</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Everybody please take note that <i>this</i> is what we call a debate! Obviously, much has changed and been (dis-)agreed upon during the debate and the only reasonable outcome is no-action since we are not at all clear on what to do. I would make one comment however: I <i>will not</i> count 'votes' such as Klonimus's which explicitly says he has no feeling at all on the article and is merely (and literally) <i>voting</i> to force things in one direction. That seems inappropriate and very unnecessary to me. Admins can judge for themselves whether there is consensus or not: we do not need spurious 'votes' such as that to help us out. Also note that a poll on extending the debate has no useful precedent and is largely unnecessary anyway since the backlog in closing AfDs is usually at least several days beyond the 5 stipulated and much of this discussion doesn't really deal with deletion-or-not and could be carried to the Talk: page of the article. (I'm going to remove the headers here since they upset a bot that counts the open afds.)-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:30, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comments</b>: I would have preferred to discuss this article on its talk page first. However, I can't find much to recommend the article. For example:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>It has the same problems that I alluded to in my dispute statement in the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_indeterminacy.html" title="Quantum indeterminacy">quantum indeterminacy</a> article, particularly since all the quotes from that article were literally plunked into this one.</li>
<li>Though thinking about logic, process calculi, quantum mechanics and everything else is an exciting activity (it is useful to brainstorm) I can't figure out the unifying theme, if any of this article.</li>
<li>I think the article contains statements which are...bizarre: Consider the following statement</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Quantum indeterminacy carries over into the Actor model because of its use of arbitration for determining which message is next in the arrival ordering of an Actor that is sent multiple messages concurrently (e.g. by using arbiters in the implementation of Actor systems).</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As best I can determine this is wrong.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Having said that, I think Hewitt should have first the benefit of presenting a defense of the article; the article needs change no matter what happens. <s>I will <b>abstain</b> (for now; my mind is changeable if I see reasons to do otherwise) and <b>propose in any case an RfC</b></s> See below.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 02:32, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. I will only add that I cannot see where <i>any</i> of the cited literature deals with the putative subject of this article (namely a connection between quantum mechanics and the actor model arbitration scheme). Instead they deal with either QM or the actor model. That leaves the connection between them <i>undocumented</i> in the literature, and therefore a violation of NOR. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 03:37, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree with everything CSTAR says.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You might try reading <a href="http://research.sun.com/async/Publications/KPDisclosed/SciAm/SciAm.pdf" class="external text" title="http://research.sun.com/async/Publications/KPDisclosed/SciAm/SciAm.pdf" rel="nofollow">Computers without Clocks by Ivan Sutherland and Jo Ebergen</a> to gain some intuition. Then ask the following question: <i>In terms of quantum physics, how does an arbiter work?</i> BTW, there is a huge literature on arbiters and the quantum physics of integrated circuits.
<dl>
<dd>The connection between the Actor model and quantum physics has been published many times, <i>e.g.</i>, there is discussion in the following proceedings of a refereed conference:
<ul>
<li>Carl Hewitt and Gul Agha. <i>Guarded Horn clause languages: are they deductive and Logical?</i> International Conference on Fifth Generation Computer Systems, Ohmsha 1988. Tokyo.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>There are references to the phenomenon in papers published in refereed journals as well.</dd>
<dd>Regards,--Carl Hewitt 04:39, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I apologize for the extreme brevity of the above comments. Because I am away to a conference, I cannot respond fully. The questions, suggestions, and comments here are greatly appreciated and are deserving of a full response.--Carl Hewitt 07:21, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Further Comment</b>. Though this is not a judicial process, I ask Carl to rely on a more "progressive" dialogue strategy. Please try not to respond to questions with questions (it sounds Socratic, but in fact is a very "regressive" strategy--it does not advance the dialogue). To answer the questions implicit in this page, could you please say: "Such and such published papers discusses the relation between actors and quantum mechanics in the following way". Moreover, your rhetorical response
<dl>
<dd><i>Try reading ... Then ask the following question: "in terms of quantum mechanics, how does an arbiter work"?</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>is not helpful, to me at least. I don't know how arbiters work in terms of quantum mechanics; am I supposed to figure this out? Please tell me. But the article in dispute sure does no such thing (nor does another article in which I disputed another quantum claim of yours. I can't remember it now). Instead the article in dispute provides quotes from Einstein, Thomas Kuhn, Hawking, Penrose. Also why do you insist on bringing Chris Fuchs into this?--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 05:24, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I don't see any connection based on the Sutherland and Ebergen article. Their methods of handling asynchony and arbitration are based on deterministic circuits, while QM is nondeterministic. The conference proceeding that you reference I would need to look up, but as you are a co-author it fails to overcome the concerns of NOR and self-promotion. Beyond that, saying "<i>There are references ...</i>" is most unimpressive. Please list them (preferably in <a href="../../../a/c/t/Talk%7EActor_model%2C_mathematical_logic%2C_and_quantum_physics_a608.html" title="Talk:Actor model, mathematical logic, and quantum physics">the talk page for the article</a>) as CSTAR has requested. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 05:36, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, or possibly transwiki to WikiBooks if the author is interested.

I'd consider it to be a misunderstanding of Wikipedia's policies and if Carl Hewitt is interested, this may become a WikiBook on his take of the actor model. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 07:04, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Reads like an odd mix of computer science and QM. Replicates a pile of stuff that the same author put into Quantum uncertaintly. Looks more like OR than a proper article. Also: CH says "The connection between the Actor model and quantum physics has been published many times, e.g., there is discussion in the following proceedings of a refereed conference: Carl Hewitt and Gul Agha. <i>Guarded Horn clause languages: are they deductive and Logical?</i>". Which makes me think (a) if this is even vaguely mainstream, he should be able to cite someone other than himself; and (b) something more recent than 1988; and (c) a proper paper not just a discussion from a conference proceeding. Nonetheless, as per C*, if CH can come up with some defence, I'll reconsider. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 08:13, 19 October 2005 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Agree with CSTAR, except that I note that (at least I) have already had a long-running debate with Hewitt on these topics; see talk page on <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metastability_in_electronics.html" title="Metastability in electronics">Metastability in electronics</a>, now moved to <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbiter_%28electronics%29.html" title="Arbiter (electronics)">Arbiter (electronics)</a>. My frustration with Hewitt is that he makes assertions and then persistently dodges questions and criticisms. This could be an interesting topic if Hewitt took the subject matter seriously, and actually gave it the attention he claims it deserves. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 13:12, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Move</b> (without redirect) to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_case_for_quantum_mechanics_being_incomplete.html" title="The case for quantum mechanics being incomplete">The case for quantum mechanics being incomplete</a> and bring article into line with core WP standards.</s> What I see here is a consensus for delete, and i don't think it is a sound consensus. I'm afraid I will be away from WP until Monday, if by chance the AfD has not been closed by then I may amend this vote. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 11:51, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you look at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_case_for_quantum_mechanics_being_incomplete.html" title="The case for quantum mechanics being incomplete">The case for quantum mechanics being incomplete</a>, you will find that the text relevant to that subject is now there. The result is a highly POV article, but there is no reason why it cannot be toned down. I advise working with Carl to get it properly link in the the relevant QM articles as well as trying to at least partially resolve the POV issue.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: the article should be moved to a more appropriate name, but it is not now clear where the best home for the article is. One point in particular: is it best to treat the relationship of the actor model to logic and physics separately, when there is a tradition of considering the relationship of computation, logic and physics to each other that dates back to Turing, and passes through such distinguished thinkers as Robin Gandy, Dana Scott and Robin Milner? I'm inclined to think that the contributions of the actor model to this discussion are best placed within a section of a broader article. Until it is clear what the right fate for this material should be, I regard a delete outcome as premature. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:56, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A broader article would certainly be welcome as well. However, I am aware of no <i>technical</i> published work on the relationship of computation to physics by <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1995/msg00170.html" class="external text" title="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1995/msg00170.html" rel="nofollow">Robin Gandy</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dana_Scott_909b.html" title="Dana Scott">Dana Scott</a>, or <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Milner_ba7f.html" title="Robin Milner">Robin Milner</a>. Also when I spoke at length with Milner last summer he did not know of any published work on the relationship of process caluli to physics in contrast to biology where there are extensive connections.--Carl Hewitt 18:33, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Gandy article I had in mind was his 1980 ‘Church’s Thesis and Principles of Mechanisms’, in Barwise J., Keisler J.J. and Kunen K., eds., The Kleene Symposium, Amsterdam: North-Holland, pp. 123–145. It's on the limits of computation and the possibility of hypercomputation and has inspired a significant literature. Scott&amp;Milner's work developing the classical automata-theoretic idea of transducer is what I had in mind: offhand I can't name references, but it is what leads into the work of Abramsky that CSTAR mentioned elsewhere. This work, while it takes physics seriously, is definitely computer science, but the IJMPC article I cited elsewhere is physics&amp;agents. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:59, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What remains documents no connection to physics now, and indeed seems to lack a thesis at all. So I retain my vote to outright delete this article. Perhaps you can move the text into a core actor model article and have it be useful there, but overall I stand behind my admonition that you stop trying to impose the actor model on theoretical physics. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 13:21, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have clarified the article to make more clear the relationship to physics. More clarification is welcome.</dd>
<dd>There is a great more published material on this subject that needs to be reported in the Wikipedia. Therefore the article should stand by itself since there will not be room to fold it into another article.</dd>
<dd>Note that as I have said before: <b>There is no attempt in this article (or others) to impose the Actor model on theoretical physics.</b> Instead it seems that you cannot accept that the Actor model is <b>dependent</b> on physics.</dd>
<dd>Regards,--Carl Hewitt 15:10, 21 October 2005(UTC)

<dd>
<ol>
<li>IMO, you have failed to document an actual dependency. Certainly the actor model can deal with pheonomena caused by quantum and relativistic effects, but to say that it is "dependent" on those effects is not appropriate.</li>
<li>Even if said dependency exists, that would not justify the tight concpetual connections that you keep attempting to forge. You may as well say that walking is a major branch of physics since walking depends on physics.</li>
<li>You have (most importantly) utterly failed to establish that these connections to theoretical physics are accepted as an inate attribute of the actor model in the field of computer science.</li>

<dd>In general, you are showing why it is a bad idea for a researcher to create articles on their own work here. IMO, a subject such as this becomes appropriate to Wikipedia when <i>someone else</i> independently decides that the subject is worthy of an article. That is the standard that I have chosen for the placement of my research into this venue. I strongly advise that you adopt the same standard. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 17:04, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Due to my conversation with Montalvo below, I can now very succinctly state why I say that you are imposing the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">actor model</a> on theoretical physics: Even if this purported connection was known in computer science, it still is <i>not</i> known in any branch of theoretical physics. You are trying to use Wikipedia to announce these supposed connections to the physics community. However, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a billboard, and in the context of theoretical physics this connection is very much <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>.

In the former realm, it is permissible (or at least worth the benefit of the doubt), but in the latter it is original research. For an article like this to be acceptable, it must be acceptable in all of its realms. For this article, that is not the case.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. A <i>theory</i> of walking certainly depends on physics. In fact the physics is quite intricate.

<dd>First of all, you have missed my point, which is that the linkage (if present) is having its significance totally overblown. I can accept the claim itself too, but as a claim and not as an established fact or speculation worthy of an independent article. Beyond that, I 100% agree with you about the intent of this VfD. If you can show that I am mistaken on my point #3 above, I will change my vote, and encourage others to do the same. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 21:02, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems to be that this AfD is an ambush because there was no talk page before it got brought up for deletion. This does not seem to be the way Wikipedia is supposed to work. Most of this discussion should be moved to a talk page and the disputes resolved there. That said, here is why I think it should not be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The relation between the actor model (AM), mathematical logic (ML), and physics has not been stated clearly in the article. That does not mean that it doesn't exist, or that it's original work. Carl's ideas have been out there in the literature for decades. He's taught this idea for decades, so the idea is out there. He and other editors should be given time to state the connection more clearly before it gets nominated for deletion. Doing it without a talk discussion is unfair.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Here is how I understand the connection: the semantics of computation traditionally has rested on ML, but because of indeterminancy in arrival order of messages in concurrency it cannot rest on ML. It has to rest on physics. A semantics based on physics is crucial and fundamental to the AM.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The goal post keeps getting moved in this deletion discussion. First it was claimed that the idea was original. When Carl gave references, it was claimed that these were not refereed journals. I can plainly see that some of the references are in refereed journals. Then it was claimed that AM does not contain a physics result. When Carl said he's not claiming it does, that what he is claiming is that the model crucially depends on physics, it was claimed that no one in computer science (CS) accepts it, with no substatiation. If there is a controversy in CS, someone should come up with a story in the talk section with references and contribute the alternate point of view to the article. All the claims against the AM not being related to physics are orignial claims. The deleters should be held to the same standard of substatiation and non-originality that Carl is being held to.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And finally, no one holds other articles to the same standard of acceptance by the scientific community that this one is being held to. The result may be obscure and may have been ingnored by most of CS, but that doesn't make it original because the idea has been out there for decades. It doesn't make it non-notable just because people haven't taken enough note yet or haven't understood it's significance yet. Some people in CS have taken note, and making technical things understandable to more people is the job of the WP.</li>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Now if this was just an "ancillary article" associated with the actor model, I'm not sure that the AfD would have been initiated. However, Carl has been very persistent in assuming the because things like <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity.html" title="Relativity">relativity</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> are (in his estimation) relevant to the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">actor model</a>, that the actor model in turn is relevant to relativity and quantum mechanics. In reality, nothing could be farther from the truth. In these fields, the actor model is completely unknown, and the purported connection is totally OR.</dd>
<dd>More to the point, Carl brought over here a bunch of text that was inappropriate to <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_indeterminacy.html" title="Quantum indeterminacy">quantum indeterminacy</a>, turning this article into a medium for maintaining a strong connection between the QM articles and the actor model articles. It was so out of line that myself and another editor felt obliged to initiate this AfD. The offending text is now off elsewhere (in a wholely QM context) where hopefully it can become the basis for an encyclopedic article. (That text describes the case for QM being incomplete and has some value in or as an article on that topic.)</dd>
<dd>What now remains is a category link to <a href="../../../q/u/a/Category%7EQuantum_information_science_c7c4.html" title="Category:Quantum information science">category:quantum information science</a>, which as best I can tell is a restatement of the same OR connection to QM. Given that this title calls for that link, I say that the article should just be deleted, and this inappropriate connection severed.

<dd>In the meantime, given that it is germane to the actor model, Carl is free to mention the logical connection between the actor model and physical theory in the actor model article. However, if he wants to reference any physical theories, then he should do so <b>only through links in the actor model article</b>.</dd>
<dd>To summarize: <i>In the context of physics, the actor model is unknown</i>, and the mention of the actor model in any physics article or category is therefore a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/NOR_11d4.html" title="NOR">NOR</a> no matter how many respected and/or peer-reviewed CS journal articles that connection may have been mentioned in. Carl has by his actions turned this into a de-facto physics article, and so rendered it OR. I will therefore be happy to see it go.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am mostly in agreement with Charles Stewart. The people arguing for deletion have valid concerns, which I share. Indeed, while it may well be true that the actor model is inspired by a (possibly misguided understanding of) relativity and quantum theory, I haven't seen any evidence that it uses these physical theories, and it certainly is not an interdisciplinary subject stradling computer science and physics. However, it is not yet obvious to me that the only way to resolve these concerns is to take the radical step of deleting the article instead of a discussion. In fact, I think the article has improved in that the questionable statement have been removed. Finally, I wish to note that I know some of the history of the conflict with Carl Hewitt, for instance the category on relativistic information science, that Carl is difficult to deal with in the context of Wikipedia, and that CSTAR, Linas, EMS, and others have reacted with a lot of patience. I hope that Carl also realizes this and that he will be cautious if he wants to continue contributing about his own work. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 13:11, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I would like to remind all that I nominated this for violating the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">NOR</a> policy; to defend his position all he would have to do is append references linking the actor model to Q.T. from some other reputable source. As was said above: he should be able to cite someone other than himself. And he should know the rules of Wikipedia well enough by now to have done that in the first place. He has pushed this topic in other articles, if the lack of proper citations here was an oversight, he could dip into one of those for a link or a journal reference, but of course there none there either. <a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDV8_2XL_8587.html" title="User:DV8 2XL">DV8 2XL</a> 23:25, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a good deal of reason to be unhappy with CH's behaviour as an editor, and I think the voting pattern on this page reflects exhausted patience. However, I'm not at all happy with the way things have been argued on this page. For NOR to be a reason for deletion, it is not enough to establish that the contents of the article qualify as original research (which has not conclusively been established), but one should also show that the topic does not support a good WP article. To paraphrase what CSTAR said, the intersection between computation, logic and physics is a fascinating one, and even if no case can be made that the actor model gives an interesting perspective of quantum physics, there may still be a worthy article here. Without intending to make personal criticism, I don't think this AfD was well put together (ie. the AfD was assembled without so much as a question being asked on either CH's talk page or that of the article's): giving CH a bit more time to put his case together (and allowing him access to his literature, etc.) can be seen as some sort of remedy for the AfD's defect. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 00:06, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Same text, but I take the application of NOR to AfD to mean that one should repair the article if possible, and delete it only if that cannot be done. Otherwise one has the absurd stipulation that if one adds a paragraph introducing a neologism (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents</a>) to a perfectly good article, then one ought to delete the whole article. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 02:19, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Then you need to show that this is (or can be) a reasonable article.</dd>
<dd>For example: I have created a modification to <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> (GR) which I refer to by the acronym FBGR, which is unpublished except in the proceedings of an unrefereed conference, and is in any case mostly unknown amongst physicists.
<ul>
<li>Case 1: If I create a article on FBGR, it would be totally <a href="../../../n/o/r/NOR_11d4.html" title="NOR">NOR</a>, and would be deleted.</li>
<li>Case 2: If I add a section on FBGR to the GR article, then what is OR is only that section, and the article can be repaired by reverting out my work.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I submit to you the proposition that the connection between QM and the actor model <i>as claimed in the title of this article</i> is wholely undocumented except in the writings of Carl Hewitt. That make the analogous situation re my OR like Case 1 instead of Case 2. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 02:43, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>P.S. Do note the following:
<ol>
<li>I have told Carl that I would not mind seeing the part about the incompleteness of QM expoted to an article called something like "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_case_for_quantum_mechanics_being_incomplete.html" title="The case for quantum mechanics being incomplete">The case for quantum mechanics being incomplete</a>". What he has is a start for the article, and in the context of its title the POV is almost bearable.</li>
<li>Carl made a great effort to attached the Actor model to general relativity a month or two ago, which I was a part of beating back. He has no sense that "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a propaganda machine". I see this as part of his propaganda, which is how is ends up being NOR. (OTOH as best I can tell the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">actor model</a> article is legitimate and benefits from Carl's expertise in the model itself. It is these odd connections to areas that Carl obviously is not very experienced in that are the problem.)</li>

<dd>It's not my aim to defend the article, and I am aware of CH's inappropriate pushing of the actor model. I doubt that CH can furnish references establishing the connection you describe, since otherwise why would these references not have been seen in CH's other edits trying to make the connection? Rather, I think that a piece of courtesy that I think is normally due, namely to discuss the proposed deletion beforehand, was not made, and given CH does not have his usual access to his resources, I think we should give CH extra time to prepare his defence. I don't see what benefit accrues to making the defence a rush job. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 03:54, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<p><big><b>A possible solution</b></big><br />
Again I apologize for now being able to participate more fully. I had to stay up til 4:30AM yesterday to finish a conference paper which was due. Today I spent 7 hours driving. But I do want Wikipedia processes to work, so I stayed up late tonight even though the conference starts early tomorrow constructing a possible solution which is explained at <a href="../../../a/c/t/Talk%7EActor_model%2C_mathematical_logic%2C_and_quantum_physics_a608.html" title="Talk:Actor model, mathematical logic, and quantum physics">Talk:Actor model, mathematical logic, and quantum physics</a>.</p>
<p>I like the idea above of removing the Actor connection from <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model%2C_mathematical_logic%2C_and_quantum_physics.html#Actor_model_and_quantum_physics" title="Actor model, mathematical logic, and quantum physics">Actor model, mathematical_logic, and quantum physics#Actor model and quantum physics</a> and starting a new article "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_case_for_quantum_mechanics_being_incomplete.html" title="The case for quantum mechanics being incomplete">The case for quantum mechanics being incomplete</a>" however it would be appropriate to balance the views already present with some other views on the subject. Since I do not have expertise in these other views, hopefully soneone else would supply them.</p>
<p>Eventually I will dig up the citaton for the indeterminacy of Arbiters being based on the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics, but for obvious reasons I can't do it now. I have some other pressing things on my plate so hopefully this possible solution can help calm things down in the meantine.</p>
<p>Please see what you think. Thanks--Carl Hewitt 10:57, 20 October 2005 (UTC)io</p>
<p>Also please note that the citation that I most need to dig up is not just a citation to my own work. The citation nneded is the underlying citaton to a published paper that established the connection between the quantum structure of integraged circuits and the indeterminacy of Arbiters.--Carl Hewitt 15:43, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please note that I cited an article in this discussion <a href="../../../q/u/a/Talk%7EQuantum_indeterminacy_in_computation_505a.html#Disputed_statement" title="Talk:Quantum indeterminacy in computation">Talk:Quantum_indeterminacy_in_computation#Disputed statement</a> which cast some doubt on your claims. That was on October 4. I have yet to see you cite any source anywhere on WIkipedia in support of any claim you made in that article on "<i>the indeterminacy of Arbiters being based on the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics</i>". None of the articles or books in the references section of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_indeterminacy_in_computation.html" title="Quantum indeterminacy in computation">Quantum_indeterminacy_in_computation</a> come even remotely close to dealing with these issues.

It may be a useful book, but this is a book on QM for general audiences. The Fuchs reference is an article basically on foundations.</li>

The article has now been reorganized as per suggestions of the Wikipedia editors above. Note that it no longer mentions "quantum."</p>

<dl>
<dd>I have a better idea: If this article is kept then call it Actor model and mathematical logic. Just plain leave physics out of the title. If there are ways that the actor model and related paradigms are analogous to physical theory, then you may describe them, given that they are documented in the area of computer science. However, <b>you cannot treat the actor model as being a part of physics</b> due to this association. I repeat what I wrote above: The actor model is unknown to phsysicists and Wikipedia is not the place to introduce it to the physiscists. Any attempt to do so goes against NOR. However, if indeed the connection is now known to computer science through your efforts then in that context it is encyclopedic.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps the case for not mentioning physics in this title is best made in the name of Newton's book introducing classical mechanics to the world: "<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophiae_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica_06d6.html" title="Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</a>" (latin which in english means "mathematical principles of natural philosophy"). So both physics and the actor model are examples of mathematical modelling anyway, and the purposrted connection can be described or not (and currently I notice that it is not described in the article) as is appropriate.</dd>
<dd>I won't rescind my delete vote. I for one want to see this title gone, and not even be a redirect.

<p><big><b>Physics or not?</b></big><br />
The dependence of the Actor model on physics is accepted in Computer Science, <i>e.g.,</i> see "The Challenge of Open Systems" in a standard reference <i>The foundation of artificial intelligence---a sourcebook</i> Cambridge University Press, 1990 and other references in the artice. <b>The published work reported in this article crucially depends on physics.</b></p>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is irrelevant to me. Look at it this way: You may know of President Bush, but that does not mean that President Bush knows of you. That the actor model knows of or utilizes physics does not mean that the actor model is known to physics.</dd>
<dd>I realize that it may seen wierd that something can be established in one venue and be OR in another. Perhaps this is a sign of how specialized the fields have become, but my own read is that the CS field has permitted itself to accept your claim without first demainding that it be validated in a physics context. However, done is done. I will respect the CS reality re the actor model is you will accept the physics reality for the same.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>FYI - I do not see a true physics connection however. In the contested article, it is stated that
<dl>
<dd><i>Instead of observing the internals of arbitration processes of Actor computations, we await outcomes.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So the physics of arbiters is not the issue, but instead the unpredictablitity of their results. If you are not concerned about the "internals" (and I don't see why you should be), then you are not concerned about the physics. This is not to say that you should not be curious about it, but rather that that physics is not fundamental to the actor model. Instead the resultant indeterminism of the outputs is. I encourage you to think about this. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 15:25, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. However, the actor model IMO is concerned with the outcome being indeterminate and not the physical cause itself. If you are challenged about the need to handle indeterminate outcomes, then you can cite QM, GR, and even <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_theory.html" title="Chaos theory">chaos theory</a>. I wish that I could get it through your thick skull that indeterminism forms the "junction" between physics and the actor model. Both exist at that junction, but only one or the other can exist away from that junction. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 02:55, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd say that referees for computer science journals cannot be expected to validate claims made about physics, nor would I expect referees for physics journals to necessarily do a good job validating claims made about computer science. It's a question of the editors ability to select the right referees for the claims made in the paper, and these doubts go double if the claims are not featured in the abstract, but appear as remarks in the course of the main claims made in the paper (I'm not saying this is what happened with CH's paper, just noting a problem with WP's black-or-white policy that claims made in peer reviewed journals are accepted as sufficiently backed up). There are journals that somewhat straddle the divide between computer science and physics, eg. World Scientific's <a href="http://journals.wspc.com.sg/ijmpc/mkt/aims_scope.shtml" class="external text" title="http://journals.wspc.com.sg/ijmpc/mkt/aims_scope.shtml" rel="nofollow">International Journal of Modern Physics C</a> published <a href="http://journals.wspc.com.sg/ijmpc/16/1601/S012918310500698X.html" class="external text" title="http://journals.wspc.com.sg/ijmpc/16/1601/S012918310500698X.html" rel="nofollow">this article about the simulation of physics by agents</a>; see also <a href="http://gort.ucsd.edu/newjour/i/msg02590.html" class="external text" title="http://gort.ucsd.edu/newjour/i/msg02590.html" rel="nofollow">their announcement message</a>. But it's a thin crowd. I don't know what to recommend as a general line here, only to suggest that CH's case would be helped if he were to publish in a journal with credentials in physics, and that otherwise we are voyaging in not very well mapped territory. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:44, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It will be interesting to see what other physicists, <i>e.g.,</i> Chris Fuchs, make of all this.

</dl>
<p>I disagree. Which scientific community accepts a result is irrelevant to whether it's original or not. Carl is not claiming a physics result? Note something being a <b>result in physics</b> is not the same as having a <b>relationship to physics</b>. <b>Depending on physics</b> does not put it into <b>the physics realm</b>. Physicists are free to read the CS literature. They just haven't. Encyclopedias, like this one, can aid this process.</p>
<p>Here is the argument in a nutshell. This result is crucially dependent on physics. It's significant in the CS community that it <i>does</i> depend on physics and not logic. It should be indexed in <i>physics</i> terms in the WP so physicists can find it. That's what encyclopedias do. They make results accessible across disciplinary boundaries.</p>
<p>I notice a whole lot of other categories listed under other categories when they're not inside them, such as <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscience_c4dd.html" title="Category:Pseudoscience">category:pseudoscience</a> as a subcategory of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Category%7EScience_11a2.html" title="Category:Science">category:science</a>.</p>

More recently, he took over the article on <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_indeterminacy.html" title="Quantum indeterminacy">quantum indeterminacy</a> and when his higly POV <i>physics</i> text got removed from there it ended up here!

<dd><i><b>Depending on physics</b> does not put [the actor model] into <b>the physics realm</b></i>.</dd>

<dd>To achieve that placement, explicit action is needed, and Carl has been all too happy to do so. My point is that not only does a dependency on physics not place something into the physics realm, <i>but it does not justify such a placement either</i>. I repeat: <b>The actor model is not known to physics.</b> That is why it should not even be indexed there. Because it is unknown to physics, such a placement is novel to the physics realm, and therefore is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.</dd>

<dd>To amplify what EMS said, no one is saying that it has been established that physicists cannot have anything to learn from the actor model, rather that the task of showing that the actor model is interesting to physicists is something that Wikipedia's core rules say explicitly that it is not to be used for, ie. that this what WP calls original research.

<dd>Every time someone want to put their own (usually original) research where it does not belong, I see a grand redefinition of Wikipedia to suit themself. Carl's redefining categorization is no different. Categorization is a means of grouping related articles, so that people can explore a field with ease. It is not meant for trivially related or unrelated topics to use as a means of advertising. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:02, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The primary reason for my dissatisfaction is that an RfC would have been better suited to make specific proposals and suggestions to Hewitt on how to make this article and other articles better. Unless you are planning on banning Hewitt --bad idea, we are going to have to do this eventually. With an RfC Hewitt would be encouraged to be more willing to follow certain guidelines of cooperation. For example, one particularly infuriating characteristic about Hewitt's style is that he makes dozens of edits each one of which is miniscule -- it makes it very hard for other editors to see what he's done or where he's taking the article (I don't care about the strain on servers -- that at least gives Jimbo Wales something to do getting more resources).

Maybe the RfC/RfA route is what is needed, and should be tried next time. As much as I hate to say it, I know that there will be a next time.

<dl>
<dd>Carl, I think the basic issue with many of your Wikipedia articles is their lack of <i>intellectual maturity</i>. You have had a long career in a certain area of <i>computer science</i>, but it seems you want to branch out into <i>physics</i> in your retirement. Nothing wrong with that in principle, and your recent activity could be valuable as long as you are very careful to honestly and fairly judge the intellectual maturity of your speculations, and are thoughtful in which venues you chose to explain your ideas. Taking the time to try to familiarize yourself with the physics literature would also be wise. I think you also need to be more sensitive to possible "cultural differences" between theoretical physics and computer science regarding judgements of maturity. Remember that theoretical physics is a subject with a long and distinguished pedigree, while computer science is still comparatively young but appears to have developed significantly different time scales/criteria for publication.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I feel that your physics-related ideas are currently at a stage which are just barely sufficiently mature to <i>perhaps</i> be worth sharing in some form with others. They might merit discussion in <i>speculative essays posted at your own website</i> (perhaps you can set up also set up a blog there to make it easier for interested readers to comment). Wikipedia science articles should however focus on explaining well-established topics in science, such as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_dilation.html" title="Time dilation">time dilation</a>, or much discussed speculations such as the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_censorship_hypothesis.html" title="Cosmic censorship hypothesis">cosmic censorship hypothesis</a>. In all cases, articles should fairly and accurately describe the current status of the ideas under discussion. Sometimes this will be difficult or contentious (e.g. <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a> evokes passionate debate), but in these cases the article can explain fairly and accurately the nature of an contemporary controversy within scientific circles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>More generally, I don't deny, of course, that speculations regarding connections between mathematical logic and fundamental physics have been much discussed for many decades in the physics literature and elsewhere. But what strikes me is the enormous breadth and variety of the ideas which are "out there"; it would be very difficult to find anyone who is sufficiently expert to provide a comprehensive review of this material, much less judge the relative merits of various speculations. So anyone attempting to discuss such issues should approach the task with humility and good judgement, and in particular, should avoid making strong claims unless one is really aware of (and ideally familiar with) all the relevant literature.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In this article, to judge from the title, you are nominally attempting to address a relatively tiny portion of this enormous literature. Your qualifications to discuss <i>computer science aspects</i> of your own actor model are not in dispute, but the rest of us might well wonder whether you are capable of doing so in an unbiased manner. This is particularly true because those of us with more physics/math backgrounds seem to agree that you don't seem to know very much about the relevant physics or math literature. I think the fact that so many users have been warning you that there is much you don't appear to know should induce you to pull back and move these speculations to your own website, where you should probably label them as preliminary. In any event, I urge you to voluntarily stop trying to use Wikipedia as some kind of venue for promoting highly speculative personal views, especially since some many here feel you that while you may know a great deal about some aspects of computer science, you don't yet know enough about physics to write usefully on such a vastly complex and subtle subject.</dd>

<dd>I have a suggestion about that (I note again that my initials happen to be the same as Carl Hewitt's, so newcomers shouldn't confuse us). I propose an RFC on Carl as an example of how one user (who is surely sufficiently saavy to know what he is doing) is devoting great ingenuity and persistence to using Wikipedia in order to promote his own highly personal and speculative views, which most of us seem to agree do not appear to yet be sufficiently mature to warrant the amount of attention which he obviously thinks they deserve in this encyclopedia. Quite a few users with considerable expertise whose talents and knowledge should be devoted to higher callings, like writing new material on established technical topics of which they have expert knowledge, have (in my view) <i>wasted</i> quite a bit of time in discussions like this one. I think a fair summary of these discussions is that we have encouraged Carl to try to develop his ideas further, but we've also repeatedly asked him to voluntarily confine his proseletyzing for his speculations to a more appropriate venue, such as his own website or blog. This makes him, in my view---and I think of others here--- something of a problem user.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 00:01, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is a lot of ill-feeling going around CH's edits, and an RfC can hope to (i) clarify what other editors are upset about in CH's editing, and (ii) put together some rules of engagement that should avoid these conflicts. The RfC then is about avoiding similar conflicts in the future. Simply listing the pages where CH's edits have not observed core WP rules would be a good start, the RfC can then establish details by examining the most significant of these. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:21, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><big><b>What should be the title of the article?</b></big><br /></p>
<p>The question has arisen as to what the title of this article should be. The subject matter of the article is a particular relationship between the Actor model, mathematical logic, and physics: <i>Indeterminacy in the physics of arbiters produces indeterminacy in Actor model computations such that they cannot be implemented using mathematical logic.</i> Thanks,--Carl Hewitt 22:36, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you are wasting a lot of people's time with endless discussions like this one. You are an academic with an established reputation (in CS) and with institutional backing, so I feel that you should recognize that you have both the oportunity and the responsibility to polish your interdisciplinary ideas to the point where you can begin to publish some of your speculations in reputable non-CS journals. For example, by showing that you can use ideas from the actor model to solve some open problem which has been discussed in the physcis literature. This alone would not, in my view, immediately promote your ideas to the status of deserving encyclopedia articles here, since solving open problems is the bread and butter of ordinary science, but it would at least put them in the marketplace of ideas. Instead, I feel you are trying to circumvent peer review by posting articles here which describe your ideas as if they have already led to an established interdisciplinary field, which as far as I can see is absolutely <i>not</i> the case. This demeans the efforts of users like EMS, who do not have the institutional backing which you enjoy, but who are attempting to pursue the traditional path of peer reviewed publication. This process can be time consuming and frustrating, but I think is still, in the long run, the best path for science and indeed for your own intellectual legacy.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I am also disturbed by what I see as your marked tendency to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html#Gaming_the_system" title="WP:POINT">game the system</a> here in order to "justify" persistent abuse of the Wikipedia. If you devoted the same degree of persistence and ingenuity to working out your ideas properly, you might actually contribute something of interdisciplinary value, but if you persist in proseletyzing immature ideas here, you will only alienate individuals who might otherwise assist you in developing your ideas in directions which might one day turn out to be useful.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 00:19, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize, my previous remark was too sarcastic. As I see it, it's Hewitt alone against everybody else in this AfD (including me, although I have tried at times to mediate). That's a difficult situation in which to expect anybody to maintain a level of clear-headedness. Perhaps Hewitt should get advocate? I know I'm going to get plastered for making that suggestion "that's the last thing we need".

<dd>If <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> wrote that opinion in the article space, it would be original research.

<dd>Once again <i><b>and from the article itself</b></i>:
<dl>
<dd><i>In concrete terms for Actor systems, typically we cannot observe the details by which the arrival order of messages for an Actor is determined. ... Instead of observing the internals of arbitration processes of Actor computations, we await outcomes.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If you are not concerned about the "internals", then you are not concerned about the physics! So I once again suggest Actor model and mathematical logic for a title, assuming that there is any good reason not to fold this material back into the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">actor model</a> article itself at this point. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:03, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Actually the article states:</b>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Actor model makes use of arbitration for determining which message is next in the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_theory.html#Arrival_orderings" title="Actor model theory">arrival ordering</a> of an Actor that is sent multiple messages concurrently. For example <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbiter_%28electronics%29.html" title="Arbiter (electronics)">Arbiters</a> can be used in the implementation of the arrival ordering of an Actor which can give rise to <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbiter_%28electronics%29.html#Arbiters_give_rise_to_indeterminacy" title="Arbiter (electronics)">physical indeterminacy</a> in the arrival order. Therefore mathematical logic can not implement concurrent computation in open systems because of the impossibility of deducing arrival orderings since they are indeterminate. Note that although mathematical logic cannot implement general concurrency it can implement some special cases of current computation,</i> e.g., <i>sequential computation and some kinds of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_programming.html" title="Parallel programming">parallel</a> computation including the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambda_calculus.html" title="Lambda calculus">lambda calculus</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In concrete terms for Actor systems, typically we cannot observe the details by which the arrival order of messages for an Actor is determined. Attempting to do so affects the results and can even push the indeterminacy elsewhere. e.g., see <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metastability_in_electronics.html" title="Metastability in electronics">metastability in electronics</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbiter_%28electronics%29.html" title="Arbiter (electronics)">arbiters</a>. Instead of observing the internals of arbitration processes of Actor computations, we await outcomes. Physical indeterminacy in arbiters produces indeterminacy in Actors. The reason that we await outcomes is that we have no alternative because of indeterminacy.</i></dd>

<dd>&#160;??? So what? IMO, what I quoted is the operative parts of the above. I agree that
<dl>
<dd><i>[p]hysical indeterminacy in arbiters produces indeterminacy in Actors</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>but since the actor model is not concerned with the internals, this is just an incidental point. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:25, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
