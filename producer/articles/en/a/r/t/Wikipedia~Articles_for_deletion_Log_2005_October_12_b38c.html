<li><b>Keep</b> as the afro brazilian people are so great in number of citzens and have a culture that difer from the spanish speaking countries of latin america. I think afro brazilians should have they own article and not make just a part of the afro latin america article. Of course the african brazilians make part of afro latin americans, and should make part of that article, but just a stub , and let a more complex text on his own article. I dont think is a good idea to delete the african brazlian article. and i think the article will be very improved and expanded. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMateuszica_25ba.html" title="User:Mateuszica">user:mateuszica</a> 12 October 2005</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable Brigadier General and probable vanity. Non-notable because in looking at the other Brigadier Generals that have wiki articles, they all have a major accomplishment or scandal tied to them. <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Bryant_Jr_cf85.html" title="Albert Bryant Jr">Albert Bryant Jr</a>'s involvment with the 4th ID (of which one unit actually captured Saddam Hussein) is probably the most notable thing in this article, but he was not personally involved in the capture. The rest of the article details some great accomplishments, but nothing that really stands out from the accomplishments of other military top brass... which brings me to my second point: vanity. I don't know what relation User25be is to the Bryant's but the level of biographical detail in all these articles, the pictures, and the trail of edits User25be has made (all are about Bryants or auxillary articles about awards they've acheived, etc.) lead me to believe that this is something of a vanity project for this user. User25be has a real flair for writing wiki articles; technically these articles are near perfect... my only beef is that there is too much information in some articles (for example Renee Bryant's awards listed in articles other then her own). I hope that regardless of the outcome of these AfD's User25be continues to contribute because he or she has a real knack for writing.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> for a couple of reasons. Let's dispense with the less weighty one first: I came across this article while following links from other articles being considered for deletion and I found myself actually interested. This family is obviously accomplished and by the time I got to this bio, I felt like I had learned something. That kind of gut reaction, genuine interest in the subject generated by the entry, means something. With the extended bandwith Wikipedia has to offer, as I mentioned in another post, there is room for the "B-listers" who are notable, if not as notable as those who can be included in more restricted informational resources. The second is that I legitimately feel this person is notable, but notable in sum, if not for one reason only. The accomplishments are legitimate and the career is clearly noted. The link to Saddam Hussein's capture is legitimate as he was the Assistant Division Commander of the unit. It would be different if he were a fellow soldier, but he was the second in command at the time and that is significant. Also, his wife has won the third and fourth highest awards the Secretary of the Army can award to civilians, and his son is a decorated veteran as well (this is bolstered when you look at some of the other Bryant entries...this is clearly a military "dynasty" of sorts, with EVERY SINGLE eligible member--subject, subject's father, subject's father-in-law--making it to the General Officer level, and son and wife receiving military decorations, as well as the other son working on the highest-profile Coast Guard project undertaken. I am from a military family myself and thus know that these are not things easily achieved and I have great respect for the people who have done so (my father and grandfather never got past MAJ and LTC in 20 and 25 years respectively, and they were not chopped liver.)
<ul>
<li><i>Though I do wish user25be had offered more than a cut-and-paste of BG Bryant's official bio. If he/she is as close to the subjects as he/she appears to be (which in of itself should NOT be a disqualifying factor) I think a fleshed out entry would give us a better idea of whether or not this person is as notable as he appears to be (or not to be). If he/she reads this before the 5-day period closes, I invite user25be to elaborate (and justify, to an extent) his/her inclusion of these entries. I have noted that I believe some of his/her entries are strong keeps, while others are weak keeps. I would appreciate his/her reasoning. el_amante 20:12, 12 October 2005</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but rewrite. Being in charge of the unit that captured Saddam Hussein makes him notable. But, calling him "BG Bryant" before he's actually promoted to Brigadier General is misleading, and the overall tone, to me, sounds a bit un-<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. After exhaustive websearching, all I can turn up about this show is that a total of eight, 24-minute episodes were made in 1999 by World Television for the British Channel 5. It has been repeated since on satllite &amp; cable channels but not on by the terrestrial broadcasters. I would hesitate, therefore, to say that it is 'notable'.

<li>AFAIK Animal Airport is simply a compilation of animal related parts of the BBC TV documentary series "Airport". The "Airport" series is notable, "Animal Airport" isn't a show in its own right. If there's a page for the BBC "Airport" series, redirect Animal Airport there and add comment?

<li>So have I. I've written a bunch, too -- but I don't pretend the world cares so much that they want to look me up in an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. This entry would clearly be a keep with a solid rewrite. I do not think that C.C. Rousseau can be dismissed as an average professor. In evaluating several entries, I note that Wikipedia is a perfect place for "B-List" notables (AS LONG AS THEY ARE, INDEED, NOTABLE) because it is not as constrained as traditional, limited, informational resources. Mr. Rousseau appears to be notable within his field and that would qualify him for inclusion, in my opinion. However, a rewrite, clarifying his achievements, would be needed for me to vote "keep" or "strong keep." el_amante 20:32, 12 October 2005
<ul>
<li>I don't necessarily know it is appropriate to compare Mr. Rousseau's lists of credits or publications to one's own in support of a "delete" vote. I don't know much about academia, but I do know that depending upon the field, the number of years in academia, etc. the number of such metrics can vary. Simply because someone does not appear to be as accomplished as you are is not support, in my opinion, for their deletion. el_amante 20:32, 12 October 2005</li>

<li><b>No vote</b> for the moment. I can't establish his importance, but he does seem more notable than the average maths professor.

<p>Sorry, but the lemma is plain silly.

<p>So, is your problem with the Lemma? How else would you suggst we deal with a problematic geographical name? Insofar as I am in the process of writing the article, I assure you the scholarship behind it is solid. --RLMullen</p>

<dd>I started to look because of the lemma. And I consider the "<i>in</i> the [..] gulf" inapprobiate. But the question of the lemma is tertiary.</dd>

<p>The article is about Christianity in a region, so I'd prefer not to bury it under "Assyrian Church of the East", which, as Pilatus says, is a denomination. Maybe rename it "Christianity in the Arabian/Persian Gulf Region" or "Christianity around the Arabian/Persian Gulf" RLMullen</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Google shows it to have a fair amount of currency among academicians, and it is a term I've heard before. While the article needs expansion, it is comprehensible.

<li>Oh, and "first seen around the time of the American Revolution"? I don't <i>think</i> so.

<li>N.B. I'm not basing my vote on the fact that I disagree with the article; perhaps the author meant that the American revolution was the first time that for a woman to stay at home was seen as a virtue and not just a role assigned to them by nature (though I disagree with that as much as my first reading). But it appears to be Americentrism, which is one of many possible symptoms of POV posts masquerading as encyclopaedia articles, as here. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 15:15, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Thanks for making the effort, it's certainly a significant improvement, but I'm afraid I'm still unconvinced as to the article's worth. There may be sources now, but it still looks like original research in the form of an essay - a sequence of quotes with alternating viewpoints. My vote stands, though I'll be watching for further improvements with interest. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 08:36, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what else you expect. It's not original research, as I'm not proposing anything myself. It is all taken from credible sources, and demonstrates that the term is not a neologism (original concern). <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 08:41, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I don't believe that your quotes do any such thing. Only two of them use the term 'domestic virtue' in the quote itself, and neither of them use it in the sense defined in the first paragraph. They appear to mean "a family's virtue", rather than anything specifically to do with the virtue of women staying at home. And even if they did use the article's meaning, evidence that one or two people used the term doesn't really lift the word above neologism status: we regularly delete neologisms used by one or two blog authors. I don't believe the fact that the sources are old makes the term any more noteworthy. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 12:57, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, agree not notable. Only thing that is close to notability is being a delegate to the 2004 Republican National Convention and that's not notable enough.

<li><b>Delete</b>, while I continue to caution against a bias against blogs and bloggers, I agree that this is not a blog of note. While Mr. McKissick may be notable, more information is needed (if the author reads this before the 5-day period is over, consider a rewrite with any information you feel may better support the notability of this subject). This feels too much like promotion for the blog. While I do consider a delegate to a national party convention significant, I can't justify it as notable enough as there are simply so many delegates and they are often chosen for patronage reasons, not substantive ones, so that such a selection automatically conveys notability. el_amante 21:00, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is the sense of a redirect? Did you read the title carefully? "Electrical potential of <b>the</b> reaction". I would understand the title "Electrical potential of <b>a</b> chemical reaction", but this one is just a phrase, as the author explains, red-linked in some article. We cannot have redirects from all possible <i>phrases</i> (unlike common misspellings). A proper syntax to do a link from a phrase, if you want a smooth text, would be this: <b>[[Galvanic cell#Electric potential of a Galvanic cell | electrical potential of the reaction]]</b>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 20:27, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not too keen on having a redirect either, but I think policy dictates one is needed to comply with the GFDL. I have to admit I never fully understood that argument though, but it does seem to come up fairly often. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 20:42, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the author merges his text into the main article themselves, there will be no GFDL problem. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 20:50, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Hoax</b>. The short version: he lacks an entry in the <i>Prosopography Of The Later Roman Empire</i> (PLRE), which proves almost conclusively that he does not exist. And this saying about <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavius_Aetius_7779.html" title="Flavius Aetius">Flavius Aetius</a> &amp; Emperor <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valentinian_III_52d7.html" title="Valentinian III">Valentinian III</a> the article attributes to him is more likely the utterance of <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidonius_Apollinaris_6c7b.html" title="Sidonius Apollinaris">Sidonius Apollinaris</a>.</p>
<p>The long version: the PLRE is an exhaustive list of every individual who is recorded as living in the Roman world during AD 260 - 641. There are 7 men named Florentius in this book, none of whom fits the profile in this article: they lived at the wrong time, are not known to have lost of an arm or leg, or lacked a military career. While admittedly there are omissions in this list (an obvious example would be anyone mentioned only in inscriptions found &amp; published <i>after</i> the completion of this work), the fact that that the author of such a "famous" saying would be overlooked is odd enough to merit a mention, an explanation for this oversight, &amp; a reference to the primary source to prove his existence; the original author did not provide any of these. As I noted on the Talk page, I have traced the quotation attributed to this general at least as far back as <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Gibbon_4de8.html" title="Edward Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>, who claims he found it in the writings of Sidonius Apollinaris.</p>
<p>With this extensive argument I may be breaking a butterfly on a wheel, but I wanted there to be no doubt about this issue: General Florentius only existed in some anonymous contributor's imagination. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:29, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Per category sorting and intro sentence, the article states that it is a concept in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>. My attempts to verify this failed (see above). The article further states, it is a concept in conservative propaganda. I doubt this, but I can't judge it, as this is a very broad topic. Anyway, if that would be the only meaning, the article is grossly inadequate. Now you additional state, it is a concept in Voegelin's gnosticism. Uuhh. But that certainly isn't in the article and therefore wouldn't be a reason to keep. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 20:00, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>Non-notable vanity article. The claims to notability seem to be that he has a blog and has written a book. Looking at the blog, only one user comment has ever been left (and this was deleted by the blog owner) which suggests that this is not a particularly notable blog. In terms of the book, "Historien om NRA" garners two hits on Google, neither of which actualy mention Wesslén's name. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 20:11, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as this appears to be primarily a promotion of the blog and likely qualifies as a vanity article. THIS IS NOT TO SAY that blogs and bloggers are necessarily not notable and I think we should be careful not to instinctively react to blog-related entries. As blogs and blogging grow, there will probably emerge a growing number of bloggers of genunie notability--the authors of the Daily Kos, Wonkette, etc. come to mind. I think that the issue has to do with how well-read the blog is, how independently notable the blogger is, and whether or not the blog is cited widely by other blogs or traditional media. I do not know if Wikipedia has a blog policy, but I will be sure to check right after this. el_amante 20:52, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

Please provide sources of independent verification of the events you are describing. A good idea could be to ask the KISW webmaster to post your blog story at their site.

<dd>With all due respect, Mikka, someone who was the duck would be a primary source, a fine source for material. Doing their own writing would need vanity checks but isn't original research. The article "makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims". The intent of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is to remove Wikipedia from publishing crank physics theories and not to dissuade people from writing about personal experience.</dd>

<dd>They are not abolished. They are very much around.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: When the Constitution of India was adopted on January 26, 1950, it abolished the caste system and guaranteed equality to all citizens." So, I guess they are giving the jobs to those who would have been in the lower castes. Since castes are outlawed, only tradition is keeping it intact. Wikipedia should not help in its preservation. Only historical names should be added, if it isn't deleted altogether. It's not the same as different ethnicities because ethnicities are not defined in terms of superiority, like castes are. It's having a list of people who are considered better/more clean than these other people. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:53, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<b>Comments</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I'll try to address the comments of kjkolb and Kzollman here&#160;:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To kjkolb&#160;: I doubt about the validity of your statement about the Indian constitution (Nichalp should be able to confirm it one way or the other). What the constitution says will make little difference in what people do in this aspect anyway. It is also nonsensical to outlaw caste and then allow reservation on its basis. What the constitution has outlawed is probably only discrimination based on caste.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As wikipedia editors, we should be bothered only about recording things as they stand. It is not for us either to pass judgement, or do anything either to preserve or eradicate it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Castes are a fact, whether we like it or not. In my personal experience, its influence has increased considerably in the last 15 years or so, when compared to the time when I was a schoolboy. Every political party tries to appease certain castes and draws heavily on caste based votes. A significant percentage of the parties are formed on the basis of caste alone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To Kzollman&#160;: Nairs use some distinct surnames like Nair (obviously), Menon, Pillai, Panicker etc. So if someone or any of his relatives has that surname, it can be considered a valid entry. Some of the doubtful entries were discussed in the talk page; there are 10-20 entries which I am still not sure about. The list also contains too many unimportant people who need to be removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PS&#160;: I am not a Nair, btw&#160;;-) <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> 17:49, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I understand and agree somewhat. I know that Wikipedia isn't for changing society, but I'm concerned that by continuing to recognize castes as valid, it is not being neutral, either. In its very small way, it is helping to perpetuate castes. I think the article describing the Indian caste system is sufficient and neutral. It could say that it is being followed increasingly in recent years, but a list of people in a caste seems like celebrating and taking pride in it. It would be totally different if this had to do with ethnicity, but castes make value judgments on the people within them, some of them very bad, some good, but all undeserved. I'm sure there are a few who take pride in being called an "untouchable", but most people probably don't want to be known for it. It is something to be ashamed of and according to the Dalit article, some of them hide their caste/non-caste. It's about as attractive as being on a list of "mud people", a term some use to describe non-whites. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:20, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Will Prakash Karat tolerate him being listed in this casteist page&#160;? Many people cannot tolerate their names being identified with caste? My name is in this list and I don't like it. Please take permission of the concerned persons before adding to this list</p>
<ul>
<li>If your name is really on the list, the first thing I have to say is that we are very glad to have you with us&#160;!</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with your comments that the editors should not add things that the subject of the article may not agree with. If the subject is notable and the facts are verifiable it belongs here. Karat is certainly famous. It can be verified that his parents are Nairs. Whether he likes it or not, he is/was a Nair and is atleast a 'former Nair'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What certainly can be done to make it accurate is to add a comment about this 'former' aspect in the description, or move Karat and such others to a seperate section with an appropriate title. I'll add a comment about this in the talk page of the article for the regular editors <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Famous_Nairs#Comment_from_AfD" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Famous_Nairs#Comment_from_AfD" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.</dd>

<li>Potentially, this could be a speedy delete under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> A1, as a short article with little or no context.

<p><b>appeal:</b> pleasantblue doesnt seek followers: it's supposed to be silly by definition. it hardly seems any one else will have a definition for 'pleasantblue', so its not possible for it to confuse anyone by leaving silly information about it. pleasantblue is built on 'koans' which <i>are</i> paradoxical and silly. pleasantblue is not kipple, and has nothing to do with software. it IS however, just silly.

<li><b>fair enough:</b> i'm truly not attempting to take up space on the server with uselessness, but am trying to define a concept, that is an active process, albeit silly. i do understand why it's seen as useless, and have no intent to move beyond the scope of what wikipedia is, but feel a few 'wild cards' in the mix is fairly representative of the dynamic nature of the internet and human culture in itself.

<ul>
<li>Sure. I don't disagree at all; it certainly <i>is</i> fairly representative of the dynamic nature of the internet and human culture in itself. But Wikipedia is not really here to showcase either. It's a project to build an encyclopedia. I have nothing but respect for projects like yours, silly or not, but Wikipedia isn't designed to include things like this. It just isn't a place for experiments, soapboxes, artistic statements and whatnot. (That said, a new and separate Wiki project could certainly be created to accommodate things like pleasantblue -- might be something for you to look into, if you're interested.) -- �<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 20:35, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The page for pleasantblue seems in outward appearance to be divergent to the conventions of Wikipedia. And yet if such as pleasantblue did not make appearance in Wikipedia then the world of "acceptable human knowledge" would be impoverished to the extent of accepting only the commonly acceptable. In my own view, this would be a tragic mistake. Inspiration comes in many forms from the most humble to the most impressive. Most always, it is silly. Nonetheless, the creative process should never ever be disregarded or otherwise ignored without timely consideration of what may be involved. I also think that a Wiki project closely associated with Wikipedia to accommodate such inventive thinking as pleasantblue would be appropriate. stardance 21:15, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>"In outward appearance," my ass. And it's not being discarded or ignored.

<li>Yes, it was a hastily thought out comment. Thankyou for confirming my own afterthoughts. I see that MG has conceded however I am still interested in a Wiki project associated with Wikipedia that covers the huge area of human endeavour that is not classed as being within existing knowledge, and yet is essential or otherwise useful to the progress of human civilisation. I have no idea how to select such items. An interesting question in itself. My respects. stardance 16:30, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>conceded:</b> your argument is clear and founded. i especially understand the concern with 'setting precedence', it shan't be pressed further. however, the "compendium of existing knowledge" - sits a little rough. there are many things i wouldn't have known existed, until i was made aware of them, often by looking them up in an encyclopedia, after having 'heard of them'.</p>
<p>a taste of revolutionary art shaking up dominant wiki paradigm gets my vote. knowledge can become sterile and meaningless without reference to the unknowable. a touch of randomness and aesthetic 'nonsense' is in the tradition of the playful seriousness of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armory_Show" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armory_Show" rel="nofollow">1913 armory show</a>, the insurrectionary sarcasms of the modernists. yes, it is an unusual entry, but i would venture, that given opportunity, the page could grow and become more relevant and meaningful. i agree that leaving the page opens the door to other unusual entries. i'd like to see if the definition evolves before it's deleted. - 'mabel dodge'</p>

<p>I think it was around the 15th century in Italy that artists originally started signing their names to their works. (I havent come to a firm reference for this yet.)

<li><b>Keep.</b> "Massive blog-based astroturfing campaign?" Isn't that a contradiction in terms? The "porkbusters" effort isn't being pushed by a single organization or even party; it's an entirely voluntary and yes, grass-roots movement. I could just as easily say that the Cindy Sheehan hysteria in August was a "massive media-based astroturfing campaign on behalf of a marginal band of leftie radicals."

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>This is a big time project, and certainly, as noted above, has more impact that Cindy Sheehan.

<li><b>Strong Keep and Expand</b> Porkbusters is notable now and has great potential to morph into a permanent political movement.

<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wikisource, then <b>delete</b>. This is a trial court order, not an appellate court judgment that declares new law - it might be a notable case, but it's one of many dozens like it against the tobacco industry, so an actual article on the case would probably be either redundant to the whole class of cases or very stubby, and either way would likely benefit from a merger into an article on tobacco litigation. I was thinking that if Wikisource is to be a repository of court orders, it would be better to start from the top, but then again it's always useful to have examples of opinions from different levels of court. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 21:39, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b>/<b>Merge</b> as the trial is notable in a minor way as supporting information in other source material. It does not qualify to stand alone as it is not one of the benchmark cases, and there is no true "article" included.

<p>"If the PFR had ever been used successfully as a defense in a Canadian criminal case I'd vote differently." Canada's most famous fugitive from the American drug wars Renee Boje is the 11th signatory to the PFR petition. The word diatribe means "A bitter, abusive denunciation." if you had read the PFR you would see that there is nothing bitter or abusive in it.</p>
<p>Wide acceptance should not be a criteria. Over 200 people believe enough in the Primary Fundamental Right to risk the wrath of the police state by signing the PFR petition. Many others endorse its principles privately. {Bernard Palmer|220.239.49.36|12:06, 13 October 2005 (UTC)}}</p>

<dd>Please do not confuse "wide acceptance of the principle itself as positive law" with "wide acceptance of the existence of the principle as a well-known, verifiable theory of law".

<p>Since when is neologism a bad thing? Quote Chick Bowen, "Wikipedia is wonderful, but it is scattershot—its function is to present as much information as possible without distinguishing within it. That is its chief strength." <small><i>(Unsigned comment by User:220.239.49.36. — <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">CB</a>)</i></small></p>

<dd>Neologism is not a bad thing, but it doesn't belong on Wikipedia, per community consensus and the will of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">our founder</a>. I certainly didn't mean that statment to defend anything that anyone puts into Wikipedia. On the contrary, my point about the strength of not distinguishing between categories of knowledge is that we can devote 10% of our resources to <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> crap and not impact our treatment of <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcaeus_%28poet%29.html" title="Alcaeus (poet)">Alcaeus</a>.

<p>"The phrase "original research" in this context refers to untested theories; data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication;". I agree the Primary Fundamental Right has not been published in any reputable publication that I know of. The Primary Fundamental Right is very much a child of the Internet, it was born of the Internet, is disseminated by the Internet. No idea so precise and simple could have bloomed anywhere else. Same as Wiki. "the will of [[Jimmy Wales|our founder" was much influenced by Ayne Rand. The Primary Fundamental Right is a bible for 'Objectivists' who advocate laissez-faire capitalism, Jimbo's perfect society. I guarantee if you ask Jimbo to click on the link to 'What is the Primary Fundamental Right' he would recognize the important role the PFR could play in changing society for the better. It is such a simple concept that its real beauty is in its simplicity. Imagine everyone legally owning their own body. It sounds preposterous but none of us in this wonderful technological age actually do. We let it slip away and it is sliding faster and faster. The Mises Institute anticipates totalitarianism will engulf the USA early this century. I think they are right that's why I built the PFR. That's why I am pressing my case with you. I want you to see that just because it hasn't been accepted by the 'elites' it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Bernard Palmer</p>

<li>Dear Admin, If you expect every Wiki entry to be as recognizable as FSM, then you'll have a lot of deleting to do as people add articles about subjects which interest them but are not as widely known as the FSM meme and therefore cannot measure up to such an arbitrary comparison. The article in question has been modified to provide more information. Please do not assert your deletion powers today upon this article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 208.210.197.2 (<a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.210.197.2.html" title="User talk:208.210.197.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.210.197.2_9921.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.210.197.2">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> as a fleshed out entry could be easily worth keeping. An entry with notable books published by Loft Press and/or various notable milestones in the subjects career and/or the history of Loft Press would qualify. Even if this person was indisputably notable, the article is insufficient for inclusion. el_amante 21:05, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The article does not in any way establish notability; I don't think the company itself is notable enough, so its president certainly isn't.

<p>Looks like band vanity to me. Allmusic hasn't heard of them, and though they claim to have one album, I'm willing to bet it's self-released.

<li>Some people tend to give a bit too much credit to some "tours" as well. If this one is true, it seems pretty extensive, but some outfits can get in a car, play a few high schools in a couple states, or open for another minor band, playing sparsely attended clubs (or, worse, coffee houses), call it a "national tour" and get a wikipedia article based on that. I don't give too much credit to mere tours, usually. If a band has no recordings, then no one knows what they sound like before they see them, and it's unlikely too many people specifically go to see a band they really know nothing about. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:36, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Seeing that the little chap the debate is about is Hungarian, I've had a look at your entries on Hungarian performers in your allmusic guide. If you truly mean ALL music, then you're seriously deficient on the classical side. Unless I'm totally computer illiterate, I couldn't find Andras Schiff, Zoltan Kocsis, Tamas Vasary, or Eva Marton - just to name a few. I regret to inform you that the Allmusic Guide is hardly a competent reference on Hungarian music or musicians. (JP)
<ul>
<li>I've noticed deficiencies in allmusic as well, particularly in foreign musicians. "Allmusic" is a bit of a misnomer. I don't know much about the site, or what they purport to have, but they are about as good a guide as anything out there, as of yet. However, they <i>do</i> have Schiff <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=41:51193" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=41:51193" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, Kocsis <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=41:33898" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=41:33898" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, Vasary <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=41:59180" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=41:59180" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, and Marton <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=41:39003" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=41:39003" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>.

<p>Keep (and not just because it's mine)</p>
<p>The examples I used in the article were used because they were easy examples to show of the camera being used in this way, without having to go into great reams of detail about the objects used in the shots, as these were already described on the matrix pages. I could have given an example of an advertisement done by centerparcs before the matrix had even been conceptually created, but no one would have understood fully what I was talking about.</p>
<p>In addition, the other information given on how the Virtual camera is used in computer animated movies and computer games is still relevant, but not to the matrix, perhaps they could use more elaboration as opposed to just deleting the article?</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The article is about brain research with references to that. No references to sources like: <i>Researchers have concluded that WP works like neural ensembles</i>.
