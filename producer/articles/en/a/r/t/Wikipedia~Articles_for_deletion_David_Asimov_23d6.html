<p>At best, article fails notability, and some versions were negative and poorly sourced.

<dd>Mere relation is rarely but sometimes sufficient, but the relatives of the famous frequently become notable by actions that would go unnoted if done by others.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a somewhat tricky situation. As the article stands now, it is probably a speedy under CSD:A7 (to me, at least, mere relation to a notable person is not an assertion of notability). However, it's probably necessary to look at the previous version of the article, taking <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> into consideration, and determining whether the several factors (being the son of a famous person + the [well-sourced] allegations of criminal conduct + the [poorly-sourced] report of conviction on at least some charges) add up to suitability for a Wikipedia article, and I would conclude that they simply aren't. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 20:37, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let me rephrase. This article belongs in the Isaac Asimov article until it becomes sufficiently notable on its own to merit a separate article. David Asmiov's only notability is his father. Therefore material on David should go under his father's article until circumstances merit otherwise.

<li>I disagree with those above who believe that some of the negative information in the article was well sourced or fairly well sourced. Most important, the quote was attributed to an unnamed officer. That is pretty hard to falsify, especially given David Asimov's low notability. A newspaper (or possibly reckless mouthed officer) is on safe ground. I mean, if he had been the son of a famous active politician with supporters and rivals, various parts of the press would cared enough to do further digging, which would give partial braking action on the unattributed quote. By the way, I think that "average" offspring of famous people rarely get press coverage, hence notability, unless the famous person is an active politician. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_L._Peterson_830c.html" title="User:Richard L.

<li>Since this is the sort of thing that comes up in interpreting <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, it's worth a little bit of analysis. I don't know if it's my post you're referring to above, but basically there were three negative items in the previous version(s) of the article: (1) that the subject was charged with a crime; (2) that a police officer commented on the nature and quantity of the evidence against him; and (3) that he was convicted of a crime, possibly as a result of a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a>. Item (1) was uncontestedly well sourced, via a reputable newspaper reporting on verifiable matters of record. Item (2) is well sourced <i>as to the fact of the officer's allegation</i>, but not necessarily as to the fact of the matter referred to. Under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> we probably should not use it even as to the allegation, unless corroborated. Item (3) appeared only in tertiary sources, that is, quotes from news reports that were not sufficiently identified to permit verification, and at least one was from an attack/advocacy site which is manifestly not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. This is the type of analysis that, I believe, BLP requires. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 01:02, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>As has been pointed out in a number of AfDs, "merge and delete" is not a permitted option in AfD, since the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> requires retention of the edit history of the previous article. Thus, if an article is formally merged as you suggest, a redirect to <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Asimov_1d17.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> would need to be left in place. As a practical matter, the information in the sub-stub is already there, so this article can simply be deleted. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 23:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're right, my apologies, I should have used other, less official, wording. I was trying to imply that the creator of the page could put in some reference to the now-deleted arrest/conviction into the father's article if it were phrased in a non-objectionable way. But at this point, given the single event of notability of the son, creating a redirect would be pointless, particularly if his father's page is the only one he would be mentioned on anyway. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 13:06, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
