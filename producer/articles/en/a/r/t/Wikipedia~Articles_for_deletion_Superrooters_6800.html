<p><b>Save and File this page</b> This organisation has significant influence on the cultural identity of Adelaide University and its students and as such should be kept up. The influence of this club can be seen in their structured mentoring program for gifted individuals, which fosters intellectual, spiritual and physical growth. They are an active participant in many events and there are frequent references to them in community newspapers, street press and University communications. You don't have to spend long in <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> to hear a story about a good deed they've done or a function they've organised. This organisation has been involved in the running and organisation of the prestigious Cascade Cup. Including rowing to several notable victories. They are known to stand for the strict maintenance of rules and standards in inter Varsity 'rograms. Most of the comments posted above seem to come from well intentioned but illinformed users from the other side of the globe. I appreciate their input and it's understandable that patent attorneys from the US would have little understanding of the cultural significance of such an organisation.

<p><b>Save</b> It is clear to me that this article should be well and truly retained. The use of the term 'sockpuppetry' which all you deleters despise is just xenophobia towards people of the wider community intruding in on your little world. How many people do you think actually spend all their time critiquing websites? It makes sense that anonymous users should vote for this article, as it refers to and is known by people whose main concern is not the internet, or let alone wikipedia. Furthermore, comments like 'unverifiable' really pertain to the effort applied and the access to such knowledge. A quick search on google, an american centric search engine, is hardly enough evidence to rule that something well known, significant and verifiable in the city of Adelaide Australia, doesn't exist. The enthusiasm of some of the'sockpuppets' while over done, is indicative of the very real existence and influence of this club. The article editor obviously thought that Wikipedia was a global repository of knowledge- which is not something that is only approved and seconded by a small esoteric community of close minded internet dwellers. <small>unsigned vote by: 202.20.20.129 (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.20.20.129.html" title="User talk:202.20.20.129">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.20.20.129_3f7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.20.20.129">contribs</a>)</small></p>

<p><b>Save.</b> It's a good thing that the Cyberjunkie knows everything about Adelaide, bow down before the mighty intellect of the all knowing and wise Cyberjunkie who is so learned that he ended up at Flinders Uni. It's safe to say that the intellectual powerhouse that is Flinders has produced some well informed individuals over the years, but CyberJunkie must be foremost amongst them becuase he knows everything about Adelaide. I think it's safe to say that CyberJunkie hasn't bothered doing any research other than going to the comic book store or tapping away at the keyboard. If Cyberjunkie bothered asking around, or even looking in a few local publications, they'd see many references to this organisation. In fact only a few months ago they featured live on channel 7's sunrise program. I suppose when you are hacking the internet and deleting wikipedia articles all night, you don't get up early enough to watch morning TV. The sort of subjective generalisations that CyberJunkie is making are reason enough to delete everything he's ever contributed to Wikipedia, but since i'm not a vindictive busy body, I've got better things to do than conduct some sort of Cyber terrorism against legitimate encyclopedic content. It's safe to say that a little bit of knowledge(Flinders Uni) in CyberJunkie's case is a bad thing.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If it's sockuppet bait, then there's probably a good chance it should be deleted regardless of content.

<li><b>Save</b>. There is no 'sockpuppetry' here. Simply people with a shared, and vested interest in preserving this small and untroubling reference to a society affiliated with the uni of Adelaide.
