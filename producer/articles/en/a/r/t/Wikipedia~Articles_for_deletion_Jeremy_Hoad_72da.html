<li><b>Keep</b> Given the minutaie of Doctor Who which is considered notable on Wikipedia and the current massive popularity of the TV show, I can't see how being the co-author of one of the most popular and, conversely, most controversial, Doctor Who novels is non-notable. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't know that every single author of books in the Dr. Who series warrants an article. However, given <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a>' post I may be convinced to reconsider my vote. As it stands, nothing in this entry (nor that for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blue_Angel_%28Doctor_Who%29_5b1d.html" title="The Blue Angel (Doctor Who)">The Blue Angel</a></i>) indicates that the novel was more popular or controversial than any other in the series. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 18:50, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - It also remains the only Who novel to have been dramatised [<a href="http://www.iriswildthyme.thiswaydown.org/angelplay.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iriswildthyme.thiswaydown.org/angelplay.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] and has generated at least one spin-off by a recognised and published author [<a href="http://www.infinitarian.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/cabinet.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infinitarian.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/cabinet.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not suggesting the information above is irrelevant - but let's be accurate. It would appear that the dramatisation of the novel, available for view on a fan site, has never been performed. The "spin-off" is a short story contained in a small press publication described as an "unofficial collection of wild variations on the theme of Doctor Who". Neither project would do much to strengthen the entry on Mr Hoad (indeed they aren't mentioned in what remains a very weak one sentence entry). That said, both pieces of information should be added to the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blue_Angel_%28Doctor_Who%29_5b1d.html" title="The Blue Angel (Doctor Who)">Blue Angel</a></i> article. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 18:03, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - indeed. I'm not aware of any evidence that <i>The Blue Angel</i> is either notably popular or controversial. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 19:09, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - For instances of both controversy and popularity see the Jade Pagoda Yahoo [<a href="http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/Jade_Pagoda/" class="external autonumber" title="http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/Jade_Pagoda/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] lists extensive public archives, the various reviews on Outpost Gallifrey [<a href="http://www.gallifreyone.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gallifreyone.com/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] and the rather notorious review of the book here [<a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/blueangel.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/blueangel.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>]<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - while that's certainly all good notability for the book, I'm not sure it adds to the Hoad article. At the moment there's nothing in his single-line article that couldn't be covered with a note on the book's page. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 14:34, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I take your point and the book article could certainly do with being beefed up a bit (there's no mention of the fuss caused by the Doctor being portrayed as homosexual in the book for a start), but it would seem odd to put details about the author in the book article rather than in a linked article on the author (as with other authors).
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The point is that, unless he writes something more at some point or does something else of note, his article is unlikely ever to expand beyond the single line description currently there. Which frankly seems like a bit of a waste of time. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 18:01, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Is there a need for more than one book to qualify under <i><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a></i> - i.e "Published authors, [...]who received multiple independent reviews of [...] their work" - there have certainly been numerous independent reviews of the book and he may well write more in the future?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Is there a need? Not at all. However, being the author (co-author, in this case) of a title that has been reviewed doesn't necessarily mean the subject is worthy of an article. After all, the above quotation from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is preceded by "People who satisfy at least one of the items below <i>may</i> merit their own Wikipedia articles..." (emphasis mine). I think it likely that the subject will write more books, but this is speculation and falls under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. That said, I recognize that <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blue_Angel_%28Doctor_Who%29_5b1d.html" title="The Blue Angel (Doctor Who)">Blue Angel</a></i> was published in September 1999. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 20:17, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough. I can't think of anything further to add - the popularity (as evinced by the fact that it has generated some form of spin-offery and conversion to another medium, as well as multiple reviews and general ongoing discussion) and notoriety of the book seem enough to qualify for inclusion of the author to me, (possibly also worth noting his publications with the National Postgraduate Council [<a href="http://www.npc.org.uk/essentials/postgraduates" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npc.org.uk/essentials/postgraduates" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] about which, I admit, I know nothing other than their existence) but I may well be in a minority.<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Unless there's a general view that <i>Doctor Who</i> articles are proliferating out of hand, Hoad is notable for his contribution to the series' spinoff fiction, which as Stuart suggests is significant. The idea that the article be merged with the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Magrs_7030.html" title="Paul Magrs">Paul Magrs</a> or <i><a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Angel_fd42.html" title="Blue Angel">Blue Angel</a></i> articles tends to minimise the contribution that a co-author makes to a book: co-authorship is a very different process from ordinary writing, and Magrs has said that the two of them wrote every line together. As far as I'm aware it's Magrs's only such collaboration, which is arguably significant in itself given his profile outside the <i>Doctor Who</i> arena as a respected literary (and young adult) author, teacher of creative writing etc. I can see arguments for expanding both this and the <i>Blue Angel</i> article, but not for deleting Hoad now he's here. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_PH_b65a.html" title="User:Phil PH">Phil PH</a> 08:14, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> Co-writing one <i>Who</i> novel seems of marginal notability to me, but I like to err on the side of including articles and, heaven knows, there are literally &gt;100 <i>Doctor Who</i> articles on more obscure topics. However, there isn't much point in having a separate article if it is never going to grow beyond the current stub. So <b>keep</b> if the article gets expanded, or <b>merge</b> with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blue_Angel_%28Doctor_Who%29_5b1d.html" title="The Blue Angel (Doctor Who)">The Blue Angel</a></i> or <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Magrs_7030.html" title="Paul Magrs">Paul Magrs</a> otherwise. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBondegezou_315a.html" title="User:Bondegezou">Bondegezou</a> 09:28, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't want to appear difficult, but I am wondering what other publications are being referred to here. I see no sign that the subject has done more than co-author a seven year-old Dr Who novel. If he has indeed written other work, it is possible that there would never have been a nomination for deletion in the first place. Should they exist, I suggest that information on other books be added to the article - it can only serve to strengthen. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 18:38, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>'<b>Comment'</b> This is possibly a reference to my mention of "his publications with the National Postgraduate Council" above, although it could also be referring to his journalism for The Times, Guardian, Independent etc or his publication in academic magazines, all of which can be verified by a quick Google search <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 09:19, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I suppose we can't really know to what <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> was referring. That said, I don't think co-written contributions to the website of the National Postgraduate Committee, "a charity to advance, in the public interest, postgraduate education in the UK", speak to notability. Mr Hoad's articles in <i>The Guardian</i> are few and far between (four short pieces on education since 2000). I'm afraid I cannot find any Hoad contributions to <i>The independent</i> or <i>The Times</i> (at least not archived at www.independent.co.uk and www.timesonline.co.uk). I think the issue of notabiility rests on the co-authorship of a Dr Who novel published seven years ago. Not really enough to these eyes.<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 17:05, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Given that this discussion revolves largely round whether co-authorship of the Doctor Who novel <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blue_Angel_1b67.html" title="The Blue Angel">The Blue Angel</a> confers notability, are you suggesting that he didn't co-write that book or that some source other than the cover of the novel on the novel's entry is required?

<dd>I'm not talking about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I'm talking about the missing sources that establish the claims to notability, of which there are two here: 1. he co-authoried a book; and 2. he's a university lecturer. Both things should be easy to verify, but verifiability doesn't establish notability. The book, btw, isn't sourced either. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 16:00, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Possibly I'm being dumb, but the claim to notability (largely of the novel and Hoad's co-writing of it) is what we're discussing here.

<p><b>Comment</b> Actually, given that he's co-author of the only Who novel (to the best of my knowledge) being taught as a University text [<a href="http://www.iriswildthyme.thiswaydown.org/angelPlay.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iriswildthyme.thiswaydown.org/angelPlay.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>], isn't that enough in itself to confer notability? <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 10:29, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Is this novel actually being taught as a university text, or did it serve as the basis of a script that is expected to be presented to students of a course in costume design in May 2007? Might this be <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystal ball</a>?
