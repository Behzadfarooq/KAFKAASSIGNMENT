<li><b>Clarification</b> the debate about this article is not about the existence of Lumber Cartel.

<li><b>Additional info</b> This article has been here over a year plenty of time for someone to actually turn it into something if anyone cared about it.

<dd>Would of, could of, should of. This article has been here over a year. There has been plenty of time to clean it up and provide something verifiable that fits with wikipedia policy. Obviously no one is interested in doing that. It also needs major re-write because it reads like a conspiracy theory blog entry. I also used usenet a lot and don't recall once hearing about this. This is subjective, and may not have been that notable. As they currently don't provide a single credible source for this article, its complete original research, especially given the style of writing used in the article. This is a policy violation and is non-negotiable as per the policy <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> <i>These three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus</i> The article cannot exist on wikipedia in its current form and no one is interested in cleaning it up.

<dd>And usenet isn't an acceptable primary source, regardless of where it happened. WP:V is non-negotiable and you can't verify those postings to usenet. The timestamp does not verify who wrote those messages. The timestamp can also be forged as can the from header. And as I pointed out below regarding TINC its never been put up for deletion and it should. Its a neologism and defining and explaining it is WP:OR. Those jargon files cannot be used as primary sources as a definition.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 14:46, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not sure I'm following all this - are you saying Google Groups timestamps and/or headers are forged?

<dd>I never made the leap from using a newsreader to one of the web-based alternatives like google groups, but does it just not show usenet content and allow you post to it through the web? Whether or not the specific google interface allows you to forge time stamps, I have no idea. But that group you're referring to is just a usenet group. Anyone can access that with a newsreader and forge their timestamp. Not-withstanding that, you cannot verify who made any of those individual posts which goes against <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> this is why forums are also not acceptable as sources. As for the primary source of what happens on usenet, there may not be a primary source. Regardless of how notable a topic this may be within the usenet community, if no one outside it has ever covered it (like say Wired) then you may not have a usable source. Wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection of all information <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and from WP:V "<b>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth</b>" Wikipedia is about verifiability not truth.

<dd>You may vaguely recall something called deja news? Google acquired their database sometime ago. Those archives go back to 11 May '81 [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1709527.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1709527.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC</a>]. The database is certainly more secure than many, many sites that are routinely accepted as reputable sources. Indeed, much of the uproar over Deja was because of the concern that they kept your words set in stone, so you could never take them back. You can forge a datestamp easy enough on your usenet client, but that doesn't keep the server from accurately recording when and from where it received your message. Keep in mind, as Bryan pointed out, this is not a case of using a usenet post as a source for anything other than it's own occurence. In that context, this is about as reliable a source as you're ever likely to see for anything. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArker_a43e.html" title="User:Arker">Arker</a> 00:32, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't justify keeping this article on the basis of a poor decision to keep another article. This article is also not in good shape. Its not written professionally, and doesn't contain a single credible source. I also see no evidence that it was ever put up for deletion so I don't see any concensus reached there for a keep on the claim that it was notable. The argument for deletion put forth doesn't even suggest deleting this article based on notability, its based on multiple policy violations and the fact that no one is interested in actually writing the article properly.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 14:40, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Published in <i>The New Hacker's Dictionary</i>, which - as the dead-tree version of The Jargon File - is semi-cited in the article. With regard to verifiability, Usenet postings are obviously primary sources about themselves. In this case the authorship of an individual post is irrelevant, as the article is about the meme, not the spreaders of it. I'm ambivalent on its notability - I think <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_is_no_cabal.html" title="There is no cabal">There is no cabal</a> is appreciably more widespread, and would support a merge - but deleting this on verifiability grounds is pretty wikilawyer-y. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 23:02, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

While it provides a basis for the name, it doesn't provide a basis for most of the content in the article.

<dd>Okay, now I've had my coffee and actually <i>read</i> the crap I wrote in the article. I'm an idiot. You're absolutely right, of course. Articles on obscure pieces of net humour are very, very hard to ultimately source, especially when a lot of discussion about this stuff happened on some forums (or Usenet, in this case). My only defense when writing the article is that I certainly did not make <i>new</i> claims, just repeated the same stuff that people said when debunking this "conspiracy".

<li>Okay, I've rewritten the article substantially and added many pre-Wikipedia references, including Salon, Wired, and Gambling Magazine. Also many mailing-list archives containing posts with Lumber Cartel references, thereby indicating that the concept has retained its notability. Also anti-spam companies calling themselves the Lumber Cartel. Also note that, despite Crossmr's concerns, Google Groups doesn't allow posting via an external newsreader, so you can't falsify your datestamps. I'll concede that the Wired article has a warning that the reporter later faced some verifiability issues regarding her sources... but the fact is, the article <i>mentioned</i> the Lumber Cartel as anti-spammers, and that's the point of notability of a meme. Remember, this is a hoax, a confabulation. The Lumber Cartel <i>per se</i> never actually existed, and no one is claiming it did; therefore, we need no more prove its existence than we need prove <a href="../../../p/i/l/Piltdown_Man_3087.html" title="Piltdown Man">Piltdown Man</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 20:41, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>again, its not the existence that needs sourcing. Its the rest of the information put forth by the article. I've read the 5 acceptable sources (I've organized them) and while google groups doens't allow you to post via an external news reader, the usenet groups it allows you to read do. Not-withstanding google groups is no different than usenet, a forum, a blog or anything else that any random person can just create. It fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as a primary or secondary source.

<dd>Remember the threshold for inclusion on wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. Opinions and information culled from an unverifiable source, while many might believe it to be true, can't be used on wikipedia. They can be linked as external links, which I've done on the article. They might need to be sorted and gone through to ensure relevance to the subject. I would consider withdrawing the AfD, or supporting a keep on this article so long as a concensus was reached and enforced on this and other articles like it (i.e TINC) with regards to ensuring proper verifiability. If people aren't interested in keeping the articles within the policies and guidelines, then there is no other course but to delete them as essentially useless in the context of an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> per Mackensen, FOo. This is an important piece of internet culture and history. Deletion would be a travesty as well as a tragedy. As to the WP:V argument above, this is a clear case where the rule being cited was worded without this sort of case in mind. It would not be appropriate to cite a usenet post for a source 99.9% of the time, and it's a good rule on that basis. In this particular case, however, usenet posts are verifiable and verified primary documents! They're much better sources, in this particular case, than exist for most articles. It makes no sense to throw the baby out with the bathwater simply because a particular rule was worded with the majority case in mind. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Wikipedia%7EInterpret_all_rules_7caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Interpret all rules">Wikipedia:Interpret all rules</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUse_common_sense_cd4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Use common sense">Wikipedia:Use common sense</a> apply here. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArker_a43e.html" title="User:Arker">Arker</a> 22:29, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"A travesty as well as a tragedy?" Those are some pretty strong words to throw around for something like this. "Internet culture and history" is more than well-represented on Wikipedia already.

<dd>unfortunately the rule is a non-negotiable policy and a foundation for content on wikipedia. Usenet posts are not verifiable. Can you prove to me who wrote them? No you can't.

<dd>I believe what is non-negotiable is the principle expressed on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the principle of verifiability. It states clearly that it may be edited "to better reflect practical explanation and application of these principles." Keeping this would not violate that principle in the least. It would violate a legalistic reading that treats every word on the page as equally important and sacrosant, but I believe a fair reading of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as a whole, particularly the two introductory paragraphs (where the quote above may be found) as well as sections 1 and 2 argue strongly against such a reading, as does <a href="../../../s/e/n/WP%7ESENSE_4fdd.html" title="WP:SENSE">WP:SENSE</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArker_a43e.html" title="User:Arker">Arker</a> 00:32, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Usenet posts are verifiable <i>as Usenet posts</i>. ie, if the relevant fact is that "x was posted to usenet" then a link showing that x was indeed posted to usenet serves as verification of that. You can dispute whether they'd be verification for the fact that "y wrote x" but categorically excluding all Usenet posts as references under every possible situation is going a bit far. As one example of a case where Usenet references are perfectly reasonable, see <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsgroup_spam.html" title="Newsgroup spam">Newsgroup spam</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:23, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't disclude it, its already been discluded by wikipedia policy and guidelines. WP:SENSE has no bearing in this, as it clearly states that WP:V cannot be worked around by another other guideline, policy or editor concensus, let alone an essay. I can already see problems with Newsgroup Spam, and its not a proper example. Their first citation is in fact original research. They're making a claim "x was the first piece of spam to hit the newsgroups", however their only citation is the actual post itself. Thats the definition of original research, because there is no independent verification for that fact. A published source has to make the claim or present that as fact for it to presented as such in the article.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 02:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The actually nitty gritty of it is meaningless here, because it boils down to: These things can be used as examples to illustrate a point, i.e. "Here is someone using TINLC in their signature on usenet", but you can't use it as a primary or secondary source for facts, opinions, theories, etc that you want to include in the article. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 04:09, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well known internet meme, article is thoroughly sourced despite protestations of the nom, who seems to be advocating his point rather strongly, and spreading the conflict to other places in what is in my view inappropriate ways. Deleting swaths of the article as unsourced, without consensus to do so, while the article is up for deletion, strikes me as a very bad practice, not to be encouraged. USNET is an acceptable primary source for information about usenet lore and usenet memes, whatever the nom thinks. Perhaps the nom could spend some time working to properly source bios of living people, where the restrictions on what sources are fit his model better than how we source usenet terms. <b>Keep</b> ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 20:43, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're swapping policies around. Your Usenet quote, where you have hung everything, is from our <b>guideline</b> on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The concept of verifiability is non-negotiable. Reliable Sources outlines one way (arguably the best way in most cases) to achieve verifiability.

<dd>Read the entirety of what WP:V says. Its not just the concept of verifiability, its everything in the policy that is non-negotiable. In addition to it linking to reliable sources for clarification, it also says in "Self-published sources (online and paper)". <b>Exceptions may be when a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as their work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications.</b> Usenet is a self-published source.
