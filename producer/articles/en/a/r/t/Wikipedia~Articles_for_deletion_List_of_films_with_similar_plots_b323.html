<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> (<b>Neutral</b>; see below). This is more something that should be in the film entries themselves. This list is not even restricted to a specific plot. Any plot similar to another will do. More focussed lists like List of animated films about animals (to include Madagascar, The Wild, Shark Tale, AntZ, A Bug's Life and Finding Nemo) for example would work much better. The lack of focus means it's a indiscriminate collection of facts, which WP is not. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:30, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's a pretty interesting collection of trivia, but it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and I think it also qualifies as an "unmaintainable list." The criteria is so vague, we could probably put nearly every movie ever made on it, if we sat down and thought about it. It lists two films about Wyatt Earp as having similar plots, but you could say that about any two biographical movies about the same person. Given the loose criteria, why not include the various film versions of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> -- and others based on them (ie. <i>West side Story</i>)? As well as the hundreds of other films based on Shakespeare, mythology, the Bible? They would certainly qualify as "having a similar plot." And that way lies madness...or a fun party game. But not an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 12:52, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The introduction to the article states that what it is documenting here is the phenomenon of competing studios either coincidentally or deliberately releasing movies with very similar premises, at the same time (e.g. in the same season, or year). Certainly such a phenomenon has been talked about in the past — the sudden spate of asteroid impact movies a few years ago, for example. <a href="http://www.gatago.com/alt/movies/4427465.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gatago.com/alt/movies/4427465.html" rel="nofollow">Here's a whole Usenet thread on the subject</a>. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Mansion/7045/13Floor.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Mansion/7045/13Floor.htm" rel="nofollow">Here's a film reviewer giving examples from the 1960s</a>. <a href="http://uk.filmforce.ign.com/mail/2006-01-24.html" class="external text" title="http://uk.filmforce.ign.com/mail/2006-01-24.html" rel="nofollow">Here's a reader writing in to a magazine asking about such movies.</a> <a href="http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/ce090699.html" class="external text" title="http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/ce090699.html" rel="nofollow">Here's someone discussing how people appear to copy James Cameron a lot.</a> <a href="http://www.salary.com/careers/layoutscripts/crel_display.asp?tab=cre&amp;cat=Cat10&amp;ser=Ser190&amp;part=Par289" class="external text" title="http://www.salary.com/careers/layoutscripts/crel_display.asp?tab=cre&amp;cat=Cat10&amp;ser=Ser190&amp;part=Par289" rel="nofollow">Here's someone explaining one strictly financial motivation.</a> The problem, as indeed was stated last month on this article's talk page, is sourcing, in order to prevent the article straying off into original research territory. There are plenty of people who have compiled lists of "copycat movies", such as <a href="http://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.2616/Movies" class="external text" title="http://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.2616/Movies" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.starpulse.com/movie/Copycat/V135454/0/4/" class="external text" title="http://www.starpulse.com/movie/Copycat/V135454/0/4/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.

<p>If the article actually mentioned the common name for these movies, "copycat movies", it would probably help (a) to clarify what the list is actually of, and (b) editors to look for sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:24, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
