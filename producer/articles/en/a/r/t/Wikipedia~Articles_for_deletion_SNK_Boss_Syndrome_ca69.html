<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree, as no actual research was done. Damn near everybody in the fighting game fandom knew this information years ago. While perhaps "Syndrome" is the wrong word, it is valid information, and not original at all(ask around <a href="http://www.shoryuken.com" class="external text" title="http://www.shoryuken.com" rel="nofollow">Shoryuken.com</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b>—"SNK Boss Syndrome" is just a colloquial term, shouldn't be here in an Encyclopedia, there are better terms to describe overly powerful bosses rather than saying the words "SNK Boss Syndrome", now that there are Namco and Tecmo bosses that are overly too cheap (i.e. Jinpachi Mishima). — <a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">Dark Insanity</a> 04:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Namco and Tecmo, however, have not been known to have insanely hard/cheap bosses for more than ten years. That's been the staple of SNK's fighting games since <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Krauser_c7a4.html" title="Wolfgang Krauser">Wolfgang Krauser</a> at least. Much like how a great many non-Konami games use the cheat code Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, it's still called the <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami_Code_6533.html" title="Konami Code">Konami Code</a> because Konami started it, they did it more than anyone else combined, and they became (in)famous because of it. This is why, when somone in just about any given forum with members over the age of 18 posts a thread about tough, cheap bosses, it usually doesn't get past two pages before someone mentions SNK Bosses in general. This is why, when a reviewer mentions the difficulty of a boss in a fighting game, he compares it to the bosses of SNK's games(see links above).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While the use of the word "Syndrome" may sound a little too colliqual to some to describe it, I can't say it's inaccurate. Wikipedia's entry on <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndrome.html" title="Syndrome">Syndrome</a> says this: <i>In medicine, the term syndrome is the association of several clinically recognizable features, signs, symptoms, phenomena or characteristics which often occur together, so that the presence of one feature alerts the physician to the presence of the others.</i></p>
<p>The contributors to this thread have done a very good job in pointing out the recognizable features, signs, symptoms, phenomena and characteristics that have made the Bosses in SNK's fighting games so damn tough. While not a medical syndrome, it's certainly one gameplay-wise.</p>
<p>Not that there's not any precedent. See the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormtrooper_effect.html" title="Stormtrooper effect">Stormtrooper effect</a>. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESAMAS_7b35.html" title="User:SAMAS">SAMAS</a></p>

<li>That's like saying a Tiger has black stripes is POV. None of the "Symptoms" in the article(dude, did you even <i>read</i> it?) are done by any opinion. The authors measure it by the actions of the boss(no crouching animation) or the observed effects of it's attacks(a single move that takes off a large chunk of the life meter). If we counted every thing that could be(or had to be) personally verified, we'd have to remove every single movie, book, or video game-related article, and that's just for starters. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESAMAS_7b35.html" title="User:SAMAS">SAMAS</a></li>

<li><b>Keep:</b> Methinks that, if it doesn't get deleted, it needs a better name, like merely SNK boss perhaps, and maybe cross-references with List of fighting game terms (which, admittedly, <i>also</i> needs some work, but still), and something clearer at the beginning which explains <i>why</i> this isn't just POV (i.e. the fact that there are several specific "factors" that contribute to the "syndrome"). Admittedly, I suppose there could be some debate as to how many factors you need for it to qualify for an "SNK boss", and yes it <i>does</i> need work to keep it from becoming POV, but for that and the reasons stated above (by people who have demonstrably <i>read</i> the article), I say we keep it. --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYar_Kramer_d20f.html" title="User:Yar Kramer">Yar Kramer</a> 05:09, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
