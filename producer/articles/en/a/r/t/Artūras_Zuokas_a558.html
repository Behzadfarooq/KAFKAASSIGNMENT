<p>Zuokas was one of the campaign managers for <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Union_of_Lithuania_7667.html" title="Liberal Union of Lithuania">Liberal Union of Lithuania</a> in the 2000 <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seimas.html" title="Seimas">Seimas</a> elections. His party placed the second and won 36 seats. It formed an alliance with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Union_%28Socialliberals%29_8193.html" title="New Union (Socialliberals)">New Union (Socialliberals)</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolandas_Paksas_f880.html" title="Rolandas Paksas">Rolandas Paksas</a>, the leader of the Liberal Union and <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_city_municipality.html" title="Vilnius city municipality">Vilnius city municipality</a> mayor, became the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Lithuania_77b7.html" title="Prime Minister of Lithuania">Prime Minister</a>. There were two candidates to fill in the vacant mayor post: vice-mayor Algirdas Kudzys, and Zuokas, both members of the Liberal Union. There were doubts if Zuokas should become the mayor as he was very young, inexperienced in politics (he was elected to the council just in Spring 2000), and as a businessman he had strong personal interests (for example, he owned a private company in <a href="../../../u/%C5%BE/u/U%C5%BEupis.html" title="Užupis">Užupis</a> and some were afraid that he might spend the city funds to reconstruct this district). However, on November 15, 2000, the council voted 27-18 to make Zuokas, at age 32, the youngest mayor in the history of Vilnius.</p>

<p>Zuokas soon earned the reputation of an energetic and innovative leader. As early as 2000 he unveiled some of his construction ideas. The populace received them as yet another collection of political promises and fantasies; however, a number of those projects have since been completed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mindaugas Bridge over the <a href="../../../n/e/r/Neris_River_cb79.html" title="Neris River">Neris River</a> was completed for the 750th anniversary of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mindaugas.html" title="Mindaugas">Mindaugas</a> coronation in 2003. It was contemplated as part of effort to reconstruct <a href="../../../%C5%BE/a/l/%C5%BDalgiris_Stadium_46b9.html" title="Žalgiris Stadium">Žalgiris Stadium</a>, Žalgiris swimming pool, and Vilnius Concert and Sport Palace in <a href="../../../%C5%BE/i/r/%C5%BDirm%C5%ABnai.html" title="Žirmūnai">Žirmūnai</a>. However, those projects are still in progress.</li>
<li>The reconstruction of <a href="../../../g/e/d/Gediminas_Avenue_c831.html" title="Gediminas Avenue">Gediminas Avenue</a> is almost complete. An underground parking lot under the Municipality Square has been opened.</li>
<li>A two-level crossing was built to ease traffic jams for Pilaitė residents.</li>
<li>A new municipal building was opened on the right bank of the Neris River. Zuokas revitalized and supported Rolandas Paksas' idea to build a new commercial center in <a href="../../../%C5%A1/n/i/%C5%A0nipi%C5%A1k%C4%97s.html" title="Šnipiškės">Šnipiškės</a>. The new building was just a first step. It has been joined by the new <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europa_Tower_30ce.html" title="Europa Tower">Europa Tower</a> and shopping center. Construction was funded by selling old administrative buildings scattered around the city.</li>
<li>Construction of the Constitution Avenue is complete.</li>
<li>Užupis and Malūnai Streets in <a href="../../../u/%C5%BE/u/U%C5%BEupis.html" title="Užupis">Užupis</a> district were reconstructed and water supply pipes were replaced. This was justified by the claim that those two streets are most popular among tourists. However, Zuokas’ house as well as his company are both located on Užupis Street.</li>

<p>Zuokas is also sometimes credited for attracting substantial investments into Vilnius. Zuokas has made an effort to market Vilnius at various international exhibitions. He personally attended many meetings with <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_direct_investment.html" title="Foreign direct investment">foreign investors</a>. Zuokas speaks several foreign languages and, being himself a businessman, understands business needs well. Also, bureaucratic obstacles to construction have been reduced. In the past few years <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius.html" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> has seen the construction and reconstruction of numerous hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, and residential dwellings.</p>
<p>Zuokas is known for his tourist-orientated initiatives. For example, all <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxicab.html" title="Taxicab">taxicabs</a> are now required to be painted in yellow and be not older than 12 years, requirements which faced fierce resistance from taxi drivers. Vilnius city municipality now also maintains a large number of informational maps and signs across the city. He also launched a marketing campaign targeted to the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Sea_a4f2.html" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> region to attract more tourists to Vilnius.</p>
<p>In Spring 2001, Vilnius city municipality unveiled a new www.vilnius.lt portal. It was one of the first <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_site.html" title="Internet site">Internet sites</a> operated by a local government in Lithuania. The site is interactive, and a new position of "e-vice mayor" was created to deal with e-mails from the residents. Another concept was to set up a camera in the mayor's office so that people could watch, but not hear his work live over the Internet. However, this concept was soon abandoned.</p>

<p>Several construction proposals have either not started or have been cancelled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zuokas strongly backed an proposal to build a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf_course.html" title="Golf course">golf course</a>. A location was found in Pilaitė, but the community protested because the course would destroy a popular recreation area. Also, the course was in part in a protected area and <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmentalist.html" title="Environmentalist">environmentalists</a> joined the protest, and the plans were cancelled.out.</li>
<li>Zuokas proposed to build several <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tramway.html" title="Tramway">tramway</a> lines to ease traffic and improve public transportation. However, many doubt if Vilnius really needs it, as the construction would take many years if not decades. It might even increase traffic congestion, as streets would need to become narrower to accommodate the trams. Besides, Vilnius right now has a well-developed <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_transportation.html" title="Public transportation">public transportation</a> system. Critics argue that the money could be used instead to buy new buses and <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolleybus.html" title="Trolleybus">trolleybuses</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Zuokas has made headlines for a number of smaller ideas. For example, he sent out letters to major news services such as <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>, <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>, and <a href="../../../i/t/n/ITN_c367.html" title="ITN">ITN</a>, asking them to include Vilnius in their <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weather_maps.html" title="Weather maps">weather maps</a>. Another idea was to change wooden doors to glass in the municipality so that people could peek in on what bureaucrats are doing. It was an extension of his "transparency" campaign. However, it was not very successful; reportedly, a few months later most doors were covered with posters.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>One of the most controversial and unsuccessful ideas was orange-colored bicycles that anyone could use free of charge. In June 2001, about 400 bicycles were brought to the streets of the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius_Old_Town_7f6b.html" title="Vilnius Old Town">Vilnius Old Town</a>. Hopes were that it would promote a healthy lifestyle, add a little flavor to Vilnius, and reduce traffic congestion in the narrow Old Town streets. However, most bicycles were either irreparably damaged or stolen within a couple of days.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art%C5%ABras_Zuokas_a558.html" title="Edit section: Municipality debts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Municipality debts</span></h2>
<p>Zuokas inherited a municipality with huge debts, reaching up to 420 million <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_litas.html" title="Lithuanian litas">litas</a> (approximately 120 million <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">euros</a>), and a great many bureaucrats. An audit of the municipality presented to the city council declared that the structure is bloated and ineffective. Zuokas announced that he would cut 20% of the administrative staff over a two-year period. Approximately 80 million of the debt was collected <a href="../../../i/n/c/Income_tax.html" title="Income tax">income tax</a> owned to the central government. By July 2001, this debt reached about 110 million. However, central government was also in debt to Vilnius city municipality. In September 2001, this debt had reached 30 million. In addition, in 1994 the central government had increased wages to schoolteachers, but did not provide any additional funds to the municipality. The municipality therefore sued the government for the 120 million litas cost of these increases, the first time a local government had sued the central government in Lithuania.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In March 2001, the city council decided to sell off assets of the municipality to cover its debts. At first it was doubted if privatization to cover debts was legal<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Vilnius Cinema Theater was the first property sold; it was transformed to a <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benetton.html" title="Benetton">Benetton</a> store. Lietuva Cinema Theater was also sold, with an obligation on the buyer to maintain its function for three years. After this term expired, the artist and student community protested against the new owner's plans to build an apartment building. Lietuva, once the biggest cinema theater in Vilnius, was known for supporting non-commercial cinema, organizing <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_festival.html" title="Film festival">film festivals</a>, and being an important part of Vilnius culture. However, in September 2005 Lietuva was closed.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>By early second quarter of 2001, about 6 months after he became mayor, Zuokas ranked as the 11th most popular politician in <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> He had taken advantage of various public events, participated and organized various charity events, and became a prominent public figure, both politically and culturally. In September 2001 he was recognized by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Chirac_001d.html" title="Jacques Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> for developing relationship between France and Lithuania.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the third quarter of 2001, Zuokas got involved in the first large scandal. <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>-based <i><a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalkia.html" title="Dalkia">Dalkia</a></i> placed a winning privatization bid for <i>Vilniaus šilumos tinklai</i>, the company that provides heat for a majority of Vilnius houses. Zuokas obtained and forwarded to authorities audio recordings of what he called threats and blackmail Dalkia to stop negotiations with the municipality. Allegedly, recordings also mentioned that Zuokas could be overthrown. However, authorities declared that these recordings are insufficient, incoherent, and did not initiate legal proceedings.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
