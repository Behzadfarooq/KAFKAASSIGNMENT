<p>James Marcinkowski was an unsuccessful candidate for Michigan's 8th congressional district. As per <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a>, it is preferable for articles created for congressional campaigns to be removed and included under an article about the campaign, which has been created at <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_8th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006.html" title="Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006">Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006</a>. Contents of the Marcinkowski article have been copied to the destination article for future revising. The debate is whether Marcinkowski represents a notable person in his own right, outside of the congressional race, as per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> guidelines. It should be noted that <strike>Marcinkowski did not have an article until his run for Congress, and that</strike> the majority of the article's content comes from his Congressional campaign. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffness_f8de.html" title="User:Jeffness">Jeff</a> 23:22, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: the statement that "Marcinkowski did not have an article until his run for Congress" is false, as I noted below.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Marcinkowski had a bio page up before he announced his run for Congress. As you can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michigan_8th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006&amp;diff=20508981&amp;oldid=20508370" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michigan_8th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006&amp;diff=20508981&amp;oldid=20508370" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it was active in 2005 (though barely a stub). Unfortunately someone moved the page without consensus to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_8th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006.html" title="Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006">Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006</a> instead of AfDing it first, so the link I gave has the wrong page title. In any case, Marcinkowski was known for his work with the CIA and for his outspoken response to the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plame_affair.html" title="Plame affair">Plame affair</a>. He testified about it to the Senate well before his unsuccessful congressional run. Prior to that, he was known for prosecuting suicide <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Kevorkian_c2f9.html" title="Dr. Kevorkian">Dr. Kevorkian</a> when he was a prosecutor in Michigan. He may not be the most well-known person to ever run for Congress, but he is not an unknown, and his congressional run was not the only reason he was considered notable enough for a BLP. His testimony to the Senate committee is <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?pid=7948" class="external text" title="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?pid=7948" rel="nofollow">here</a>; David Corn called it "perhaps the most powerful rebuttal of and rebuke" of the testimony that day; the testimony is quoted in numerous places, including Todd Gitlin's book The Intellectuals and the Flag excerpted in The American Prospect.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 00:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If a person is only included because of one event, and the only thing worth writing about them is in relation to that one event, it's logical to redirect their name to that one event. The question of whether this guy has notability <i>other</i> than the election is a content dispute, and not an issue that needs to be brought to AFD. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 07:41, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The question of whether this guy has notability</i> other <i>than the election is a content dispute, and not an issue that needs to be brought to AFD.</i> Odd, I thought that the point of AfDs was to determine notability, and that "content dispute" occurs when editors agree on notability but disagree on wording. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 14:13, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nevertheless, I agree that simply moving the article was a bad idea. An article about an election needs a fundamentally different structure from a biography and we'd be better off with a decent article written from scratch to cover the election (or just a paragraph in the page on the district). This is really a mess. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">User:John Broughton</a>'s move has made things way screwy. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 07:46, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, the article on the campaign - <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_8th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006.html" title="Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006">Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006</a> specifically says <i>the information below [which is about Marcinkowski] will be edited down and will become part of a full article about this race</i>. My intent is to turn that draft into a decent article - in fact, I'm setting up a wikiproject to recruit editors for this and a number of other races. While I'd love to be able to instantly create a complete article for the Michigan 8th race, I'm putting most of my efforts into the wikiproject, which hopefully will result in almost 100 good articles about House races in 2006.

<dd>I hope you won't use the same methods to create the rest of the articles; these moves just lead to a mess. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 18:00, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did 15 or so of these moves, trying to be judicious - almost all the articles were short and the candidates clearly non-notable. This one was probably the longest and the most "on the cusp"; with hindsight, I probably wouldn't have done what I did, despite <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">WP:BB</a>. I do note that no one has objected to any of the other moves, as far as I know. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 21:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And my move didn't make things "way screwy" - what made things "screwy" was the copy/paste done by Commodore Sloat; he could have just done a move to put the article back where it was. Or he could have asked me about my move, and I could have told him him how to reverse it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 14:13, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The more I look at this the worse it gets. The election article needs to be moved back to the guy's name to restore the history.
