<p>"Sacred Heart School" gets ~85,000 google hits. It's gonna take an amazing disambiguation page to straighten them all out some day.

<li><b>Delete or speedy delete</b>: It's a perfect criterion #1 speedy delete, in my opinion, as a predicate nominative is not an article. At present, this is an answer, a Yellow Pages entry. Further, the article is wildly misnamed. Further, there is nothing here to explain what is unique (other than the address) about it. All the school harpists can go back to sleep, since I know none will actually do some work to affect the improvement, and save your energies for an actual <i>article</i> on a school listed on VfD. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:52, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Geogre, poppet-me-pet, could you please indulge me? HOw could an article called Sacred Heart School, written about a school called coincidentally Sacred Heart School, possibly be described as "wildly misnamed"? What name would satisfy you? Wild Hogmistress of the Deeps of the Western Frond Marshes? I'm sorry but I cannot imagine an occasion on which I would regard "Sacred Heart School" as an inappropriate name for an article about a school of that name--I hope you're not joining those advancing lack of disambiguation as a reason for deletion of an article.</li>
<li>And then there the other falsehoods you pile on this. You tell us that the article is "a Yellow Pages entry". Well so what? You claim that it's a CSD 1, no it isn't. "No meaningful content or history, text completely meaningless or unsalvageably incoherent (e.g., random characters)". The article is an excellent stub because it's useful, it informs someone who didn't know (I didn't) that there exists a school in Halifax, Nova Scotia, called The Sacred Heart, it's a mixed sex, multiple-age school and the current Canadian leader of the Sacred Heart Society is an alumna. This is not a CSD1 and the fact that you blatantly assert falsehoods in proposing its deletion does not help the case. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:13, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>One has to wonder why you so desperately wish to obscure the anchor tag however. It makes it appear that you wish for someone to read your rationale and, not clicking the link, believe that <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments</a> shows why this school should be deleted, when, in fact, it shows both sides of the argument. Surely, that is not what you intend but it is how it appears. I agree, btw, that those in favour should anchor their link as well. Perhaps the arguments page should be split into 2 sub-pages. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 15:58, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't think it would be a good idea to split up the arguments just because Aaron is engaging in abusive and dishonest editing. Let's leave him to it and refuse to let his disgraceful behavior influence the disposition of the page, which is currently perfectly fine. If someone were to transform the headings into unanchored bolds, however, I would not oppose this. This would cause all links to go to the page, in the absence of "#Keep" and "#Delete" anchors. Aaron was not the first person to engage in abusive linking to that page. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:33, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
