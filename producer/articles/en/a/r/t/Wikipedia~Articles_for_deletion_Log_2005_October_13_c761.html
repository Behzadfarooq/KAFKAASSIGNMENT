<li><b>Keep</b> As the article makes clear, it's just become a very important dispute in the world of cricket politics.

<li>I didn't see any comments to that effect in IRC; granted, I was busy quibbling over the merits of assault rifles at the time. If this is the only relevant fact and preparation won't begin for years yet, why is this not a minor mention in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_World_Cup_0976.html" title="Cricket World Cup">Cricket World Cup</a>?

<li><b>Keep</b> I have pruned the most speculative parts of the article. What remains would be hard to source, as it is undoubtedly common knowledge in cricketing circles. I would recommend the addition of a source for "it came to the media's attention that the Asian nations, led by India may put in a bid that almost certainly would be able to outvote Australia's claim instead". While this is certainly true, it would help to have a source. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 21:27, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unless I'm mistaken, the representation of a number's digits in base 10 has rather little to do with any mathematically interesting (i.e. notable) properties it might have.

<li>666 isn't an apt comparison though, seeing as it's famous as the "number of the beast", and not just the fact that it's three 6's in a row. 9814072356 lays no claim to cultural significance, so it needs to be judged on how interesting it is mathematically. My point, I suppose, is that this article makes no claim to mathematical notability. It just points out a quirk of the way we write the number in base 10 - which is only one of many ways to write it. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowersofnight_dd24.html" title="User:Flowersofnight">flowersofnight</a> 03:51, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I seriously doubt that the GFDL requires a redirect in this case since mathematical facts are not copyrightable. Only a weak delete since the number is apparently listed in some other books. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 15:06, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The best guide to notability, be it of people, companies, software, products, or web sites, is whether <i>other people</i>, independent of the subject itself, have considered the subject to be notable. The litmus test for that, outlined to greater or lesser extent in <i>all</i> of our various notability criteria (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and so forth) is whether the subject has been written about in <i>multiple separate published works that whose sources are independent of the subject xyrself</i>. (WP:BIO talks about press coverage and independent biographies. WP:WEB talks about media attention. WP:CORP uses the broad term of published works, and is explicit about excluding self-promotion.)
<p>Furthermore, as <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> says, it is a disservice to AFD and to the encyclopaedia as a whole to apply criteria erratically and inconsistently. It is <i>wrong</i> to hold the Wikimedia Foundation, its board members, and its web sites to standards that are different to the standards to which one holds other companies, people, and web sites.</p>
<p>It is also wrong to argue that "If Tim Shell isn't notable then neither is Angela Beesley.". The two are very different cases, as research shows. Researching this person, I find that <i>unlike Tim Shell</i> Angela <i>is</i> the subject of multiple works published by people independent of Angela, Wikia, Wikipedia, or the Wikimedia Foundation. Angela is quoted in reports, and conference sessions given by her are published and commented upon.</p>
<p>As such, <i>unlike Tim Shell</i> Angela <i>does</i> satisfy the criteria for notability. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:14, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Move:</b> I've noticed these pages popping up too and I found out where they're comming from. These articles all talk about a particular campsite at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philmont_Scout_Ranch_d3bb.html" title="Philmont Scout Ranch">Philmont Scout Ranch</a> in New Mexico. The reason why they are all popping up is that the Philmont article has a link created for each campsite. It seems to me that these articles are notable for anyone looking at the Philmont page, but are not very notable to Wikipedia as a whole. I proposed in the discussion page that these articles be moved into subpages under the main Philmont article (<i>If you want to debate this issue, go to the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Talk%7EPhilmont_Scout_Ranch_f94b.html" title="Talk:Philmont Scout Ranch">discussion page</a></i>).

<li><b>Passionate Keep</b> This article, although small in scope, is quite factual and informative. Specific Organizations DO make it in this encyclopedia, and such entries are extremely resourceful. It is not trivial, it has a local impact. It is noteworthy, for if one is not impacted locally, such an article like this is necessary to learn about it.

<li>That's fine, but this article is definitely NN. I mean, if the C.L. of T. had started the political career of America's first Libertarian president, that would be one thing. But this group is really really trivial. I don't mean to belittle its accomplishments, but it's a small club in a small college for a very small political party.

<li><b>Response</b> I would agree you have a valid point. I think the charge, then, would be to show the impact and discussion about this organization, and I think substantial commentary, even if local, is enough to make the entry notable. If there is discussion and secondary work about this group, then that should be enough to reference it and make the topic available to people that would not be familiar with the topic. Instead of famous being the standard for noteworthy, this is my understanding of the criteria. So I guess it would be famous on a very small scale. This protects against arbitrary judgements of triviality and size. <b>Keep, Revise</b> --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalecasta_ddbb.html" title="User:Malecasta">Malecasta</a> 06:03, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Nice effort, Malecasta, but there is ample precedent that college groups are not retained around here unless they are <i>exceptionally</i> noteworthy.

<li><b>Keep</b>. To say that the CLT isn’t making an impact on campus is an unfair characterization. Perhaps the impact is relatively small, but it's definitely existent. We have several events lined up, and we will be planning more next semester. In fact, I just got through a planning meeting for the Marriage Equality event referenced on the article, which will be held on Valentine's Day next semester. We're reserving an entire field on campus for this event; we're scheduling speakers; we're creating a petition to legalise gay marriage in Maryland just for this event. One can hardly say there's no impact. As for the comments about the college being small, from what I’ve heard, this (i.e. Towson University) is the second largest college in Maryland. I believe University of Maryland is the only one larger. As for vanity, that's perhaps a fair claim, as I didn't bother creating any article for the other groups on campus. But this is because I know more about the CLT and its history than I know of the other groups. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllixpeeke_4511.html" title="User:Allixpeeke">Allixpeeke</a> 03:47, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I totally agree with this, but it has been suggested that college organizations, by precedent, should not be published unless their impact is exceptionally noteworthy (see Xoloz). I personally disagree with this policy, if it does exist, and I see hundreds of reasons why it should be <b>Kept</b> and <b>Revised.</b> I am very weary of something being deleted because someone thinks it is insignifcant, and I've tried to give a correct interpretation of the Noteworthy policy above. I strongly believe if there is secondary discussion of any kind about the organization, no matter how small or local, it should be kept. This consensus, no matter how small, should ALWAYS override the arbritrary judgements of some, and even a majority, that the article is trivial and not important. Otherwise, a lot would not be in this encyclepida because of the prejudiced and provincial views of some (or most) people against many topics. The only consideration here that has been convincing to me is the Precedent of how the encyclopedia has handled these issues in the past. I think that's a fair standard to apply here, but I will modify this to say I do not believe the precedent is right and perhaps the precendent should be ignored because it is wrong and not in good spirit. I think people are concerned about vanity and advertising, and there is no reason that cannot be addressed through <b>REVISION</b>. I would hate to see this article go on account of "delete-hawking," deleting for the sake of the good of the encyclopedia on very simple grounds. This article, obviously, deserves a broader consideration. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalecasta_ddbb.html" title="User:Malecasta">Malecasta</a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalecasta_d93c.html" title="User talk:Malecasta">talk</a>)</sup> 03:57, 2005 Oct 15 (UTC)

<li><b>Clarification</b> Definately, the "upcoming events" section should go, go, go. I am not urging this page be kept for self-promotion. This should be a topic about this orgainization.

<li><b>Comment</b> I removed all self-promotion references, and I removed the Constitution because it can be found in an external link. I believe the vanity issues have been addressed. The article, as it appears now, is a factual entry about the Organization, which should probably be expanded upon to further demonstrate the topic's significance. Finally, the initial reason for deletion was that the page was "not noteworthy." Not being noteworthy is not a major criteria for deletion, and a factual topic about anything, should be signifiant. This article should be expanded to further show its significance and secondary discussion. Of course, I refer to the previous comments I have already made about deletion for not being noteworthy. I believe a factual entry that shows an organization of relevance and significance exists here, and it can be developed. I think the concerns in the reason for deletion have been addressed or greatly mitigated.<b>Keep, Revise, Expand</b> --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalecasta_ddbb.html" title="User:Malecasta">Malecasta</a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalecasta_d93c.html" title="User talk:Malecasta">talk</a>)</sup> 04:33, 2005 Oct 15 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move:</b> I've noticed these pages popping up too and I found out where they're comming from. These articles all talk about a particular campsite at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philmont_Scout_Ranch_d3bb.html" title="Philmont Scout Ranch">Philmont Scout Ranch</a> in New Mexico. The reason why they are all popping up is that the Philmont article has a link created for each campsite. It seems to me that these articles are notable for anyone looking at the Philmont page, but are not very notable to Wikipedia as a whole. I proposed in the discussion page that these articles be moved into subpages under the main Philmont article (<i>If you want to debate this issue, go to the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Talk%7EPhilmont_Scout_Ranch_f94b.html" title="Talk:Philmont Scout Ranch">discussion page</a></i>).

<p><b>Keep and expand</b> - the sales technique it's talking about is certainly real. It's not the best article it could be, but this is an amateur encyclopaedia after all. If someone wants to take a crack at cleaning them up, sources for usage of the term can easily be found with a Google for 'foot in the door "sales technique" ' or similar.

<dd>I agree that the article is much improved, but I still have my concerns. My initial reaction was, <i>but this still sounds like Original Research to me, and I'd like to see some references</i>, when I notice the link at the bottom of the page and followed it. I'm not sure how to react to the linked article, however. The first part of it is a very reasonable explanation of the technique, but near the end, it turns into a <i>demonstration</i> of the technique; the article is not really about a sales technique, it's a religious sermon, but the fact that it is indeed a sermon is hidden until the very end, by which time the reader is hooked on reading the article. I'd be much more inclined to vote to keep the wikipedia article if you could find some other external references to cite and ditch the sermon. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 13:53, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It's pretty detailed, and directly addresses the issue in a way that the first reference didn't. Frankly, since it's been verified that the term exists, I agree that more and better references would be 'nice', but don't think they're essential to keep the article on WP. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 15:57, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm ashamed to say I only just read the article all the way through and saw the bit about Billy Graham. Guess that shows 2 things: a) FITD doesn't always work and b) I should read articles all the way through before referencing them. Good thing it wasn't about the miracle of Goatse&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last "Foot-in-the-mouth" Malthusian</a> 16:01, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>While I'm at it, I do think the original reference is rather cute and should stay in; the fact that it's a demonstration of the technique makes it quite an interesting external link, even if it shouldn't be the sole reference. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 16:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You should add this new reference, and I still think the sermon citation should be removed, but in any case I agree that with the rewrite it should be kept. It might also make sense to move it to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_in_the_door.html" title="Foot in the door">Foot in the door</a>, or at least make that a redirect to here. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 16:56, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Done. And I've kept the sermon, but changed the text of the link to 'An example of foot in the door technique'. I know it's a bit dodgy, especially as the irony of an article about foot-in-the-doormanship being a 'foot-in-the-door' to talking about Jesus is apparently unintentional (look at the other articles on the website). But Wikipedia isn't a scholarly work, and I think we can have the odd idiosyncratic external link. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 18:59, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Also i came across to the article because it was linked from one of the psych articles, and I thought it was a shame that there was actually nothing there!

<li>My old vote confused some people. straight up <b>Delete</b> -- not worth noting because there are thousands of bands who shared the same fate.

<p><b>Do Not Delete.</b> Come on people, this is totally not fair. I know of this band (having been into this typw of music when younger). They are totally legit. They were a music scene phenom in the mid-1990s among the LI Hardcore cult outside of New York City. Just becuase there is vulgarity in the title (which many bands have, I can refer you to many others) doesn't mean it should automatically be detected. What do you want them to do? Edit history and change the name of the band? I can't say that I agree with the presentation of the article (in terms of boosting the band), but hey, I've seen much worse on Wikipedia in terms of promoting the band rather than being objective. I will be looking for back-up cites, but in the meantime: Please Do Not Erase. I thought it was nice that something like this about long-dead local music appeared on Wikipedia... as it adds credence to the idea that the internet can be a source for finsing information about subjects that the mainstream media cannot deal with.

<p><b>Keep and Categorize</b>. I am the author of this page. Human Shit is the band's name. It was real band. They played between 1994 and 1995 just outside of New York City. Some say there will be a reunion. I don't know what more I can say. To those of you who know nothing about this subject (Mr. Kilgore below excluded from this category), don't make recommendations you cannot support intelligently!!! If it is non-importnant to you, it may be importnant to someone else. If it is considered vulgar by you, I would direct you to the entry for <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> which is much more vulgar and intelligently classified on Wikipedia. Do not delete. It should be categorized under Heavy Metal, Music.</p>

<li><i>Comment</i> I have no problem with the band's name. I have no problem with it being an heavy metal band. I do not find the name agreessive (although that is propbably the band's intention and they'd be sad to read this...). Plus I like heavy metal and went to some very minor underground band's concerts, so I don't think the subject is non-important. The article's tone is no reason to delete but to cleanup. It was nominated for none of these reasons.<br />
The main issue is «only released one indie album». That is a little short for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines</a>. Show up something fitting one of those criteria, or even a little short of that (one good shot is telling for which label they recorded), and I'll be glad to change my nomination. <a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 20:14, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>To Nabla: Listen Mr. Smarty Pants. Yes, you figured that the two entry's above came from the same computer. Very good for you. As it turns out, one of my colleagues here at work (I'm a newspaper editor, not merely some online know-it-all critic) knows of the band from way back then. So, he wrote the entry from the same computer. Big Whoop-te-do. It is a part of local history. And (I feel the need to repeat), it is history. This is why my friend was gracious enough to include his name and e-mail address. I keep seeing these "delete" directives from people with profiles indicating they are from the mid-west and even Australia. Let me ask you: Who are you to determine what is history and what is not. I'll be looking for supporting links, but you know what, it's not too easy. I have a CD sitting at home that tells me the band is history, and that's all I need to feel vindicated. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Delete, &amp; redirect to No 4th Wall to Break, non-notable</b>... I hesitate to do this, because I am actually a fan of this artist's work... however, as the article for this artist's comic Built for Comfort was deleted as non-notable, and as this artist's biography is available at <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia</a>, I find this article to be unnecessary. The best option is to delete and redirect to No 4th Wall to Break, I believe</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Humph, here we go again! The thing is now, how do you decide whether a person is notable?

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Indeed. Mind you a google search for "Lucas Teodoro da Silva" reveals three pages of hits about no one but me. The first 2 searches on "lucastds" hit sources about me, and a search for "tedzsee" gives 6 pages of google entries about me. The thing is: <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosa_Parks_bff2.html" title="Rosa Parks">Rosa Parks</a> is notable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._20a6.html" title="Martin Luther King Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> is notable. Lucas TdS? Probably no more than you. And I think, until such time as your comic appears in this encyclopedia, the biography probably doesn't warrant a space here either. Now, I was one of those who staunchly defended the notability of said comic, but even so, I was uncomfortable with the idea of the bio appearing here. The precident is that webcartoonists usually don't have bios in this encyclopedia. Even the entry for <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Gurewitch_d756.html" title="Nicholas Gurewitch">Nicholas Gurewitch</a> simply redirects to his comic (ie. he doesn't warrant a seperate entry because it is his COMIC that is notable, not him). I dunno. That's why I thought a redirect would be more appropriate. You can always post the bio on your <a href="../../../h/i/j/User%7EHijamiefans_b84c.html" title="User:Hijamiefans">userpage</a>, as most wikipedians do. --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 20:21, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this article is a kind of self promotion or some joke. I´m really into bodyboarding since the 80´s and I´ve never heard about this lad. Also, he seems to be only 15 now. Nothing makes him worth of a page in Wikipedia, since he has NO encyclopaedic value. I think this article should be forever removed. By the way he spoke utter lies. He claimed to have invented the 720 air reverse, when José Otávio from Brazil had it caught on tape a lot before this Gaica claims. Also Jeff Hubbard have done it before. This guy also seems to be vandalizing the Boadyboarding page to promote himself. A search in google returns nothing for him either. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 13:59, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wether it is, to a large majority I'm sure, seemingly irrelevant and unverifiable we have to remember that this website has articles relating to eveything from abstract theories of information theory to videogame entries. If an article on Space invaders is relevant enough to warrant keeping then why does an article displaying some new conotations of english need to be deleted so quickly?

<li><b>KEEP IT!</b> Considering the difficulty in fitting in at school it's important to be able to be part of the crowd and not be a POTA or a too far kid. Besides the logical reasons for keeping the page, it's also a momento for years to come from Padua and documents the ever growing encyclopedia of Paduanisms.

<li>Well, giving Kappa the benefit of the doubt, it is possible sometimes for the <i>planning</i> for an event to meet the criteria of notability and verifiability even before an event occurs. However, anyone passingly familiar with Hollywood moviemaking realizes that those are plans so subject to change that they do <i>not</i> meet those criteria. By the time this movie gets made, <b>if</b> it ever actually gets made, it could easily have a different title, two different stars and be changed from a suspense thriller to a dark comedy. I would <i>like</i> to give Kappa the benefit of the doubt and think that he actually put some thought into this and just made a mistaken assumption, rather than that he put thought into "gee, what flimsy argument can I make to cover my reflexive vote of 'Keep'?" However, I've seen his record... -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:08, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>While I find that <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>'s penchant for inclusiveness often verges on the extreme, I find he usually musters an argument that should be taken seriously and is much more than just a cover for a knee-jerk keep vote.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article details an upcoming band who may not yet be known to everyone, but as stated in the article, this band is in fact a musical "<i>movement</i>", and although they have not yet released any albums (which you seem to believe is the only thing that quantifies a "band"), one is in fact in production (as stated in the article), on a small record label. Disregarding music because it does not fulfil your 'criteria' would be a shameful attempt to classify art. For example, the <b>Arctic Monkeys</b> last weekend played a sold-out gig to 2,000 people at the <b>Hammersmith Apollo</b>, although they, too haven't released an album.

Ultimately, I believed that gaining a clear consensus after the last AfD was the largest issue here, but since that attempt was apparently percieved as a ploy in the continuing Deletionist/Inclusionist nonsense, apparently my original goal is being ignored. Therefore, I've decided to discard that goal and go with my opinion on the article itself rather than the AfD. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 05:48, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To avoid misunderstandings, there's one thing I want to make crystal clear: I am <b>not</b> accusing you of any kind of ploys or deletionist nonsense. In fact, it's obvious to me that your intentions are honourable. My earlier remark concerned repeated AFDs against one article in general (an example that still gives me a bitter taste in my mouth is the case of Fyksland, which first survived two VFDs, then it was decided to merge and redirect Fyksian into it, and then it was killed in a third VFD after all). --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 09:15, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thanks for the clarification, Jan. I'm going to keep my vote, but i'm glad there's no hard feelings. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 16:54, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. In my opinion, an renewed AfD is way over the top if the only purpose is having the conclusion of a previous one reformulated, especially given the fact that the final result would be the same anyway. In your place, I would rather have contacted the administrator in question. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 09:54, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Then we agree to disagree, Jan. I reopened this vote largely because of the ambiguity that was caused by the admin who opened and closed this last time, <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a>. If I asked Ambi, that wouldn't help the other people(the reason how I found out about this article) that were somewhat perplexed at how the last AfD was closed, and she would have to repeat that task several times. That was probably a minor mistake since Ambi has a reputation as a great Wikipedian, so this is just to make sure what consensus is and to absolve her of any future problems from those ambiguities. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 15:39, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. If someone can show that the language created (<a href="../../../t/o/k/Toki_Pona_266a.html" title="Toki Pona">Toki Pona</a>) has made a few waves than its creator merits ancillary inclusion; disinterested secondary sources rather than blog entries count in this regard.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The notability of <a href="../../../t/o/k/Toki_Pona_266a.html" title="Toki Pona">Toki Pona</a> is beyond doubt. But does its creator therefore merit an article on her own by definition? Not necessarily, if you ask me. The "notability by proxy" mechanism could work if: a) the article about Toki Pona would get too long, or b) Kisa would be notable for other things as well. Now, I don't think any of those two is the case. Besides, the article in question doesn't add much to the phrase used in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Toki_Pona_266a.html" title="Toki Pona">Toki Pona</a> (created by the "Canadian translator and linguist Sonja Elen Kisa") anyway. Normally, I would therefore have voted "merge". But the article has already survived an earlier VfD, and I don't think it would be a good idea to constantly re-AfD articles until the deletionists get their way. So "keep". --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 09:54, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable fan-made (unauthorized/unlicensed) online game. It's one of many more-or-less interchangable "Build an army by paying us money or recruiting other players" online games, and doesn't, as far as I can tell, have any sort of news coverage or other impact.

<p>What exactly defines a game as non-notable? Whether authorized or not, the game has attracted almost 40 thousand users since it was put online 8 months ago, more than 16 thousand of which are still active in the game and/or the forums. The administrator of the game has constantly made updates to the game to please users, as well as improve gameplay. The administrator is currently developing the 4th version of the game, giving all users a gaming experience that they can look forward to on a daily basis. To call the game non-notable is arrogant and pompous, and the current article does a great job of defining the game's brief but storied history, as well as giving new users an idea of what they need to do to excel in the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost 40,000 user<i>names</i>, in a game where gaming the system to make false usernames for the referral bonus is rewarded? That's less than you'd think. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 00:43, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Cheaters who create double accounts are found and baned by Admin and Mods of StargateWars, many cheat fixes are implimented to prevent multi accounting. 40k players NOT 40k usernames. More players are joining every day and unactive accounts are deleted. Stargatewars is most popular Stargate game on all the web.</p>
<p>First of all, the game does give limited referral bonuses, but as it seems you haven't done more than give it a cursory glance you don't seem to realise that these bonuses are essentially useless for anyone trying to do even marginally well at the game. Link clicks from the referral links are limited to 50 per day, which in the grand scheme of things would count for about 1% of the growth a player can realise in a day through actual gameplay (i.e. nobody bothers with the link clicks anymore). Furthermore while there are bonuses for supporting the game people can play (and be quite successful at it) without paying a cent. In fact some top players have received supporter bonuses FOR FREE from the admin for their excellent gameplay. A few players known for their excessive donations have been singled out and targeted as the practice of donating to achieve rank is strongly frowned on. The game appears to be initially based on Kings of Chaos (which has it's own wiki) and expanded the concept to create a far richer more engrossing gaming experience. So it's non-notable why? Because there are no media articles on it? Much that is noteworthy fails to appear in the media and even more that is not noteworthy appears in the media with all too much frequency. Perhaps to you it's not, but to the stargate fans out there this game is noteworthy and considering that it is the longest running sci fi show in US history and second only to Doctor Who all time globally, I think that it's a testament to how Stargate has entered into various different facets of culture outside of television.--Freeside 07:13, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I quote: "Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports" - thus, why does an article need to be about media? I quote again, from the same source: "Subjects [people] of encyclopedia articles must have a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered by their friends and relatives." However: no where in that OFFICIAL article by the wikipedia admin does it say that non-human subjects need to be 'notable'. So there! <b>Keep or put yourself at the mercy of all Stargate nerds</b> And I am just about to add an external link to my own walkthrough guide; this article will act as a brief summary of the game, but not a walkthrough (whoever suggested it was). <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunterd_92e3.html" title="User:Hunterd">ZPMMaker</a> 08:38, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Are you <i>threating Wikipedia</i> in your vote? How absolutely silly.<br />
As for claims of notability, as a matter of practice all things need to assert notability, unless (and this a very controversial exception) that thing is an inherently notable thing (and online web-based games aren't even close). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 08:43, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>No, that was not a threat (what made you think it was?). Also, it does not say that it needs to be notable. If you know where it says it must, please point it out to us.<a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunterd_92e3.html" title="User:Hunterd">ZPMMaker</a> 11:15, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>As far as I can gather there are two main points supporting deletion. First that the game is unlicensed, hence not fully legal, and second that the game's popularity is deemed too limited to warrant inclusion. Correct me if I'm wrong. Now the first point is actually irrelevant. Something being authorized/sanctioned is not a pre requisite for relevance. I think you would agree after a moment of thought that unsanctioned/unauthorized work can often be equally or more relevant. So saying "Unofficial, unlicensed, and non-canon" is essentially moot. As for the second point, if using Kings of Chaos (KoC) as a metric, a comparison between the two shows that KoC has about 10 000 users online at this moment compared to about 500 for Stargate Wars (SGW). Now this indicates that SGW has about 5% of the usage that KoC has. This is notable. KoC has been around for almost 5 years whereas SGW has been around for a matter of months. In any other arena, say for example web browsers, Firefox developping a user base that was about 5-10% the size of IE was certainly considered notable. --Freeside 19:35, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unofficial, unlicensed, and non-canon is subject to "<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/features/articles/editorials/foxed.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.planetquake.com/features/articles/editorials/foxed.shtml" rel="nofollow">foxing</a>". Don't laugh-- <a href="../../../m/g/m/MGM_7545.html" title="MGM">MGM</a> has already <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/04/21/mgm_nastygrams_starg.html" class="external text" title="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/04/21/mgm_nastygrams_starg.html" rel="nofollow">gone after others</a> for similar. SGW is also charging money for support, which could be construed as the use of MGM's copyrighted material in order to turn a profit. You know, something which MGM's legal department wouldn't take too kindly to. A cease-and-desist means that the game would likely no longer exist, making the need for an article on a short-lived web-game "essentially moot." Hence, my objection.</dd>
<dd>Back to the current article, though: Your argument seems to basically be 'there isn't a huge userbase yet... but there might be someday! And then we'll be glad we had this article!' By that math, I could write up a web-game and have it online for five minutes... sure, it might have one user now, but if it lasts for five years like KoC, then there'll be 525 600 users! (I'd better get started with that article.)</dd>
<dd>As far as the Firefox analogy goes, it's apples-to-oranges. In the web-browser arena, IE has something like 90% marketshare; thus 5-10% is notable, as that makes it the second most popular browser. Stargate Wars is one in how many different web-games (each with how much share of the market)? <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlab_61a8.html" title="User:Slab">slab</a> 23:22, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, I happen to have a lot of respect for Tim, being a board member and such. And I don't believe much in the notability thing. But, Tim doesn't seem notable to me. His assertions to notability are being the Bomis CEO and being a Wikimedia board member. We should not make special exceptions for people who work with Wikimedia, this is bad. It seems like a huge self-reference to me. And, it uses information from the Wikimedia Foundation wiki. I feel this is original research because it's written by Wikimedia. I hope to soon become as notable as Tim Shell, and I would make a self-nomination for VFD if an article was written about me at the same level of notability. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac"><font color="red">Phroziac</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac"><font color="red">talk</font></a>)</sup><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Phyzech_Republic.svg_15ec.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_Phyzech_Republic.svg/25px-Flag_of_Phyzech_Republic.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Phyzech_Republic.svg_15ec.html" /></a> 01:38, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I don't think every CEO is notable; there needs to be auxillary reasons for notability (notable company, media coverage, etc.) Bomis fall just short of notability IMO, so I don't really see Mr. Shell as notable as a CEO. Board Membership does not confer notability in and of itself. I wonder if we would even be havign this discussion if Mr. Shell had no involvment in Wikipeida and was just a CEO of some random dotcom with a board membership on some other random project...--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:53, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>My own opinion regarding the value of this article has nothing to do with Bomis or Wikipedia. Any CEO and/or Board member of similar sized organizations should have an article. Tim Shell's relationship with Bomis and Wikipedia means he has an article <i>sooner</i> than other similar people. Please don't make comments that don't assume good faith on the part of people whose opinion is opposite your own. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 15:08, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

I simply don't agree with your contention that every CEO of a mid-sized company is notable. In my opinion that is extremely low bar to set for notability. That's just my 2 cents and you are certainly entitled to disagree with me.

<li>The best guide to notability, be it of people, companies, software, products, or web sites, is whether <i>other people</i>, independent of the subject itself, have considered the subject to be notable. The litmus test for that, outlined to greater or lesser extent in <i>all</i> of our various notability criteria (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and so forth) is whether the subject has been written about in <i>multiple separate published works that whose sources are independent of the subject xyrself</i>. (WP:BIO talks about press coverage and independent biographies. WP:WEB talks about media attention. WP:CORP uses the broad term of published works, and is explicit about excluding self-promotion.)
<p>Furthermore, as <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> says, it is a disservice to AFD and to the encyclopaedia as a whole to apply criteria erratically and inconsistently. It is <i>wrong</i> to hold the Wikimedia Foundation, its board members, and its web sites to standards that are different to the standards to which one holds other companies, people, and web sites.</p>
<p>Researching this person, I have yet to find anything published about him by someone independent of Bomis or the Wikimedia Foundation that isn't a straight one-sentence mention, as an aside, that parrots <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Board_of_Trustees" class="extiw" title="wikimedia:Board_of_Trustees">Wikimedia:Board of Trustees</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomis.html" title="Bomis">Bomis</a> (from the version before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bomis&amp;diff=20747585&amp;oldid=20307423" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bomis&amp;diff=20747585&amp;oldid=20307423" rel="nofollow">Jimbo Wales removed mention of Tim Shell from that article</a>), or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a>.

<p>Additionally, <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a>'s argument is wrong. Claiming that someone is notable within the group of users of a web site does not wash for Wikimedia board members and Wikmedia project editors any more than it washes when people assert that their BBS sysop is notable within the users of their BBS, or that a web discussion forum participant is notable within that discussion forum, even though unremarked upon elsewhere. <i>Other people</i>, independent of the subject, have to regard the subject as notable, and have to demonstrate the extent to which they find the subject notable by <i>creating and publishing works of their own</i> about it.</p>
<p>As such, this person does not satisfy the criteria for notability. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:55, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Perhaps I wasn't clear. I wasn't asserting that he was notable because he's notable within Wikipedia, I was asserting that, for the sake of smooth operation of Wikipedia as a website, it would be valuable to have articles on the board members. It's not that he's <i>notable</i> as such, it's that he's <i>notable enough within Wikipedia</i> that Wikipedians would have an easier time of it knowing who he is. Not that this article is that great, but it might get expanded. As you might have guessed from the weakness of my keep, I'm not entirely sold on this argument but it's stuck in my head and I cannot ignore it. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:30, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The place for the Wikimedia Foundation to publish articles on its board members is the foundation's own wiki. And that's where it <i>does</i> publish them. See the hyperlink given above.

<li>Note that in the same edit where Jimbo Wales removed mention of Tim Shell as "minority stakeholder", he also removed himself as "majority owner", so it's either a correction regarding ownership, or that in capacity as "minority stakeholder" he didn't think Tim Shell warranted a mention.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Lord Bob. For me, this is about user convenience. A user might want to know about the people who run this place, and WP seems like to a logical place to uncover such information. As I see it, it isn't about a <i>double standard</i> as much as <i>full disclosure</i> of what makes WP run. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:55, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Wikimedia Foundation <i>has its own wiki</i> for full disclosure, and the page where it publishes information about its board members is hyperlinked to above. We also have <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="m:Main_Page">Meta</a> for foundation-wide things. The main article namespace at Wikipedia is not the be-all and end-all. We should not be basing our judgements upon what meta-information about the foundation it might be handy to disclose, since that is a decision for the primary sources (e.g. what the foundation decides to disclose on its own web site about its board members), not the encyclopaedia. We should be basing our judgements upon whether this biographical article meets our <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographical articles</a>. It is not about full disclosure, and <i>is</i> about double standards. Your argument is employing the very double standard that we shouldn't be employing. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:06, 15 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have to disagree, Uncle G. While I was dimly aware that there other Wiki sources for this info, WP is the first place I (and I suspect most casual viewers) would look for this information. It needs to be here to be <i>easily</i> accessible, and I take <i>easy</i> accessibility to be part of <i>full</i> disclosure. Perhaps you didn't read what I wrote very carefully, but I knew my logic was endorsing a kind of double standard in the interest of this <i>easily</i> accessible, <i>full</i> disclosure. As with all policies, when there are conflicts of interest, one must decide which one believes to be more fundamental, and I take the view that administrative transparency mildly trumps or, at least, augments this case for, WP:BIO. In any event, either because you did not read carefully, or because I was unclear, I do feel your tone was unduly harsh. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:11, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You are arguing on the flawed basis that Wikipedia is, and should be, the primary source for information on the Wikimedia Foundation, to the world and to Wikipedians. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a primary source</a>, and, as I've already pointed out, there are other wikis for that. Those wikis exist for the very administrative transparency you are looking for. We aren't here to host and publish primary source material for the Wikimedia Foundation. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a hosting service</a> for the Wikimedia Foundation any more than it is a hosting service for anyone else. It's clear, from the existence of the Foundation's wiki, that the Foundation doesn't expect us to be its hosting service, either. As I said, whether to have this biographical article in Wikipedia is not a matter of administrative transparency and full disclosure, and <i>is</i> a matter of double standards. If we had this little information about an executive of <i>any other organization</i>, which was only available from the person's autobiography on that organization's own web site and not verifiable from an independent second source, the consensus to delete would very probably be unanimous. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:18, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"It is said that his birth was marked by earthquakes, tidal waves, tornadoes, firestorms, the explosion of three neighbouring stars, and, shortly afterwards, by the issuing of over six and three quarter million writs for damages from all of the major landowners in his Galactic sector. However, the only person by whom this is said is <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zaphod_Beeblebrox_11a1.html" title="Zaphod Beeblebrox">Beeblebrox</a> himself, and there are several possible theories to explain this." — <i><a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitch-Hiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_55f3.html" title="Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy">Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></i>, Fit The Ninth.
<p>Looking for multiple independent sources is just as much good encyclopaedism as it is good journalism. The problem with the source is not that it is external. It is that it is not independent of Tim Shell himself, and is tantamount to autobiography. As <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:autobiography</a> says, and as the preceding quotation implies, autobiographies have verifiability problems. Furthermore: They definitely cannot contribute towards notability. Self-promotion does not automatically make one notable. <i>Other people</i> have to regard the person as notable. See above. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:18, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll respond here to all your points, though some of my counterpoints will be brief. In the case of a Wikimedia board member, WPians are uniquely positioned to maintain a verifiability check on the content that is posted in these articles, as least as it relates to relevant professional details. <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zaphod_Beeblebrox_11a1.html" title="Zaphod Beeblebrox">Zaphod Beeblebrox</a>' autobio was not subject to Wiki revision; patently false claims are likely to be removed, given the dilligence and active interest of the community in its leaders.</li>

<dd>As for the rest, I simply <i>disagree</i> that I proceed from a false premise. Experience indicates to me, and the Keep votes here do also, that Wikimedia's board members are more likely to remain unknown if some provision is not made for their information to be listed in article space; if your concern for a double standard is not calmed by a faith in the ability of our board members to be reasonable (and to be overseen by the Wiki editing community), then -- by all means -- tag them with a special disputed tag, highlight them in a caution color, bemark in any appropriate way to suggest that they are different. In the final analysis, though, I find that their <i>special</i> status within the Wikimedia world creates a <i>special</i> need for WP articles. I make this finding based on a firm belief that their biographies should be transparent, and that -- without WP articles -- they are not sufficiently so. Feel free to disagree, but I find the suggestion that my analysis is "false" to be strangely positivistic. We aren't discussing a bare philosophical theorem. We are considering alternatives for the priorities of the WP. You value more the strict enforcement of a guideline; I, an interest in making our leaders' information very easily viewable to even the most casual user. No one has a "false premise"; these are simply competing values in tension, each value with its own merit to recommend it. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:54, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Exactly. <b>Speedy keep</b>. And by the way, can anyone explain to me why we <i>can't</i>, theoretically, have an article on <i>every</i> radio station? Right now the precedent includes most, but not all of them, and I'm not saying that that should necessarily be changed, but... we could, if the Wikipedia community agreed to it, indeed have an article on every radio station, right?

<ul>
<li>I don't object to keeping significant radio stations, I think there the ones that only have W and K call signs, but very small stations should be excluded. One source says there's 12,000 commercial radio stations in the U.S., so I suppose it's possible to include them all. However, the worldwide number is much higher, probably between 50,000 and 150,000. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 02:21, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right now, "very small stations" are defined by precedent as being no larger in scope than one city. And I'm not arguing that the precendent should change. Just pointing out the possibilities.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 04:29, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>So we need to drop all of the ones that begin with C in Canada where many have a large number of listeners in the US? Using only 2 of the beginning letters for call signs is not the way this wiki should work. It is not only about the US. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 05:37, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was talking about establishing notability for U.S. stations only, not criteria for other countries. I'm kind of stumped trying to figure out how it could have been interpreted otherwise. W and K only have meaning in the U.S. as far as I know, and it would be nonsensical to exclude radio stations from other countries on that basis. Anyway, the point was that, from looking at the FCC website, it looks like very small stations <b>in the U.S.</b> get call signs like NJ9AZ and the commercial/bigger stations in the U.S. get the four letter call signs that begin with W or K.
<ul>
<li>Random point: commercial radio stations aren't the only notable ones, I think. I think if a station is commercial, that is more of a guarantee that it will be notable, though. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 15:22, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, that criteria may be too inclusive. 12,000 radio stations is a lot and if the stations in the rest of the world are judged by similar criteria, relevant to the country it's in, it will be a lot of stations. If there's only 50,000 stations in the world that would meet the criteria, it would be 6% of the total pages we currently have in Wikipedia (19% if it's 150,000). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:37, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe we could create something like <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for radio stations? --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 15:22, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sounds like a good idea. I think the current, informal criteria is whether is notable outside the area, but that doesn't make much sense to me. In mountainous areas, signals don't travel very far and if you can't hear the station, how would it become notable? Even the coastal range here in California (2 to 3 thousand feet where I live) severely limits the range of local stations. I also think that there could be non-commercial stations that are notable, although I think the big ones still get the W and K call signs and that the 12,000 number includes even small commercial stations. (I'm not saying that any station without them is non-notable, though). I'll look into developing criteria. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 08:56, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
