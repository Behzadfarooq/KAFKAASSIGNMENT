<p>GASHITE is a game played on a pool table with the que ball and the eightball.There is no player limite but requires at least two. The creator of the game is unknown. Gashite is played much like horse but the word shite is used as an alternative. The first player starts with the eight ball stopped on the opposite side of the table. He then rolls the ball with his hand into the eight ball. He has three tries untill he gets a letter.If he hits the ball the next player must then grab the que ball run to one of the shorter sides of the pool court and roll it into the eight ball before the eight ball stops.This continues until a player shoots the eight ball into a pocket which means the next player recieves a letter.If the que ball rolls into a pocket this means nothing.Once a player has enough letters to spell SHITE they are out. The last player wins.During the game a player must keep both feet on the floor and when the que ball is thrown it must go foward or the player is disqualified.</p>

<p>This is a must read for every person coming from the former Yugoslavia. The book with the most accuracy describes the life of people from the 15th century up to the first world war. The writer Ivo Andric shows the reader the interaction of the ottoman turks with the serbs and croatian serfs. From reading the book one is able to see how the past has affected the recent civil wars on the balkan peninsula. <i>"The Bridge on the Drina"'<b>Italic text</b></i></p>

<p>John Insley Blair</p>
<p>Born in Warren County, New Jersey, 22 August 1802, John Insley Blair was a successful railroad magnate and a philanthropist. While Blair received limited education as a young man, he was successful in a general country store business in the New York-New Jersey area and expanded his business interests into other lines such as flour mills, manufacture of cotton, and ultimately coal and iron production. The coal and iron business led to Blair's association with and investment in railroads. By the end of the 19th century, John I. Blair headed more than a dozen railroads, including the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western and the Union Pacific Railroad, and was engaged in railroad building in Iowa, Wisconsin, Kansas, Nebraska, Dakota, Missouri, and Texas. He also built the first railroad across Iowa from the Mississippi to the Missouri rivers, and subsequently more than 2,000 miles in Iowa and Nebraska. Some <a href="http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,760722,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,760722,00.html" rel="nofollow">quipped</a> that Blair built railroads to use steel from his mills and towns to provide traffic for his railroads. In 1890, at 88, he capped his great career by founding the famed banking firm of Blair &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Blair gave generously to various causes, and the most significant beneficiaries of his gifts were the Presbyterian Church, [Princeton University], and [Blair Academy].

<p>Sesshoumaru is Inu-Yasha'a older brother. He appears to be very cold and emotionless. Emotions are difficult for him, but his own journey (originally to hunt and kill Inu-Yasha) will have very special plans for him.</p>
<p>He, too, possesses a sword given by his late father: this one forged from the right fang. It's known as Tenseiga, and there is an odd twist to it. Whereas Inu-Yasha's Tetsusaiga can slay 100 demons in a single swing, Tenseiga's stroke can save 100 souls. It is a sword of life rather than death, and the cold Sesshomaru finds the sword to be quite worthless.</p>
<p>But Tenseiga sticks diligently to its destiny of saving lives. Once Inu-Yasha managed to discover the secret to Tetsusaiga's power, a stroke from the sword almost killed Sesshoumaru, but Tenseiga stepped in and spirited Sesshoumaru away. The truth is that the unique swords are a twist of fate designed by his and Inu-Yasha's father to ensure that neither brother can overcome the other. For a while, Sesshoumaru couldn't make a weapon that could overcome Tetsusaiga, but then again, with Tenseiga in his possession, not even Tetsusaiga can strike him down. (Not that he'd be able to wield the sword himself anyway. Tetsusaiga can only be wielded by someone with human blood. Inu-Yasha can wield it because he's half human but Sesshoumaru can't because he's a full-blooded demon). Tenseiga, however, will play a role in Sesshoumaru's personal journey, as he learns the truth about its powers of life.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sesshoumaru finds another way to challenge Inu-Yasha. Learning of the fallen demon Goshinki, who had managed to bite Tetsusaiga in two, he consults a twisted disciple of Toutousai named Kaijinbou, who takes a fang from the fallen demon and forges a new sword: Toukijin. Despite all the evil embodied in that sword, Sesshoumaru is able to overcome it and master the sword, finally gaining the chance to face his brother on equal terms.</p>

<p>Unit factor analysis, also known as the “conversion system” among other identifiers, is a system of developing solutions to many elementary and complex problems in science and mathematics. It is based on the fact that from any algebraic statement of equality, such as 2.54cm = 1 inch can be obtained two multipliers, or factors, who’s value is one (1). For example:</p>
<p>Dividing each side of the above statement of equality by 2.54cm the expression</p>
<dl>
<dd>2.54 cm = 1 inch</dd>
<dd>2.54 cm 2.54 cm</dd>
</dl>
<p>From which we obtain the factor that equals one (1) (1 inch/2.54 cm). If we divide both sides of the equation by 1 inch, we obtain the unit factor (2.54 cm/1 inch). An example of the usefulness of the system is that it enables one to organize a problem in a consistent manner that is easy to compute with a calculator and each step is suggested by the previous step e.g. What is the price of gasoline in Euros per liter (excluding taxes), if the price is $2.50 per gallon? We probably know many of the, so called, conversion factors, and if we do not know them or if they have constantly changing value, as does Euros/Dollar, we can easily look them up. Start with what is given or known</p>
<p>($2.50/gallon) X (1 gallon/4 quarts) X (1.06 quart/ 1 liter) X ( 1 Euro/ $1.18) = 0.56 Euro per liter.</p>

<p>The Go Hard Brothers are an experimental electronic-jazz/dance duo from Cheltenham, UK. Drawing influence from a wide variety of artists, ranging from the Prodigy to jazz legend Herbie Hancock, they are widely being tipped for superstardom in the coming months and years.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b>Biography</p>
<p>Very little is known about the actual identity of the Go Hard Brothers, as they perform under the pseudonyms "Go Hard Brother 1" and "Go Hard Brother 2" but they have given some clues into their lives past and present. The duo claim to have met in the small spa town of Cheltenham in 1999 and are believed to have been school friends throughout their adolscence. They cite the somewhat stifled Cheltonian atmosphere as the main reason behind their experimental and avant-garde musical style and a desire to break free of traditional musical roles and genres. Go Hard Brother 2 has publicly stated that the cosmopolitan society of Brighton, his birthplace has been a major factor behind the multiculural aspects of the band's music.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b> Music: Important Features and Problems with Catagorisation</p>
<p>Although the GHBs define themselves as experimental electronic-jazz/dance, they encompass a range of other genres into their music. On their debut, and to date sole EP, "Stick A Fork In It It's Done", they display a clear interest in rock, art rock and post punk in particular, hip hop, jazz, blues and power ballads. "We wanted to create a sound that reflects the growing diveristy within society today" says Go Hard Brother 1, and they have received considerable praise from their peers on the underground scene and several music critics, such as the notorious Jassy S for achieving their aim.</p>
<p>The GHBs are not fond of ostentatious or elaborate lyrics, claiming that any poetic lyrics would simply distract the listener from the essence of their music, the instruments. However, in almost all their songs, short and often intentionally humorous phrases can be heard, often mimicing Tim Westwood, who the band claim is "the funniest man alive today" and who is a personal hero and role model for both men. The track "China is Rubbish" has caused some outrage within the Chinese community but the band cite the controversial Communist dictatorship as the motivation behind the political satire rather than the republic itself.</p>
<p>Some common features of Go Hard Brothers Songs include: A variety of different sections and genres A fast tempo A "come down section" that is both preceded and proceded by a musical climax Various "wigger" comments Synthesizers A use of repetition and the recycling of ideas</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b>Influences</p>
<p><br />
Tim Westwood, Landscape, Mylo, the Prodigy, Herbie Hancock, Charlie Parker, Radiohead, M, Queen and Blur are all thought to be major influences.</p>

While in Santa Fe, Sid and a few colleagues expanded on the existing children's theatre camp to create a year-long Children's Theatre troupe.

<p>Taking a break from life on the road, Sid returned to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> and freelanced around town.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-09_1bc5.html" title="Edit section: Hugh Paulsen (Wing Commander)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hugh Paulsen (Wing Commander)</span></h2>
<p>Hugh Paulsen is a Captain in the Confederation Navy and minor character in Wing Commander IV&#160;: The Price of Freedom. He initially arrives on the TCS Lexington in order to brief Capt. William Eisen on orders from Confederation HQ. However, upon attending a briefing, Col. Blair finds that Eisen has been relieved of command for reasons unknown. It is around this time that a new Colonel appears on the ship, flying under the callsign "Seether". He is evidently given preferential treatment by Paulsen i.e he is not arrested for murdering an unarmed prisoner of war.</p>
<p>Later in the game, Eisen and Maj. Todd "Maniac" Marshall defect to the Union of Border Worlds. Blair and Lt. Winston "Vagabond" Chang are tasked to pursue. Blair accepts Eisen's invitation, believing that the Kilrathi War-era Confederation he fought for is not the Confederation he now serves.</p>
<p>Paulsen continues to command the Lexington against Blair and his compatriots. After the Lexington is disabled in the Salinas Nebula, Paulsen abandons the ship with both Seether and an unknown shuttle pilot. The depth of Paulsen's complicity with the Black Lance is revealed when he asks Seether, a subordinate officer, for guidance and orders. Seether responds by cutting his throat. Paulsen was always a subordinate, most likely turned to the Black Lance's cause by Admiral Tolwyn, with whom he shared a devotion to duty and certain perception of the Confederation.</p>
<p>Paulsen is a gruff and unfriendly character, but one who gives respect to those who serve him well.</p>
<p>NOTES</p>
<p>1) Although Blair MUST defect at some point (the game is unwinnable otherwise), he does not have to do it the first time he is offered. If he takes the offer up, he must fight three of the pilots from the Lexington's roster before landing on the Intrepid. If he refuses, he must fight Vagabond to the death. In this case, Blair sees more of Seether and Paulsen, even flying on Seether's wing at one point, and it is implied that Maniac cannot forgive him for killing Vagabond. If Blair refuses twice, the Lexington is destroyed and Blair either dies in the fighting or drifts forever in his ship.</p>
<p>2) Paulsen is played by the late Jon Spencer, best known for his role as Leo in The West Wing.</p>
<p>3) It is not clear whether or not Paulsen was aware of the true horror of Tolwyn's actions and plans, it is perfectly possible he was simply following orders.</p>

<p>Before the formation of the civilisation of Assur the region known as ancient Mesopotamia of which Assur was a province had been ruled from Egypt for hundreds of years. This was done partly through the reverence the many magis/priests of the lands had for the ancient Egyptian study of the cosmos and partly due to the influx of foreign Greek blood and ideas. The Egyptians encoded their religious faith with rich Egyptian mythology expressed in pictographics or hieroglyphic motif to mainly depict the lives and fortunes of their pharaohs. Time (the counting of the years) began and ended with the reign of a monarch. These hieroglyphs or ideographs were motifs that became the forerunner of the phonetic symbols which inspired ancient Hebrew, the oldest phonetic written language (of the Bible) in the region, still being used today. These ancient Mesopotamian/Semites were already culterally integrating and mixing up their ideas about the cycles they were observing in the heavens. So much so that as the Egyptian Empire crumbled under the influx of this newly found knowledge, the Assur (Assyrian) Empire took over, integrating both ancient Egyptian/Mesopatamian knowledge with that of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Dr Molteno, is a senior tutor at Dunedin University, and has performed several highly complex operations at the Dunedin University Hospital, Otago, New Zeland. His work with cases of Secondary Nonneovascular jeuvenile glaucoma, is revolutionary. He is credited with the invention and development of the malteno tube implants, which assist in the drainage where other procedures would fail. Treatment of glaucoma with this tube has a 78% sucess rate over fifteen years to twenty years, other treatments do not come close to this level of sucess, and for many people the Molteno tube is the last bastion of hope to save thier sight. There are differing types of the tube system that best meet the needs of different eyes.</p>

<p>71.109.60.216 05:26, 9 February 2006 (UTC)I know that many people have been using the term "Nanoer" for reasons other than what it is. This is the origin of it. "Nanoer" was actually a name for a character in a story that was written but not published, so to make up for it the writer started using the name "Nanoer" or "nanoer11" wherever he had to create a nickname. Now you are wondering how I know this? Well, I know this because I am the author and I am not publishing the story on here because I still hope that one day it will be published and I become famous. So I would appreciate if people do not use the term anymore without stating that I came up with it. Also, there is a Nanoer Writing website of some sort which just uses the name but is not my website.</p>
