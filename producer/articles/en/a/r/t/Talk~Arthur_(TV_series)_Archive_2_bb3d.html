I had this title on my Macintosh but accidentally wiped it when I upgraded it to OS 9.2 and can no longer get a copy of it, so no checking for me. Also, I put Charles back into Ratburn and did some correction to some embarassing mistakes I made: See episode #50802 at ECDC for more information. Lastly, about Mr. Read's first name being errornously said as "Nigel": I will let it through for now, but can anyone point me in direction of at least one episode where this error take place so I or others can verify it?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Closed captioning errors removed</span></h2>
<p>I have removed the closed captioning glitches in the trivia section. This is because firstly, Arthur is aired on two different captioning tracks in the US itself (and word has it some stations even offers a third track in Spanish). Outside the US, the captioning are almost certainly done in-house by the TV station and are usually not transferred from the official closed captioning track (in fact, there is still a substantial number of countries that either do not caption programming at all, uses a different captioning method i.e. Teletext), or use open captioning instead.</p>
<p>Guidelines to check with before submitting a caption mistake:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Is the caption settings of the TV correct at that time?</li>
<li>2. Did the TV station goofed up?</li>
<li>3. Was the signal strong enough to not warrant captioning errors?</li>
<li>4. Was the captioning done in-house and not transferred over from the official caption track(s)?</li>
<li>5. Was the program re-dubbed?</li>
</ul>
<p>When recording a caption mistake in the WiKi:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Note the call-sign of the channel that the error occured at the end of the error.</li>
<li>2. If outside the US, note the country where the error occured.</li>
<li>3. It would also help to note the date/time the error occured.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should help make it more comprehensible to the readers, as some might find it puzzling that a caption mistake occured when they do not in fact get captioning at all, or they did not get that mistake on their end at all. I also propose creating a separate page or section dedicated to glitches in the show if they're to be re-added.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Episode Pages</span></h2>
<p>Should they be 2 15 minute episodes (like the first 3 episodes have) or should each 15 minute episode have an individual page (like some of the later episodes)? <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGooTuM_5332.html" title="User:GooTuM">GooTuM</a> 06:00, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, having each an individual page would go easier for those with narrowband or low-capacity devices (i.e. I sometimes would visit the site with a Sony Clie PDA, which has NetFront 3 as it's browser (and trust me, it's abysmal. Usually complains of page being too large and then cuts off halfway). Also, some areas air Arthur as one 15 minute episode iirc. I say, one 15-minute episode on each page, but note that which two episodes go back to back. Btw, I propose the following naming convention for the episode pages: <i>&lt;episode name&gt; (Arthur TV series episode)</i>.

<p>I noticed in the "cast" section of this article, someone snuck in "Arthur's last tow voice changes sounded as if he hit early puberty". I think Wikipedia should be about <i>the facts</i>, and not what people <i>think</i>. I know I've inserted my opinions into articles before, but I'm trying to do better. Also--I haven't heard anything on this so-called "controversy" about the spiritualism and Yoga in Arthur. Can someone fill me in, or should I just delete that section?

However, I could not think of how to correct that, since the logo at the end of the programming suggests that WGBH produced the show. Feel free to reword it, I can't think of anything better.

<ul>
<li>I doubt it. IMDB doesn't say it's over (the end date is still "<i>????</i>") and I'd think cancelling a show with such a large fan community would inspire some "Save Arthur" petitions and such. Since I've heard nothing else about it, I assume it's an error. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 22:59, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have not heard anything about any plans for an eleventh season. IMDB is not a reliable source, and "The Fairly OddParents" (just cancelled) and "SpongeBob SquarePants" have much bigger fan communitities than "Arthur". Also, Arthur has been partially put into obscurity by shows like <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberchase.html" title="Cyberchase">Cyberchase</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jakers%21.html" title="Jakers!">Jakers!</a>, and hardly airs as much as it used to. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus2_3f8f.html" title="User:Marcus2">Marcus</a> 00:29, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I personally wouldn't think of it as over. Although there is no word on season 11 yet, I really doubt it to be cancelled as it would've been official and would appear in either or both WGBH newsrooms and/or Arthur Worldwide. And as Starblind said, cancelling a show with such a large fanbase would be suicidal. Besides, they just released a movie (although the movie was bad imo). I guess they're just still in the planning phase. We get all sorts of rot here- from <i>unnamed rabbit girl is April/May/June/Whatever</i> trash to fake Season 11 information.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adult Humor</span></h2>
<p>Did Arthur ever have episodes using adult Humor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort of. There was never anything patently adult like sexual references, but there have been jokes which were clearly intended for viewers older than Arthur's core audience. As one example, when Muffy is working as agent for the Backstreet Boys, she takes a 50% cut, which is much higher than an agent would make in real life, although most 4-to-8-year-olds probably wouldn't knoe that. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 14:17, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is it juut me, or is this section completely unnecessary? Wikipedia isn't a receptical for random bits of minutia.

<dd>I just realized that there's an entry here for a calculator Muffy got... That seems awfully excessive. If it's okay, when I have time I would like to try to pare this down to a list of "significant parodies", which I think would be more appropriate. (Lolly Locket and the World Girls are significant; the doll DW didn't get for Christmas is not.) As for the person who wrote it - it's true that it's a shame it was written in vain, but it doesn't belong here. They're free to put it on a fan page if they want to.

<dd>I really cannot see how Stanley belongs to the characters page, since he's not a "living" character on the show. Separate Arthur Wiki, though, sounds like a good idea.

<p>That doesn't sound right. I know the Arthur GBC game exists because I've played it (albeit on an emulator).
