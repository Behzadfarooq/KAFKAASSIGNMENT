<li><b>Keep</b> While I agree that it's a challenge to maintain a neutral point-of-view on such an article, objectively chronicling verifiable and nationally-covered controversy or criticism of an international corporation is perfectly encyclopedic. A better solution would be to watch the article and try to neutralise any ranting or POV that may surface, but the topic itself has merit. — <a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>NM</b></font></a><a href="../../../n/m/c/User_talk%7ENMChico24_41e0.html" title="User talk:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>Chico</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NMChico24_752e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>24</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg/25px-Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" /></a> 04:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While I too feel that NPOV is tough to achieve in an article that basically just slams a company, it is needed to keep the overall NPOV, and a deletion and merge would make the wal-mart article far to long. EnsRedShirt 04:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I find that the sheer amount of coverage of the topic is also a form of POV bias. The main points need to be presented in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a>, and the rest needs to find another home. We aren't the BBB or Consumer Reports and we shouldn't try to be. The fact that this has become nearly as large if not larger than the main article is a problem. - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriona_934d.html" title="User:Triona">Stephanie Daugherty (Triona)</a> - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETriona_5b3e.html" title="User talk:Triona">Talk</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Comment</a> - 05:14, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously the POV of this article has to walk a fine line, but the concept itself is well-established, and the potential length warrants seperation from the main Wal-Mart article. It's certainly as notable as <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_World_of_Warcraft_074b.html" title="Criticism of World of Warcraft">Criticism of World of Warcraft</a>, and the decision was to keep that. Or you could pick the GWB article and put the criticism and praise together if you wanted NPOV. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's a lot of criticism of Wal-Mart. It's not bias to include it. But if you're objecting on the grounds that Criticism of X articles themselves are unacceptable, well, I think that would best be taken at the policy level, not on the individual article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:28, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Article length should not be a concern here since the article length issue is only a guideline (not a set-in-stone policy). The Wal-Mart article is only 42Kb, some articles on WP are 200-250Kb.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as many users have said, Criticism of Wal-mart is well documented from a variety of sources. I would say that it is <i>more POV</i> to delete the article then it would be to keep it since by doing so you eliminating an important coverage aspects of Wal-mart. As for merging and article size, there is certainly ideal article sizes and content forks such as this serve a purpose to maintain readability. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 09:36, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The idea that an article critising an entity <b>must</b> therefore violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is abhorrent. It is clearly beholden on editors to maintain a neutral point of view, but to delete it because it might contain something awkward for Wal-Mart?

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a>, it makes alot more sense to keep this material together, and it avoids any potential problems of NPOV. There's no problem with the length, since both articles are already very well structured with subheadings, so that individual sections are not too long. Note that if it would "overwhelm" the parent article as suggested, then it is too long and needs editing, or is given too much weight, or (and this is the most likely) the remainder of the article ought to be expanded. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:36, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment, yarrr</b> Much criticism from Wal-Mart comes from union funded campaigns/organizations such as <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wake_Up_Wal-Mart_cec4.html" title="Wake Up Wal-Mart">Wake Up Wal-Mart</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_Watch_04d4.html" title="Wal-Mart Watch">Wal-Mart Watch</a>. It is in my opinion that such criticism rationale should go into the articles about the organizations criticising Wal-Mart, not in an article about Wal-Mart itself, with links provided from the main article. Specific lawsuits should go in separate [[whatever v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.]] articles, with links again to the main. Everything directly related to Wal-Mart should go in the main article, while criticism that is common to big-box stores in general should go to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big-box_store.html" title="Big-box store">big-box store</a>.

<dd>I think there is some backwards logic here in regards to moving to the criticisms to the union pages. You want to keep information as centralized and relevant to the topic as possible. When the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_Book_Review_9cd4.html" title="New York Times Book Review">New York Times Book Review</a> makes a comment about a book, should we include the comment in the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_criticism.html" title="Literary criticism">Literary criticism</a> section of the book's article or on the New York Times page? When President Bush criticised <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trent_Lott_dcd8.html" title="Trent Lott">Trent Lott</a> for his Strom Thurmond comments should those criticisms go on the <a href="../../../g/w/b/GWB_14d0.html" title="GWB">GWB</a> page or on Lott's? The normal "ideal situation" would be for this information to be in the main Walmart article, however the <i>breadth</i> of criticisms would makes that cumbersome and unfairly tilt the POV in the main article. Hence, the reason for this article's existence and a strong reason to keep it. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:49, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The difference between the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_Book_Review_9cd4.html" title="New York Times Book Review">New York Times Book Review</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wake_Up_Wal-Mart_cec4.html" title="Wake Up Wal-Mart">Wake Up Wal-Mart</a> is that the purpose of the latter is to exclusively criticise Wal-Mart; hence such criticism is more directly related to the campaign. The problem with this nomination is what is not realized here: Not only is Wal-Mart's criticism considered a notable subject by a lot of people, but so is the very existence of this article on the English Wikipedia. Despite we still can't decide how the hell to resolve the disputes in this article, it is amazing to see this much energy into keeping an article with so many problems around. Obviously, you work for <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_Depot_1d41.html" title="Office Depot">Office Depot</a> but I don't know if it's unionized or affiliated in any way with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. It makes me wonder where this energy is coming from, for it is either the Pro-Wal-Mart side or the union-funded Anti-Wal-Mart side. Or maybe just Wal-Mart bashers in general.

<dd>LOL, actually I don't work for Office Depot. I just gladly leech off of their wireless network.&#160;:P (Seriously, it's 2:30 in the morning here. Do you think they're open?) As for the example, the purpose of the New york times book review is to criticized books (positive or negative). I agree that the article needs some clean up but AfD <i>never has</i> and <i>never will</i> be a substitute for clean up. Personally, I like Wal-mart. I am actually a small business owner and from a cost perspective, they are valuable. However, I recognize that criticism about this company is notable and commented on by a variety of reliable sources--not just those union organizations. As I noted before the deletion of a notable and encyclopedic topic just because you disagree with it, <i>is more POV</i> then this article will ever be. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:42, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Merge</b> Verified and sourced criticisms should be merged into a critics section of the main article. We do not need an article on every notable company, and then a separate article on the criticism of every notable company. The position that a merge would tilt the POV of the main article is pure nonsense. Facts are facts, and if a company has earned a poor reputation then stating so in Wikipedia when verifiable sources are provided is proper. Wal-Mart has made their bed, they ought to lay in it now. We are here to provide a non-biased presentation of the FACTS. Not to whitewash corporate America or help them look good to their customers. The subject is Wal-Mart. Therefore, an article on that topic would present any favorable and any disfavor able information on the same page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShortfuse_4fcc.html" title="User:Shortfuse">Shortfuse</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShortfuse_65d9.html" title="User talk:Shortfuse">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shortfuse_149e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shortfuse">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>In capitalism, as far as I know there has always been one company considered to be the "evil empire", or the most evil/hated out of all in the general public. That company used to be Microsoft Corporation due to its monopolistic business ethics, now it is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. due to its business ethics again. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 02:29, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As fashions changes and the fickle finger of frustration points at a new company, we then will create an article about all those criticisms? And, depending on what your POV is, some would charge that any of the above companies are the evil empire of today... <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:04, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
