<li><b>Keep</b> but change the title and spell out Saturday Night Live on the title.

<li>Don't think I'll be voting on this, but I had no idea who Ashlee Simpson was until I got involved with Autobiography's article.

<li>To answer this: <b>Yes</b>; I heard about her for the first time in the english wikipedia, and this only because there is this large, intermittent discussion going on. Mind, I'm from Germany, so this does not prove your point; I'm not voting here about this, but for my part I fail to see her noticeability <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a> 13:44, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I had never heard of Ashlee Simpson other than as a result of Wikipedia articles and controversy surrounding them, and that is the honest truth. She is <b>not</b> so famous as to have made an impression on people who don't follow contemporary popular music, unlike, say, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> who is to popular music as Einstein is to theoretical physics: the one name that people who know nothing about the topic, know.

<li>Well, I wasn't saying she's as famous as Britney. I was just curious. Thanks for your feedback. Hey, maybe it's good promotion for her, huh?

<ul>
<li>Tell you what. Darned if I'll buy a whole album. If you will name the one single Ashlee Simpson song that it is most important for me to hear, I'll buy it from iTunes Music Store. And listen to it. I won't spend $15 and an hour of my time, but I'm willing to spend $0.99 and three minutes. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:02, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I originally thought I heard of her first on WP, but then I remembered she had a relatively small article in Maxim or FHM or one of those before she was particularly famous. Unfortunately, the article mostly went into what a novelty it was that she was so different from her sister, and I don't think I (or anyone else) really got much from it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:47, Jan 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Although Ashlee seems to get a rather bizarre amount of attention on WP in contrast with other artists of similar notability, I'd say that this is one incident that should be kept, since it was so focused-on by the media for most of late last year. I do think it needs expansion though... there's no mention of the whole "blaming the band" fiasco, for example. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:36, Jan 26, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> as a subchapter.

<ul>
<li>There is simply no reason not to have quality information about this topic. It does not suit my personal POV to have this article, but nevertheless I support its existence for inclusionist reasons. It makes no sense that we have detailed articles on every Pokemon and Digimon character, associated video game and TV show, but we can't have detailed Ashlee articles. What's the problem here? Nominate an article on a Pokemon character and the people who work on those articles will furiously campaign for it to be kept—and I would too, of course. But nominate an Ashlee article, and who's going to campaign? It's really just me who works on them. Now, surely we should vote based on general principles, not based on whether a topic is popular or not among present-day Wikipedians. There is a problem when information is being removed from Wikipedia for such a reason. A very big problem, I'd say. Articles far less notable than this would be kept by nearly unanimous votes. So why can't we be consistent? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 17:40, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You may not have noticed but both 23skidoo and myself voted <i>merge</i>, not <i>delete</i>. Yes, this incident is slightly noteworthy, but it's really just a footnote in the story of Ashlee Simpson. You're right, it makes no sense that we have detailed articles on every Pokemon, but I'm not about to take it upon myself to merge every single one into a larger Pokemon article or two, though I would fully support such an action. My opposition to this as a separate artcile is not because Ashlee Simpson isn't currently popular enough, it's more because she's <i>too</i> popular right now, and very minor incidents like this are blown out of proportion and made into full scandals. I think it should be covered more as what it is, not "Acid-refluxgate" but as a small technical problem that occurred on a TV show. This will soon be forgotten, but Wikipedia will keep a record of it for posterity, where it belongs: in the Ashlee Simpson article. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:26, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And that record will have to be greatly abbreviated, since an article cannot continue growing forever and ever. That's why articles like this are needed: to provide the space to permit continued expansion. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:35, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why can't it? The paper Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, has no problems devoting the equivalent of <b>one megabyte</b> to a single article.

<li>Also, on a simple Google test, "Pokemon" gets roughly 10 times the results that "Ashlee Simpson" does (and indeed it would get even more if we included Japanese-language results).

<dl>
<dd>In October 2004, at the start of pop singer Ashlee Simpsons's second musical performance, an error involving pre-recorded backing tracks caused the singer to walk off the stage. The network attempted to hide the flub by remixing the show's sound for the West coast audience making the pre-recorded track inaudible, which only confused West Coast viewers by making it appear as if Simpson walked off stage for no reason.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This simple paragraph was then re-edited by <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> to prevent Simpson from "looking bad", then edited by other users to add even more details to compromise until we finally got to this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The foibles of live television were exposed in October 2004 when at the start of singer Ashlee Simpson's second musical performance of the show, a pre-recorded backing track for the wrong song was accidentally played. Simpson's father (her manager) had decided to use a vocal guide track because her voice had been weak in rehearsal. During the performance the vocal track was shut off but the musical track continued and Simpson walked off the stage. She subsequently apologized for the error during the show's closing—the incident served to highlight the always precarious nature of live television, as noted by the night's host, Jude Law. It appeared viewers that Simpson had been lip synching and the incident received wide-spread coverage in the news. The following week the incident was the subject of several skits.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Coincidentally, a team of reporters from the CBS news program 60 Minutes led by Lesley Stahl had been taping and interviewing during the production cycle, and recorded both the rehearsals and the immediate reactions by Lorne Michaels and others. Michaels said immediately afterwords that he had never been asked about using a vocal track, and would not have allowed it. However, since then the production practices of SNL have been scrutinized by reporters and Michaels has admitted that backing tracks are sometimes used. The 60 Minutes report also revealed the intense writing frenzy that goes on during the week leading up to a show, the involvement of the guest hosts in developing and choosing their skits, and the rule that all skit dialog is performed as-written, with no improvisation allowed on camera.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Albeit the last paragraph is mostly about 60 minutes it highlights the fact as to how this incident has grown into an edit war in the SNL article.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a>]'s claims, I am not trying to keep either Simpson or SNL from "looking bad", I couldn't care much less. Willmcw has subsequently added it back to the SNL article and tightened it up nicely, it looks much better now HOWEVER it will only be re-edited by <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> at the earliest opportunity and we'll be back where we were.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is the question of whether the details of this incident belong in the SNL article or in the Ashlee Simpson article. I think a fair compromise that can cut out a lot of unnecessary detail in both articles is to keep this one and we wiki-link to this article from both. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_schiller_6670.html" title="User:Jeff schiller">Jeff schiller</a> 19:55, 2005 Jan 26 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That isn't a reasonable "compromise". A lot of people don't want excruciatingly long Ashlee Simpson-related articles popping up like weeds all over the damn Wikipedia. I can see why Willmcw didn't want the article on SNL to be swallowed by Ashlee Simpson, but the compromise would have been to keep the description of the incident short and refer people to the Ashlee Simpson article for the boring (I mean, uh, fascinating) details. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:58, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

My preference is: merge into <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> as a section, and add a link from the Saturday Night Live article to that section. 1) The <i>information</i> in these detailed and well-written paragraphs should be kept because it seems to be of high quality. It's not of much importance where. 2) I would have voted against a <i>stub</i> on this topic, but there is now enough information to make it acceptable as article. 3) Nobody is going to find it by typing in the title; it will be found by search or by following a link. Therefore <i>if</i> the content is merged, <i>then</i> the article should be deleted, as I don't think it's of any use as a redirect. 4) The event is of far more significance in relation to the career of Ashlee Simpson than to the history of <i>Saturday Night Live.</i> (My apologies to the sysop who has to decide how this vote should be counted.

<li>Chuq said he hadn't seen or heard of the show. What's that got to do with whether it aired or not? Personally, I haven't seen or heard of it either, and I'd hazard a guess that it aired on cable television, to which subscriptions are a lot less common in Australia than the U.S. Most successful cable shows eventually make it to free-to-air (and thus, a wider audience) but <i>The Ashlee Simpson Show</i> hasn't done that yet. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 04:02, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Slightly off-topic but I felt like looking it up. As of late January 2005, what is Ashlee Simpson best known for? To find out, I did a search on the New York Times for the exact phrase "Ashlee Simpson" and got about twenty hits (i.e. the New York Times has mentioned her name about twenty times in the years 2000 through the present." In reverse chronological order, and omitting some utterly irrelevant ones:</p>

<li>An article about another topic says "'It's possible," Juror No. 8 insists.' Sure. And maybe Ashlee Simpson will develop some talent this week."</li>
<li>One is an article about voice-training software that ends with the remark "Of course, being on key is not a prerequisite for fame. Just ask Ashlee Simpson."</li>
<li>An end-of-2004 overview says "ASHLEE SIMPSON, just a tip:/Singing's more than moving lips,/And an artist understands/It's bad form to blame the band."</li>
<li>A long piece begins "ASHLEE SIMPSON got caught with her microphone down on 'Saturday Night Live' in October, and five weeks later, on Dec. 5, 'Good Morning America,' which had been especially gleeful in its post-mortem of the debacle, presented Lindsay Lohan in a 'live singing debut'-- lip-syncing just like Ms. Simpson." The article goes on to argue that lip-syncing goes back to 1929, there's nothing wrong with it, it's not essentially different from a singer using a microphone in the first place.</li>
<li>A December 26th piece, "TV's Best Live Moments" of 2004 (Janet Jackson, etc.) comments that "Before Ashlee Simpson blamed the band, and the norms of contemporary live performance, she tried to save her "Saturday Night Live" blunder with a humble-pie two-step and sort of did: the pure panic in that dance is something modern choreographers should study."</li>

<li>An article on tofu at a Japanese pub says "Yuba arguably has more character than plain tofu, which is like saying that Britney Spears lip-synchs less transparently than Ashlee Simpson."</li>
<li>A movie is mentioned with the words "Her third album, 1973's "Hard to Stop," is reissued this week: it had no breakout hits, but give her a break -- it was released when she was 20 years old, the same age Ashlee Simpson is today"</li>
<li>A letter to the editor says "I'm sure Ashlee Simpson is a talented young woman, but the real talent behind her success lies with the writers, musicians, engineers and producers who have crafted enjoyable pop tunes for her to dance to and occasionally sing along with. My only problem with this situation is that the Ashlees of the industry are sold to the public as artists."</li>
<li>An article on "Rockism" opens "BAD news travels fast, and an embarrassing video travels even faster. By last Sunday morning, one of the Internet's most popular downloads was the hours-old 60-second .wmv file of Ashlee Simpson on 'Saturday Night Live.' As she and her band stood onstage, her own prerecorded vocals -- from the wrong song -- came blaring through the speakers, and it was too late to start mouthing the words. So she performed a now-infamous little jig, then skulked offstage, while the band (were a few members smirking?) played on."</li>

<li>Arts briefing: "Ashlee Simpson's run atop the Billboard 200 chart of best-selling albums ended after a week when her debut, "Autobiography," with sales of 270,000 copies, slipped to second place behind the 16th installment of the compilation series "Now That's What I Call Music!," left."</li>

A million copies of 'Autobiography,' her charming debut album, have been shipped since its release on July 20. Her reality series on MTV, "The Ashlee Simpson Show," has become a 3.4 million-viewer-a-week hit.... VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN -- You just shipped a million albums. How do you feel? ASHLEE SIMPSON -- Amazing. Oh my gosh. I'm freaking out. Everything is so exciting. Oh it's so cool. It's got the album cover on it and it says one million! I was like, this is insane. When I saw it, I started crying. Isn't that insane? Just to have an album in stores. It's the coolest."</li>
<li>Arts briefing: "SISTER ACT -- Ashlee Simpson, the kid sister of Jessica Simpson, is standing tall atop the Billboard Top 200 chart today."</li>
<li>Article on Simpson: "Raunchy or Sweet Reflections Of Adolescent Self-Esteem" "There is some actual talent as well as show-business ambition in the Simpson family. Ashlee Simpson, 19, is the younger sister of the famously ditsy pop singer Jessica Simpson, and she has her own television acting career (as a character in 'Seventh Heaven') as well as her own MTV reality show, 'The Ashlee Simpson Show,' which followed the making of her debut album, 'Autobiography' With songs by Ms. Simpson and some very experienced collaborators, the album is a thoroughly calculated package..."</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, these are in reverse chronological order. In my judgement, and by my count, as of late January 2005, Ashlee Simpson is about <i>equally</i> well known as a highly successful pop wunderkind with, it is acknowledged, "some actual talent as well as show-business ambition," and as the subject of the embarrassing incident on SNL. But notice that <i>after</i> the SNL incident, <i>all</i> references seem to treat her as a joke. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:32, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Man, that's a lot of research you did. Why don't you see what you can contribute to some of the articles? They've been made desperately emaciated of late and could use some more info added to them. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:42, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. Dpbsmith should put his findings on the Ashlee Simpson page in a paragraph on her declining reputation. 68.118.61.219 10:34, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I probably will, but I'm certainly not going to rush into it. So much of what would need to be said would involve reporting contemporary value judgements in an NPOV way. How much of the animus against her following the SNL incident was really related to lip-syncing, and how much was that this nineteen-year-old revealed herself to be "not a trooper," i.e. an inexperienced performer who was not able to handle a bad situation gracefully? Other questions that puzzle me: has she been pushed to sing too many public performances, with inadequate voice training, to the detriment of her vocal health? The whole story of the SNL incident at least raises this question. I haven't yet found any handy on-line video of her Orange Bowl performance, but if she sang far worse in public than in recordings, this suggests either lack of attention to her vocal health, or flattering studio enhancement of her recorded performances. The latter wouldn't bother me at all; nobody complains that <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bing_Crosby_1db0.html" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> (or <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whispering_Jack_Smith_73f2.html" title="Whispering Jack Smith">Whispering Jack Smith</a>!) couldn't project like an opera singer and needed to use a mike. The former would be disturbing. Speaking of wunderkinds suddenly projected into the spotlight whose welfare I wonder about... how's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Church_4c54.html" title="Charlotte Church">Charlotte Church</a> doing these days? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:49, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You must certainly NOT put your material into the existing A.S. articles. It is a well-established Wikipedia policy that each bit of information about A.S. goes into a separate article. Your material is sufficient for three or four articles, at least. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:42, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Look, an article gets long, you break out some content. It's perfectly reasonable. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:46, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Or, you could say, "This article is already long enough for the subject. Lets find something to remove or condense so there is room for this new information". What a concept! You seem to think that A.S. is a great artist; since she is only 20 or so, she has many years of her career ahead of her. What are you planning -- that by the time she is 40, Wikipedia should have a few hundred articles on Ashlee Simpson? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:41, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
