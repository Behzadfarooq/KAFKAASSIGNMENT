<li><b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. "Tunday", which is a tradition celebrated in Lancashire according to some of the commenters here, turns up only 4 Google hits when combined with Lancashire <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=tunday+lancashire" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=tunday+lancashire" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, none of which support the definition of Tunday shown in this article (and two of which are apparently misprints of "Sunday" from mis-scanned newspapers). In other words, we have no online sources for Tunday at all, much less reliable ones. By contrast, I never heard of <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohinga.html" title="Mohinga">mohinga</a> before, yet I can find numerous Google hits for it, substantially all of which describe it as a kind of food from Burma. (See <a href="http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Feb/08/il/FP602080311.html" class="external text" title="http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Feb/08/il/FP602080311.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for an example from the Honolulu Advertiser, a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.)

<li><b>KEEP</b> First of all having read through this discussion I would like to say that just because I am a new user, that people should not treat me any less than themselves, it is true I have made little contribution in the form of comment or article to Wikipedia, through no fault of my own, as I find it a reliable and well managed source, and see little need therefore to add my input. However, I have come to gain information on a local tradition which has recently come to my attention, Tunday. being new to the area I am increasingly interested in local myths and traditions, I have recently heard about Tunday from some of the local people and colleagues who have lived in the area for a long time. with the most recent Tunday just passed I decided to further my knowledge into this tradition, as I found it an interesting event. I trawled the internet fruitlessly, as it seems some of you also have, with little reference to Tunday on the internet I was beginning to lose hope in finding this illustrious tradition. I discovered this article and was shocked to find that people considered Tunday a ‘Hoax’ this fuelled an ambition to find the true roots of Tunday. I remembered the true roots of knowledge before the internet, having took the time to go to the library I found a book entitled 'Lesser known traditions of England and Wales' by Anthony Langdon, in which there was a clear article on Tunday, although small and seeming relatively insignificant compared to other lesser known traditions the article relates to a tradition which reaches back centuries, “Tunday has been an Celtic tradition since circa 230AD, the tradition was a ritual preformed by believers of pre-roman druidism, the ritual was preformed on the hour of the calendar day of the subsequent number of the month of the subsequent number” it goes on to say that “The tradition no longer includes a human sacrifice, but the custom of praying to the Celtic gods for desires has remained.” This appears to have evolved into the current practice of wishing. It appears that the tradition has been passed on through a relatively small area of Celtic ancestry to lead to today's current Lancastrian tradition along with several small Welsh communities who also practice this tradition. The old rituals of sacrifice were replaced over time, when Druidism as a religion was practically destroyed in circa 60BC by the Romans, by those less loyal to the tradition by simple good will gestures, to be in accordance with Roman rule. It would appear according to 'Lesser known traditions of England and Wales' that the tradition of Tunday has evolved to have meaning on our current calendar and as more units of time have become available as has the accuracy of the Tunday tradition. Unfortunately this source gives no information upon the origin of the partial and full Tunday, but I assume as time began to be measured in the 12 hour clock that followers of the tradition adopted the slightly easier option of celebrating Tunday, and taking a quiet moment to reflect and wish on, for instance, the 14th hour rather than the 2nd hour. Also unfortunately the book does not give any disclosure into where the current name of Tunday derives. Of course having discovered this information I was appalled to think that people were comparing such an ancient and inherent tradition to that of Crop Circles or Bigfoot, (admittedly through no fault of their own) classing it a ‘Hoax’. I hope you see the errors of your ways in wishing to delete a (until now) somewhat forgotten gem of British history, from a site dedicated to empowering knowledge to the people. To say that it is suitable for deletion because it is relatively unknown is blatant bigotry against lesser known knowledge and is a misuse of this website. I will certainly be celebrating Tunday and spreading the word of such a prestigious celebration. Upon saying this I would agree that the member who wrote this article needs to review it with relevant sourced information.</li>

<li>firstly in reply to the rather aggressive 'IrishGuy' I have been a legitimate user of Wikipedia for a long time now, although as I explained, I have had no need to comment or add an article of my own until now, having had recent interest in the subject I have joined this farce of a debate in order to protect a tradition and custom 'under attack' by a combination of ignorance and benightedness. I resent that I have to defend my identity as well as defending this tradition, as for so called ‘sock puppetry’ you yourself say along with ‘tonywalton’ admit that you have never seen this happen before in favour or against any AfD. In reply to the accusations that this book does not exist, it seems to be a reprint of a compilation of older books based upon English traditions. It seems that some of this book has been translated from original Gaelic texts. I very much doubt any of these books or manuscripts are listed on any incomplete online library catalogues such as that of the British library which goes back barely further than the 15th century. In reply to your link to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Neopaganism_10f8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Neopaganism">Wikipedia:WikiProject Neopaganism</a> this was not a Neopagan tradition, no doubt it will have evolved into a form of Neopagan tradition, but Celtic beliefs and religion precede that of Neopaganism, so therefore your link is totally irrelevant, I’m afraid. And as for “whatever "the ritual was preformed on the hour of the calendar day of the subsequent number of the month of the subsequent number” is supposed to mean” this quite obviously means that a ritual was preformed on the hour of the day (for instance on the third hour) of the day of the month which followed the number of the hour (for instance the fourth day) of the month which followed the number of the day (for instance the fifth month). Having said this in response I do see your point that the source provided seems somewhat invalid. Therefore I am willing to spend some of my time researching this subject further in order for the truth to be known. When I have collected more information I shall return to post my findings.--Dontrileme 13:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You claim <i>firstly in reply to the rather aggressive 'IrishGuy' I have been a legitimate user of Wikipedia for a long time now...</i> and yet your user history shows quite the opposite. Second, you claim <i>as for so called ‘sock puppetry’ you yourself say along with ‘tonywalton’ admit that you have never seen this happen before in favour or against any AfD....'</i> Wrong. We both stated quite clearly that neither of us has seen it be effective. It happens all the time in AfDs...it just rarely works. Because like this case, it is plainly obvious that Dontrileme is the same user as Guitar6strings. You both write the same. You both insist on calling this a debate even though it has been pointed out it isn't. You both write excessively long screeds and point the finger at me about this being deleted. I'm not the one who nominated this for deletion. I'm just the one who keeps catching your sockpuppets. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 17:23, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>as for so called ‘sock puppetry’ you yourself [Irishguy] say along with ‘tonywalton’ admit that you have never seen this happen before in favour or against any AfD.</i> Actually no, I said nothing like that. I said though I supposed it had been known I personally had never seen sockpuppetry in favour of deletion, and I'd never seen sockpuppetry against deletion <i>to be effective</i> (quite the reverse; it tends to sway consensus in favour of deletion).

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would like to thank Justin Eiler for bringing the matter of <b>230AD</b> to my attention, it is true that druids did not exist at that time, as I clearly stated <i>"Druidism as a religion was practically destroyed in circa 60BC by the Romans"</i> unfortunately I made a typing error, I should have typed 230<b>BC</b> but accidentally typed 230<b>AD</b> instead, I’m sure you can appreciate that I have made a typing error and even went on to seem to disprove myself with the previous quote. (I do not see why I would do that if I was lying and not just making a simple mistake.) As for accusations of the book 'Lesser Known Traditions of England and Wales' not existing, well I can only say that I have read it, it does exist and it isn't <i>my</i> problem if <b>you</b> cannot find the book.--Dontrileme 16:22, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Typographical errors are certainly understandable, and I don't hold that against anyone.

<p>We must have different versions of "Chroniques Paysannes Legendes, Traditions et Superstitions". In my version, it appears to me (my french is not flawless) Tunday is on page 45. Is there something different in your version?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: This whole discussion is idiotic and beside the point. This AfD is not an attack on a different religion or cult or tradition or whatever. The existence of the wikipedia article is what's in discussion here. You (the article author and all the "Tundayists" around here) say that Tunday exists, is notable in the Lancashire area and that there's a book that mentions it. Fine. Give us a way to verify it and we will promptly change our votes to Keep. Please read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for a extended explanation on verifiability. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a> has more info on what is "Reliable Source". Whining and personal attacks wont change the outcome of this AfD. 146.164.26.85 18:06, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I accept the fact that people find it hard to accept the proposed sources by my fellow Tunday believers but whether you can find those books/sources or not does not make this article a hoax; it only further emphasises your point as an article that cannot not yet at this point be verifeid sufficeintly to your strict demands. I believe notability is somewhat "proven" or moving towards it wheather you may agree with me or not but ture, the real debate between people here is on the verifiablity. However i must strongly stress that despite this topic of discussion in my motion to keep the article; it is most deffinately not a hoax.--Guitar6strings 23:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, notability has in no way been proven. All that has been shown are sources given that may or may not exist. How does that illustrate notability? <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 23:05, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely and unreservedly accept your assertion that it's not a hoax. However, the standard at Wikipedia is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V"><i>verifiability, not truth</i></a>. To quote from the relevant policy, "This means that we only publish material that is verifiable with reference to reliable, published sources."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If and when Tunday reaches the level of public acclaim and awareness to be published in reliable, published sources, feel free to come back and recreate the article. In the meantime, it fails the standards of verifiability, and thus does not belong at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 00:19, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
