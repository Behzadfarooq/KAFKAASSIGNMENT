<li><b>Delete</b> having looked through it. The Blade Runner ones, for example, are essentially nonsense, chunks of the list is redlinks we <i>really</i> don't need filled, and at least some of it is original research, in that the sources do not appear to use the term Battle of <i>foo</i>. Also, the bar for inclusion is too low - there are battles listed (thanksfully without links yet) which are contained in fiction which is barely known, rubbing shoulders with the Lord of the Rings. Oh, and lumping Blade Runner and Soldier together and saying they were written by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Peoples_9a37.html" title="David Peoples">David Peoples</a> is also a stretch, since Blade Runner is from a book by Philip K Dick (as any fule kno) and the two are not truly a pair; to include Peoples' name looks like fandom. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 16:51, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> per my reasoning on the List of fictional wars AfD: <i>Original research, unmaintainable, and unencyclopedic.

<li>Fictional Military Battles is perfectly relevant to the many science fiction universes, books, RPG's, etc. It's a quick and easy aid for one to find a group from a stroy and look up the right series. And the ,list is maintable, and has been maintianed well. Also, this list is relavent due to the imporantce of the Military Battles to the plot of many stories. Instead of creating many useless pages that just deals with the oneoperation, a single list will be able to maintian any and all plot relevant operations. --Eldarone 23:35, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There are probably tens of thousands of fictional battles. Who decides which get in? We obviously can't have a list with ten thousand battles on it, but as the <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheel_of_Time_3eb4.html" title="Wheel of Time">Wheel of Time</a> entry shows, it's not being limited to battles which have their own article.

<dd>An excellent article? It is an incomplete list that doesn't tell the reader why this sort of thing is needed. If anyone can come up with a reason for compiling such a list, fine. The normal reason is to enable comparisons to be made between items on a list, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_rivers_by_length.html" title="List of rivers by length">List of rivers by length</a>. What comparisons can be made between the battles in different fictional worlds that can be separated from the more logical idea of overall comparisons of the fictional worlds and authors? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:31, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I actually like the idea of this list, but it's simply not sufficiently defined in terminology and thus excessively broad.

<dl>
<dd>Then all we need to do is define the list even more. If you wish, you can even suggest how the list should be limited more. For one thing, the battles must be significant to the main body of fiction could be a good start. --Eldarone 04:55, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I thought about that before I voted. However, I couldn't think of a way to limit the list without making it too crufty. A list of fictional battles in classic literature might be manageable, but I don't think that's what the keepers of this list find interesting. Once you open up the list to all fiction, it becomes unmanageable. It's an interesting concept for a list, but I don't see a way to make it encyclopedic. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 02:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It dosn't have to every fictional battle, just ones that have signifcance to the main body of the work. Besides, many general articles don't have list of battles for their work. --Eldarone 03:55, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find these kinds of lists helpful for categorizing information and I believe that fictional battles are prominent enough of a topic to warrant being *<b>Kept</b> on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Grand_Roi_des_Citrouilles_0219.html" title="User:Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles">Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles</a> 04:26, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Categorizing. That is what <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_0080.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories">categories</a> are for. Categories are fine for organizing large amounts of information related only by one thing, such as being a fictional battle.

<dd>The problem is, not every series is going to have a seperate article on each battle. Most are going to have a subsection of a larger article, and categories sometimes don't list every plot or background imporatant battle --Eldarone 18:29, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>That really doesn't hold up as an argument at all. Why would a fan of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly_%28TV_series%29_5a5c.html" title="Firefly (TV series)">Firefly</a> want to know about the fictional battles in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a>? Surely a fan of one work of fiction would want to read about the battles therein in an article on that work of fiction (or in the case of Tolkien fans, in works devoted to that kind of thing). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:44, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not true. I am a fan of both Firefly and Animal Farm and I like having a list like this for comparative purposes even. --<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Grand_Roi_des_Citrouilles_0219.html" title="User:Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles">Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles</a> 12:45, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You missed my point. I said, "Why would a fan of X what to read about fictional battles in Y?", not "Why would a fan of X <i>and</i> Y want to read about fictional battles in both?" I also don't see what "comparative purposes" this list can serve - that there are more battles in Harry Turtledove's Timeline-191 than in Animal Farm? Well, paint me blue and call me Charlie. I never would've guessed that. Further, just remember that you liking or disliking an article has very little bearing on matters. I wouldn't mind seeing an article on myself here, but that doesn't mean that one should exist. Likewise, there are lots of articles I'd prefer didn't exist, but unless there's a better reason than that, it doesn't count. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 13:06, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, I have to disagree. It's because of articles that I and others "like" that we come to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Grand_Roi_des_Citrouilles_0219.html" title="User:Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles">Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles</a> 13:09, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's why you come here, I didn't say otherwise. What I <i>did</i> say, though, is that there are rules, guidelines and policies which govern what's actually included here, and "Someone likes it" isn't one of them. Like I said above, I'd like it very much if I had an article here, and one day I might, but that doesn't mean I need one now. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 13:20, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with BigHaz. This seems to be part of the problem. To be blunt, you (and others) need to understand what Wikipedia is about, not turn Wikipedia into a free-hosting site for things "you like". <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:24, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Responding to Le Grand Roi: well, fine, make a copy of the list. But the community, backed by policies, seems to be deciding that Wikipedia is not the place for this sort of thing. Please understand that Wikipedia is not meant to cover everything. A lot, yes, but not every conceivable trivial list. Again, I point you to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_rivers_by_length.html" title="List of rivers by length">List of rivers by length</a> as an example of a well-designed list. Better to have a series of inter-connected lists, than one long, indiscriminate list. By all means, keep a copy of this list offline, and redesign it into a series of navboxes between different areas of Wikipedia (such as <a href="../../../c/a/m/Template%7ECampaignbox_War_of_the_Ring_5b58.html" title="Template:Campaignbox War of the Ring">Template:Campaignbox_War_of_the_Ring</a>), but in this format, it is not suitable for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:17, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It actually looks like a consensus has not been reached. I have no qualms against improving this article, which I think is always a good idea, but the concept is sound and so if anything should be tagged with a please improve comment rather than just outright deleting it, especially as some took the time and effort to start with probably the right intentions in mind. --<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Grand_Roi_des_Citrouilles_0219.html" title="User:Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles">Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles</a> 13:28, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

We don't need to do it by serving up a mishmash of things which are only related by being fictional and (in the broadest possible sense) a battle. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:43, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is true, however the two anonymous users I have identified as you have both edited your Talk page in the same manner you do when you log in. One of them was also asked a question to which you responded when logged in, which rather cliches the deal in lieu of an IP check which I of course can't do. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 13:20, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is nothing to worry about. I use many public computers, so who knows who uses the same IPs after me. Take care, --<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Grand_Roi_des_Citrouilles_0219.html" title="User:Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles">Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles</a> 13:28, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If everyone claimed this, there would be no way to prevent abusive sockpuppetry. In this case, I would suggest discounting votes by IP addresses. These votes are now of questionable authenticity because of your statement: <i>"I use many public computers, so who knows who uses the same IPs after me."</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:30, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not only that. If I were using a public computer, I'd be stunned if the person who used it after me edited my userpage in much the same way I did. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:20, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, it's a sensible fictional subject to organize into a list, and it's sensibly divided by fictional source rather than indiscriminately merged. The original research problems mentioned above are corrected by editing, annotating, and sourcing the list, and as this list expands and becomes too unwieldy, subsections can be split off into other lists with this as the organizing parent. The list (or sublists that it organizes) can also mention battles that aren't worthy of independent treatment, and redlink articles that should exist. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 04:14, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - having battles in Tolkien and Turtledove rubbing shoulders with the "Battle(s) of Springfield" from the Simpsons is proof that this is an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a>. At most, some of these universes might merit their own "List of battles in X" list, but aside from that it should go. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:46, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That issue would be solved by removing any fictional depictions that don't correspond to the real-world subject as described in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.html" title="Battle">battle</a> article. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 22:26, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not the particular cases I've cited. Per the definition at that article, all three wouldn't get removed. My point, though, is that even with a definition like that, we're looking at an indiscriminate collection of information - how many works of fiction are there (I note sardonically that even Scientological belief is included as a work of fiction, which Scientologists would have fits about)? How many works of fiction contain a battle? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:32, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Delete</b> as indiscriminate collection of information.
