<li><b>Strong Keep</b> in original version. Click on the links to the Google Groups featured in the section titled Sci.Psychology.Psychotherapy in Usenet Environment of Gangs. You will quickly discover that this article in its original form is as factual as any written in Wikipedia. And if the article appears odd, it is only because the article is an accurate reflection of an oddity. The following statement, by contrast, is not a fact but merely an educated opinion: the haste with which "editors" are converging on this article to delete its original form in its entirety, without qualification, discussion, or verification suggests the work of Usenet gangbangers based in none other than (drum roll please) ... sci.psychology.psychotherapy. I am screen capturing all this work, including the date-time stamps, for inclusion in a report to be reviewed by more civilized and educated communities outside Wikipedia.
<p>Also, the acceptable practice is to keep an original article intact pending the outcome of a review such as that prompted by a recommendation for deletion. But James James, and other fly-by-night aliases posing as editors, are engaging in the practice of treating a replacement "stub" as the main page and any effort to restore the original page as "vandalism." This is turning reality on its head. Restore the original page, conduct your research, weigh in on the discussion, and then make any changes (which may include wholesale deletion) based on the outcome of the review. Even the author of the much-maligned John Seigenthaler article was entitled to 132 days of infamy. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.149.8.228 (<a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.149.8.228.html" title="User talk:172.149.8.228">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.149.8.228_e0c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.149.8.228">contribs</a>) 2005-12-27 04:56:33 UTC.</small></p>

<li><a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.usenet.kooks.html" title="Alt.usenet.kooks">alt.usenet.kooks</a> has been around for more than 20 years, and has always been a significant group within the alt hierarchy. Regardless of its content, there's no doubt it merits an article. The same can't be said for this newsgroup. It's probably been around as long or even longer, but if I recall correctly, it was created in a lump with the other groups in the sci hierarchy, and has never been well-known. Thus my suggestion to redirect. It certainly can't remain as an attack piece on another article (as per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 13:35, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Significant? How in the name of John Hinckley is alt.usenet.kooks significant?! Because some Usenetters who founded it 12 years ago (not 20) use spam advertising to recruit aggressors from other news groups? In this way, alt.usenet.kooks is a phenomenon. I give you that. But no editor would ever allow me or anyone else to tack on a criticism or consequences section (without sidelining it within 2 seconds to the Discussion page). This is not an article written out of journalistic objectivity or integrity. It's propaganda.
<p>No one in the civilized world knows Alt.usenet.kooks. It's endemic to Usenet, that is, until this Wikipedia article started showing up in Google searches of the victim's names. That's the whole point of the article.</p>
<p>This is not an attack piece on Alt.usenet.kooks. It is stand alone content, and shares the same verifiability and "significance" as your beloved Alt.usenet.kooks. Interesting how no one is discussing verifiability anymore. Suddenly, verifiability is not a criterion. You must have followed the links and examined the evidence. That being said, I know one thing that is never a criterion in science or journalism: popularity. How well known subject matter is is utterly beside the point.</p>

<li>Does it matter? A scaled-down adaptation titled "Gang Stalking &amp; Usenet" was created as a subsection for the article on Stalking, and it was deleted (labeled spam) by one of the same "administrators" (Karada) who deleted the original version of this article wholesale without due process and without a discussion page. Some Usenet lover posing as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Karada" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Karada" rel="nofollow">Wiki admin</a> is running around protecting an unimpeachable image for a culture (i.e. Usenet) whose effects should be noted.

<li>Good point Cyde, only you are forgetting something. The creator of the original article is not the vandal. There would be no article if it were not for the author. I suggest you treat this article similar to Alt.usenet.kooks. Have a discussion page and a page on which people can permanently challenge the neutrality, but otherwise leave the article intact. Hell -- you can even add qualifying sections to the main page. There are many options besides deletion redirection (AKA deletion by proxy).
<p>A true editor would defer to policy here. Leave original article. Let this mechanism run its course and let's see where the chips fall. I think you are concerned that by the time the dust settles, enough people will have voiced support for the original version to prevent deletion or redirection. Still, I suspect Wiki editors will violate their own policy. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User:67.129.121.254">67.129.121.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User talk:67.129.121.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.129.121.254_9df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.129.121.254">contribs</a>) 2005-12-27 16:49:31 UTC.</small></p>

<li>No, Usenet newsgroups <i>do not</i> deserve articles purely on that basis alone.

<li>The choice is between <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> and an unexpandable directory entry. The article content as it stands is 100% original research, and is, moreover, the spillover from a long-standing conflict on Usenet. The rewritten stub article is a simple "N is a Usenet newsgroup" directory entry. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>, be it of people, companies, web sites, or Usenet newsgroups. For this article to be worthwhile, there needs to be scope for expansion of the article to be <i>more</i> than a simple directory entry. There needs to be secondary source material available that is <i>more substantial</i> than simple directory listings and excerpts from "active" files. Usenet newsgroups that have had non-trivial works published <i>about</i> them (such as FAQs on <a href="http://faqs.org./" class="external text" title="http://faqs.org./" rel="nofollow">faqs.org.</a> for example) qualify for articles on this basis.

<li>True, but then originality should not be penalized if the facts derive from an observation or arithmetic so simple as to be almost assured of a .90 inter-rater reliability coefficient. There's not much interpretation or construction here.
<p>A good encyclopedia does not merely mime or mirror other pre-packaged encyclopedias (e.g. the FAQ list), but transcends it. However, I agree that if one had to choose between a stub-based article and no article at all, I'd choose no article at all. There's nothing good anyone can say about this news group except that it boasts some of the highest traffic and is often listed (lazily I might add) as a "resource" on department of psychology web sites. It is also "captured" (i.e. indexed to the Web) by a number of news readers (more news readers than alt.usenet.kooks). Of course, it's only after I ask news reader admins and psych dept web site admins to examine this news group do they realize they made a mistake listing it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User:67.129.121.254">67.129.121.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User talk:67.129.121.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.129.121.254_9df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.129.121.254">contribs</a>) 19:46, 27 December 2005.</small></p>

<li>Har har. I see Cyde Weys sent me a message in which he threatened to ban me if I persisted in restoring the article to its original draft, which is perfectly acceptable before the due process runs its course. So what's the rush Cyde? Why the hammer? We have a good jump on the process. The system is working according to policy. And the original article is NPOV. So let's wait and see. What are you afraid of? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User:67.129.121.254">67.129.121.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User talk:67.129.121.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.129.121.254_9df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.129.121.254">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>I'll ask this from you only once.

<li>Hey, I didn't drag this unit into the matter. I didn't know it existed until someone referred this page to the countervandalism unit, which was hysterical and inappropriate.

<li><b>Comment</b>. For those of us not involved in the controversy this is very confusing.

Since the war resulted in the creation of SPP.moderated a few years ago, it might deserve to be mentioned in an article about the history of, and justification for, moderated Usenet groups, but probably not otherwise.
