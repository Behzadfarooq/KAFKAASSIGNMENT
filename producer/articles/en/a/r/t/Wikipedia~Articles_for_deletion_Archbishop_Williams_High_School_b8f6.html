<li><b>Keep</b>. Please remember that <b>notability is not a deletion criterion</b>. <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F.</a> <a href="../../../j/d/f/User_talk%7EJdforrester_2f42.html" title="User talk:Jdforrester">(talk)</a> 16:51, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's simply not true. Notability is an established and widely used shorthand that well captures many deletion criteria. Please see my <a href="../../../v/f/d/Wikipedia_talk%7EVfD_decisions_not_backed_by_current_policies_ab58.html" title="Wikipedia talk:VfD decisions not backed by current policies">earlier explanation</a> on this point. See also the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html#Rationale_shorthands" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">guide to VFD shorthands</a>. A strict formalism doesn't accomplish anything here. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 21:32, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the working reference given above is a clear demonstration of the fact that "non-notability" is <i>not</i> a valid deletion criterion. A mere personal shorthand used by <i>some</i> editors is not a policy consensus - as the immediately adjacent reference to "unencyclopedic" even more clearly shows. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 23:58, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. Postdlf, what you 'understand' to be policy may just possibly not actually <i>be</i> policy.&#160;:-) I would agree, however, that it is indeed erroneously becoming "established" - this is exactly what I'm trying to fix. <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F.</a> <a href="../../../j/d/f/User_talk%7EJdforrester_2f42.html" title="User talk:Jdforrester">(talk)</a> 00:03, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since when did we need a policy consensus on what words we could use to express ourselves on VfD pages? It's the substance that matters, and the substance of "not notable" is not only always tied to specific deletion criteria, it often overlaps more than one. I went into quite a bit of detailed explanation to show how notability is at the heart of at least most of the deletion criteria—can you elaborate on "no, you're wrong," or "no, we never approved that word for expressive usage"? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 04:40, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Umm, whut? Where on Earth did you get the impression that I was objecting to the word? I'm pointing out that notability - the concept, not the word - is not a ground for deletion. You can bend over backwards to show that other people have been using it as such, and indeed this is helpful to show where people have erred, but they are using it wrongly. There are many occassions when things that are unnotable <i>also</i> aren't suitable for the encyclopædia, but this is <i>not</i> a causal link. <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F.</a> <a href="../../../j/d/f/User_talk%7EJdforrester_2f42.html" title="User talk:Jdforrester">(talk)</a> 12:59, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you're still missing the whole thrust of what I was saying, but let's drop it here. If you want to take the time to explain to me what specifically you disagree with as to how nonnotable things <i>always</i> fall under one or more of the stated deletion criteria, please do so on my talk page. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 17:31, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
