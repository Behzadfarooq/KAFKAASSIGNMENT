<p>This article was created by <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrummerThanThou_10f7.html" title="User:FrummerThanThou">User:FrummerThanThou</a> on 28 November, 2006, to tout a yet-to-be created and dubious "<a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi_Judaism_f269.html" title="Haredi Judaism">Haredi</a>" airline in Israel. (At the same time an anonymous user added information to the <a href="../../../l/e/v/Lev_Leviev_ea46.html" title="Lev Leviev">Lev Leviev</a> article that Leviev is founding NeshAir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lev_Leviev&amp;diff=90785159&amp;oldid=90784914" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lev_Leviev&amp;diff=90785159&amp;oldid=90784914" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which User:Frummer affirmed adding Leviev's interests in "aviation" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lev_Leviev&amp;diff=90883359&amp;oldid=90785159" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lev_Leviev&amp;diff=90883359&amp;oldid=90785159" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and the <i>only</i> mention of "Leviev and NeshAir" on Google is a link to the Leviev article on Wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Leviev+NeshAir&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Leviev+NeshAir&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) So we go full circle and Wikipedia thus becomes the ONLY source for all this baloney as Wikipedians and the world are "taken for a (sky) ride" on "NeshAir"! All this is highly suspicious and violates a number of things. A simple Google search shows exactly <b>three</b> hits for a "NeshAir" airline <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=NeshAir&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=NeshAir&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, the first being its own one web page ad for itself <a href="http://www.neshair.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.neshair.com/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, and the other two are links to Wikipedia: this article, and its mention in the <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Al_26f7.html" title="El Al">El Al</a> article, also inserted by User:FrummerThanThou <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=El_Al&amp;diff=93760402&amp;oldid=93378732" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=El_Al&amp;diff=93760402&amp;oldid=93378732" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> into which he added: "...This resulted in the leading <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi.html" title="Haredi">Haredi</a> rabbis such as <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi_Kanievsky_589c.html" title="Rabbi Kanievsky">Rabbi Kanievsky</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliashiv.html" title="Eliashiv">Eliashiv</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aron_Leib_Steinman_2cc7.html" title="Aron Leib Steinman">Aron Leib Steinman</a> to proclaim a boycott on the airline and promoting the new Haredi Neshair airline. <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1164881870575&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull" class="external text" title="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1164881870575&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull" rel="nofollow">jpost.com</a>" HOWEVER a careful reading of the jpost.com article reveals ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION of "Neshair" - so what we have here is Wikipedia helping to promote a lie about something that does not exist.

<li>Have you read it at all Frummer? It's about how you have tried to create PR for a company that does not exist and unfortunately it fits into a pattern of how you operate, and all I have done is state the places where you have caused much trouble. Unfortunately, based on all these cases, I have concluded that you are a menace to Wikipedia, based in <i>your</i> actions and activities.

It's relevant here, because this is part of a series of his deliberate disruptions of Wikipedia. So does anyone who puts up exactly one incomplete "under construction" web page with no information on it, have the right to have a Wikipedia article based on it? You make no sense. Did you notice that he lied when adding: "...and promoting the new Haredi Neshair airline..." in the <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Al_26f7.html" title="El Al">El Al</a> article (which is a serious article) when no such thing happened? Kindly do not vote on a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kneejerk" class="extiw" title="wikt:kneejerk">kneejerk</a> basis merely for the sake of disagreeing with me because this is not about <i>me</i>.

<li>Hi Mets: Don't misunderstand me. Notch it up to my sense of mercy that I have not gone the RFC route at this time, which I consider to be a very serious procedure. I would much prefer that User:FrummerThanThou would moderate his ways and avoid his irresponsible style of editing and writing , with which I have unfortunately become well-acquainted in recent weeks. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 06:32, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>IZAK: Suggesting that someone gets blocked is also very serious, as you have done with frummer. I had a conversation with him last night...he seems like a nice guy, although a little misguided lately. I think he needs a break for a bit, but not a block. Weren't you blocked in the past? I'm sure it wasn't fun. As such, stating that he should be blocked might not be considered mercy as you were in that situation. C'mon...it's the holiday season. This isn't necessary right now. =) <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 13:13, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi Mets: Sure he's a nice guy, that's not the issue, it's his wild pattern of editing, writing, nominating, and un-nominating articles relating to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> back and forth, that I have had the dubious pleasure of having to struggle with. I am not judging him as a person, I am judging his work, that's all. Furthermore, it is out of a sense of responsibility and of not wishing to see Wikipedia and its Jewish content articles mangled (as Frummer tends to do) that I am keeping a careful watch on what he does with Judaic articles. I can't watch his edits to non-Jewish articles, let other people take him up on that. And as for my history on Wikipedia, I started in December of 2002, four years ago <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aryeh_Kaplan&amp;oldid=536245" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aryeh_Kaplan&amp;oldid=536245" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and at that time we had a number of virulent and scheming <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemites</a> who were sabotaging Jewish and Israeli articles and in the course of a bloody slug fest over a long time I got blocked for about a week for repeatedly calling them antisemites. (Since then I am NOT <i>that</i> blunt, as there are more ways than one to skin a cat), and eventually a few of those characters were in turn blocked and banned for a long time as their true colors and Jew-hatred eventually did them in -- so I don't think that you or Frummer want to be gloating in their company -- nor do I suggest that <i>anyone</i> open that can of worms, they'll just get burned (by the worms&#160;;-})! And yes, Happy <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah.html" title="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a> to all! <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 14:24, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi IZAK: I am definitely not gloating in anyone's company and this is not about anti-semitism. This is about how you tend to lose control way too much. Instead of jumping on someone, why don't you take the time to find out what the problem is, instead of plastering it all over wikipedia. Obviously, if someone is deliberately causing problems (i.e. frummer), then they should be dealt with in the proper forum. This is an AfD, not The Jerry Springer Show. Anyway, my email is on here so maybe we should continue this through there. All I can see of our debate is just clutter. And also a Merry <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>! <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 15:03, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>... the article makes a nice-looking, <i>i.e.</i>, well-formed, stub, but it fails even the most basic criteria for notability. It is not an Israeli airline as the article asserts, it is, rather, an airline <i>idea</i>. That's nice, but unless it gains notability [which it has not] for being an idea, failed or otherwise, it's not valid article material. I wish the idea the best of luck, and once it takes off [pun intended], I'll be more than happy to support the article, even as a stub. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 02:08, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
