<p>OpenSky is a project to design and build a working version of the fictional "mehve" glider familiar from the anime cartoon <a href="../../../n/a/u/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_1fe5.html" title="Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind">Nausicaä</a>.

<p><b>The Bidhannagar College (B.N.C.)</b>, the youngest government college in West Bengal, India, had a small beginning with 52 students on June 25, 1984 in a school building at 142 BF Block, Salt Lake City, Kolkata - 700064, which is now the head office of West Bengal University of Technology (W.B.U.T.) But from its inception the College was modelled as a centre of academic excellence. The collge has been sifted to ite new address to solve the problem of running out of space.</p>
<p>Affiliated to the University of Calcutta as an under-graduate college, it has been admitting Honours students only. The College started functioning with the following Science Honours subjects - Physics, Chemistry ( though the admission were started from 1985-86 session), Mathematics, Economics and the Humanities Honours subjects - English, Bengali, History, Political Science and Philosophy. Honours courses in Zoology and Statistics started from 1997- 1998 and 2000-2001 academic session respectively. Honours courses in Botany and Microbiology were opened during 2002-2003. From 2005-2006 academic session the college is alos offering the post graduate courses in Micro-Biology under University of Calcutta.</p>
<p>Now a days B.N.C. is in the top 5 colleges among all colleges under University of Calcutta. Most of the departments have significant ranks in the Merit List of the University. The students of this youngest college are in IITs, IIMs, DSE, JNU, ISI, IISC, TIFR, IGIDR and many more prestigeous institutions doing their higher studies and reserach. Many students are in significant positions in corporate worlds and administration.</p>
<p>The new three storied magnificient building, constructed at a cost of Rs 6.4268 crores, has an area of about 70,000 square feet. This new building is meant for the Science departments only. But at present the Humanities departments, the Library, and the Administrative wing have also been temporarily accomodated in the present building. Permanent acomodation for these sections in another building is under consideration.

<p>Leeds Fed was formed in 1974 by a number of smaller associations coming together to form a 'federation', for the benefit of the community. The idea was that by working together they could achieve more than as separate organisations. That philosophy has prevailed throughout Leeds Fed's history, with partnerships and joint working arrangements being a common feature of its work over the years.</p>
<p>The Association grew quickly through the 1970's and early 1980's with a lot of pre 1919 stock. New build development was undertaken through Leeds Partnership Homes during the early 1990's, leading to the present day where our 4,300 homes are roughly half pre 1919 stock and half new build stock.</p>
<p>Most of its homes are in Leeds, but through the 1990's they started developing outside Leeds and now have around 400 homes in Harrogate and 100 in Wakefield.</p>
<p>The association's aim is to provide a benefit to the whole community through the provision of housing and associated services. Most of its services are directed at renting homes people want to live in, for less than they could be rented from the private sector. However through supported housing it also provide services specifically designed to help people with particular needs, for example older people, people with disabilities (physical or mental), refugees and women fleeing domestic violence. Around 550 homes are used for supported housing helping people, as far as is possible, live independently within the local community.</p>
<p>The Association engages in regeneration in the communities where we have stock, in order to help change communities to become places where people will choose to live.</p>
<p>Leeds Fed is located at Arthington House 30 Westfield Road Leeds LS3 1DE</p>
<p>The current Chief Executive is Mathew Walker, and Chair is Martin Dean</p>

<p>The complex is the gateway for pyruvate, the three carbon unit derived from the oxidation of glucose in glycolysis, to enter the mitochondrial matrix as Acetyl CoA for further oxidation in the citric acid cycle. The complex consists of three enzyme catalyzed reactions from pyruvate decarboxylase, dihydrolipoamide transacetylase, and diydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. The byproduct of the reaction is CO2 and the reduced conzyme NADH which will be oxidized in complex I of the electron transport chain.</p>

<p>“I’m My Own Grandpa” is an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_song.html" title="Popular song">popular song</a> written in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> by Moe Jaffe and Dwight Latham (aka Lonzo and Oscar)</p>
<p>The song tells the story of a man who marries a widow with a grown up daughter. The daughter then marries the man’s father, so that his step-daughter is now his step-mother, and his father is now his step-son-in-law.</p>
<p>The man’s wife then has a baby, who is the brother-in-law of the man’s father, since he is married to the baby boy’s older sister. This means the man’s son is his uncle, by virtue of being his step-mother’s half-brother.</p>
<p>To complicate matters further, the man’s father’s wife has a son who, in addition to being the man’s half-brother, is also his grandson – by virtue of being his step-daughter’s child.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, because his step-daughter is also his step-mother, that makes the man’s wife his step-grandmother, by virtue of being the mother of his step-mother. This means the man is his wife’s grandchild.</p>
<p>Thus, as husband of his step-grandmother, he is his own grandpa!</p>

<p>The President’s Hundred is a marksmanship award for placing in the top one hundred in the NRA’s Presidents Match each year at Camp Perry, Ohio. The President’s Match, created in 1957, awards the top 100 contestants the President's Hundred Medal. They may also wear the President's Hundred Tab, created in 1958. The tab is among a few achievement tabs, also including Special Forces, Ranger, and Sapper tabs. The President’s Hundred is quite rare because only the current top one hundred are allowed to wear the tab. In other words, new members must usurp the old ones. There are both rifle and pistol matches during competition. According to Master Sgt. Mark Bearnson, NCOIC of the First Army’s Small Arms Readiness Group,“People who earn it take a lot of pride in it, and try to qualify as many times as they can.” Both civilians and soldiers may wear the tab.</p>

<p>Malcolm Frager was born in St. Louis on January 15, 1935 (according to a typescript autobiography by Frager) and died June 20, 1991 (Berkshire Eagle Friday June 21, 1991). Frager began studying piano at six and debuted with the St. Louis Symphony when only ten years old. When fourteen, he moved to New York City and began study with Carl Friedberg. He became an internationally recognized pianist after winning the Leventritt Award in 1959 and first prize in the Queen Elizabeth of Belgium Competition in 1960. Frager pursued an extremely active career around the world and was particularly popular in Europe and the former Soviet Union. In addition to his concert activities, he was also a very active scholar, concerned with the historical study of the piano repertoire, particularly Robert Schumann. In 1967 he rediscovered the manuscript of the original version of Schumann's piano concerto and in 1978 discovered a cache of manuscript of eighteenth and nineteenth century composers, thought to have been lost during World War II. Frager was also very active as a judge in music competitions and served on the visiting committee of Eastman School of Music.</p>

<p>Employed by the Bio Zoids of the Zoids: Genesis series Hell Armor is probably the strongest armor in all of the Zoids series. While there is not much known about the armor itself it is known that it is immune to energy attacks and isn't even phased by projectile munitions. The only thing ever known to be able to penetrate the Hell Armor is a substance in the show called Metal Zi. Which is a very rare metal on the Planet Zi so the only practical use of it is in Melee weapons like the Murasame Sword on the Murasame Liger.</p>

<p>Also known as The Voice of Reason or King A-JAX, Preston rose to fame from the ashes of Moultrie, a small town in South Georgia. He still resides there, says it gives the local residents hope for a brighter tomorrow. Preston is the leader of the worlds greatest gang, A-JAX, and often eats dogs just to see kids cry. Many find it hard to look directly at him, for the sheer brilliance of his face often blinds the timid and frail. If you want to talk to him call 229-891-****, but be warned, the sound of his voice is so reasonable that it could(and likely will) damage your eardrums permanantly. Seriously, don't call that number. Preston is destined for even greater things in his life, and you may ask yourself "what else is there for him to do?" or "how can someone who has reached the pinnacle of greatness push forth to an even higher level, how is that possible?" Well it just is.</p>

Many of his works are featured in public collections throughout Japan. In 2002, Okazaki participated in the Venice Biennale as the director of the Japanese pavilion of the International Architecture Exhibition.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-19_d796.html" title="Edit section: Theatre @ Risk">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theatre @ Risk</span></h2>
<p>Theatre @ Risk has been creating a diverse range of innovative new performance works since 2001, presenting the latest cutting edge local and international theatrical texts. Theatre @ Risk's focus is on work that is brave and inventive, that challenges audiences’ expectations, that is dynamic and entertaining whilst being actively engaged in social and political debate.</p>
<p>Theatre @ Risk has proven its key role in the Melbourne arts scene over the past five years, as a principal developer and creator of new work. Its work has been repeatedly acclaimed for its strong production values, imaginative staging, outstanding performers, and a consistently innovative, varied and challenging repertoire of work.</p>
<p>== Theatre @ Risk Past Productions ==</p>
<p><b>One Way Street</b> By David Greig With Simon Kingsley Hall Directed By Chris Bendall Produced by Kirrilly Brentnall</p>
<p>Designed by Isla Shaw Lighting by Nick Merrylees Music by Kelly Ryall</p>
<p><br />
“What David Greig has written and Simon Kingsley Hall performs with elan and warmth, under the unobtrusive direction of Chris Bendall, is not only a city symphony for different voices, past and present, but also a contemporary and messy love story and a high-class entertainment” Sunday Age, 12/2/06</p>
<p>“Simon Kingsley Hall’s solo performance is energetic and mesmerizing… This is writing at its very best and it is wonderfully brought to life by the creative team… If you are interested in experiencing a night of innovative and stimulating theatre where all the elements – writing, performance, direction, video, set, lighting and sound work together then One Way Street is a must” Melbournestage.com.au 9/2/06</p>
<p>“David Greig’s writing is sharp and funny… Kingsley Hall’s acting is skilful in its lightning-fast alternations of character and accent… Within the context of contemporary Europe, this is a particularly resonant theme, resonant with global significance in a world of permeable national borders.” The Age, 9/2/06</p>
<p><b>The Woman Before</b> By Roland Schimmelpfennig With James Wardlaw, Carolyn Bock, Heather Bolton, Paul Ashcroft, Katherine Anderson Directed by Chris Bendall, Produced by Kirrilly Brentnall</p>
<p>Originally performed 4–20 November 2005 at Fortyfivedownstairs</p>
<p>Designed by Peter Corrigan Music composed and performed live by Phil McLeod Sound design by Kelly Ryall Lighting by Nick Merrylees Stage Manager Jo Mullins</p>
<p>“Yet again, Theatre@risk occupies the cutting edge of contemporary Melbourne theatre with this thriller from one of Germany's most-performed playwrights, Roland Schimmelpfennig. A sharp, tight script; a many-layered performance style that references Greek tragedy and film noir; intelligent and imaginative direction from Chris Bendall; and subtle performances from the five actors contribute to the enormous enjoyment.”</p>
<p>“Lighting that silhouettes figures both in and out of the action, and moody cello music played by composer Phil Mcleod, build suspense.”</p>
<p>“Bolton gives a wonderfully chilling performance — in an almost deadpan rendition of obsession that can only be understood by her actions, not her words or her facial expression. The confused Frank has too few clues to read her correctly. Wardlaw gives the character just the right touch of ultimately fatal indecisiveness.” Helen Thomson, THE AGE, November 8, 2005</p>
<p><b>Stalking Matilda</b> By Tee O’Neill With Jude Beaumont, Irene Dios, Odette Joannidis, Rob Jordan, Toby Newton, Jeremy Stanford Directed by Chris Bendall</p>
<p>Originally performed 6 –21 August 2005 at Theatreworks</p>
<p>Set &amp; Costume Designer: Kellee Frith Lighting Designer: Nick Merrylees Original Music &amp; Sound Design: Kelly Ryall Movement Consultant: Simon Kingsley Hall Stage Manager: Genevieve Cizevskis Producer &amp; Photography: Kirrilly Brentnall</p>
<p>“Flawless troupe... Hunt this one down right now." – Inpress, 2005</p>
<p>“Jude Beaumont is outstanding as Matilda” – The Age, 2005</p>
<p>"A carnival like set, limbo competition and jaunty soundtrack combine with O'Neill's snappy dialogue to set the tone for the rest of the performance - proving that a moral tale is a squillion times more effective when it's told in an abstract way with irony and satire” – Inpress, 2005</p>
<p>“Now in its fifth year, Theatre@Risk remains true to its manifesto of producing theatre that's left of mainstream and politically conscious. The company prides itself on trying new ideas in form and content and deliberately shies away from narrative orthodoxy. Stalking Matilda fulfils all such criteria.” – The Australian, 2005</p>
<p>“While Stalking Matilda explores the popular theme of asylum seekers seen in an increasing number of recent productions, much credit must be given for its original composition.” – State of The Art, 2005</p>
<p>“Theatre@Risk has once again produced a keen-edged and incisive investigation of local and international politics and the pressures which place both social and personal ties in crisis.” Realtime, 2005</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Wall Project</b> By Ben Ellis, Tee O’Neill &amp; Tom Wright With Ernie Gray, Odette Joannidis, Simon Kingsley Hall, Anastasia Malinoff &amp; Jesse Spence Directed by Chris Bendall</p>
<p>Originally performed 2 -5 June 2005 at fortyfive downstairs</p>
<p>Producer: Kirrilly Brentnall Set &amp; Costume Design: Isla Shaw Lighting Design: Adam Howe Original Music &amp; Sound Composition: Kelly Ryall Stage Manager: Phillip Costello</p>
<p>“Theatre @ Risk has proved itself to be one of the most important independent theatre companies in Australia right now.” - John Bailey, Beat, 2005</p>
<p>“The stories themselves are absorbing, and the many links with contemporary political life become more and more obvious. But it is the synergy set up by the actors, slipping in and out of different roles along with their rudimentary costumes, that energises the whole piece, and makes such a risky proposition succeed.” Helen Thomson, The Age, June 6 2005</p>
<p><br />
<b>7 DAYS 10 YEARS</b> by Louis Milutinovic with Larissa Gallagher, Ernie Gray, Simon Kingsley Hall, Odette Joannidis, Laura Lattuada, Anastasia Malinoff, Steve Mouzakis &amp; Sergio Tell directed by Chris Bendall produced by Kirrilly Brentnall</p>
<p>Originally performed 6 November – 21 November 2004 at Theatreworks</p>
<p>Set &amp; Costume Design: Peter Corrigan Lighting Design: Nick Merrylees Original Music &amp; Sound Composition: Phil McLeod Stage Manager: Sarah Blakely Production Manager: Emily O’Brien</p>
<p>‘7 Days 10 Years is an absorbing play that receives from [director] Chris Bendall and Theatre@Risk a full-blooded, thought-provoking and powerful dramatisation. Fine acting from this hard-working cast contributes enormously to the play's emotional impact.’ Helen Thomson, The Age, November 9, 2004</p>
<p>“A night of theatre about the Balkan wars doesn't sound like an attractive proposition but Theatre@Risk's production manages to be entertaining without compromising on its vehement anti-war message. 7 Days 10 Years's exploration into the casualties of war is powerful drama.” The Australian, November 8, 2004</p>
<p><br />
<b>Terrorrism</b> by the Presnyakov Brothers Translated by Sasha Dugdale With Paul Denny, Julie Eckersley, Luke Elliot, Lyndal Hall, Sophie Kelly, Romy Loor, Adam May &amp; Paul Reichstein Directed by Victor Bizzotto</p>
<p>Originally performed 26 August - 12 September 2004 at Fortyfivedownstairs</p>
<p>Set Design: Douglas Iain Smith Costume Design: Ellen Turner</p>
<p>Lighting Design: Nick Merrylees Original Music &amp; Sound Composition: Kelly Ryall Producer: Chris Bendall Stage Manager: Jo Roberts</p>
<p>“Terrorism continues Theatre @ Risk’s penchant for producing disjointed, stridently political and non-naturalistic drama. Poised on the edge of hysteria or paranoia… the eight person ensemble offers energy and grim humour, while the complimentary set and music score are well crafted” Thuy On, The Australian</p>
<p>“Terrorism has a tension and edginess not often seen in our local writing, which requires, and gets from Victor Bizzotto’s tight direction, ensemble work of a high standard… This is a play and an excellent production, that send us off into the night in a disturbingly thoughtful frame of mind, thanks again to Theatre @ Risk’s enterprising charter.” Helen Thomson, The Age</p>
<p><br />
<b>ARABIAN NIGHT</b> by Roland Schimmelpfennig translated by David Tushingham With Joshua Hewitt, Odette Joannides, Josephine Keen, Rob Meldrum &amp; David Michel Directed by Chris Bendall</p>
<p>Originally performed 10 February – 22 February 2004 at Fortyfivedownstairs</p>
<p>Set Design: Danielle Harrisson Costume Design: Emily Barrie Lighting Design: Marco Respondeck Original Music &amp; Sound Design: Kelly Ryall Producer Simon Kingsley Hall Stage Manager: Caitlin Nunn Production Manager: Emily O’Brien</p>
<p>“Arabian Night is theatre careening at top speed down narrow streets, laughing at scared pedestrians and flipping the finger to its red faced pursuers. Its a show that impresses through sheer velocity. There will be few unimpressed by this dense, eerie production." John Bailey, Beat, 2004</p>
<p>"Arabian Night is a delight; that rare and exciting phenomenon, something that stretches the imagination in unexpected ways... Once again we owe thanks to a fringe company for a glimpse of some of the most exciting contemporary drama from outside Australia." Helen Thomson, The Age, 2004</p>
<p>“Arabian Night is a highly evocative production. Theatre@Risk’s staging represents a triumph for Bendall and the actors, particularly Josephine Keen and stalwart Robert Meldrum.” Realtime, 2004</p>
<p>"Arabian Night.... is an all-round winner. From eerie sound and music composition to inspired direction and consistently bold performances from the amazing cast. Theatre @ Risk's production is quite possibly unlike anything you've seen before. You really will leave the performance feeling as if you've just woken from a strange and exquisite dream." Louise Jones, Inpress, 2004</p>
<p><br />
<b>STITCHING</b> By Anthony Neilson With Simon Kingsley Hall &amp; Alexandra Schepisi Directed by Lauren Taylor</p>
<p>Originally performed 19 November – 7 December at Black Box, Victorian Arts Centre</p>
<p>Lighting Design: Ben Chessell Sound Design: Jethro Woodward Set Design: Ronan Moss Costume Design: Ellen Turner Musicians: Jerome Haoust &amp; James Cathcart Producer: Chris BendallStage Manager: Berni Sweeney</p>
<p>"Theatre @ Risk has a reputation for presenting edgy, experimental produtions that deliberately confound form and content, and its latest effort is a perfect example of its artistic manifesto... Stitching will not appeal to the mass market (it has no desire to) but if you can see past the nasty elements its dissection of sex and relationship has contemporary resonance" Thuy On, The Australian, 2003</p>
<p>"Stitching showcases the extraordinary acting talent of Alexandra Schepisi. Theatre@Risk looks set to remain one of the forerunners of Melbourne's independent theatre scene for some time to come." Artshub , 2003</p>
<p><br />
<b>BABEL TOWERS</b> devised by the company With Simon Kingsley, Adam Mcconvell, Steve Mouzakis, Elena Pellone &amp; Alex Schepisi Directed by Chris Bendall</p>
<p>Originally performed 25 June – 6 July 2003 at Black Box, Victorian Arts Centre</p>
<p>Text &amp; Dramaturgy: Polash Larsen Original Music &amp; Sound Design: Kelly Ryall Video Designer &amp; Choreography: Louise Taube Set Design: Penelope Thomson Costume Design: Emily Barrie Lighting Design: Rob Irwin Stage Manager: Caitlin Nunn</p>
<p>“Through large doses of humour and satire, Babel Towers manages to be both a highly theatrical and very engaging new work dealing with a difficult and challenging theme about mandatory detention of asylum seekers.” Steven Fennelly, Radio 774, 2003</p>
<p>“Theatre@Risk have been around for a little while now, and have established a reputation for outstanding performances and choice of works. The comedy in Babel Towers is very well handled, and works best at its most slapstick and physical moments with comic timing sharpened to a fine point.” John Bailey, Beat, 2003</p>
<p>“Babel Towers is a powerful and important new Australian work of social commentary. Were this piece performed in the prohibitive world it depicts, its performers would be arrested for subversion. Performances are raw, intense and energetic.” Craig Martin, Stageleft, 2003</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Jungle</b> by Louis Nowra With Diana Emery, Anthony Johnson, Simon Kingsley, Louis Milutinovic, Eva Parkin &amp; Greg Ulfan Directed by Chris Bendall</p>
<p>Originally performed 17 August – 2 September 2001 at Black Box, Victorian Arts Centre</p>
<p>Design: Karyn Hunter Sound Design: Ben Bourke Lighting Design: Rob Irwin Original Music: Daniel Dinnen Stage Manager: Maureen Thomas</p>
<p>“Bursts through naturalism’s boundaries by sheer force of style, speed, imagination and shock tactics… This exhilarating theatre owes much to the performers whose work is enormously physical, their bodies pushed to perform the substance-enhanced feats of a bunch of crazies that match the on-speed dialogue…This is not mainstream theatre. It is, in its unique way, more exciting than that, more on the edge, raw and sometimes rough.” Helen Thompson, The Age, 2001</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Spectular</b> By David Greig With Jessamy Dyer, Josephine Keen, Simon Kingsley, Adam McConvell, Louis Milutinovic, Elena Pellone, Hunter Perske, Claire Powell &amp; James Saunders Directed by Chris Bendall</p>
<p>Originally performed 16 August - 1 September 2002 at Black Box, Victorian Arts Centre</p>
<p>Set Design: Emily Barrie Costume Design: Ellen Turner Lighting Design: Nick Merrylees Sound Design &amp; Original Music Composition: Kelly Ryall Stage Manager: Emma Beaurepaire</p>
<p>“Fine performances from this hard-working cast… an ambitious big picture work that embraces comedy, farce, satire and social analysis” – Stephen Carroll, Sunday Age, 2002</p>
<p><br />
<b>Polygraph</b> by Robert Lepage and Marie Brassard with Amanda Hulme, Simon Kingsley &amp; Louis Milutinovic Directed by Chris Bendall</p>
<p><br />

<p>Design: Amanda Silk Lighting Design: Nick Merrylees Sound Design: Lydia Teychenne &amp; Danielle Harrisson Stage Manager: Maureen Thomas Production Manager: Lee Young</p>
<p>“This is vital, audacious theatre and Melbourne could do with more of it.” Beat Magazine, 2001</p>
<p>“Theatre@Risk might just restore our faith in theatre.” Herald Sun, 2001</p>
<p>“Visually striking, infused with passion and poetic flair, compelling and very funny… Theatre@risk displays the energy and confidence of a company worth watching.” The Sunday Age, 2001</p>
<p>“A vigorous success: clever, disturbing and fun. Hulme and Kingsley are flawless and are the stars of a night that looks very promising for the future of Theatre@Risk.” The Age, 2001</p>

They are two aging yuppies keeping their college friendship alive by leaving their wives behind at least once a year and taking to the woods and trails of some of the most beautiful places around the globe. On their yearly adventures Dennis' brother, Kevin Whitley usually accompanies them and together the trio have backpacked and hiked some of the most beautiful and pristine areas on the planet.</p>
<p>The Trail Starts Here&#160;! Our mission is to promote wilderness travel and provide a forum for backpackers, hikers, trail runners, mountain bikers and other trail adventurers from around the world to share their stories and experiences from the trail.</p>

<p>The idea for this website was inspired by our own desire to travel to the popular (and not so popular) hiking trails and back country destinations across the globe and share our stories with others.</p>

<p>Gongsun Zan seeing he could gain victory during this era decided to secure himself. He built a capital city called Yijing where he built many large towers on top of many moods where he and his generals lived. There was ten mounts around the city and the towers had iron doors with huge grain supplies for Zan to use to live out the civil wars of his country.</p>
<p>Zan decided to let his troops out his fortress fight for them self thinking they would see the only option they had was to fight hard, in-stand they killed there generals and surround or died easily while fighting. In time Yuan Shao's army reached the gates of Yiling but, the city withstood several attacks form the Yuan's army for years till 198AD.</p>
<p>Gongsun Zan sent his son Gongsun Xu to receive help form rebels in the Taihang Mountains in Heishan. The idea to attack Jizhou and cut off Yuan's line of retreat forcing him to abandoned the siege. The first stages of the plan went well with Zhang Yan agreeing to help Zan but, after that the plan charge to saving Yijing. With 100,00 men on the way sent a message to his son telling him to lay an ambush of 5,000 elite cavalry on low ground north of the city, thy werwe to signal Zan to escape with his troops out of the city.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Yuan Shao's troops caught the massager and laid there own troops in ambush, signal Zan and then routed his unit forcing him back into the city. Yuan's troops followed up there victory by digging tunnels under the city then supporting them with beams which they later torched. The tunnel went into the center of the city and collapsed under Zan tower causing it to begin to collapse. Accounts state that Zan killed his family but, vary on to weither he committed suicide or was murder before he was able to burn himself to death along with his tower.</p>

<p>A founding member of the seminal speed metal titans Dark Angel, lead guitarist Jim Durkin is largely credited to writing many of the band's songs on their first three albums <a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Have_Arrived_ccc8.html" title="We Have Arrived">We Have Arrived</a> (1985 Azra/Axe killer Records) <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkness_Descends_2567.html" title="Darkness Descends">Darkness Descends</a> (1986 Combat) and <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leave_Scars_a2b7.html" title="Leave Scars">Leave Scars</a> (1989 Combat). He formed and helped shape the band with his aggressive take on heavy thrash laden guitar riffs and lead melodies (assumedly influenced by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Page_70e6.html" title="Jimmy Page">Jimmy Page</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>) from 1981 until his departure from the band in 1989 (replaced by Brett Erickson just in time for Live Scars). He later admitted in an interview that his true reason for leaving was because of the poor business deal with Combat Records that had left him penniless, and never to make money on the sales of his albums on that label.</p>
<p>Later on Durkin tried to resurface in music with a band called Dreams of Damnation in 1992, (which was as chainsawing and brutal as anything his previous band had done) however even though recording a demo that year, the timing wasn't right and the project was shelved for several years. Durkin was later influenced by members of the Swedish speed metal band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Haunted_214f.html" title="The Haunted">The Haunted</a> to continue playing music, and in 2000 he reformed the band with a new line-up and recorded their debut album Let the Violence Begin .</p>
<p>Jim also attempted to reform <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Angel_%28band%29_a2d5.html" title="Dark Angel (band)">Dark Angel</a> as well in 2002, however when he couldn't recruit the services of original vocalist Don Doty and bassist Rob Yahn , he handed the reunion reigns over to friends and other members drummer <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Hoglan_c658.html" title="Gene Hoglan">Gene Hoglan</a>, (<a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28band%29.html" title="Death (band)">Death</a> , <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testament_%28band%29.html" title="Testament (band)">Testament</a> , <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Man%27s_Child_8db8.html" title="Old Man's Child">Old Man's Child</a> , <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strapping_Young_Lad_d063.html" title="Strapping Young Lad">Strapping Young Lad</a> ) vocalist <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Rinehart_ed89.html" title="Ron Rinehart">Ron Rinehart</a> and second guitarist Eric Meyer (which later fizzeled out when Rinehart suffered a major neck injury).</p>
<p>Currently Durkin is pursuing Dreams of Damnation with the recent release of the band's second album, Epic Tales of Vengeance (2006, Say it in Blood Records) on his own label, (which in the future he plans for it to carry even more bands) and doing with a whole new line-up, and surprizingly including a new female vocalist Loana dP Valencia . The band is currently supporting the album with live shows in venues along the west coast.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-19_d796.html" title="Edit section: St. Paul Open School">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">St. Paul Open School</span></h2>
<p>St. Paul Open School was established back in the mid-70s in a red-brick warehouse without playgrounds on a busy commercial street as an alternative education experiment. Moved several times in its life, the small school still exists today in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Right from the very beginning, Open School attracted misfits. Talented but individualistic students who had the capability to succeed, but did not fit neatly into the traditional school mode. Open School promised just that – an open style education. A free-for-all of knowledge. Students, guided by parent and teacher-counselors picked their own classes, studied their own subjects and learned at their own pace. Teachers, parents and people from the outside community taught classes. Students did not have a home-room. Grades did not share the same schedule. There were no structured grades. You graduated when it was time to move on and when a set of specific core competencies (like reading, ‘riting and ‘rithmetic) were accomplished.</p>
<p>Though liberalism in the 70s was waning, shocked by the Kennedy and King assassinations, initially the school was very much an icon of the progressive education movement. It was the hippie school then. Even with 500 children from kindergarten to grade 12, there was no playground. A small park with a pond across the busy commercial street in front would have to suffice. The neighbors were sad office buildings, hanging on from the 50s. The back yard was a parking lot, fenced in to provide some semblance of a schoolyard for the dispatch and collection of children by yellow buses and moms in station wagons. Industrial business adorned the street behind the first school. Semi-trucks came and went all day, amid a constant stream of teenagers walking to local shops and bus stops.</p>
<p>And yet, this was a magical place. A place of learning. A place of popping bright exposure to man’s accomplishments and understandings. A Soho artist’s loft of color, imagination, experiment and freedom, plopped down into a business district and overrun with kids in patched jeans with long hair, beads and saying things like “peace, man.” It was a harvest of gold.</p>
<p>Four stories of once empty warehouse converted to two long corridors of activities on each floor. A carpeted lobby held large carpeted blocks for no other reason than to break-up the space and create multi-levels for the kids to hang out. And hang-out they did. The school was going at all hours. Students had to be shooed away. Tours of the curious from far and wide ran all day. Like the business around it, the converted warehouse was a beehive of activity. Whether your schedule brought you to the building or not, students stopped by, just to check-in or lunch in the basement cafeteria.</p>
<p>“Home Ec” was a single kitchen and sewing area in the first corridor on the right. Administration offices shared the opposite side of the lobby. Most of the younger kids activities were on the first floor. Woodworking (and other shops, such as they were), shared the basement with the cafeteria. Nothing was special about the food. No macro-biotic diets here. Just the same bland school food. The Math department with its knee-high main student body and a desk-like computer terminal spitting out the dot-to-dot pointillism of modern Snoopy art, occupied the other side of the corridor, opposite Home Ec. With match, Home Ec, children and Administration, much of the first floor was a place to be ignored by the teenagers and young adults. The lobby and the fourth floor were the places to hang out.</p>
<p>Courses were open to all ages. Once started, some ran forever. One was Human Sexuality, Tuesdays and Thursdays. A hit with kids from the middle grades to young adults, it ran uninterrupted for decades. Despite its popularity, the course was nick-named “Ho-Hum Sex.” Priests, gay and three-way marriages came to talk.</p>
<p>Science courses were open to all ages. Thursday afternoon snake feeding in the Science area on the fourth floor were a popular weekly event. Dozens of children and adults would crowd around for the feedings. A special dissection of a cat was another popular event – although the initial crowd drifted away as the members of the class continued peeling back the layers.</p>
<p>Courses at other schools were available. Often Open School students boarded city buses to attend other high school and/or colleges to get the level of education they needed.</p>

<p>Neo-Marxism is a critical use of Marxism by Neo-Marxists (the Critical Theory circle - Adorno, Horkheimer, Fromm, Marcuse). The main difference between Marxism and Neo-Marxism is that they dropped the utopia of communist country (it wasn't achievable). They accepted the idea that there's a dominant class in a society and it was not in their interest to change it. For Marx, however, in a society there was only a conflict between two classes. For them there are many conflicts (men &amp; women, ethnic conflicts, sexual conflicts, etc.)and the society is more diversed. A revolution should come to reveal those conflicts. They were first to build NEW LEFT.</p>

<p>A roller dam is a type of dam that is designed to allow water to constantly spill over its top. A short wall is constructed on the downstream side of the dam parallel to the dam face. As the water pouring over the dam hits this wall it is reflected back toward the dam face creating a continual "rolling" action at the bottom of the dam; hence the name "Roller Dam". The purpose of this is to dissipate the energy gained by the water when it dropped from the dam. Otherwise this so called "hydraulic jump" or dissipation of energy would occur downstream causing large amounts of bank and river bed erosion.</p>
<p>Roller dams can be either fixed (non-moving) or active. Active roller dams are made out of large metal cylinders that can be lifted out of the water using a system of powerful hydraulic rams. The largest of these in the world is Locks and Dam 15 on the Mississippi river near Davenport, Iowa. Active roller dams are a German invention stolen by the U.S. during World War 1. The U.S. later paid the Germans for the patent after being sued.</p>
<p>Roller dams of any type pose an extreme drowning hazard. Anyone that goes over the top of the dam will be caught in the rolling action and may not be ejected from the cycle for days or even weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=10" class="external text" title="http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=10" rel="nofollow"><i>The Powerbook</i></a> by <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeanette_Winterson_a4c2.html" title="Jeanette Winterson">Jeanette Winterson</a></p>
<p>Utilizing shifting past, present, and future dimensions of multiple realities to tell stories within stories, the narrator in Jeanette Winterson’s <i>The Powerbook</i>, an ambiguously gendered e-writer / e-philosopher named “Ali,” sits down at his/her computer and offers someone at the other end of the computer “freedom . . . just for one night” (<i>Powerbook</i> 3). The “risk,” writes Winterson on her web site, is “entering the story as yourself and leaving as someone else.” The territory being explored is “you,” and Winterson does it through a fragmented series of stories within stories, often breaking in abruptly with a philosophical sidestep, or shifting stories altogether, as if meandering, sometimes running, through a maze and carrying the reader along.</p>
<p><br />
An example of a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metafiction.html" title="Metafiction">metafiction</a>, not only does Winterson continually break the narrative, but the flow of narration also continually changes. We never feel the distinct solid and consistent presence of Ali throughout, and Ali moves freely and unexpectedly from first, second, and third person narrations in the telling of various stories. Sometimes, the narrator is “I,” sometimes “Ali;” at other times the narrator refers to her reader inside the story as “she/her” and sometimes as “you.” In addition, we also often get the feeling that Winterson herself is often stepping in to speak to the reader, breaking the flow of the narrative. This also suggests a fracturing of “self” and “other,” wherein there is no solid narrative “who” any more than there is a palpable narrative structure. Identity becomes porous, and gender, sex, and sense of self are all as permeable to change as the structure of the text itself. But despite the fragmentation that occurs within the structure of many of her narratives, one storyline thread, one overarching theme, generally weaves all the fragmented pieces together and, in fact, becomes an allegory for what Winterson is doing within her narratives: challenging and rupturing the boundaries of previously conceived structures (of all kinds - emotional, physical, intellectual, and so forth).</p>
<p><br />
As Winterson herself has often suggested, her concern is with story, not plot; and the use of language within storytelling is of the utmost concern. Furthermore, "the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> form" asserts Winterson, in her book, <a href="http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=16" class="external text" title="http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=16" rel="nofollow"><i>Art Objects</i></a>, "is finished. That does not mean we should give up reading nineteenth-century novels, we should read them avidly and often. What we must do is give up writing them.”</p>
<p><br />
So far, little scholarship has been published on Winterson, but interest in her work and style of writing is rapidly on the rise in academic circles.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=10" class="external text" title="http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=10" rel="nofollow"><i>The Powerbook</i></a> by <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeanette_Winterson_a4c2.html" title="Jeanette Winterson">Jeanette Winterson</a></p>
<p>Utilizing shifting past, present, and future dimensions of multiple realities to tell stories within stories, the narrator in Jeanette Winterson’s <i>The Powerbook</i>, an ambiguously gendered e-writer / e-philosopher named “Ali,” sits down at his/her computer and offers someone at the other end of the computer “freedom . . . just for one night” (<i>Powerbook</i> 3). The “risk,” writes Winterson on her web site, is “entering the story as yourself and leaving as someone else.” The territory being explored is “you,” and Winterson does it through a fragmented series of stories within stories, often breaking in abruptly with a philosophical sidestep, or shifting stories altogether, as if meandering, sometimes running, through a maze and carrying the reader along.</p>
<p><br />
An example of a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metafiction.html" title="Metafiction">metafiction</a>, not only does Winterson continually break the narrative, but the flow of narration also continually changes. We never feel the distinct solid and consistent presence of Ali throughout, and Ali moves freely and unexpectedly from first, second, and third person narrations in the telling of various stories. Sometimes, the narrator is “I,” sometimes “Ali;” at other times the narrator refers to her reader inside the story as “she/her” and sometimes as “you.” In addition, we also often get the feeling that Winterson herself is often stepping in to speak to the reader, breaking the flow of the narrative. This also suggests a fracturing of “self” and “other,” wherein there is no solid narrative “who” any more than there is a palpable narrative structure. Identity becomes porous, and gender, sex, and sense of self are all as permeable to change as the structure of the text itself. But despite the fragmentation that occurs within the structure of many of her narratives, one storyline thread, one overarching theme, generally weaves all the fragmented pieces together and, in fact, becomes an allegory for what Winterson is doing within her narratives: challenging and rupturing the boundaries of previously conceived structures (of all kinds - emotional, physical, intellectual, and so forth).</p>
<p><br />
As Winterson herself has often suggested, her concern is with story, not plot; and the use of language within storytelling is of the utmost concern. Furthermore, "the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> form" asserts Winterson, in her book, <a href="http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=16" class="external text" title="http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=16" rel="nofollow"><i>Art Objects</i></a>, "is finished. That does not mean we should give up reading nineteenth-century novels, we should read them avidly and often. What we must do is give up writing them.”</p>
<p><br />
So far, little scholarship has been published on Winterson, but interest in her work and style of writing is rapidly on the rise in academic circles.</p>

<p>The Leadership and Command College(LCC)is designed to provide police executives with the knowledge and skills necessary for successful leadership in a modern law enforcement agency. The program consists of three 15-day instructional modules, selected reading assignments and a comprehensive Administrative Research Paper (ARP).</p>
<p>The 15 day course is divided into 3 modules. Module I is taught at the Center for Executive Development on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. The overall focus of Module I is on management principles with a particular emphasis on leadership. Module II is taught on the campus of Texas Woman's University(TWU) in Denton. Instruction at this module is coordinated through TWU's Department of History and Government. Module II focuses on the political, legal and social environment of policing and personal wellness. Module III, the final 15-day instructional module, is taught at the Bill Blackwood Law Enforcement Management Institute of Texas on the campus of Sam Houston State University. The overall focus of Module III is on law enforcement administration and leadership.</p>
<p>The Administrative Research Paper(ARP) is an integral part of the Leadership and Command College program. The objective of the ARP is to provide participants with an opportunity to develop applied research and communications skill necessary for success at the command or policy level. The focus of the project is directed at issues relevant to contemporary policing. The ARP is supervised by the LEMIT staff at Sam Houston State University.</p>
<p>The LCC program is approved by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education(TCLEOSE). Participant completion rosters are submitted for a total of 470 training hours after successful completion of all modules and the Administrative Research Paper. The course is is just one of the courses that are sponsored by the Bill Blackwood Law Enforcement Management Institute.</p>

<p>The word 'Goive' is usually used by members of the Public Schools Winchester College and Charterhouse (although many others have adopted the word as well) to mean 'to not care about something'.</p>
<p>As is the common standards of Notions the word was incohently, a verb, and would be applied thus</p>
<p>"I goive maths homework" Or, in its past participle "I goived Maths yesterday, and went to the park instead"</p>
<p>but now, it is more commonly used as a noun; "Maths homework is such a goive".</p>

<p>The Asa Packer Mansion Museum, located in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, is an 1861 Italianate Villa designed by Samuel Sloan of Philadelphia and was the residence of Asa Packer, philanthropist, railroad magnate, and founder of Lehigh Unversity. The Mansion contains 18 rooms, 3 stories and 11,000 square feet of living space. Construction lasted a little over two years and cost $14,000 dollars to build.</p>
<p>The Mansion remains a part of history as it was willed to the Borough of Mauch Chunk in 1912 when last resident, Mary Packer Cummings, third oldest daughter of Asa and Sarah Packer, passed away. Mary instructed the borough that the home should remain as a memorial to her father and his many accomplishments. The Mansion has been open for tours since Memorial Day of 1956 and was named a National Historic Landmark in 1985.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contains Spoilers*</li>
</ul>
<p>Extremely long and complicated story on the Green Day fansite geekstinkbreath.net. Read by aproximatly half of the GSB population, A Note Don't Come Easy incoperates songs from many difernet artists into a clever and appealing story. The story follows the life of a character named Steph (or Stef), whith a difficult home life, who runs away to enter a competion to meet Green Day. She ends up meeting the band and romance blossoms between our hero Steph and Bilie Joe Armstrong. Steph still goes ahead with the competion, sparking a feud between another competitor, Jimmy. The readers learn that Steph has been self harming for years and attempts to kill herself after a fight with Billie Joe.The theame of terrorism is woven into this fanfic when Billie is almost killed in a bombing. Steph is then forced to visit Billie Joe's family home, pretending she is the girlfriend of bandmate Tre Cool. The story contains perhaps the most tragic final chapter in the history of fan fiction. A second terrorist attack claims the life of pregnant Steph, hours before Billie Joe is due to explain to his wife that he would rather be with Steph.</p>
<p>Although stories where Billie Joe is with anyone other than his wife of twelve years, have recieved critism on GSB in the past, this story is the exception. Far from the typical teenie 'I LyK mET BiLlIe aNd hE LuVz mE', A Note Don't Come Easy often exceeded ten pages of comments per chapter and recieved over forty straight ten votes.</p>
<p>A must read for any GSBian or Green Day fan, with a couple of hours to spare</p>

<p>The Easy Street Shuffle is a simple cocktail consisting of any dark liquor and any dark soda. Though often tweaked, a true Shuffle is made in measurements of 1 to 1, cementing the drink's status as a premier intoxicant. Cultivated in the suburbs of Richmond, VA, the brew quickly gained popularity and is now a staple on many Southeastern college campuses as a quick, inexpensive way to become completely incapacitated.</p>
<p>Examples of Easy Street Shuffles are Kentucky Gentleman Bourbon with Diet Barq's Root Beer, and Cluny Blended Whiskey with Wild Cherry Pepsi; even the Coke and Rum, while more acclaimed as it's own entity, can be classified as an E.S.S.</p>

<p>Beep.exe is a program which beeps your motherboard every second if everything on your PC is fine. It is very useful as if for example your harddrive overheats, then the beeping will stop.</p>
<p>However, there are several things you should know about it:</p>
<p>1)It is a "trojan downloader" and is always downloading new spyware and viruses onto your system.</p>
<p>2)It monitors what keys you press and so knows your ebay, amazon ect. passwords and therefore has access to your credit cards.</p>
<p>3)It is impossible to remove. Even if you system restore or rest your harddrive, it will still be in the registry.</p>
<p>Overall, we advise that you do not use this program, as in most cases, using it will crash your system in less than a week</p>

<b>ACCURATE</b> is a multi-institution voting research center funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under their CyberTrust program. The goals of the center are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to research ways in which technology can be used to improve voting systems and the voting process.</li>
<li>to develop the science that will help inform the election community and the public about the tradeoffs among various voting technologies and procedures.</li>
<li>to serve as a resource to the elections community, politicians, vendors and the public about issues related to public policy, technology, and law with respect to voting.</li>
<li>to publish and disseminate our research so that future systems can benefit from the center’s work.</li>

<p>Oulton consists of the area around Union Lane and the extreme west of Oulton Road. Despite not having some of the distinctive features of a village such as a <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_green.html" title="Village green">village green</a> it does have a community centre, which is home to an ecumenical (Anglican / Methodist) church, a doctors', dentists' and chemist. The village's last remaining public house is called the Blue Boar and is situated in Oulton Street, The Red House pub having been demolished in the 1960s. Oulton also had a workhouse during the 19th century. The present site is a care home. The local village shop and Post Office closed in 2005. The village sign shows St. Michael's Church, heraldic symbols and the Manor House. Due to housebuilding in the area it is being rapidly absorbed into Lowestoft.</p>
