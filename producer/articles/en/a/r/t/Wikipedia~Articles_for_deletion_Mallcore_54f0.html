<li><b>Keep and expand</b> article is NOT for attacking nu metal, I have repeatedly put in the <i>correct</i> info about the subject---that it is viewed as the "proper" term for nu metal, since nu metal is not viewed as metal---only to see it deleted every time. I even referenced this article before only to have it deleted. NOTE TO EDITORS: Metal-Rules is a perfectly legit source in the metal community. If it doesn't meet Uncle Wiki's requirements for Reliable Sources, then I suggest rewriting them. It's highly regarded in the metal community. And mallcore wasn't made up in school, it was made up on a website (metal-rules if I'm not mistaken) several years ago. Not hearing it until now is no excuse for claiming it isn't legit, isn't notable, isn't widely used, or any other such nonsense. <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurs18_47e9.html" title="User:Ours18">Ours18</a> 21:27, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bullshit; nearly every metal fan I've personally met does not consider nu metal to be metal, hence my statement. Apparently, I'm not the only one here who has had that experience. If Wikipedia talkpages count as evidence, we wouldn't have to even bother sourcing it; look around the metal (specificly nu metal) band talk pages. And for the record, I actually <i>listen</i> to some mallcore bands---I have no problem calling them such. <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurs18_47e9.html" title="User:Ours18">Ours18</a> 05:14, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Negative, it has no genre meaning at all, it is pretty much only an insult.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> The article may need a lot of clean up, but I the term is sufficienty used and important to have its own article. The term is used a lot between extreme metal fans, and it is commonly used on <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> (certain bands even have it as a genre!). The term Mallcore does not only apply to Nu-Metal bands, but also to bands belonging to other metal subgenres, so I think that "a sentence on the Nu-Metal article" would be not right. The term is not synonymous with Nu Metal, although many nu-metal bands are labeled as mallcore by some metal fans. I am willing to re-write the article from A to Z if that helps. --<a href="../../../z/o/u/User%7EZouavman_Le_Zouave_16d7.html" title="User:Zouavman Le Zouave">Zouavman Le Zouave</a> 10:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Again, the logic behind this proposal is completely ridiculous. "Mallcore kid" is used in the same sense as "newbie" on other websites, and is only used for a little while, until the user accumulates a certain number of posts or points. Also, a search for "mallcore" as a music genre only turns up 16 bands out of the almost 43,000 bands on the website. That hardly qualifies <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> as a "mallcore site." Deathrocker is just trying to associate <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> with a derogatory term.

<li><b>Comment</b> That is by far the most dishonest "research" ever. Note that the first two results are from Wikipedia. Maybe we chould redirect mallcore to the Wikipedia page? Did you comb through every source, and see if any of them label <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> as a mallcore website? No, of course not, because that reveal how idiotic that premise is. You're being completely irrational. You have absolutely zero interest in fact, you just don't want to admit that you're wrong.

<li><b>Comment</b> Encyclopaedia Metallum is a popular website with <i>a lot</i> of traffic <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=metal-archives.com&amp;site1=maddox.xmission.com&amp;site2=bash.org&amp;site3=snpp.com&amp;site4=&amp;y=p&amp;z=1&amp;h=300&amp;w=500&amp;range=6m&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=metal-archives.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=metal-archives.com&amp;site1=maddox.xmission.com&amp;site2=bash.org&amp;site3=snpp.com&amp;site4=&amp;y=p&amp;z=1&amp;h=300&amp;w=500&amp;range=6m&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=metal-archives.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. As such, Google will index many pages from the site, including user comments in reviews, profiles or on the forum, which in no way demonstrate that Encyclopaeda Metallum is a mallcore-related site. There is no logical link between those Google search results and the definition of mallcore. And as others pointed out, using similar logic, we should redirect <b>mallcore</b> to the Slipknot article instead, or perhaps we could redirect the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_Metal_b381.html" title="Heavy Metal">Heavy Metal</a> article to the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> article since Google hits for the keyword "heavy metal" are far more tremendous <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22encyclopaedia+metallum%22+%22heavy+metal%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22encyclopaedia+metallum%22+%22heavy+metal%22" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Okay deathrocker, let's play by YOUR rules. Google search for "mallcore" "slipknot" == 10,900 results. Remove slipknot and put nu metal in its place, and you get 13,800 results.

The article does need a lot of clean-up, and I am willing to re-write the article from A to Z. --<a href="../../../z/o/u/User%7EZouavman_Le_Zouave_16d7.html" title="User:Zouavman Le Zouave">Zouavman Le Zouave</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../z/o/u/User_talk%7EZouavman_Le_Zouave_3197.html" title="User talk:Zouavman Le Zouave">Talk to me!</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zouavman_Le_Zouave_cb0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zouavman Le Zouave">See my edits!</a>)</sub> 10:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The biggest problem with the term can be seen on this very page. Ours18 saying stuff like nu-metal isn't metal and thus uses the term as its "correct" name doesn't jive with another person who believes it to be synonymous with any mainstream "metal" band. An article for a purely derogatory term doesn't need its own article in this instance and can be relegated to the nu metal page. And what band would seriously call themselves mallcore? What would be the use in labelling yourself mallcore? The whole thing reeks of elitism. If you don't like nu metal and want to call it mallcore fine, but coming up with a better name for nu metal other than mallcore may bring more awareness to nu metal not being metal.Outlaw-Viper 10:42, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There's already far too much overclassification of bands going on in the nu-metal genre, and this is just encouraging it. There's only so much derogatory beating of a dead horse you can do until it gets old. The sound of nu metal is clearly cut from the same cloth as the most popular (though <i>not</i> the most hardcore) styles of metal. The popular definition of nu metal being metal completely fits. - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStick_Fig_43b2.html" title="User:Stick Fig">Stick Fig</a> 19:22, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Rewrite</b> I propose to rewrite the article in a more correct form where there would be NPOV and where the bands cited would not be offended. Instead of saying: <i>"This band is mallcore"</i> it should read: <i>"This band may sometimes be considered mallcore by some"</i>. I propose that the article be re-written from A to Z and that peaceful discussion may lead to a more positive change for the fate of this article. I could take care of the rewriting, but I would gladly encourage people to help out as well. --<a href="../../../z/o/u/User%7EZouavman_Le_Zouave_16d7.html" title="User:Zouavman Le Zouave">Zouavman Le Zouave</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../z/o/u/User_talk%7EZouavman_Le_Zouave_3197.html" title="User talk:Zouavman Le Zouave">Talk to me!</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zouavman_Le_Zouave_cb0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zouavman Le Zouave">See my edits!</a>)</sub> 10:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Don't delete" and "rewrite" amount to the same thing. Either way, the article remains. My point in this AfD is that this article can never be NPOV, as the title is a derogatory term, and that therefore it should not exist on Wikipedia. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 17:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see your point in a way, but there are other articles on Wikipedia with derogatory terms as the title, like "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>" or "<a href="../../../f/a/g/Faggot_%28epithet%29.html" title="Faggot (epithet)">faggot</a>" for example. - <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> 11:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Those terms however have historical significance (and are used by more people) while the term mallcore does not.Outlaw-Viper 22:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, maybe the term nigger and faggot are more used and more significant, but mallcore does exist and it does have the right to be on Wikipedia. I mean, there are stubs about train stations, why couldn't mallcore be there? <a href="../../../z/o/u/User%7EZouavman_Le_Zouave_16d7.html" title="User:Zouavman Le Zouave">Zouavman Le Zouave</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../z/o/u/User_talk%7EZouavman_Le_Zouave_3197.html" title="User talk:Zouavman Le Zouave">Talk to me!</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zouavman_Le_Zouave_cb0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zouavman Le Zouave">See my edits!</a>)</sub> 10:45, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
