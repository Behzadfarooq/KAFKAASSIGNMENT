<p>This article is problematic on many levels. If it was named "List of Black billionaires according to Forbes" it would be fine, except then it would then be a copyvio. As it is now this article is merely a speculative essay. The criteria for inclusion is ambiguous (do mulatto and blasian people qualify? What about black Papua New Guineans and Australian Aborigines?). The very issue of being black cannot be agreed upon, as you can see in the article's edit history and talk page, as well as at <a href="../../../a/f/r/Talk%7EAfrican_Americans_whose_net_worth_is_equivalent_to_at_least_%241_billion_3a68.html" title="Talk:African Americans whose net worth is equivalent to at least $1 billion">Talk:African Americans whose net worth is equivalent to at least $1 billion</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Talk%7EBlack_people_41e8.html" title="Talk:Black people">Talk:Black people</a>. Someone renamed the article "African Americans whose net worth is equivalent to at least $1 billion", but that was refuted. "Black people of African Ancestry whose net worth is equivalent to at least $1 billion" would probably be refuted as well. As there are barely a handful billionaires who are black (Oprah Winfrey being the only current one), the article has to be padded with essayic speculation (as is the case now). <s>I say <b>delete</b> this article and <b>mention that they are black (if it is important) in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_billionaires.html" title="Lists of billionaires">Lists of billionaires</a></b></s>. <a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 00:00, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per above. I agree that the article has many problem on many levels. But I would say that the one that are most troubling to me is the "focus splitting". Is the article attempting to be a list of billionaires or is the article attempting to define "What is Black"? After the first paragraph, it splits into discussion about what is considered black that is really unneccesary. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:28, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. To refute the 3 main arguments:
<ul>
<li>Arguments over "who is black" are not a valid reason to delete this article, or else we would have none of the dozens of other articles on race. Yes, race is controversial, but Wikipedia is not censored. To the contrary, it should bend over backwards to stay honest and objective.</li>
<li>Ezeu also misunderstands copyright law. Under <i><a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_v._Rural_4040.html" title="Feist v. Rural">Feist v. Rural</a></i> (which has since been adopted by Europe, too), lists cannot be copywritten, so the fact that this list might be "according to Forbes" does not make it copyvio. If that were the case, we'd have to delete <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_500.html" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a> and dozens of articles like it, too.</li>
<li>The fact that "there are barely a handful billionaires who are black" doesn't matter. We have thousands of articles that are about one or only a few people. The question isn't how many people fit into the category, but is it notable that they have made it? Yes, acheiving <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billionaire.html" title="Billionaire">billionaire</a> status is a sign of notability, and it's especially notable for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacks.html" title="Blacks">blacks</a> because they were all but shut out of the international economy until 40 years ago because of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crow_laws_6b62.html" title="Jim Crow laws">Jim Crow laws</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>, and the like.</li>

<p>The article says nothing. That and I'm tired of the damn race argument. DELETE, DELETE!!!! Everyone knows that in America particularly race matters. In this article it matters even more because the assertion that is being made and has been made overtly is that blacks are incapable of being billionaires and BEING BLACK. That the real racism behind adding that piece.</p>
<p>Most of you on here: Let's look at all the components of a person! Especially if he or she is "black"! They must have some other genes that account for their achievement. All or most so called African Americans or Africans in the Americas have other genes the majority Caucasian genes. So let's follow your ignorant argument that Asians and Caucasians are closest on the tree. That would mean by proxy, as a result of slavery most African American (who have been removed from African for damn near three centuries!) are the FURTHEST thing from African possible, and closer to Asians that you think. That is what makes that chart UNAPPLICABLE!</p>
<p>It does not take into account the mixtures that have happened as a result of chattel slavery and generations of Afro-European mixtures. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by User:208.49.22.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7E208.49.22.2_b137.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:208.49.22.2">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>You're not making any sense. African-Americans are on average 83% African and 17% Caucasian. They are Black because Black is the single largest chunk of their gene pool. No person on Earth is 100% pure so race is defined by the single largest chunck of ones ancestry. It's been pointed out that Michael Lee-Chin is 45% Black, 5% white and 50% Chinese so he's not predominantly Black, and any doctor that gave him medical treatment intented for Blacks would be fired especially since the Chinese gene-pool is the opposite of the Black gene-pool--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 18:30, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> If you delete this articel than you should delete the article on <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> too since that has the same problems. The only dispute in the article concerns Michael Lee-Chin and all we need to do is show so both the sides of the debate about whether or not he's Black. Also this article was nominated for months in the early stage and survived every time. You're not even allowed to be nominating it again.

<p><a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> is right. Even though it may be argued that he's wrong about the copy vio (which I don't believe he is!), he is correct in pointing out that unless the definition for black is clarified this becomes a redundant exercise. This is becoming a referendum on what it means to be a billionaire if you have African blood coursing through your veins. The other question arises then at the same point as to who is right in their definition. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">Mareino</a> if Oprah is the only person who will be counted contextually then folks can learn about her IN HER article. What's the point in saying, "geez we'd count Michael Lee-Chin but he's a unique racial category of genetic opposites." Oddly enough we have barely mentioned Bob Johnson in this article except to say in a cursory sense that he was a billionaire, but he lost that status post-divorce from Sheila.</p>
<p>If the argument about Jim Crow laws and one-drop rules are going to be pointed out then it needs to be noted that "black" comes in all "nationalities" if you will. It isn't much of an achievement to point out how much ground blacks have lost as they strive to be anything but black in America.</p>
<p>The caveat here is that there aren't that many arguments on what it means to be white and who's counted unless the KKK or other white supremacists are doing it. Moreover, I’d think we’d all agree if you don’t look white you’re not.</p>
<p>Question for all though: isn’t this blasian thing a phenomenon of new world intermarriage? Do the Chinese or Japanese government have a racial category for this? From what I hear the mixed children of GI’s (first true “blasians”) were treated like crap in Vietnam (which is funny as hell in brown ass Vietnam) and Korea. I even here the purer “Asians” (the Chinese and Japanese) look down on the more mixed Asian populations such as exist in Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. Meanwhile, “black” people have opened their arms wide to welcome these downtrodden only to hear that they’d like to separate themselves.</p>
<p>Based on these factors I vote DELETE. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 151.203.196.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.203.196.2_9cef.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.203.196.2">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Black was defined in the article but Ezeu complained that the defenition was racist. A Black is a person with a majority of ancestors that stayed in sub-Saharan Africa during Homo S. Sapians original exodus from the continent some 70,000 years ago. No person on Earth is pure, everyone has mixed blood to some degree that's why doctors define your race by predominance of ancestry. If most of your ancestors are from sub-Saharan Africa you're Black, if most are from North-East Asia, your North-East Asian etc. It's not very complecated at all. And btw, the mixed children of GI's were not the first Blasians. Believe it or not, the first Blasians were pure white people. Yes, white people. This was stated in Time magazine and by Cavalli-Sforza who discovered that on the genetic level, all Europeans are hybrid population that is a mix of African genes and North East Asian genes. This is because all humans started in Africa, and Europeans are nothing more than Africans who are in the process of becoming North East Asian. So really by calling a Blasian Black you are calling all white people Black.--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 18:12, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your support.

<li><b>Delete and Recreate</b> - If this article were only about billionaires who happen to be black (however you want to define that), it would be fine although the article title should be plural. However, most of the article is about other things: poverty rates, women, racism, rumors, claims, businesses, and people who aren't even on the list yet -- a list which currently has only one person on it. This effort would be better directed as something like Economic Advancement of Black People.

<li>Good idea. A general rewrite might be in order, but I think the article needs a better focus first. I raised the idea on the Talk page as you suggested.

<dd>First of all we're not talking about Australoids and Papua New Guineans though including them wouldn't matter since they haven't produced any billionaires. Black when spelled with a capital B refers to people of sub-Saharan ancestry. This topic is extremely important because most people I speak to do not believe that Black billionaires are even possible, so it's very important to document all the billionaires and near-billionaires in history that were Black or have had Black blood, it's important to document the economic contributions made by people with sub-Saharan ancestry. It's also extremely important to point out the economic inequality exists even at the highest levels. Black billionaires are extremely note-worthy because virtually every Black population on Earth has been either enslaved or colonized, so to come out of that to become a billionaire is worthy of extensive documentation. If we can have articles on subjects like <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy_over_race_of_Ancient_Egyptians_0af2.html" title="Controversy over race of Ancient Egyptians">controversy over race of Ancient Egyptians</a> we can most certainly have an article on Black billionaires. Just because the information is not of use to you does not mean it can't be a helpful resource for others especially those studying Black business and Black history. It's extremely difficult to get information and statisistics concerning Blacks worldwide as most stats are confined to African-Americans. Thats what makes this article unique.--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 15:13, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
