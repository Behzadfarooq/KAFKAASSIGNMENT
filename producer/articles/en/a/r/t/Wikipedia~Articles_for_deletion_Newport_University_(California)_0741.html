<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. I find it rather disturbing that so many established editors think the number of google hits should be the primary reason we include an article, but whatever. Based on the numbers there is no consensus to delete, thankfully arguments other than the google hits were presented, and per JJay's argument and evidence there does seem to be reliable information written about this topic. I suggest actually citing it in the article, which is about 0.02% as long as this AfD. <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 23:49, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Acreddited simply means officially recognized. While unaccredited may mean it is not notable, it really only means it is not officially recognized, by whatever officials happen to be in charge of accrediting, not that it is neccesarily not notable. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 03:42, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An article does not need to meet every notability requirement it may fall under, only one(unless I am wrong). My stance is that while it may be a CORP, it is still a SCHOOL, and if it meets one of them, as opposed to all of them, it is fine. Yes, it is a CORP, but it is still a SCHOOL. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 03:51, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, but we have a consensus about corporations. We have no consensus abotu schools. So it maybe makes sense to differ to the one we have an actual consensus on? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:52, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>No, I don't think so, because that consensus was not neccesarily made with schools in mind. To be frank, it seems like a bit of a stretch to apply CORP to a school simply because it is not accredited. After all, acredited schools can be private corperations aswell, I don't see the connection. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 03:55, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, most private schools are non-profit (all public are non-profit by definition), which gives them different tax stuctures and incentives.

<dd><b>Comment</b> for all those "per Silensor" keeps: most of the Google hits returned are <i>not</i> about the Newport University on Newport Beach at all, but about the Cristopher Newport University. When you search for "NEwport University" California -"Christopher Newport", you already drop to 13,500 Ghits<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22newport+university%22+california+-%22christopher+newport%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22newport+university%22+california+-%22christopher+newport%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Many of those are still false positives, but you get the idea. As for the number of students: they seem to have had a grand total of 8 graduates in 1993<a href="http://www.cpec.ca.gov/collegeguide/InstitutionProfile.asp?Inst=E0039A" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cpec.ca.gov/collegeguide/InstitutionProfile.asp?Inst=E0039A" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and are not listed in the COOL database<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cool/SearchResults.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cool/SearchResults.aspx" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. As far as I can see, it is an unaccredited <i>correspondence</i> law school with some 10 to 15 students each year<a href="http://www.nwculaw.edu/cgi-bin/nwcu/testimonials_statistics.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nwculaw.edu/cgi-bin/nwcu/testimonials_statistics.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. First, the school is registered with California for the bar exam <a href="http://calbar.ca.gov/state/calbar/calbar_generic.jsp?cid=10184&amp;id=5128" class="external autonumber" title="http://calbar.ca.gov/state/calbar/calbar_generic.jsp?cid=10184&amp;id=5128" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. It is also my understanding that Newport students can take the California licensing exam in clinical psychology and family counseling. Second, there are reliable sources available for the school, for example the Salt Lake Tribune did an extremely long expose in 1996 when it registered in Utah (pay site) <a href="http://news.google.fr/archivesearch?q=%22newport+university%22+%22newport+beach%22&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.fr/archivesearch?q=%22newport+university%22+%22newport+beach%22&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Third, whatever you may think of these types of schools, people are getting degrees from Newport and sometimes working in positions of authority. That can cause controversy. Stanley Blondek, an expert witness and California prison youth counselor who claimed a masters and PhD from Newport (but repeatedly failed the California licensing exam) is an example (pay site) <a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SB&amp;p_theme=sb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0476D3400CDA9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM" class="external autonumber" title="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SB&amp;p_theme=sb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0476D3400CDA9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<dd>What??? California sets standards for allowing students from various institutions to sit for the bar exam and in the case of unaccredited schools, bar exam rule XIX is applicable (as indicated in my previous post). It is not up to me to "provide WP:RS for each criteria". The school is listed on the California bar exam website, meaning they have passed inspection and adhere to the clauses of rule XIX. Pretty simple really. If you believe that is not the case please enlighten us. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:53, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No one claimed the school is accredited. That is not at issue. Your statement that "people can walk in and take the test" is false. The school has to be inspected and must adhere to a series of requirements. That is why few schools are on the list. Your comment that the school has been called a "diploma mill" is completely unproven. Provide proof of that statement. The California Bar's non-opinion of unaccredited schools is not the issue here either. Finally, WP/Corp is a guideline that should not apply to schools for obvious reasons. The interest of these types of articles is to have background information on institutions of higher learning that are awarding degrees to people that sometimes achieve positions of authority (in this case potential lawyers, social workers, psychologists). That is inherently notable and supercedes WP/Corp and its fixation on stock prices. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 13:51, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

This was in relation to Newport's "classes" which "are not in the form of instruction, we just ask the students to raise their questions and discuss them with experts." This again is a trival mention in the paper, but leads use to question Newport's seriousness as a "school"</dd>

<dd>You cearly haven't read the first source, which never calls the school a diploma mill. Nor does the second source, apparently. The only person making that claim is you, but without proof.

<dd>2) Your insisting we keep an article for a ten year old Salt Lake newspaper that calls this place a <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">diploma mill</a> is more of a reason to delete. That is, no one has provided any criticism in the article about its ppor quality of instruction. Thus, your link makes us more skeptical about the article meeting WP:V. The article says nothing about criticism, which is very misleading per your one article. Readers, right now, get the false impression that is place's academics aren't questionable per the one source you mentioned.</dd>

<dd>1) While the school is not accredited, the fact that several state bodies do provide some level of recognition to the school is not only evidence of verifiability, it also goes a long way to establishing notability in the context of a university. 2) The source is independent, reliable and verifiable. There is simply no criteria that the source must be recent OR that it must be positive. "Non-trivial coverage" is timeless. As the source is provided, readers can make their own impression of the article's characterization. 3) A reminder that a school's presence on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unaccredited_institutions_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning">List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning</a> doesn't mean it should be deleted. 4) The time has come to address the evidence of notability and get past the fact that it is unaccredited.
