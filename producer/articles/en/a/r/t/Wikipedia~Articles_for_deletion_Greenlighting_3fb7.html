<li><i>Reply to comment'</i> I dont understand what you mean by that. Because we just now decided that we wanted a wikipedia entry, and we are just now receiving major attention from other blogs and news sites, this makes us a "neologism"? We have been around for quite awhile, but unfortunately, greenlighting is already a popular term; we were overshadowed almost immediately. Greenlighting is a popular movie production term that has garnered a very large internet following. Perhaps you have heard of project greenlight. Also, if you google greenlighting, you can see that it is a common term for giving something approval. It is very hard to be "heard" when so many people are already using the term in mainstream communication.--Maiael 5 July 2005 22:29 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So, the term was applied to this activity for the first time a few days ago, but actually is normally used for something else? I have heard of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Greenlight_fd5d.html" title="Project Greenlight">Project Greenlight</a> and if greenlighting is actually a popular movie term, this article needs massive revision. I applaud your efforts in creating a new meaning for a word over a couple of days, but until it has been in common use for some considerable period of time, it is inappropriate to include it in Wikipedia. Add it to one of those online slang dictionaries first. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 6 July 2005 13:48 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Whether this is an important social phenonmenon or a hoax, it obviously has some support behind it. Like it or not, "Greenlighting" is a topic of some significance in some way, and deserves a wikipedia article. Also, a great deal of <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoaxes.html" title="Hoaxes">hoaxes</a> have wikipedia articles. (also see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_hoaxes.html" title="List of hoaxes">list of hoaxes</a>). <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordell_Walker_552c.html" title="User:Cordell Walker">Cordell Walker</a> 6 July 2005 00:32 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this is an interesting case. The article itself, and the content therein, had a major effect on shutting down the hoax. The perpetrators basically folded after their scheme was revealed here. Despite that, the backers of this hoax are still attempting to control the content and existence of the article -<a href="../../../o/%5E/o/User%7EO%5EO_8499.html" title="User:O^O">O^O</a> 6 July 2005 01:03 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Wait and see.</b> If this hoax gets picked up and widely circulated, it's something that people will be looking for authoritative information on, and WP ought to carry an explanation. If it never makes it into the public consciousness (defined, at a guess, as appearing on a well-viewed talk show or in a wire story picked up by multiple mainstream newspapers), but rather dies a merciful death, the article should die just as quickly. (I don't find the 'neologism' guideline to apply at the moment -- it's not an attempt to introduce the term, but a description of events relating to someone else's introduction.) <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEritain_131a.html" title="User:Eritain">eritain</a> 6 July 2005 07:10 (UTC)

<p><b>Why?</b> Why are so many of you so opposed to having this on wikipedia. Is it going to make your copy of the hardbound Wikipedia too thick? Is it going to slow down your internet surfing abilities? Greenlighting was important to us. We wanted to see just how much attention we could get by creating this, and we received quite a bit. I am sorry that some of you feel that this is non-notable, but we feel that it is. Actually, there is a community of over 50,000 that are aware of this hoax and a vast sum of them approved of it. I think it is important that it is documented so that people who find out about this at a later date, or people who want to find out what it was all about, or even people who want to find out if its a hoax or not, can found out exactly what happened. --Maiael 7 July 2005 03:29 (UTC)</p>

<li>Do you have any evidence to back up your statements that it received much attention, or are the claims of the attention it received as made up as those of greenlighting itself? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck_Carroll_598d.html" title="User:Chuck Carroll">Chuck</a> July 7, 2005 03:47 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't have access to the referrer logs as I am not the admin of greenlighter.org. Since I have no control over being able to prove how many sites linked to greenlighters.org, and the numerous, very very numerous, forum topics started about us, such as the pbonline forums, genmay, metafilter, and other big names, I guess there isn't much I can do other than argue here.
