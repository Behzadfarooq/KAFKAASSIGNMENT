<li><b>Delete</b> I have grave doubts that the originator of the article (<a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFivetrees_336a.html" title="User:Fivetrees">User:Fivetrees</a>, a very personable individual, but quite new to Wikipedia) is aware of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policies, so I'll go have a chat with him. In the mean time, however, this article consists entirely of original research. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 19:18, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep (if possible)</b> Few scholars are experts in both (Jewish) Kabbalah and (Christian) Jesus. I know serious books on the topic exist but they are difficult to get a hold of. Is there anyone here who can compile a bibliography? It's a worthwhile topic for an article. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 21:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comparing the article with serious books on the topic doesn't yield the result that you are hoping for. The article claims to be about something that also goes by the name of Christian Kabbalah. Books on such a thing exist. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0691005400</a> has a whole chapter, chapter 2, on the subject of Christian Kabbalah, which mentions people such as Martines de Pasqually. It bears <i>zero</i> relation to <i>anything</i> written in this article. For starters, this article is discussing completely the wrong century. The aforementioned book tells us that Christian Kabbalah has its origins in the 15th century. Both the chapter on non-Jewish Kabbalah in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1580910491</a> and the chapter on Caballism in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0521361915</a> (citing the <i>Encyclopaedia Judaica</i>) tell us that Christian Kabbalah lasted from the 15th century until the end of the 18th century, when it faded out. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:43, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article has nothing to do with Christian Cabala. Christian Cabala is a Renaissance Period attempt to synchretize Jewish Kabbalah, Christian Theology, and Greek-via-Islamic Philosophy. The article is different. The article discusses if the historical Jesus himself is using an early form of Kabbalah during the Roman Period. Christian Cabala and Jesus's Proto-Rabbinic Kabbalah arent the same and are not even related. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 10:33, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The very first sentence of the article claims that it <i>is</i> about Christian Kabbalah. Please read the very first sentence of the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Reread the first sentence. It is about "Jewish Kabbalah" which isnt the same thing as "Christian Kabbalah", and it says the article is only related to Christian Kabbalah "in some part". The article is about Jewish Kabbalah. In editing the article, the reference to Christian Kabbalah should be removed from the opening paragraph. Christian Cabala has few if any references to the historical Jesus. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 12:08, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The first sentence has now been altered. But that only makes your argument for keeping less tenable, not more. Instead of an article about something that we have some books about, that simply isn't in agreement with the books, we now have an article for which you haven't actually put forward <i>any</i> of these purported "serious books on the topic", and for which <i>no</i> "serious books on the topic" turn up in any searches for such books. I cited some books about Christian Kabbalah. I suggest that if you wish to make an argument that this isn't original research, you do the same for what you claim the subject of this article to be and show that there really are books on this subject. So far, it seems that there are not. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am an expert of the focal point of this topic (subject of kavim in both systems), but not of english writing or wikipedia styling. Wikieditors know this and always help to correct my editing or english errors. I started many religious wikitopics - participating here is too serious to me. So only rare experts of these both fields, understand importance and rising trend of this interesting, delicate and difficult topic. This is not my personal opinion, but clear fact of long years of research and this topic will become widely known and encyclopedic without my participation. If someone knows this topic better - please contribute, my task was to initiate topic of what others saw as separate particles (a lot of sources and studies published), but I already see as whole mosaic. Maybe some terms will be corrected, but the idea is already clear to many students who know both sides. The problem is that there are rare ones who know BOTH SOURCES GOOD ENOUGH, SYMMETRICALLY. Most of students know good enough only one side of question, or even confuse Jewish Kabbalah with some "general kabbalah" or "hermetic kabbalah"; know subject of Christian Jesus, but don't know Jewish concept of Yeshua or Gnostic logia, Gospels of Thomas and Philip etc., what is much different from general Christianity. There are a lot of near or similar studies on this field, but exact focal point is discussed only last 5-10 years. So citations, materials, references and publications will follow soon. To IMHO decisions about this topic can be made only by experts of Jewish-Torah-Hebrew Kabbalah (at least ashlagian or lurian, but there are more and deeper materials). And experts of (mainly non-christian concept of) Yeshua: at least Gospel of Thomas of Nag Hammadi Library in coptic, greek-koine New Testament or Brit Hadasha in hebrew. Please immerse into material deeper! --<a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFivetrees_336a.html" title="User:Fivetrees">fivetrees</a> 11:36, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>So citations, materials, references and publications will follow soon and decisions about this topic can be made ONLY BY EXPERTS OF BOTH FIELDS</i> — Wrong. Citations should be given <i>now</i>. And it doesn't require an expert in the field to ascertain whether you are working from sources or not, and thus whether this is original research or not. If you are working from sources, they will be easy to cite. If you are condensing and summarizing the existing literature in a field, you will easily be able to say, right now, what literature you are condensing and summarising. So please cite your sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>What is most significant is not that Fivetrees claims to be an expert, but rather that he is the author of the article. Is he an expert? Where did he receive smicha? Or where did he get his postgraduate training? More important, expert or not, he cannot violate NOR. Where are the articles in peer-reviewed journals? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 10:11, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Given this a delete is unavoidable. Wikipedia exists only for topics that be verified by nonexperts, an article that cannot be so verified is by definition not encyclopedic. An article on historical or contemporary Christian Kabbalah appears sourcable and might be of interest, but this article, which claims that Jesus practiced a form of Kabbalah as it existed 2000 years ago, is about something else entirely.

<li>A quick look at the two sources listed in the reference section: One clearly violates the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source policy</a>. <i>Yeshua as He is</i> by Jake Ashcroft is a self-published work. Lulu.com is a vanity (self) publisher, as it explicitly states <a href="http://www.lulu.com/about/whatislulu.php" class="external text" title="http://www.lulu.com/about/whatislulu.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> "Lulu's not the publisher - <b>you</b> are." Assuming the other, <i>Keys to the Kingdom</i> by <a href="../../../m/i/g/Migene_Gonzalez-Wippler_00cd.html" title="Migene Gonzalez-Wippler">Migene Gonzalez-Wippler</a>, despite its publication by New Age publisher <a href="../../../l/l/e/Llewellyn_Publications_29f1.html" title="Llewellyn Publications">Llewellyn Publications</a>, is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, nonetheless the requirement of multiple reliable sources is not met. (Note that Wikipedia's article on Gonzalez-Wippler appears to have been copied verbatim from Llewellyn's web site). --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 03:33, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have to be careful with this kind of remark. As soon as you try to decide which publishers are 'real' publishers and which are not you are creating a lens through which you filter reality, usually ending up seeing what you set out to see in the first place. Llewellyn are a long standing publishing house of good repute. It is in the nature of the material that they publish that your problem lies. This kind of material is always going to have a high freak out factor. But saying they are a doubtful publisher because they publish things you don't grok is the first step on the road that leads to book burning. Tell me, would you suspect a publisher who only publishes in one field to be suspect if that field was anything other than religion? Somehow its ok if the major strands of major religions self publish their material but once a member of a minority group does so they are vanity publishing! As the wise Mr. Bob Dylan once wrote, "The times they are a'changin'" The existence of so called vanity publishers like Lulu perform a valuable service in allowing people who have written worthwhile books that wouldn't get picked up by a publishing house because their market is so specialised to publish them themselves. This is not vanity. This is accepting the realities of the market and finding your own solution. We are too accustomed to a world in which media of all kinds have a higher acceptance factor if they come from a 'reputable' source. This is prejudicing knowledge and as long as one does this one is a slave to media barons and publishing houses. I find it ironic that this kind of thing goes on on wikipedia! The whole point of wikipedia is to alleviate that slavery. To open people's eyes to the fact that everyone has knowledge and we can help them share it. As soon as you start to try to prejudice some knowledge over some other you are on the road to oppression.</li>

<li>It seems to me that all parts are beyond repair in that the entire articlesimply expresses the author'sown point of view. What parts do you think can be "repaired?" What does "Yeshua" refer to? Jesus? Do you know of any Kabbalistic work or scholarship on Kabbalah that refers to Jesus in this way? I do not. Do you know of any Christian work that refers to Jesus in this way? I do not. Do you know of any of the scholarship on Kabbalah that says anything about Kabbalah and Jesus? I do not. Do you know of any documentation that supports claims that the Kabbalah, as we know it, existed during Jesus'life time? To my knowledge, all kabbalistic texts appear after the destruction of the Temple (and thus after Jesus) and I do notknow of any reputable scholar who has claimed that Jesus had any influence on the kabbalah. Do you? Your vote suggests that you think this is a real, valid, encyclopedic topic. I really just want to know why you think this. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 17:38, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a> policy. This is overkill as this article will obviously be deleted. "After lurian Kabbalah affirmed, that Yeshua was an expert in Kabbalah..." [sigh]... This kind of reminded me of the editor a couple years back who kept insisting on adding to the Jesus article that Jesus' teaching methods took the form of <a href="../../../k/o/a/Koans.html" title="Koans">koans</a> (and I'm comparing the OR content, not the editors, fivetrees seems to be a polite editor who edits in good faith). --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 21:59, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have some expertise in this subject area. This article has great potential. I have had correspondence with the author when editing other Kabbalah articles and he does know what he is talking about. imho this work is not original research, but the fact that the author's first language is not English is really working against him here. I have spoken to the author at some length regarding this article and I believe it can be brought into line with wikipedia's policy regarding original research. He does have the sources to cite to demonstrate that this is not original research. I will help him to render this article into English more accurately. Please don't rush to vote to delete this article as it is an area of research which has few exponents in English and it is worth taking some effort to help get this article to meet wikipedia's policy.</li>

<p>It is widely known, that teaching of Yeshua was based on Torah and on no other source, as he himself states being fulfillment of the law (Torah) and he recites Torah numerous times.</p>
<p>It's widely known, that Jewish mysticism is based on Torah too and main sources of Jewish Kabbalah (Zoar etc.) are mystical commentaries of nothing except Torah or related sources.</p>
<p>So it's clear, that both Yeshua and Jewish mysticism come from the same root.</p>
<p>Could such obvious correlations altered by something other more important?</p>
<p><b>Are there any doubts about this&#160;?</b></p>
<p>I hear arguments in the voting, that Yeshua's teaching is rooted in some other source except Torah/TANAKH. And that Jewish Kabbalah is based on every source except Torah/TANAKH.</p>
