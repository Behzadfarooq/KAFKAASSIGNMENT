<li><b>Keep</b>, but modify. There is value is pointing out that certain events generated controversy. This can be done in a NPOV fashion. However, this article needs to focus on a factual recounting of the fact that there was controversy, not re-hashing the controversies themselves. For example - 1. Graham Poll mistakenly failed to send off a player after the 2nd Yellow. This generated the following controversy: a. Failure of the 4th referee to catch this {cite sources here}. 2. Ghana was awarded a penalty shot in injury time of the first half. This generated the following controversy: a. Video replays seemed to indicate misapplication of the rule. {cite sources here}. This would be a useful and informative article. The hard part is the subjective evaluation of what events should be included, but that's nothing new to wikipedia, now is it? --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 14:45, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, and adapt to NPOV standards. Also, another good idea would be to describe the alleged controversies in chronological order, instead of just mentioning them in passing. A more formal approach, with information such as date, time, and location of the match, as well as venue names etc would definitely help. It could be like a "controversy recap" in that it could provide the contentious referee calls made throughout the 2006 WC. As NThurston said, there is value in mentioning the controversial plays and calls, but it must be done in an organized manner and in keeping with NPOV rules. --macgirl 16:29, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> It can be cleaned up, and FIFA's president has now joined in criticism of the referees. However the refereeing problems are the only significant controversy so far, none of the other topics are notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>: In response to Starghost and Gadig's thoughts - The purpose of this article is to document that there were mistakes made and there was a lot of whining about the officiating. This is very different from actually being a POV whining page. This page should not be a forum for people to say "my team got ripped." Rather, it is to say that many people felt that a particular mistake, event or action caused a lot of discussion among followers of the tournament. I know this is a very fine distinction, but it is a very important one. I fail to see how documenting facts surrounding an argument is POV, just because it involves documenting an argument. I agree that it still needs a significant rewrite, but maintain that it is notable and can be NPOV. --204.113.19.8 22:28, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, it is important to note that some of these actions have led to consequences that impact the event. Graham Poll was a likely candidate to referee the final, but that is now very unlikeley. Finally, it's not all about the refereeing. There have been other meaningful controvesies surrounding this event that need to be documented. --204.113.19.8 22:31, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are saying that the article is supposed to document mistakes. To afirm that there really were mistakes in most cases is POV (to say there's something fishy about the number of fouls between BRA and AUS is misleading, to mention a 3rd yellow card doesn't deserve it's own article). You say it's supposed to document the whining. Newsflash, fans get upset when their teams lose. You say other controversies are meaningful or notable. I disagree. I also think giving the spotlight to some of the controversies unintentionally validates them, therefore stepping over that fine distinction you mentioned. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">PHF</a> 00:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That makes no sense (and you didn't sign your comment). Deleting a section of an article is a totally different process to deleting an actual article. I definitely saw a red link at some point, so I want to know what got deleted, by who, and when, whether it got recreated or undeleted, and why I can't find any "paper trail" showing what happened! <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 07:41, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, Looking at the date in the deletion log, and seeing the date of creation of the article, I see that this is in fact a <b>recreation</b> of already deleted content. An admin earlier speedy deleted the article as "patent nonsense". The article probably looked different then, but as non-admins cannot see deleted content, we have no way of looking at the history. Does this affect the debate? Was it improperly speedy deleted before? Can it be speedy deleted now as a recreation of deleted content? To answer the last question, this debate already means that speedy deletion because of recreation is not an option. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 07:51, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Continue to improve the article as far as NPOV and references are concerned. It's a very useful reference, especially in the context of the ongoing debate whether video should assist in refereeing football matches: Many of the controversies hinge on what the replays show. Also, historians and future Wikipedia users will want to consult the controversies pertaining to individual matches, or issues such as the Togo players threatening to strike over compensation, or their coach leaving the team in their support. The issue of hair-pulling during a goal at the England-Togo match is a good example of a controversy not resulting from a referee's decision, and one that a referee may well be expected to miss but which affected the score -- a fine addition to the historical record. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareklug_38c6.html" title="User:Mareklug">Mareklug</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareklug_3424.html" title="User talk:Mareklug"><sup><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></sup></a> 01:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> There is absolutely no possible way this article can ever be NPOV. Personally, I think Australia got screwed today, but Italians would likely disagree. Which side is correct?

<li><b>Keep</b> but as said above, needs a bit of cleanup. Just stating the word 'controversial penalty' means very little - controversial to who and why? , although if links to relevant articles and clips could be provided. Examples such as the 3 yellow cards are unavoidable and even FIFA acknowledge that these are real 'controversies' and are definately worthy wiki topics.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - please note that this article was initially a recreation of previously deleted content, though it presumably has improved since then. It would be nice if an admin could somehow merge the page history of the deleted page into the page history of the recreated article, so that everyone can see the <b>full history</b> of the articles written on this subject. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 07:51, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> the useful stuff, and <b>Weak Delete</b> the rest. What "controversies" were there in previous FIFA World Cups that would warrant a separate page like this one? The unusual occurrence of 3 yellow cards to the same player is discussed elsewhere, and this is notable for not having occurred before. The T&amp;T pay dispute is also notable and is discussed elsewhere. These should be migrated elsewhere and merged with other similar text if possible. However, it's not unusual to have refereeing decisions that caused discussion among fans of the game. Such decisions would likely occur in every World Cup and whether they were dubious or controversial can be strongly POV. No good criteria exist for selecting dubious refereeing decisions. Such a list could be very long indeed! Most of the article lacks references. The article lacks the time the various refereeing "controversies" occured and thus it is more difficult to substantiate them. Finally, the user that created the page has made no other Wikipedia contributions. --<a href="../../../b/2E/d/User%7EB.d.mills_9f02.html" title="User:B.d.mills">B.d.mills</a> 08:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>I dont think you can cite original research in fairness, the content is from proven sources - specifically the FIFA website. Also it is a relation of actual events which IMO does not constitue research but observation. I thinkthe important question is does the content belong here or split up and distributed between the other FIFA 2006 articles as <i>criticism</i> (for example).

<dd>I believe I can cite the lack of original research as the article fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> in that the FIFA citations (with the exception of the citation of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepp_Blatter_fba6.html" title="Sepp Blatter">Sepp Blatter</a> comments) explain the rules and some editors have taken it upon themselves to interpret the rules themselves based on what they saw (all of the "appears to show" analysis is original research). Perhaps I was a bit hasty in saying the whole thing should be scrapped, as the bit with Togo, and the comments by <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a> officials could certainly be distributed appropriately (not criticisms, so much as news) elsewhere. However, these few bits of encyclopedic information do not excuse the completely POV OR nature of the article <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 12:30, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><s>Actually, upon further review, I'm going to vote <b>Keep for now</b> per others, so we can have a reference point for all of this, as the competition isn't even over yet. Once over, we can collaborate and write it in such a way that it'll be encyclopedic and a great addendum to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_25dc.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> article, as the yellows have been flying like crazy.

<dd>I've spent a bit of time on the article today and have researched all of the sources and citations, and I'm going back to my original <b>Strong Delete</b> vote; I actually tried to justify what should and shouldn't be included by using stringent WP policy, but was unable to, given the nature of the sources and incidents. I had to interpret the sources and citations from WP policy, but it was <i>my</i> view of whether or not the sources were NPOV or not, as it's so subjective. Therefore, much of the editing I intended to do was compromised. One can see the talk page for a look at what I was trying to do in remaining NPOV and NOR. Certain incidents, however, such as the three yellows, the record number of cards, and the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepp_Blatter_fba6.html" title="Sepp Blatter">Sepp Blatter</a> comments should be merged into the article where appropriate. <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 16:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you are all saying here and perhaps the title 'controversy' is a little mis-;eading. I think the thought of the original and cirrent authors is to highlight areas of dispute / human error in the 2006 finals. If 2 newspapers take a different view over something (eg the final seconds penalty in the AUS / Italy game) then it is obviously a dispute of interest. THe article does provide an objective view of that (and all the other) incidents (or just about anyway) in my opinion. Taking the example of that penalty again I don't think saying one team find it a controversy and one team don't is fair. I watched the match and am impartial (supporting neither team plus England are unlikely to play either of them) and think that it was a contreversial decision - not because it was wrong but because of the outcome from it -&gt; Italy scored and won the match. Now even if it is a foul (I personally think not but that is your own opinion) the decision would be contreversial. It is the timing and the oucome that determines it!!! Some of these commments are response to bits and pieces up the page so I stuck it down here for ease. --<font>&#160;<a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">Tmorton166 (Errant Emote)</a><sup><font>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmorton166_fe7b.html" title="User talk:Tmorton166">talk</a></font></sup></font> 14:07, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, this controversy is part of the sport. At one point in the article, about the Italy v Australia, there is mention of a Italy v South Korea match in 2002. So, there is interest in understanding what are the claims surrounding that match. This article will be reference to future sport disputes. It is an integral part of the game, despite FIFA and all trying to hide or ignore some blatant, factual mistakes, like the 3 yellow cards to the same player. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaocastro_5a8e.html" title="User:Joaocastro">JoaoCastro</a> 21:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
