<ul>
<li>Excuse me? I've been doing plenty of non-VFD-related edits, and I have voted Keep or Merge on numerous articles that have been put up for VFD. I'm not sure what you're stating or implying here. I put a lot of articles up for VFD because I have been doing RC patrol, and it is very common to see articles that are either nonsense or content-free (and thus candidates for speedy deletion), or articles that are unencyclopedic and have thus been posted here for consideration. If the consensus is to keep this article, I'll go along with this. But I <b>will not</b> be bullied. Don't make veiled threats again. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 03:39, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's not supposed to be a threat, just an expression of (hopefully) paranoia. It's related to the fact that we're not doing very well at establishing a consensus on schools.

<li>True, but I think we're a little too quick to VfD advertising web pages. We tend to assume that they're a kind of spam. Which they often are. But they're also often articles about notable topics that are simply written too subjectively. Very often people VfD them when they should clean them up or make them into stubs.

<li>um, I'm sorry, but your point is...? I spent most of my "fledgling" time revising other articles etc. and have only moved onto Vfd now that my "pet topics" are pretty much complete and I'm a little more acquainted with the workings here. Is there some problem with me being new to Vfding? That I am misvoting? That I am voting too much and/or too often? That I shouldn't dare suggest a Schoolwatch article be deleted? ....orrrr what? Since you chose the word "incident", your comment sounds fairly negative in tone. Please explain, as I am curious as to what exactly you meant (or didn't mean) by this comment.

<li><b>Comment</b>: there are many university and college articles out there that look <i>much</i> worse than this one currently does (just look though some of the categories), and there are probably thousands of institutions less notable than this one too, but they have so far been left alone because of the consensus that institutions of higher education are inherently notable enough to have an article. If some people want to change that policy (or at least de facto policy), I think the right place to do that would be on a policy talk page, not here. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 01:49, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
