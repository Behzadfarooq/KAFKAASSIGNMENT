<li><b>Keep.</b> As I stated previously when I removed the PROD notice from this article, expanded the article, and tried to revise it in a manner that presents a relatively balanced view of the topic, I think the real reason for the proposed deletion is the allegation that the article topic is a fraudulent organization. This is one of the types of "reasons" discussed at <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions</a>. Fraudulent organizations can be notable (for example, see <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a>). If a notable organization is alleged to be fraudulent, it seems to me that Wikipedia should make the information available to people, rather than hiding it by deleting the article. I believe the topic is notable, as indicated by the fact that prominent <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mills.html" title="Diploma mills">Diploma mills</a> cite NAHE to support their claims of credibility and several "quackwatch"-type organizations include it in their lists of known unrecognized accreditation agencies.--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 04:30, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You haven't explained or given reason why it is notable, see: <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Is there enough details to write an article? FGT2 04:40, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have the notion that <b>Notable means "worthy of being noted" or "attracting notice".</b> That is not the same as "is easy to find extensive information about." Factors that indicate this organization is "attracting notice" include the <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mills.html" title="Diploma mills">diploma mills</a> that use it to establish credibility for themselves (examples: <a href="http://www.iufs.edu/IHEC.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.iufs.edu/IHEC.htm" rel="nofollow">International University of Fundamental Studies</a>, <a href="http://www.onlineeducationfacts.com/online-education-facts/concordia-university.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.onlineeducationfacts.com/online-education-facts/concordia-university.htm" rel="nofollow">Concordia College and University</a>, <a href="http://www.americanuniversity.org.uk/prospectusacc.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.americanuniversity.org.uk/prospectusacc.asp" rel="nofollow">American University of London</a>, and <a href="http://www.widu.us/recognition_biu_aei" class="external text" title="http://www.widu.us/recognition_biu_aei" rel="nofollow">Bircham International University</a>), news stories about fraud incidents involving this outfit (for example, <a href="http://www.billingsgazette.com/newdex.php?display=rednews/2005/04/23/build/wyoming/35-distance-degree.inc" class="external text" title="http://www.billingsgazette.com/newdex.php?display=rednews/2005/04/23/build/wyoming/35-distance-degree.inc" rel="nofollow">Cheyenne police chief defends distance-learning degree</a>), and its appearance on fraud-alert lists such as <a href="http://www.cpec.ca.gov/CollegeGuide/NonAccredited.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.cpec.ca.gov/CollegeGuide/NonAccredited.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpec.ca.gov/CollegeGuide/NonAccredited.asp</a> . --<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 05:21, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> the fact the article has been edited to show that it is an un-accredited facilty, with little else of note, maybe worth a re-direct straight to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unrecognized_accreditation_associations_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning">List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning</a>. <sup><a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_e3b4.html" title="User:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana" color="#6633CC">Khu</font></b></a><a href="../../../k/h/u/User_talk%7EKhukri_0ba4.html" title="User talk:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana" color="#CC66FF">kri</font></b></a> -</sup> 09:36, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Unsure</b> it's discussed a lot, and often in reliable sources, but only in the manner of a directory entry listing it as unrecognized. I can't find a source which states outright that it's an accreditation mill, but I can find sources that state several of its accredited schools are degree mills. Smerge and redirect to the list of unrecognized accrediting agencies may be the best result. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It does not have multiple, non-trival mentions, and therefore should be deleted. This is a WEBPAGE tied to diploma mills. Can you verify this is a real group or anything it claims to be? 17:05, 13 February 2007 (UTC) --The preceding unsigned comment was posted by <b>FGT2</b></dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. If we are going to do lists of red links, i.e. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unrecognized_accreditation_associations_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning">List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning</a>, we should do articles on the underlying institutions. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Whether it's a real organisation or an accreditation mill doesn't matter in this debate: it's got the references to support the notability claim, so the decision is straightforward. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 17:15, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> No one has proved it is notable. The only thing cited is it belongs on a list of <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accreditation_mill.html" title="Accreditation mill">accreditation mills</a>. Read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>: "<b>A company, corporation, organization, group, product, or service is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, the source of which is both: 1) independent of the company, corporation, organization or group itself, or of the product's or service's manufacturer or vendor, and 2) reliable.</b>" The newspaper in the article does not mention this subject, it mentions a <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">diploma mill</a>. FGT2 01:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> being a fraudulent business isn't reason for deletion, but being a probably dishonest attempt to pose as a notable fraudulent business is good reason, especially as the article exists in good part to promote another article. Truly notable fake accreditation agencies get many more media references than this one has. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:42, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, while vandalism is not a good deletion argument, lack of sourcing is. The three sources cited in the article are a "name drop" and therefore trivial. No indication this subject is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 05:31, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
