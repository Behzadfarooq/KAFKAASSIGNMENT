<p>As "fascist" is a pejorative term that no one uses to identify themselves, this list violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. In addition, some of the people listed here are still living, which violates <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, especially given that the entire list is unsourced. Perhaps this could be replaced by a List of historical fascists, as there were political parties and people 60+ years ago who did call themselves fascist. As it is, this list merely invites the constant adding of right wing politicians and others who various editors don't like. <a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 00:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Maybe it should be renamed to self identified fascists, but that's not the concern in an AfD. Similarly, there may be some entries which should not be there, but that's not a reason for deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b> The word "fascist", applied strictly, can only be applied to members of the Italian party founded by Benito Mussolini. If it is to be applied to any right-wing politician, from the Nazis down (or up) then the list is so hopelessly incomplete as to be totally non-encyclopedic.

<li>Yes, the fact that it's a pejorative term.

<li>If there are a sizable number of people who honestly self-identify as an idiot or a bastard, and they are notable in relation to those things, then we <i>should</i> have those lists. Now, I don't think that this list, or <i>any</i> ideological list for that matter, should be applied to someone who does not self-identify as a fascist/libertarian/conservative/whatever.

<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b> to list of historical (self-proclaimed) fascists per nom. This could be a useful page, but it has problems. As can be seen from the edit history, it's controversial. Fascism is pejorative in many cases and could be used for a sneaky Wiki-attack. Also, the definition of "fascist" on this page is too loose - if the subjects were self-proclaimed fascists, that would be fine, but some of those on the list could equally well be said to be far right-wing or Neo-Nazi; that's not the same as fascism. As an aside, the page is also a target for vandals. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 01:29, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> since the reasons for deletion are flawed in a few respects.
<ul>
<li>"As "fascist" is a pejorative term..." is an incorrect statement because the term is used simply as a descriptive term to describe a political ideology. There is an article on fascism used the way you consider it at <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_%28epithet%29.html" title="Fascist (epithet)">Fascist (epithet)</a> but the list explicitly does not use that definition. Certainly, the original PNF were called, and called themselves, fascist but no one would say it is being used perjoratively. Any one adding someone who is not obviously a "fascist" ideologically (with references) is immediately reverted as the article's history shows.</li>
<li>"...that no one uses to identify themselves, this list violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>." this statement is incorrect since some people do refer to themselves as fascist or a related ideology (falange, national socialist, etc.). In fact, there was a recent Deletion review to allow the Category of Fascist Wikipedians to be re-created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_March_5" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_March_5" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for those who do self-identify sa a fascist.</li>
<li>"In addition, some of the people listed here are still living, which violates <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>". How so? If someone added George W. Bush to the list (and it stayed on it for more than a minute before being reverted) it would violate it but what about Pino Rauti? Some of the neo-Nazi's on the list could be argued I suppose but that is a separate issue that does not warrant deletion of the entire list especially since most people on the list are dead.</li>
<li>"...especially given that the entire list is unsourced." Actually, everyone of those figures does (well, should) have sources for them being a fascist in their own articles. To have the sources for everyone on the list page would clutter it up and is completely unnecessary. Do we have references for everything added to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Atari_7800_games_8b6f.html" title="List of Atari 7800 games">List of Atari 7800 games</a> on the page with the list? No, and, therefore, we do the same with this list. - <a href="../../../d/n/e/User%7EDNewhall_a69a.html" title="User:DNewhall">DNewhall</a> 01:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The introduction to the article claims not to use the term as an epithet, but the actual items on the list shows that it is being used that way. The problem stems from the way the word "fascist" is used in multiple ways, which could include anyone from WWII Italian fascists to modern Neo-Nazis and white supremacists to simply conservative right wing politicians. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Black_%28nationalist%29_1204.html" title="Don Black (nationalist)">Don Black (nationalist)</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a>, for example. White supremacists and nationalists would generally claim not to be fascist, and being a white supremacist or nationalist does not imply one believes in dictatorship or totalitarianism. A few hundred years ago, most of the white population of the US held beliefs such that we would now consider them to be white supremacists; were they all fascists? The term "fascist" is too broad and too pejorative to make a List of fascists keepable. (And, not that this is reason to delete or keep, but your claims that any items on the list which aren't sourced are immediately removed is clearly not true, there are about 50 redlinks in the list, where are our sources on these? And most of the people on the list which we do have articles on, which I checked, I didn't see justification for calling them fascist) --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 03:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Not due to the nom's reasoning, but because the subject of the list is a bit broad. Instead, a category would be better suited.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 01:54, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While I can see the ideal usefulness of this list, I'm concerned that out of eight people who I picked off the list (most at random), <b>none</b> had the work "fascist" in their Wikipedia entries. In other words, if they were so self-identified, why isn't this mentioned in their articles? (And some articles were quite long with extensive sources.) Yes, they all shared <i>some</i> characteristics of fascist philosophy but, as far as I could see, fascist was being applied to them <i>externally</i> and as an epithet for their Neo-Nazi/authoritarian/anti-Semitic/racist/etc. beliefs. I'm not one to defend such people but if I got a 0 for 8 result, I have little trust in this list. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b><font color="green">Pig</font></b><sup><font color="red">man</font></sup></a><sub><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">dialogue</a></sub> 02:58, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No one has questioned whether it was notable, the criticism of it is that it's not NPOV. "Notability" is not our only requirement for keeping an article. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 03:41, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> With a term that could be used pejoratively in the name of the article, we should be insisting on attribution with footnotes because the potential for libeling someone in an ugly way is enormous here, yet there is not one single footnote or reference of any kind in the article. Also, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> is a Hitler-loving racist according to the Wikipedia article on him, but I think it's inaccurate to call him a fascist in the terms of the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> article that was mentioned earlier in this discussion, because I don't think he adheres to all of the "integral" tenets mentioned in that definition (I don't think he's in "opposition to laissez-faire capitalism"). It does nobody any good to be inaccurate in identifying extremists. What we need are separate lists, with each item footnoted, and with a definition of the label at the top, including what criteria put people on the list or leave others off of it. Delete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Fascists_1eb2.html" title="List of Fascists">List of Fascists</a>, then let someone, if they want, start the whole thing over along the lines I described, because I think the current list is useless and unsalvageable. We should have a List of racial supremicists, List of Nazis, and List of Ku Klux Klan members to cover the extremists who don't fit in the Fascists list. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. A similar article, List of communists, seems to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_communists_5e33.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of communists">have been nominated as well</a>, for those who are interested.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 06:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> although many of the entries on the list should probably be taken away. The nominator's statement, "..."fascist" is a pejorative term that no one uses to identify themselves" is in part incorrect. That the term a perjorative term today is true, but <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benito_Mussolini_f411.html" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> for instance did refer to himself as a "fascist".

<li><b>Keep</b> Editing can deal with any who do not belong or whose fascism is not attested by sources satisfying [[WP:ATT] in the primary article on the person. I see a number of well substantiated fascists such as Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler, and Mussolini on the list, and there is good reason for historical information to maintain such a list. Any editor can remove any unsupported entry (such as a prank listing of someone's high school principle or parent). <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:21, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If some entry in the list is questionable, someone can put a citation needed tag or still better, provide a reference or remove the entry. But having some questionable entries does not mean the list has to be deleted. Self-identification could be used as a criterion.

<li><b>Delete</b> Not useful, really, and can be controversial. People may try this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_fascists&amp;diff=107949363&amp;oldid=107479137" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_fascists&amp;diff=107949363&amp;oldid=107479137" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and even if that is kept a watch on, I don't see a real reason for this page.

<li><b>Comment</b>: the criteria who's included here are obviously impossible to enforce. Czechoslovakia includes 4 names of which only Gajda fits here (leader of party named fascist, supporter of corporativism). Moravec was an opportune propagandist, Frank and Henlein mere nationalists and separationalists. Stříbrný, Kramář, Domin - leaders of fascists parties and groups are missing. The list looks degenerated into "list of every bad guy". <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 23:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
