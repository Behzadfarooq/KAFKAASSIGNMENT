<b>RATIONALE FOR DELETION:</b>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Votes appear primarily based on whether people were amused by the article or not. This violates <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">WP:N#Notability is not subjective</a>.</li>
<li>The admin decided "Keep" but did not follow <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other."
<ul>
<li>NOTE: <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanker.html" title="Wanker">Wanker</a> has only one non-trivial published work cited about "Wanker". (No blame to the admin - no one even mentioned this omission in the prior Afd discussion).</li>

<li><u>Per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, this is so "even though there may be many examples of the term in use", such as listed in the article's sections <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanker.html#Usage_and_social_acceptability" title="Wanker">Wanker#Usage and social acceptability</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanker.html#Wanker_in_popular_culture" title="Wanker">Wanker#Wanker in popular culture</a>.</u></li>
<li><u>Per the section "Reliable sources for neologism", <u>To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term</u>. This article contains only one reference <i>about</i> the term.

At minimum, please let's remove the "popular references"/trivia sections altogether which as is so often the case, are out of control and a net negative - and well, a crap magnet in themselves in this such a case.

<li><b>Redirect</b> I don't care if it goes to masturbation or if it's a soft redirect to Wiktionary's wanker page. It's a valid search term, but not really a valid article topic as it can easily be discussed within masturbation. Heck, "Wanker" was also the b-side of The Darkness's "One Way Ticket" single, so turn it into a disambig page if you like. &lt;shrug&gt; Any of these options would be suitable, but an article really isn't appropriate at this time.

<li><b>Comment</b>, the nominator appears to be on a quest of some sort to eliminate earthy Anglo-Saxon terms relating to sex from Wikipedia, always using the justification <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> ("recently coined" words that do not "appear in dictionaries") although these are established slang terms or colloquialisms.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Make personal attacks against me as you will. However, <b>the deepest problem with the article is its lack of established notability:</b> "A topic is notable if and only "if it has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other." "The subject of" <u>does not</u> equal <u>merely mentioned in</u>. Right now, the cold hard facts mean the article does not meet that criteria. <b>Note:</b> Culling together sources that merely mention <i>Wanker</i> <u>as a colloquialism</u> only asserts that the article is, in fact, Synthesis and Original Research. I suggest if you want to keep this article, you best expend your efforts finding sources where <i>Wanker</i> "has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other." Right now it has only one which <i>does not</i> equal "mulitple". Meeting notability per Wikipedia policies, and only that, is what will keep this article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability_is_not_subjective</a>. - <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 08:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, it's "merely mentioned" in the dictionary. This nomination is pushing the envelope of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 08:51, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>POV Pushing by whom, the authors or the AfD nominator? <i>Wanker</i> as an offensive colloquial term for "masturbator" indeed needs to be mentioned as such in <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a>, nothing more, unless and only unless notability for <i>wanker</i> <u>as a term</u> worthy of an article as such is verified as "<u>the subject of</u> [not merely mentioned in] multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other" (bracketed verbiage added for clarity). <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 09:13, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Firstly, wanker is slang, it is not colloquial. Secondly it means more than simply "one who masturbates". If I called someone a wanker it means I consider them to be irritating not because I think they go home and masturbate. Again, wanker is in the dictionary, it is the subject of a definition of its meaning. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 09:22, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if you can establish that <i>Wanker</i> is notable because <i>as a term</i> "it has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other" with "subject of" <u>not</u> equating with <u>merely mentioned in</u> articles - then fine.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article is about the term <i>wanker</i>, not about "wanking," so redirect to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> is not appropriate (much as a redirect of <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a> to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> is not called for). The word is not a neologism, but has been in common currency for quite a long time. Multiple published references support both the word's sociolinguistic notability and much of the content of the article.

<li><b>Strong Keep:</b> This is a commonly used term in Australia, as well as Britain and New Zealand. Given this, frankly, only an American would consider the term a neologism. Given this, to delete the article would be to pander to an American cultural Point of View. I would also like to add that an article needing improvement (e.g. more sources, etc.) in spite of very common usage and clear potential for improvement should not be deleted. I would further add that it is often not used in its literal sense (i.e. often someone is called a 'wanker' even if they do not regularly engage in masturbation), and thus anyone who thinks that merging the article with masturbation is... for lack of a better term... a wanker. - <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmishThrasher_13f9.html" title="User:AmishThrasher">AmishThrasher</a> 07:33, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Where to start? 1) <i>Inadequacy of previous AfD</i> - the result of the AfD was overwhelmingly for keep, and appears to have been so for non-trivial reasons - virtually none of those who voted keep appear to have done so "based on whether people were amused by the article or not", as anyone actually reading that AfD should be able to clearly see. 2) <i>Neologism, including the bit about "non-trivial sources about rather than using the word"</i> - I'd regard the <i>Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang</i> as such a source. It cites the term Wanker as having been used since at least 1950 in its listing of the word. 3) <i>Mergability</i> - the popular usage of this word <i>per se</i>, as opposed to its usage as a term meaning masturbation, is enough for it to survive as a separate article. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 07:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A number of the formulae ["you wanker" and "fuck off, wanker" (from page 205)] use as a form of address the word <i>wanker</i>. Literally, the word <i>wanker</i> in New Zealand English denotes a male who masturbates. But it is also used as a general term of abuse among New Zealand males.

It's obvious that this isn't a neologism by any stretch of the imagination. As for redirecting to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">Masturbation</a>, that's blatantly misleading. In modern usage, "You are a wanker" does <b>not</b> strictly mean "You are a regular masturbator". That's exactly why this article needs more than a dictionary definition, to make it clear what the expression actually means nowadays, and show examples of how it's used nowadays. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 08:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC) <a name="More_reference-padding" id="More_reference-padding"></a>

<p>Above I demonstrated by evidence that the reference in the article, <u>Jenny Cheshire, 1991, <i>English Around the World: sociolinguistic perspectives,</i> Cambridge University Press, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0521395658</a></u>, verified nothing in the article except a dictionary definition.</p>

</dl>
<p>Just as with the book, I searched its entire digitized contents for the term <i>Wanker</i>.</p>
<p>The word appears <u>once</u> in the book, on page 36, within a table that categorizes British "swear" words from "Very mild" to "Very strong". There under the "Moderate" section we find the word <i>Wanker</i> in its sole entry in the book.</p>
<p>The mention was so minor that <i>Wanker</i> does not appear in the book's Index on page 275, where it would appear otherwise between "VALA" and "warrants". In contrast, the word <i>fuck</i> is discussed in some depth in the book, and appears in its Index as such, on 40 of the book's pages.</p>
<p>Page 36 of the book, other pages, as well as the book's entire index can be viewed at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415258375&amp;id=iKbvbEwNjugC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;ots=NLoQNfcvYH&amp;dq=Swearing+in+English:+Bad+Language,+Purity+and+Power+from+1586+to+the+Present+wanker&amp;sig=-lvzmVG03R0CpZ61_wgBT8DdZ8g#PPA275,M1" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415258375&amp;id=iKbvbEwNjugC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;ots=NLoQNfcvYH&amp;dq=Swearing+in+English:+Bad+Language,+Purity+and+Power+from+1586+to+the+Present+wanker&amp;sig=-lvzmVG03R0CpZ61_wgBT8DdZ8g#PPA275,M1" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanker.html" title="Wanker">Wanker</a>, the sole pertinent reference cited in specifically the reference section is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Cameron, Deborah "Naming of Parts: Gender, Culture, and Terms for the Penis among American College Students", in <i>American Speech</i> Vol. 67, No. 4 p372.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the entire journal article, the word <i>wanker</i> appears only once, indicating nothing more than the fact that college students in the researcher's study group used the word <i>wanker</i> as slang for masturbation. Here is the exact sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apart from the two fellatio-related terms above, there are two references to anal sex, <i>rectum wrecker</i> and <i>anal intruder</i>; <b>and one to masturbation, <i>wanker</i>.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is the full extent of the coverage of <i>wanker</i> in the reference. No further discussion or mention is made.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanker.html" title="Wanker">Wanker</a> claims,</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wanker...is also a slang term for penis used by American college students. This usage implies that the penis is primarily a tool for masturbation.[1]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Obviously, based on the cited source, the claim that <i>wanker</i> is a term for <i>penis</i> is not verifiable, patently false. This speaks nothing of the ludicrous Synthesis/OR claim that follows, "This usage implies that the penis is primarily a tool for masturbation."</p>

<li>I just want to mention here that the nominator did NOT nominate this article after extensive research.

Only when after two days almost everybody disagreed with these arguments, the nominator did research on the article and switched to the arguments of "WP:WINAD", "WP:V" and "WP:OR". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wanker_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=98600959&amp;oldid=98589640" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wanker_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=98600959&amp;oldid=98589640" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I would also point out that over 150 pages link here. Ok, a good chunk of them are talk pages but a good chunk of them aren't.

<li><b>Keep</b> - popular, notable term.

<li><b>Keep</b> Extremely well known in New Zealand. The illustration is correct - just one eg. it was recently featured in advertising a chocolate milk shake drink. There are tone issues and excessive pop culture references, but these don't justify a delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this article is excellent especially for non-native English speakers. The wiktionary entry only doesn't help these people much.

<li><b>Keep</b>.
