<p>The result was I'm closing this as a <b>keep</b>. After discounting one newbie I get 13 keep to 6 delete votes. I'm further discounting several delete votes. One admits it needs a rewrite, but vote to delete anyway (articles that can be fixed with a rewrite aren't deleted). Another claims that being a CEO at three companies is not notable without explaining why that would be (there's several valid articles about people who are CEO of just one company). The article may using some questionable press release-based sources now, but reliable sources are available as several keep voters have pointed out. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This editor appears to get his jollies about questioning my intentions. All right, I admit it: this is really a <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">Single purpose account</a> and has been all along. That's right! I only created it to attack this page....erm, and also to do about 75 other edits on completely, um, unrelated topics. The word is out—you can post it to your newsletter (along with that exclusive interview with Brandenburg that you've been waiting to publish). Anyhow, I thought I might mention that <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanlys212_026b.html" title="User:Stanlys212">Stanlys212</a>'s pointed observation doesn't seem to be true anymore. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 08:53, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> - Notability is somewhat borderline and the article could use some clean up, but the subject is far more worthy of an encyclopedic entry than, well...I won't go there.

<dd>Actually, I <i>would</i> like some clarification--I'm a bit of a newbie and listed this page because it was flagged as unencyclopedic (See <a href="../../../b/r/y/Talk%7EBryan_Brandenburg_6534.html" title="Talk:Bryan Brandenburg">Talk:Bryan Brandenburg</a>). From my reading of the notability guidelines, this topic clearly fails. I couldn't find any articles actually <i>about</i> him; rather, just articles with short quotes <i>by</i> him answering questions about companies he's worked for. The articles I did find are trivial and seem more like press releases than anything else.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person."--I've looked and I just can't find anything like that, so I think it's clear this subject fails this criterion. Looking at the other criteria, I can't see any evidence that this subject "made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in [his] specific field" or that he's "received multiple independent reviews of or awards for [his] work." Walking through all of the tests, I can't see any evidence that this subject is even remotely close to the underlying principles of the WP:BIO guidelines--which is why I posted the article up for discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Still, I'm new here, so if I'm way off the mark here I'd like to make sense of it. So, just to clarify, in practice are individuals deemed biographically "notable" by comparing them to existing articles in the encyclopedia? I ask this because that is how I interpret the last comment and I'd like to know about the practical guidelines with respect to notability. To me, the written guideline seems to set a standard (albeit a fuzzy one) which is miles away from "keep articles if they're clearly better than others you've seen." <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 06:50, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Ack, I've been <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outing.html" title="Outing">outed</a>! The truth is, I'm a closet Brandenburg fan. I had a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a>, back when it was <i>cutting edge technology</i>, and as a result, I was supporting an article which really didn't meet standards as described by the nom. I have stricken my original comment and reversed my position. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> should be commended for making a strong original nomination and for following up with such <i>extremely</i> well-reasoned and well-written support.

<li><s>Nice little sarcastic roast. I had to laugh&#160;:-D—and I loved the jabs at both my intelligence and my newbie status!</s> Anyhow, I figured I should be clear that I wasn't trying to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite</a> at you, <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup>, I just wanted to understand how this process really works—so that in the future I don't nominate articles for deletion that shouldn't be (thereby wasting people's time and taking up space on the AfD pages). I've been reading and using Wikipedia for about two years now and recently decided I ought to try and get more involved. So, I read most of the guidelines and dove in. Well, that's where I'm coming from—no hard feelings and sorry if I came across as biting; I wasn't intending to. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 18:51, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> – 71.116.216.221 Thanks for your input! I went through the links that you posted (many of which are listed in the article itself) and <b>did a content analysis</b> on each one—for brevity I've <b>posted the results</b> on the <b><a href="../../../b/r/y/Talk%7EBryan_Brandenburg_6534.html" title="Talk:Bryan Brandenburg">article's talk page</a></b>, so you and others may review it there. Unfortunately, one can't claim that Brandenburg is the <i>primary subject</i> of any of the linked articles, which is one of the main reasons I nominated the article for deletion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the Google test you did, while around 500 hits is comparitively large with respect to most video game programmers, most U.S. university professors yield at least 10,000 Google hits. So, it is hard to claim that "a search for the subject produce[s] a large number of distinguishable hits". Additionally, it's hard to claim that Brandenburg's companies are <i>major</i>, since two are now non-existent and none of them were/are publicly traded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> – <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben">Dallben</a> Actually, <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculptured_Software_139a.html" title="Sculptured Software">Sculptured Software</a> was acquired by <a href="../../../a/c/c/Acclaim_Entertainment_743f.html" title="Acclaim Entertainment">Acclaim Entertainment</a>, a publicly traded company. <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering_Animation%2C_Inc._72bf.html" title="Engineering Animation, Inc.">Engineering Animation, Inc.</a> who acquired his second company, was a publically traded company.

<dd><b>Comment</b>—I think I should probably clarify (lest ye accuse me of mudslinging) that I am not stating that Brandenburg is not notable in general—really, every person <i><b>is</b></i> within their realm of friends and associates. Rather, I'm claiming (and I feel the data supports this) that he is not notable <i>with respect to Wikipedia guidelines</i>. My comment on public trading was simply supporting evidence for the claim that this article fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. (As a side note, just being publicly traded doesn't actually make a company notable according to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, just for you <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinux_monster_0c36.html" title="User:Linux monster">Linux_monster</a> and because I'm a glutton for punishment, I browsed the entire contents of a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22bryan+brandenburg%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22bryan+brandenburg%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google search for Bryan Brandenburg</a> in case I missed some big story about him. In my perusal, I found out that Google's hit estimate was off (there are actually only around 215 distinct pages indexed) and that some of those hits relate to other Bryan Brandenburgs. For example, there is/was a candidate for <a href="http://www.brandenburgforcommissioner.com" class="external text" title="http://www.brandenburgforcommissioner.com" rel="nofollow">county commissioner</a> in Michigan and a <a href="http://www.citea.org/images/hist_archives/citea_photo_archives_document.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.citea.org/images/hist_archives/citea_photo_archives_document.htm" rel="nofollow">Bryan Brandenburg Co.</a> that existed in California in the 1920s. However, in the results there are no significant independent articles about <i>this</i> Brandenburg. In fact, the vast majority of articles that mention him are about <a href="../../../z/y/g/Zygote_Media_Group_406b.html" title="Zygote Media Group">Zygote Media Group</a>, a company whose current websites don't even make historical mention of Brandenburg (As evidenced by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22bryan+brandenburg%22+site%3Azygote.com+OR+site%3A3dscience.com&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22bryan+brandenburg%22+site%3Azygote.com+OR+site%3A3dscience.com&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this Google Search</a>—note that although some links appear, Brandenburg's name does not appear in any of the pages). So, if you feel this nomination is in error, please just produce the documents and references necessary to support the notability claim—I've done my best to find some and at this point I am confident that the article has been given an unbiased review. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 15:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At any rate, that's my take on the available information. You state at the end of your entry that "Bryan Brandenburg is one of the grandfathers of the Utah game industry", which seems to indicate you're familiar with him and might know more about him. Do you know of any specific articles about Brandenburg or maybe a book (independent from him) that is written about him? If we could produce a set of independent and significant articles about his connection to the game industry, that might be a way to keep the article. The only Web articles I can find don't even mention he had anything to do with the game industry (except for his credit listings in games, of course). <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 07:13, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He was CEO of Software Arts International, which was acquired by EAI. At that time, he was made head of the SLC studio of EAI. Certainly a prominent figure of EAI, but not the CEO. Sculptured was a pretty significant <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_developer.html" title="Video game developer">video game developer</a> and he was a founder of it. But I agree that all those articles that are listed that barely mention him or just Zygote should be removed. The articles he wrote could go in a "Bibliography" section. One last note, I think Brandenburg wrote most of the article himself. Don't know if that really matters, but I had to go back and remove gushing comments from the article from time to time. — <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 18:27, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I knew Brandenburg at Sculptured which grew to almost 100 people, a very large group of indies. <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalanche_Software_85ff.html" title="Avalanche Software">Avalanche Software</a> were former programmers and sold to Disney.

Saffire was another company spawned out of Sculptured <a href="http://www.saffire.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.saffire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.saffire.com/</a>.</p>
<p>EAI Interactive was a pretty big deal. They did games for Disney, Hasbro, Mattel, Hannah Barbarra. Brandenburg was the top guy for the interactive division. He also did some outdoors thing with <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Malone_8876.html" title="Karl Malone">Karl Malone</a>. Don't know much about that but published some books.</p>

<p>Not sure what he's up to now, but I'm sure it will be big.

<li>Thank you for adding to this discussion. I noticed that the links resulting from the Google News Archive search match up well with those already listed in connection with this nomination.

In addition, can you claim that Brandenburg is the primary subject of any one of these articles? <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 06:51, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for contributing to the discussion. I have done a lot of searching in relation to this article and am curious if you can produce any sources related to Brandenburg's role in gaming (as implied by your opening sentence). The references that I can find are press releases about companies Brandenburg has worked for and I can't find any independent articles about his gaming contributions. In addition, could you specifically identify which of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines (if any) these links support? I am a fairly new editor and am hoping to gain a better understanding of how accurate the guidelines are.

<li><s><b>Speedy Keep</b></s> <b>Keep</b>First let me start by saying that it is not helpful that the prod was deleted without comment and I concur with <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben">Dallben</a> that its one reason for this article to be in AfD. That said, the subject's importance, the extent of reference materials on both him and the ventures he has been involved in, and involvement in the history of gaming and graphics is beyond dispute. One doesn't have to be Sid Meier to qualify for notability. I sense extreme Deletionism gone awry. I strongly disagree with users like <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> since founding even one succesful company is notable. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndless_blue_2cba.html" title="User:Endless blue">Endless blue</a> 00:39, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Thanks for voicing your opinion—it will hopefully help this discussion to come to a resolution. I am sorry if this nomination appears to be <i>Deletionism gone awry</i>—please know that being a deletionist was not my intent; rather, a clearer understanding of the process and the validity of Wikipedia's guidelines. From my perspective, I saw something that was deemed unencylopedic, read the guidelines as carefully as possible, measured this article against those guidelines and found it more than just a couple of standard deviations from the mean.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, this AfD ensued and it's been interesting. Still, I hold to my original reasoning—in fact, the experience in researching has only verified for me my claim that this article does not stand up to the Wikipedia guideline. But, since I'm a newer editor, I'm happy to concede the difference between a concrete guideline and a practical one. If you feel the guideline is wrong, express how and why, that way we all know where you're coming from.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That aside, it <i>is</i> helpful to know which claims fall within the concrete written guidelines and which do not. For example, you state that Brandenburg's "involvement in the history of gaming and graphics is beyond dispute," but I can find no significant references to his involvement in gaming and his <i>verfiable</i> involvement in graphics are press releases from companies in which he's been a prominent figure (and are therefore not independent of him). Given sufficient capital, any company can woo the press into printing something about them. So, since you are so adamant about this article being kept, can you produce references that explicitly fulfill the guideline? If not, what guideline are you actually using to justify notability and which references fulfill it? (Please note that I'm not trying to be contentious or to get you to change your vote—I'm more interested in understanding the foundation and reasoning of your argument).

<dd><b>Comment</b> The subject has been cited in a number of non-trival third party articles, include reliables sources like Forbes and MacWorld. That means that the subject confirms to the guidelines for notability in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The following quotation from said same guidline should explain it:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries <i>except</i> for the following:
<ul>
<li>Media reprints of the person's autobiography or self-promotional works.</li>
<li>Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<dd><b>Response</b>—It is exactly this guideline, which is clearly not being met (at least, no articles have been reproduced yet). Here's my reasoning: let's dissect this guideline and use it to filter articles from being credible candidates:
<ul>
<li>"The person has been the <i><b>primary subject</b></i>..." — the article in Forbes and the mention of his webcast panel interview (he was interviewed along with two other unrelated individuals) in MacWorld are great news…for Zygote Media Group and DAZ Productions, respectively. That is, the primary subjects of the articles are <i>the companies</i>, not Brandenburg. This is true for all of the cited sources.</li>
<li>"...of multiple non-trivial published works..." — It is true, Forbes and MacWorld are non-trivial, but the articles in which Brandenburg's mentioned are.</li>
<li>"...whose source is independent of the person." — This has probably the greatest effect on the claims. The vast majority of the links available clearly resulted from press releases made by the companies Brandenburg worked for. Therefore, it is unfair to claim these articles make him notable, because the articles are not <i>independent</i> of him.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>That said, I am still awaiting a clear and cogent argument against my reasoning, which is based solely on the guideline. If you disagree with the guideline, then that's a different matter altogether. Since the beginning of this nomination, I've been searching and requesting for citations that really show notability. Give me the link to the Forbes article "Bryan Brandenburg: CEO" or anything like that and I think we'll have some verifiable information about Brandenburg, which we can legitimately include in this article (or even justify having an article with). <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 01:52, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I will grant you that the Forbes article mentions him almost in passing. The MacWorld article definitely mentions him and is focused on his speaking event, so I don't agree there. However, I have a fundamental difference of opinion with you on how much of a distinction you can make between articles written about companies founded by people and articles written just about those people. Based on this logic, Steve Jobs could be considered non-notable since he's rarely mentioned outside of news about Apple or Pixar. Seriously, entrepreneurs are measured by the businesses they found, and its inevitable that those businesses and other ventures will be mentioend alongside their names in articles. I believe your intepretation of "primary" places too high a hurdle for notability. That said, I think my speedy keep vote was a bit over the top and I"ve downgraded it sine the point you make is valid (if exaggerated IMHO). <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndless_blue_2cba.html" title="User:Endless blue">Endless blue</a> 02:38, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but I think you'll have to agree with me that Steve Jobs is a very poor comparison to Brandenburg. Independent authors have written a myriad of books about Jobs—we're not talking about articles, but entire volumes. Therefore, Jobs <i>clearly</i> fulfills the guideline.</dd>

<dd>In addition, I'm not saying that we eliminate all information about Brandenburg from the encyclopedia—just that there's no need for an article about him. Other editors involved in this discussion have expressed concerns about its verifiability and content. So, if this article <i>should</i> be in the encyclopedia it would necessarily be significantly sparser than it is now; probably just a few sentences and some non-redundant references—in which case, why have it? As I see it, Brandenburg's name <i><b>should</b></i> appear in the articles for the companies he's worked for and all of the salient information about him kept there (i.e., what projects he was involved in, his major contributions, etc). One surprising factoid I learned recently was that Brandenburg worked for Zygote from January 2005 to April 2006<a href="http://www.vmmg.net/news/zygote-media-group.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vmmg.net/news/zygote-media-group.shtml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. This is surprising because almost all of the articles we can find about him are as Zygote's CEO. Anyway, I think if you can produce and article specifically about Brandenburg, or perhaps a more equivalent example than Jobs, I might be more inclined to see things your way.

<p><b>Comment</b>: I have given my vote above. At this point, I wish to note that the article presently consists of roughly a half-dozen sentences and laundry lists of games the man has worked on, links to Wikipedia articles that do not exist, and a lot of external links of which roughly half seem only tangentially related to the man. So regardless of if the man is notable, the article needs a serious re-write.

Looking at the sources cited by the article itself, and by people who have listed them above, there are more than enough good, reliable sources to write a neutral article. The fact that the article, as written, is decidedly NOT NEUTRAL is not a reason to delete. NPOV (like COI) problems are clean-up issues, not delete issues. The subject of this article deserves a Wikipedia article, even if the current one is poorly written. Start it again, clean it up.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>: I strongly feel that Brandenburg is noteworthy enough for a WP article. However, the article (in its current form) needs work. All that we have right now are six sentences, a list of contributions, and then a set of references/links. The article would be far more encyclopedic if the core was fleshed out a bit more to provide more complete background information, with the references inserted as necessary. If that were done, my vote would change to <b>Keep</b>.
