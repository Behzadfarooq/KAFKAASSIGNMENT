<p>Recently various pages of similar content, such as the Metal Gear glossary, have been deleted, this is of a similar vain and will likely never obtain any <i>real world</i> info <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Bread_c594.html" title="User:The Bread"><font color="red"><b>†he Bread</b></font></a> 04:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Fancruft, listcruft. Basically List of jokes on The Simpsons episodes involving fictional machines. What next? List of Simpsons jokes involving food, List of Simpsons jokes involving animals etc etc <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:46, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> I'm iffy on this, just because in most cases, "List of fictional...whatever" articles are lists of things inherent to the nature of the show, for example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Futurama_products_1138.html" title="List of Futurama products">List of Futurama products</a>--Futurama is set in the future, and a common joke on the show involves humourous, fururistic twists on modern-day products. The Simpsons is about family life and pop-culture in general--not <i>inventions</i>. This is just an extremely large list of an extremely random aspect of the show. Unless someone could provide a pretty good argument for keeping, I'd say delete (and who knows, there are some people who may be searching for this very thing?). <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 06:45, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There's no question that the Simpsons is notable, and will have a fair number of articles devoted to it. This list involves inventions which are often the focus of an episode, and in preference to having an article on each one, as some might possibly deserve it, I'd prefer just this one, as it can be more inclusive. Though I think this list should have links to the episodes the invention appeared in(some do already, some don't). In addition, you should note there is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_products_in_The_Simpsons_1f14.html" title="List of products in The Simpsons">List of products in The Simpsons</a> (not to mention Vehicles and Homer's jobs) with which this could be merged as a seperate section. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 07:55, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>BTW, I don't think lenght is a good argument against this list. It is not extremely large(though I could agree with removing some of the entries, that is not due to length, just inclusion), not necessarily going to get extremely large(I suppose the Simpsons could go on forever, but that's not a good argument for no list), and is short in comparison to some of the existing simpsons articles (like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_neologisms_on_The_Simpsons_2683.html" title="List of neologisms on The Simpsons">Neologisms of the Simpsons</a>).</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, Simpsonscruft, if the events were notable, move it to any appopriate article. Simpsons is rather notable, and I suggest a Simpsons wiki would be suitable for such stuff. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a fan site.

<li><b>Delete</b> I like the Simpsons, I think most people do, and, more importantly, it is one of the most important shows in the past two decades. That being said, this does NOT mean we need lists for every-possible thing involving The Simpsons. This is listcruft/fancruft. Bwitth makes the same point I'd argue; if we let this stay, then we have to let virtually all lists regarding The Simpsons, no matter how random, stay. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 23:01, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><strike>Keep</strike> strong strong keep</b> Its an interesting article, I'm sorry to say I recognise many of the inventions and its a fabulous article which has collected together some very intesting aspects of the series into one place. Is it encyclopedic? Having written some stuff on the inrationality of faith in invention, it would be very useful to have an article with so many "irrational" inventions from which to draw examples. If anything I would like to see more details on each, some diagrams or pictures, but what is already there is a very good source material. Perhaps it should be compared to a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heath_Robinson_c90f.html" title="Heath Robinson">Heath Robinson</a> invention --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 23:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Having looked at <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heath_Robinson_c90f.html" title="Heath Robinson">Heath Robinson</a> I've just discovered that it doesn't cover the subject of "heath robinson" inventions at all and apparently the only source in Wikipedia is this article.
