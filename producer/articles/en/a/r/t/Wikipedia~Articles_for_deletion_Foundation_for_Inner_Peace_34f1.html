<dd><b>Comment</b> This is not "self-promotion" by any stretch of the imagination. Take a look at the history of the page and see that this article was started by a man named <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott Perry</a>. On his personal website, Scott Perry is identified as a "student" of ACIM who lives in <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Arbor%2C_Michigan_cad1.html" title="Ann Arbor, Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a> and is a professional "licensed master plumber" <a href="http://www.miraclevision.com/perspage/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.miraclevision.com/perspage/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Foundation for Inner Peace, on the other hand, is in California and was started by Judy Skutch, a woman who comes from a wealthy New York family that, during her childhood, used to entertain <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Roosevelt_a44d.html" title="Eleanor Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> during breakfast (citation: Journey Without Distance<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587611082/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587611082/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). Mrs. Skutch hardly needs the help of a professional plumber in getting word out about the organization she helped to found. (No disrespect to plumbers. The point I'm making is obvious.) Foundation for Inner Peace did not start this article. Besides, they are a non-profit organization that does not need any advertisement anyway. ACIM has been a steady seller for more than 20 years. Go to any bookstore and you will find it there ... all without any promotion! (You will never see an ad for ACIM in any magazine. It doesn't need it. It is grass roots and spread by word of mouth.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 08:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Wikipedia states that there is a difference between "notable" and "famous." Foundation for Inner Peace is not famous. But it IS notable. Whether you had heard of these sites or organizations is not the point. The point is that within their field these organizations are notable. Oh, and it is hardly "original research" to mention an organization and then link to that organization's official website. That is actually called "verification," the thing you have claimed on three ACIM-related pages to hold so dear, and yet it is also the thing you cannot accept with regard to ACIM. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 08:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Despite the fact that there is a great deal of very acceptable and verified information about ACIM (as well as Foundation for Inner Peace), this editor wants two pages about the topic deleted, and on the main ACIM page he/she will not listen to reason and accept a verified and trustworthy citation when one is presented.

<li><b>Delete</b> or possibly merge to ACIM. This article does not assert the significance of the group - no evidence of size, influence, media coverage, uncited, no independent discussion of the group. So the article itself cries out for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to inform fellow editors: it appears that the nomination of this page by Ste4k for deletion is a “bad faith” deletion attempt. Ste4k has recently submitted deletion nominations for all of the following <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a>-related articles: <a href="../../../a/c/i/ACIM_church_movement_7dd6.html" title="ACIM church movement">ACIM church movement</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Schucman_99ad.html" title="Helen Schucman">Helen Schucman</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitudinal_healing.html" title="Attitudinal healing">Attitudinal healing</a>, Foundation for Inner Peace, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a>, Community Miracles Center, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>, Kenneth Wapnick. And in the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, Ste4k will not accept ANY websites as “verifiable” websites with regard to ACIM, including <a href="http://www.acim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.acim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acim.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.facim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.facim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.facim.org/</a>, both of which are the official websites of California-based non-profit organizations. This editor's deletion attempts are merely personal bias masquerading as adherence to Wikipedia policy. And it appears that this editor has a history with this kind of behavior.

<li>This is not necessarily the case.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I guess I get frustrated by the fact that you all say it has not verifiable evidence. It is a book publisher. It is verified that this exists. I'm also frustrated by the lack of "good faith" in all of this. These articles were started by a very nice and well meaning man who was not attempting to do anything other than contribute articles he thought would be of value to other people. There is no denying that Ste4k (or whatever) has been spiteful and mean spirited all the way through. With that, delete the article. I don't care. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 21:29, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually it is not a publisher. The book's contents are public domain. And as a publisher they only printed perhaps a couple hundred books out of a small print shop known as Freeperson's press. Have you read the valid secondary sources? The court case?
