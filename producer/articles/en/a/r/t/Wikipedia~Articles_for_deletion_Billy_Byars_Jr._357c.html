<p>RJASE1 wrote..."IMDB has a single reference to the film, with the name Billy Byars included, but I can't dig up any other info." <b>That's the point, I have spent two years "digging up" the information.</b> Are you under some strange assumption that "Google" and/or "IMDB" should be your only source? Try leaving your bedroom and visit a library for real research. However, if you are housebound and insist on only using the Internet, you must be able to find more then one reference to Billy Byars.

<p>Dhartung:</p>
<p>I don't believe suggesting to someone that "Googling" is not the only possible research, nor even research at all, is being uncivil. I do believe that calling actual professional research a "hoax" is uncivil, childish and igonorant. Especially when all one has to do is send a message to the author and ask questions.</p>
<p>Also, please, in this type of discussion forum, it may be best to refrain from "wiki speak". <b>"Weak Keep"</b>? Could you put that in more concise language?</p>

My argument is that Byars, the subject, is a topic worth having in Wikipedia, but Billy Byars Jr. the article, as it stands, is a problem article that needs trimming and cleanup to comply with Wikipedia policies, including the sacrosanct <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living persons</a> policy. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:53, 5</dd>

Dhartung:</p>
<p>Please understand "ignorant" is not a pejorative. It means "lacking knowledge". It does does not mean dumb or stupid.</p>
<p>Since I am obviously "ignorant" of "wikiworld" I would still like to be educated as to why calling someone's research a "hoax" in not considered "uncivil", especially when the researcher could easily be "messaged" with any questions.</p>
<p>As for "trimming" the article, I understand we live in a world where young adults have a "child like" attention span and can't be expected to read an article that would take them longer than 60 seconds to read, but perhaps we can begin here today and show young people what articles should be. Finally, breaking-up articles into different pages with fun hyperlink clicking may be all the rage for a tiny minority, but it gives most people a headache.</p>
<p>I hope you take my comments in the cooperative spirit intended.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a> is a particular guideline at Wikipedia and a valid rationale for deletion. By raising it, RJASE1 legitimately asked the community for consensus on whether the article was valid and verifiable enough to keep. That is a label placed on the <i>article</i>, not on an <i>editor</i>. You can't be incivil to an inanimate object, but editors are assumed to be real persons and we should all respect that. My reference to trimming was not in regard to attention spans or for brevity, but because much of the article appears difficult to reconcile with our strict policies requiring verification from reliable sources. We can keep the article if a) the article can be trimmed to encyclopedic information about the man that b) demonstrates notability. Anything that cannot be cited, but could be considered libelous, such as accusing someone of manufacturing what would today be considered child pornography, must be removed immediately, and the person wishing to keep it has the responsibility of justifying it by coming up with sources. Anything that involves synthesis, conjecture, or conclusion that is not citable to a secondary source is considered original research, and is not permitted on Wikipedia, which is by design and policy a tertiary source. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 00:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I want to apologize for using the word 'screed' and will remove the 'hoax' tag, since I'm willing to concede that this person existed. But the only fact about this person that I am willing to accept at this point is that he produced/wrote the film mentioned in the article. I don't see how that makes him notable enough for Wikipedia inclusion if there is nothing else published about him. All the gay porn stuff has got to either be referenced or removed immediately because it's potentially libellous. - <a href="../../../r/j/a/User%7ERJASE1_c81d.html" title="User:RJASE1">RJASE1</a> 22:39, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, the internet sources don't back up any of the substance of the article. The book source appears to be difficult to obtain and amazon gives a different year of publishing, possibly a change of publisher or a plain mistake. I'm uneasy about having so contentious an article with only these sources on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 23:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (changed vote). I have reviewed the article twice and as many of the sources as I can, and I find nothing indicating that Byars was truly notable. The only thing that might make it notable is the child pornography investigation, but the article states that the LA Times explicitly did not cover it. Many times the article relies on original research (e.g. tax records), conjecture, or weasel words to arrive at a conclusion. This article may be of interest to some publication, Ballog, but it is not something that belongs on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 00:41, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dhartung wrote, <b>"...Not notable..."</b>: Let's see, Son of J. Edgar Hoover's and Dwight Eisenhower's friend Billy Byars Sr., who was a multi-million dollar oil baron who owned what has become Exxon/Mobile. Both Byars are constantly mentioned in the JFK assassin theories. Oh yes, Byars Jr. arrested in what "The Meese Commission" called the largest child porn case in history. And don't forget, Byars Jr, was the employer of Loretta Young's son who pleaded guilty in the case.</p>
<p>Dhartung wrote, <b>"...The L.A. Times didn't cover it"</b>: It was the lead front page story on Saturday October 27, 1973. The paper also wrote on the the later trials.</p>
<p>Dhartung wrote, <b>"Many times the article relies on original research (e.g. tax records)"</b>: LOL. God forbid the online community is exposed to actual original scholarly research (althought I don't know of any tax records being used). I see, it's better to use second hand unverified information. Good point.</p>
<p>The article was almost completely sourced earlier today and yet it is still flagged.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I freely admit I am not an administrator - I spend most of my Wiki-time on anti-vandalism patrol. That is, however, not relevant to this debate. My bottom-line point is that the article fails verifiability criteria per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and includes potentially defamatory claims. If the non-complying material is removed from the article in its present state (and it needs to be, sooner rather than later, unless it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>, per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_controversial_material" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_controversial_material" rel="nofollow">this policy</a>), the little remaining material is not enough for the article to pass <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and the whole article should probably be deleted. I'm sorry if the author was offended - nothing personal. I recommend the author read <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. <a href="../../../r/j/a/User%7ERJASE1_c81d.html" title="User:RJASE1">RJASE1</a> 04:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Ballog, your behavior is less than stellar and can earn you a nice fat block for running afoul of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

<p><br />
<b>RJASE1</b>: You continue to fail to cite <b>specifics</b>. Please cite any potentially defamatory claims which have not been sourced or referenced. You also confuse good sourcing with "convienence" of verification by you. Simply because <b>you</b> can't read the contents of a book or magazine online does not mean it's a bad source. The fact that <b>you</b> might need to pay a fee at a web site or visit a brick and mortar library to verify a source does not make the source invalid.<br /></p>
<p>Admittedly, there has been confusion about the term "original research" here. My original research (original because I am the first to research the material for this subject) is all of previously published materials. Items such as United States birth, death, social security records, etc. are official records and are just about the most reliable source available. So to are state sex offender lists. Wiki's definition of "OR" is information that has not been previously or seperately published. The information I cite has been previously and/or seperately published.<br /></p>
<p>Simply by repeating your false claims again..."If the non-complying material is removed from the article in its present state (and it needs to be, sooner rather than later, unless it's..", does not help your argument. Once again, you fail to cite <b>specifics</b>. This constant repeating of unsubstaniated claims can be viewed as evidence that your are simply being abusive and attempting to "flame" an article.<br /></p>
<p>I previously cited three books, a magazine article, an internet article and The Los Angeles Times as sources confirming that Billy Byars, who owned Lyric which produced pornography, was arrested in 1973 for charges specified in the article. Now, please explain to me how this does not meet the criteria for sourcing?</p>

Stop being a "wikigeek" and using "WP"s to make your arguments and retorts. Can't you think for yourself? Do you really need to rely on material written by others to protect yourself.

<li><b>stubbify and recreate</b> , or delete. The problem here is that many of the occurrences are in fact notable, but they are notable as crimes. However, the subject of the article appears not to have been convicted of them, and the indictment was (according to the article itself) never prosecuted, so an attempt to discuss them from the standpoint of trying to demonstrate the subject's guilt is an obvious violation of BLP. Similarly the criminal actions of others are discussed--in some cases safely, because they have been convicted, but in some cases not, which is also a violation of BLP.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>BLP is not a technical WP matter--it is a basic principle of fairness in any encyclopedic source, and it is also the basic way of avoiding libel for any publication.</dd>
<dd>Personally, i would have deleted or at least blanked the entire article as it now stands as libel.</dd>
<dd>That does not mean an article cannot be written, for the subject of the article is unfortunately notable, and sufficiently notable that an article would be appropriate even over his objections, and enough verifiable non BLP material found. But the present article is so obviously full of prejudicial and unsupported testimony that it cannot reasonably stand.

<li>DGG, let's discuss notability. What we have here is: son of an oilman, "boy film" producer, apparently well-known as someone J. Edgar Hoover once threw a quote at, but not prominent in the JFK assassination, once indicted but not prosecuted for what the Meese Commission did call "the first child pornography ring".<a href="http://www.porn-report.com/303-child-pornography-law-recommendations.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.porn-report.com/303-child-pornography-law-recommendations.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Is that notability?

<li>I stubbified it. After slogging through the whole thing, I would definitely classify it as libelous, particularly as none of the "charges" are backed up by anything but one editor's sleuth work. Furthermore, a lot of it was not supported by anything but opinion - the paragraph about Zipper magazine stated only that "it's obvious that Byars published it." -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 06:15, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I categorically support the stubbing of this article, obviously. I am open to arguments on how the subject is notable per sources acceptable to make an article adhering to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. But an article under the guise of a biography that is little more than slugfest of controversies just will not cut it. Currently, such an article seems to be the intent of the article's primary author. Elaragirl's suggestion that the history be deleted should definitely be followed if this article is kept. Folks, let me suggest that there hundreds, even many thousands of BLPs on WP that are as bad as this, basically hidden from everyday view.

<li><b>Comment</b> - First, I've independently verified a number of the sources the author cites: the L.A. Times on microfilm years ago (it's online now), the J. Edgar Hoover biography, the Warren Report, the best-selling Robin Lloyd book. The sources are all genuine. (On the other hand, they'd fail the quality test being demanded here: Lloyd sources nothing, the Hoover bio is where the now discredited story of Hoover in drag came from.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have read the Original Research policy. I´m not sure I fully understand it, but it seems more a barrier against people who take a handful of facts and conclude that everything's due to the Patriachy or the Illuminati. This merely takes scattered facts about a man and puts them together. There are no Big Theories involved, and no twisting of facts to a predetermined conclusion.</p>
<p>Yes, the article sounds strange. The subject is strange - and interesting. Style questions I won't address, it's easier to fix style and organization than content.</p>
<p>Regarding the statements that are potentially libelous, they are all from public sources. The Warren Report failed to verify its facts and see that the "child pornography ring" wasn't a ring and no charges were brought based on child pornography, and that the only movie mentioned in the L.A. Times was from the description entirely legal.</p>
<p>An analogous case, also from Los Angeles, was the McMartin school satanic sexual abuse scandal. One cannot argue that there should't be an article on it because the charges were false. They were false, and the first of many similar charges. The charges against Byars were false too, or at least never proved. Some of the charges were found false by a jury; part of the article is an interview by another of the falsely accused where he says that he pled guilty but the police were ready to frame him.</p>
<p>The persecution of child pornography has been a significant excuse for the attacks on civil liberties over the past thirty years in the United States, especially on the Internet. A great deal of the "original research" on which those policies have been based is, frankly, a crock. Byars was one of the first victims. A comparison of the facts, presented here, against the lies, in such places as the Attorney's General's pornography report, is illuminating. Keep.</p>

<p>Regarding libel, several references were removed to the late "pornographer" Guy Strait. It's not libel, since he's dead and it's famously true. According to the Chicago Tribune, Strait "was one of the nation's leading pornographers ... he had cornered the market on the production of ‘kiddie porn'."(Chicago Tribune, 17 May 1977, p. 1-8.) The articles are reprinted in <i>Sexual Exploitation of Children, Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Crime of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 95th Cong., 1st Sess.</i> (1977) pp 428-42. The "statement of Guy Strait, producer of child pornography" appears in the same volume on pp 23-28. Mr. Strait was also the founder of the first gay newspaper in San Franciso in 1961, which at the time took courage.</p>
<p>There were objections to "the first child pornography ring [...] brought to public view." (Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) PART 3: Law Enforcement Recommendations. Chapter 3, paragraph 5.) I agree that the charge is false. However it was made by the Attorney General's commision, which failed to check primary sources or court records before perpetuating the accusation.</p>
<p>The article does not qualify for exclusion as "original research". While I agree that more footnotes are needed, I own or have read a number of the sources given, and the article is in line with available source references. The lack of footnotes is a correctable flaw. There is no ideological bias. I've read some "original research" - I recall something on the Ark of the Covenant being an electrical capacitor - but the only burning passion I see here is a desire for completeness.</p>
<p>Is it controversial? The man apparently has led an eventful and colorful life, and the article reflects that.</p>
<p>Regarding the notability of the subject, the scandal that ended Mr. Byars's company was one of the early events of the campaign against child pornography, still today used as the major argument for censorship and regulation of the Internet. The arrests were the first major appearance in the papers of LAPD sergeant Lloyd Martin who became one of stars of the 1977 child pornography panic, and who is now discredited.</p>
<p>One of the problems the author faces here is that the usual "reliable sources", aren't. The Meese Commission didn't bother to see if the charges were proved, but only that they were made. The headline in the LA Times said "14 Men Indicted in Sex Movies", there were no charges involving "sex movies" and the only movie mentioned was a nudist films legal then and now. The Chicago Times gives numbers for the child pornography market, and for Strait's income as the man with a corner on the market; the numbers are incompatible by an order of magnitude. The book by Robin Lloyd, a best seller with an introduction by a U.S. Senator, has no footnotes, but where one can compare it to the L.A. Times articles, Lloyd reuses the same incident three times, without telling the reader. His major contribution to the kiddy porn panic was inventing the number of "300,000 boy prostitutes" in the U.S.</p>
<p>The article is more accurate and even in its current state better sourced than the "research" on the topic that was the foundation for past and current public policy.</p>
<p>Child pornography may not be notable, but the attempt to repress it - or rather the repression done or advocated in the name of repressing it - certainly is. Mr. Byars was one of the first to be attacked under that banner. He's notable. Chapado 03:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Although the immediate BLP issue has been resolved, as the article has been stubbed, here are some specific example of unsourced, potentially libelous statements, Ballog:
<ul>
<li>"Some of the photographs and films were attributed to a "Harlan 'Slim' Pfeiffer" [7] whom may actually be Byars himself", referencing photographs that "featured extensive nudity of boys and young men."</li>
<li>"Other Internet rumors contend "Glawson", who was an obvious favorite of Byars, was given the "rights" to the Lyric works", which is part of a completely unsourced paragraph.</li>
<li>"One Internet poster claims "Terry Stuart" was "Byars first" (possibly meaning first lover or first model)".</li>
<li>"this person basically ruined the film under the direction of Byars who was really only interested in displaying the naked boys."</li>
<li>"One can be certain the writer obtained this biographical information from Byars himself who constantly felt a need to exaggerate his true experiences."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's only going through about half of the pre-stubbed version. I wouldn't be suprised if there's more in the second half. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 04:32, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Congratulations, you are the first of the people who wish to delete this article who took the time to actually read it (well at least half) and actually cite specific sections you have concerns about.</p>
<p>Now let us review your concerns:</p>
<p><i>"Some of the photographs and films were attributed to a "Harlan 'Slim' Pfeiffer" [7] whom may actually be Byars himself", referencing photographs that "featured extensive nudity of boys and young men."</i></p>
<p>First, the Pfeiffer photographs have never been considered illegal and have always been available legally, as they continue to be today. It can not be considered libelous to credit someone with photography that is not considered illegal. Conjecture by an editor is not prohibited so as long as it is clearly conjecture. For example, in numerous encyclopedic articles of the past thirty years concerning Watergate, there has been much conjecture about the identity of Bob Woodward’s “Deep Throat”. The current Wiki article about Rush Limbaugh contains open conjecture about his addition to prescription drugs being the cause of his temporary deafness.</p>
<p><i>"Other Internet rumors contend "Glawson", who was an obvious favorite of Byars, was given the "rights" to the Lyric works.”</i> "One Internet poster claims "Terry Stuart" was "Byars first" (<i>possibly meaning first lover or first model</i>).”</p>
<p>Again, these was clearly identified as a rumor and Usenet postings. Perhaps they do need a link to the Google archived source. (Note: The “favorite of Byars” issue is also contained in the book “Children in Chains”)</p>
<p><i>"this person basically ruined the film under the direction of Byars who was really only interested in displaying the naked boys."</i></p>
<p>This was clearly attributed to the 2006 interview with the Director of the film “Genesis Children”, Anthony Aikman. This sourcing question really isn’t even debatable.</p>
<p><i>"One can be certain the writer obtained this biographical information from Byars himself who constantly felt a need to exaggerate his true experiences."</i></p>
<p>This is a valid concern and should be reconstructed.</p>
<p><i>“ I wouldn't be suprised if there's more in the second half.”</i></p>
<p>Not a productive comment.</p>
<p>The article is nearly 10,000 words long. I’m sure you don’t think it should be reduced to one sentence because of the above few concerns. Ballog 15:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)Ballog</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, actually conjecture by an editor <i>is</i> prohibited even if clearly labeled. Please see <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. If the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> article contains conjecture about his hearing loss, that should be removed as well. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is very clear in the prohibition of original synthesis of thougth. Additionally Usenet postings are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and even if clearly identified as such should not be used as a source or even included in an aricle. Wikipedia is expressly not the place for republishing rumors, particularly those that come from Usenet threads. Something else I've noticed that I'm not sure anyone has touched on is the "What ever happened to…?" section, which is completely inappropriate in the context of this article. This is an article on Byers and off-topic explorations of what happened to individuals who are not Byers don't belong in an article about him. Beyond that, Natalies concerns are valid and are a good reason to see this article reduced to one line at this time per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<i>“I would think that having to spend two years locating information from sources that are not wholly reliable (Internet forums are not RS at all) simply screams NN...”</i></p>
<p>The article contains about 1% of information attributed to Internet forums. You choose to ignore the remaining 99% of the sources (books, magazines, newspapers, official United States records) listed for the article. Perhaps you actually didn’t read the article but only the discussion here.</p>
<p><i>“...and even a Salon article that mentions him also points out that he was a teenager at the time.”</i></p>
<p>I am entirely confused by this statement. The Salon article is a source concerning Detective Lloyd Martin and the prosecution of child pornography. I don’t believe it ever mentions Byars. This Wiki article is about Byars entire life. What do you mean by, “he was a teenager at the time”? What time? Ballog 15:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)Ballog</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Some of the photographs and films were attributed to a "Harlan 'Slim' Pfeiffer" [7] whom may actually be Byars himself", referencing photographs that "featured extensive nudity of boys and young men."</p>
</blockquote>
Not libel. First, Byars was unquestionably producer of a film that "featured extensive nudity of boys and young men". Second, there's a long tradition of that in Western art; see Germaine Greer's <i>The Beautiful Boy</i>. Third, photographs of nudity aren't illegal. The Genesis Children is on sale even now; at least one of Byars's magazines is in the New York Public Library.
<p>Regarding the Salon article: it's <i>wrong</i>. The reference is to a meeting that supposedly took place between J. Edgar Hoover and Byars after the Kennedy assasination; Byars was born in 1936 and 27 at the time of Kennedy's death. The Salon author, you see, was unable to check his facts in Wikipedia...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...it seems that the author is trying to pursue an agenda instead of sticking to verified fact.</p>
</blockquote>
What agenda? He seems to pursuing facts, lots and lots of facts. Perhaps they could be better organized. There may be a lack of a narrative thread, but I can't detect an ideological one.
<p>Several people have said the sources seem scattered. periferical, and unreliable. Yes. Who else appears in the Meese Report and one of the best-selling books focusing on the subject of the Warren Report? There's a real-life Forrest Gump quality to the man. And, as said above, while a lot of the sources are unreliable (Robin Lloyd, the Meese report, the LAPD accusations) an awful lot of public policy has relied upon them. --Chapado 18:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The goal here should be a good article. Not for some "process" to run it's course or for someone to save face in an argument.

Like Ballog, I'm new here, although I have used Wikipedia for reference often in the past. I do not wish to tread on any toes or break any rules.</p>
<p>It would appear that a biography of a living person is particularly fraught with hazards for a new contributor. Nonetheless, <b>Notability:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Billy Byars, Jr. was one of the principal figures in what the Meese commission called "the first child pornography ring";</li>
<li>"Child pornography rings" make a lot of appearances in the media, a new one having turned up in Austria during this discussion;</li>
<li>The specter of child pornography remains the artument most heavily used to justify regulation, censorship and eavesdropping on the internet, even after the 9/11 attacks;</li>
<li>At least one of those who later became notorious in the crusade against child pornography first appeared in the charges against Mr. Byars;</li>
<li>Looking at the primary sources, then the secondary sources, as done here, leads one to the conclusion that the secondary sources, (e.g. the Meese Report) would never withstand a Wikipedia deletion review.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. Byars was an important if involuntary participant in an event that marked the start of a significant societal trend. That the charges against him appear unfounded only increases his importance.</p>
<p><b>Article quality:</b> Yes, there are missing footnotes. Having read many of the sources cited, I am aware that nearly all of the claims made can be substanciated.</p>
<p>I'm also aware that in an encyclopedia, and especially in an article on a living person, there's an enormous difference between claims being provable, and being proven. The editor offered to add in the footnotes. The article being stubbed I believe prevents him from doing so. I'm certainly not going to try because there are too many rules of which I'm unaware.</p>
<p>There may be a lack of narrative thread, and perhaps there is content not essential to the topic.</p>
<p><b>Original research:</b> Much of the world's knowledge is available in libraries, in microfilm or dead-tree format. Clicking a mouse can in seconds give you reams of information on something that happened last week or last year. Something that happened thirty years ago, however, requires you to get your hat and coat and go down to the library. Sometimes many libraries, as one defunct magazine may be in one, another in another, instead of bytes which are searchable from anywhere.</p>
<p>From the No Original Research policy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the exception of interviews he conducted with people involved in events that took place over thirty years ago, it seems to me that that is precisely what Ballog did. It also seems to me that he's getting ragged for having done it in the library rather than on-line.</p>
<p>It takes time and effort to research that way. What can be found for a recent event on Google in two seconds can take longer for information not on the Internet. Two years, say.</p>
<p>But to suggest that the information is somehow less reliable, or less important, or less significant, because it can't be verified by anyone without moving from their desks, is provincial.</p>
The article does not - with exception of the data based on interviews - violate the policy as stated above. The Policy also bars
<blockquote>
<p>"... any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position."</p>
</blockquote>
Several people have suggested that's a problem here. I've asked someone to explain to me what "theory" is being advanced by the article, but no one has answered. It's just a collection of facts. I've put some theory in above justifying notability, but I don't think there's that much theory in the whole article.
<p><b>Civility:</b> Ballog's civility or lack thereof has been subject to sufficent comment here. I will not add to it.</p>
<p>I did find that there's a "Please don't bite the newbies" policy. I like to ask the others here to consider that they have put considerable effort - effort, not just gazing into space to find the right phrase, but shoeleather, squinting at microfilm, scanning chapters and footnotes rather than using full-text search, etc. - into producing an article, on a person whose strange life you find interesting. You post it. Someone says, "Jeez, I can't verify this in under a minute online. Must be a hoax. Let's delete it."</p>
<p>The lack of footnotes in a biography of a living person is a significant flaw, which unquestionably must be corrected. Trouble is, with the article stubbed, the editor can't correct it. I'm sure this isn't a Catch-22, but if someone were to say what the usual way is to proceed, that might be productive.</p>
<p>Also, while I realize that a long-standing community develops a mutually understood technical shorthand, to a newcomer it's crypic gobbleygook. "ABC, DEF, GHI! Q.E.D.! Delete! HIP HIP Hooray!" is roughly how it reads to the uninitiated. I note that early on someone said "HOAX" which is a technical term meaning something different than "Hoax!" That editor explained and even apologized. Unfortunately, that didn't stop the flow of acronyms.</p>
<p><b>Libel:</b> This bears repeating. The material which Mr. Byars's company produced, of which his feature film <i>The Genesis Children</i> is an example, featuring nude young men and boys, was not and is not pornographic. Byars publicly defended the artistic merit of his productions. Much of his material freely and legally circulates today. No pornography charges were ever brought against him; none of his associates were ever convicted on pornography charges. One of his associates, the late Guy Strait, with whom he cooperated in distribution but apparently not production, was a pornographer and a child pornographer, but Byars himself was not.</p>
<p>There is a doctine heard in free speech circles, called the "chilling effect". If something is made illegal, people become very cautious about approaching the limit of what is illegal, and what can't be said because of fear of approaching the illegal extends the zone of what is effectively prohibited. Mr. Byar's work falls into the area of "chill" - it is not illegal, but rarely produced nowadays because the penalties for stepping over the line are so great.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion:</b> The subject is notable; the article well researched, but badly footnoted. The style and organization can perhaps be improved, but that is more easily done than adding facts to a fine piece of empty prose.</p>
<p>The author is perhaps abrasive, but he's also in his first effort been met by what appears less an open community than a closed club, with acronyms in place of secret handshakes. He's had his research disdained because it was conducted with two years of gumshoe work rather than via Google. He seems to be pissed off at that. I would be too.</p>
<p>The No Original Research policy has been unfairly invoked against the article. While the first-hand interviews violate it, the vast majority of the article does not. While people have suggested that there's an agenda, they won't say what it is. I think there's merely a collection of facts. An encyclopedic collection of facts.</p>
<p>If the article is kept - and I think it should be - I assume there's a standard procedure for these cases. Perhaps it goes back in sections as the editor footnotes the material. Maybe the original interviews get left out until the editor publishes them elsewhere. There seem to be a lot of policies about what not to do; surely there are some as to the best or easiet way to do this. Perhaps they could be shared with the same open-handedness as the "thou shalt not" policies have been. Chapado 00:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
