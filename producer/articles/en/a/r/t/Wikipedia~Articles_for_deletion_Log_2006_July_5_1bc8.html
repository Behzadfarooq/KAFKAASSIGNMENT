<p>I am also nominating the following related pages because they are part of an album by The Ataris entitled, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Skies%2C_Broken_Hearts...Next_12_Exits_8213.html" title="Blue Skies, Broken Hearts...Next 12 Exits">Blue Skies, Broken Hearts...Next 12 Exits</a>. This album was released by an independent label several years before the band achieved mainstream popularity. Each song on the album now has its own article, even though this album did not reach any billboard chart, and none of the singles reached any sort of chart as well. This band is not influential to have merit to have each song from a non-charting indie album have their own articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>merge</b> the songs now under consideration. I would actually be inclined to suggest merging SDHSFR somewhere as well; there doesn't seem to be very much to say about it other than that it was their first single, which means it might be better covered as part of some wider context, which would be more useful to those who are trying to find out about the history of the band.

<li>Hi, Mike. You shouldn't take this personally. We get a lot of corporate <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a>, so people can be a little brusque about these things. Articles about companies should generally meet the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> standard. This one doesn't seem to. If you think it could, you have a few days to improve the article. If not, don't sweat it.

Nominiator, you should consider rereading the section on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html#Before_nominating_an_AfD" title="WP:AFD">before nominating an AfD</a>. In my opinion, AfD is mainly for contested deletions. This should have been preceeded by enough research to be sure the the article was <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html#Before_nominating_an_AfD" title="WP:AFD">a hopeless case</a>, some discussion with the author, and a <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion</a>. I hope you fit a lot of research in 60 seconds, but you left the rest out. The author's contribution history makes clear he's a well-meaning new editor, and we should strive <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">to not bite the newcomers</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 14:05, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, but move</b> It's certainly, in my eyes, a notable song. It was a hit single, and easily the most well-known song by the X-Ecutioners (in fact, there's no competition). However, the article should be moved to a different title, as it is an X-Ecutioners single, off an X-Ecutioners album, that simply featured 40% of Linkin Park (not to mention Wayne Static). The first sentence should state that it's a song by this DJ crew that features some Linkin Park members, not ""It's Goin' Down" is the single by Mike Shinoda and Joseph Hahn from the Nu metal band Linkin Park, and the scratching artists The X-Ecutioners from their 2002 debut album Built From Scratch." The single chronology should also be removed. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 01:36, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>He is a notable pastor. He was pastor of the LARGEST Southern Baptist Church in LOUISIANA for fifteen years. We have many teachers, lawyers, and professors on Wikipedia who certainly have records no more impressing that Reverend DuBose. There are only about 15 Baptist ministers on the site. Are we setting a "higher requirement" for ministers than teachers, lawyers, and professors? I removed the "awards" from high school, as that line did seem to trivialize his accomplishments.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of a lawyer on Wikipedia, and I just pulled this name from random:</p>
<p>Steven Dennis Bell (born 11 February 1953 in Akron, Ohio) is a lawyer and mediator.</p>
<p>[edit] Biography Bell's parents are Samuel H. Bell and Joyce (Shaw) Bell. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1975 and from the University of Akron School of Law in 1979. He was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1979. He served as an Assistant Director of Law for the City of Akron (1980 - 1983) and as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio (1984 - 1988). He also served as a Special Assistant Attorney General for the State of Ohio (1992). In 2002 he became the managing partner of The Simon Law Firm, LLP in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p>How does this lawyer qualify for inclusion but not the pastor of the largest Baptist church in Louisiana? -- Billy Hathorn</p>

<p>Here's another lawyer who is listed: Albert Bates From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Albert Bates (born 1947-01-01) is an influential figure in the intentional community and ecovillage movements. A lawyer, author and teacher, he has been director of the Institute for Appropriate Technology since 1984 and of the Ecovillage Training Center at The Farm in Summertown, Tennessee since 1994.</p>
<p>Bates has been a resident of The Farm since 1972. A former attorney, he argued environmental and civil rights cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and drafted a number of legislative Acts during a 26-year legal career. The holder of a number of design patents, Bates invented the concentrating photovoltaic arrays and solar-powered automobile displayed at the 1982 World's Fair. He served on the steering committee of Plenty International for 18 years, focussing on relief and development work with indigenous peoples, human rights and the environment.</p>
<p>Bates has played a major role in the ecovillage movement as one of the start-up members of the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN), and GEN's president of the Ecovillage Network of the Americas (from 1996 to 2004). In 1994 he founded the Ecovillage Training Center, a "whole systems immersion experience of ecovillage living."[1] He has taught courses in sustainable design, natural building, permaculture and technologies of the future to students from more than 50 nations.</p>

<dd>Hello again, Billy. I'm disappointed that you appear to have missed my previous reply. If you think another Wikipedia article doesn't meet our standards, you should follow <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">one of the approaches for deletion</a>. If you believe this article should be kept, you should help us see how it meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, or explain how you plan to make it meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Note that this isn't any sort of judgement about Wayne DuBose; I'm sure he's a fine fellow. Here we just decide if an article meets the appropriate standards. If you think the standard should be changed, I'd start with the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">appropriate talk page</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 20:34, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it may have been missed that Pastor DuBose was the pastor of the largest Southern Baptist congregation in LOUISIANA for a period of some 15 years. That alone should make him worthy of coverage. The church had over 6,000 members while he was the pastor there. -- Billy Hathorn</p>

<dd>Hi, Billy. No, I did notice that, and should have mentioned that. There are two issues I have. First, we'd need to be able to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> that from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Second, I'm not sure that's really enough: it doesn't obviously meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Per <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, that's not a deal-breaker for me, but I'm having trouble extracting some principle that we could insert into <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to make it better. Running the largest X of type Y in place Z doesn't seem particularly encyclopedic to me. Have his accomplishments been noted elsewhere? For example, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Warren_a87e.html" title="Rick Warren">Rick Warren</a> was recognized in Time, Newsweek, and US News and World Report. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 17:56, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result of the nomination was <b>delete</b>. The arguments against merge are convincing - to summarise them, there's no evidence that this 'chaos theory of literature' exists in any context, so it can't be connected with Hayles. If Hayles had actively associated herself with a "chaos theory of literature", then the article would be a merge candidate, but she didn't - one of her books is merely said to have "laid the groundwork for study". --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:12, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looks like pomo nonsense. Nothing on Google/Books/Scholar. The article is vague about the books it actually mentions--there's a big difference between using an idea as a <i><b>metaphor</b></i> to aid in explaining another field, and devising an all-out <i><b>theory</b></i> of the field.

<li><b>Delete</b>, I don't think a merge is necessary in this case.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Klashnekoff is one of the top UK hip-hop artists currently around and more than meets the requirements of WP:MUSIC. He has two albums out on notable independent UK hip-hop labels (check Amazon), performs frequently on Itch FM (London's leading hip-hop radio station) and others, and recently was one of the headliners at BBC Radio 1Xtra's UK Takeover event in Nottingham, appearing with Kyza and the rest of Terra Firma. I wouldn't argue that the latter two entries should necessarily be retained, but Klashnekoff has to stay. PS: 87,500 Google hits for Klashnekoff (spelt thusly); listed by the BBC 1Xtra website as one of the UK's most influential artists.Efortune 12:06, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Multiple performances and interviews on 1Xtra and Radio 1 should be enough for WP:MUSIC. If you know UK hip-hop at all, you've heard Klashnekoff; the nature of the UKHH scene is such that notability is not usually established through major-label albums. Mixtapes, live performances, pirate radio, and latterly music videos on cable/satellite TV stations are the means by which these artists become important. (In fact, if it were even necessary, you could argue a case for inclusion under the 'performers outside mass-media traditions' section of WP:MUSIC...) He's one of the best-known UK rappers at the moment, so unless the argument is that UK rap is so insignificant as to be unencyclopaedic, this surely has to stay.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Klashnekoff, along with several other UK hip-hop artists are the future of hip-hop. Simply put, simply stated. They are making records, and making waves, and they will make a splash in the United States much the same way Paul Wall, Swisha House and Chamillionaire did. They are sort of an internet phenomenon outside out of their own countries as well, as without the internet I would have never discovered their wonderful sounds.Herzogthc 02:53, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Agree that it's probably too early for Kyza and Terra Firma, who haven't released albums yet. Klash has two out though, is widely known by UK hip hop listeners, and IMHO has to stay. Efortune 13:39, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The linked "official website" is "currently under maintenance". The MySpace page shows a last login of 12/15/2005, with only one friend.

<li><b>Comment</b> Calling the page "pure spam" is an exxageration. -- ABCOffice.com 03:42, 5 July 2006 (UTC)-- The page follows the neutral point of view criteria by sticking to an objective history of the company and avoids making outrageous claims of having "the best" of anything. The ABC page is far less spammy than <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_Max_623e.html" title="Office Max">Office Max</a>'s or <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_Depot_1d41.html" title="Office Depot">Office Depot</a>'s Wikipedia pages, which are blatantly commercial with inclusions of sale offers, return policies, etc. The page has only has 1 external link, fewer than Office Max's page, and is full of internal links to existing Wikipedia pages, so to accuse it of external link spamming is disingenuous. Edits and links to the ABC Page I made were done in accordance with the orpan page notice posted. As for notablility issues, ABC Office is a formidable ecommerce presence on the Web, and should not be penalized for not getting the negative notoriety the Dot-bombs garnered, (who have their own Wikipedia sites). Rather than knee- jerk deletion, please excuse my lack of Wiki-coding experience and make recommendations to fix the page to bring it into compliance. Thank you.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would take that criticism more seriously if you were not responsible for vandalizing the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_Max_623e.html" title="Office Max">Office Max</a> article by including an external link to its competitor OfficeZone (which ABCOffice owns I suppose). If that's any comfort to you I've edited a bit of the Office Max article and have tagged the Office Depot article for spam-cleanup. But this AfD debate is about ABCOffice and not the articles devoted to its competitors. There are three important criticisms which you completely fail to adress:

<dd><b>Comment</b>The reason I mentioned the Office Depot and Office Max pages is because I used those as a template of an "acceptable" Wikipedia page for corporations, which was why I was perplexed at the negative attention the ABC page has received. As far as the NPOV, VAIN, and SPAM critiques, I am an hourly employee for ABC Office, but I have no stake in the company, other than my bi-weekly, minimum wage, check. To avoid the appearance of impropriety, I was cautious to exclude sales pitches, past advertising gimicks, slogans, financial information and mascot histories. It warrants the question, though, why would anyone not affiliated with a business entity take time to originate a wikipedia page for that company? The article does include links to competitor's Wikipedia sites, only has one external link, covers only the history of the company, and the previous logo was replaced with a better, neutral graphic. Rather than being vague, if you would please reference specifics on the page that need addressing that would be appreciated. I want to be in compliance.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>Vain: “While an article about a little-known company, say, should not automatically be taken as a vanity article, it is preferable for the initial author not to be an owner, employee of, or investor in the company;” – It’s preferable but not required. My being an employee does not automatically call for deletion. I could have done what every other corporate contributor did and just make up a phoney username so you couldn’t trace it back to the company. At least I was honest.</dd>
</dl>
<p>NPOV: “articles must be written from a neutral point of view, representing views fairly and without bias.” This article does not violate NPOV because it’s a neutral history of a company. It doesn’t make biased claims, and it links to competitor’s Wikipedia sites. All the information in the text is verifiable and on public record. If you actually read the article it focuses on origins, locations and ownership changes. Sales and other non-verifiable information was omitted.</p>
<p>Spam: The only reasons 3 or 4 links to this page were added to other Wikipedia sites was to get the page off the “orphaned articles” list, as was instructed by the add links tag placed at the top of the page. There are 17 links to other Wikipedia pages but only 1 external link. That hardly qualifies as Spam. There is no “sales oriented language” in the text so it should be differentiated as a legitimate article about a commercial entity.</p>
<p>As far as notability, the page qualifies based on several articles that have been published referencing our company, including stories in: Dezignare Interior Design,out of Austin Texas; The Salt Lake Tribune; and an upcoming publication from Fahy-Williams, out of Geneva, NY. You still haven’t answered why ABC is less notable than the other companies listed in the previous posting.</p>
<p>I have been specific in my explanations on why the page does not violate the WP guidelines cited. Now would you please be specific on why you believe it does, other than that it was written by an employee, which according to policy is not recommended but does not automatically warrant deletion.

<li>I can't see any notice of this "discussion" on the original creator of the article's talkpage. <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">Common courtesy</a> would seem to demand it, particularly when one notes that this article has a/ existed for quite a while without anyone's feeling the need to burn it and b/ been worked on a fair bit. I think you could argue that this stuff would be difficult to source, but there's no reason we couldn't have a discussion of Scottish dialect terms and their variance from English under this title. Merging it with <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_English_ce86.html" title="Scottish English">Scottish English</a> is likely only to bloat that article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Apologies for uncivil sounding "this list is terrible" comment, however I stand by my opinion that this list is far too inconsistant to be edited or merged into anything usefull.

<p>The result of the nomination was <b>delete</b>. I really wish people would watchlist AfDs they participate in and address major edits. However, it seems clear that the references provided by the rewrite do not address the biosetpoint theory directly. This is still <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.</p>
<p>This is an encyclopaedia, a tertiary source, and we cannot "judge this concept on its scientific merits". That is the job of respected scientific journals and other secondary sources, which if they choose to give it credibility can allow an encyclopaedia article to be written that satisfies <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<p><b>07/10/06 - There has been a major editing of this entry.</b> It is true that the concept was first published in the journal Medical Hypothesis, but I would invite any critics to judge this concept on its scientific merits.

<li><b>D</b>elete. Although a reference is provided, <i>Med Hypoth</i> is a weird journal that is populated partially by cranks and kooks. Wikipedia should <i>not</i> have articles purely based on material from that journal unless it achieves notability outside (e.g. gradual support by authors in other journals). This deletion is not because of NOR (because it is sourced) but because of notability. NB the editor who wrote this article is also the author of the <i>Med Hypoth</i> paper.

Sorry Yeanold, but as Mikeblas says you haven't actually asserted that Villains meet any of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>'s criteria. Those are guidelines and not policy, but no-one else seems to think that Villains should be excepted.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - I don't think Wolftown Records cuts it as "an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable". I am slightly worried that WP:MUSIC may be unfairly prejudice against this kind of urban music.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Villains, though now unoficcially disbanded, have an album widely available nationally, as well as having regular features in the world's oldest hip-hop magazine, hip-hop connection <a href="http://hiphop.co.uk/index.php?PastIssue=201" class="external autonumber" title="http://hiphop.co.uk/index.php?PastIssue=201" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, so there's two criteria straight away. Also, two of the members, Tricksta and Late, have a tally of solo achievements that qualify as notable in themselves. <a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeanold_Viskersenn_c023.html" title="User:Yeanold Viskersenn">Yeanold Viskersenn</a> 09:08, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Having an album "widely available nationally" isn't one of the criteria. The group needs a charted hit on a national music chart, or two or more albums on a major label or an important indie label. The article makes no assertion that <i>Hip-Hop Connection</i> has had "regular features" on the group. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 13:19, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - I'm sorry but I'm pretty annoyed, I've spent a lot of hours trying to improve the quality of articles on UK hip-hop, and in the last couple of days someone seems to have swept across my edit list and nominated everything for deletion - I check every article of against WP:MUSIC, and have given reasons why each should be kept. Do people realise that an act only needs to meet ONE of the criteria on WP:MUSIC, not ALL of them? Villains do as has been stated twice above. <a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeanold_Viskersenn_c023.html" title="User:Yeanold Viskersenn">Yeanold Viskersenn</a> 10:49, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hard to find any meaningful information about this political party, other than that <a href="http://www.dcpoliticalreport.com/inactive.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dcpoliticalreport.com/inactive.htm" rel="nofollow">it once existed</a>, according to D.C.'s (Daniel Sachs') Political Report. The Google hits seem to be either WP article copies or passing references in anyone-can-edit websites (like acronym sites listing this as an interpretation of "HARP").

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s> <b>Weak Keep</b>, primary problem is POV (reads like a press release or corporate web page), <s>and notability isn't entirely convincing.</s> Might be willing to change my vote with a) a revision to remove POV problems <s>and b) comments from users familiar with the program.</s> Didn't read <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo's</a> comment close enough; sounds like someone who would know, with an edit history that doesn't hint at bias.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The above stated, I have to note that I'm pretty uncomfortable with aspects of this nomination. The user who nominated this for AfD was heavily involved in <i>another</i> page up for AfD (possibly an employee of that program's <s>publisher</s> distributor) that lists <i>this</i> product as a "direct competitor." I don't like the possibility that an employee from Company A is nominating competing software from competing Company B for AfD. Doesn't really invalidate the nomination, but it does make me squirm a little. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 00:20, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Indeed, I am actually employed by the company eye4you, we do distribute HDGuard which in turn is somewhat of a competitor of Deep Freeze (Deep Freeze has little presence in Australia and Europe). I absolutely love wikipedia, and thought it may have been a good idea to post articles on our company which is well known throughout the Australian public/private education arena, however, after reading through the WP articles I do agree that both the HDGuard and eye4you articles should be removed. Notability doubts and corporate _influence_ are present, and I think that this article shows signs of it also. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan.manzi_fa71.html" title="User:Nathan.manzi">Nathan.manzi</a> 01:26, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> and mine as well. I agree that POV is a factor with the current version of this article, and hedge my "weak keep" vote on the hope that this will be changed soon. Judging from the edit history of the article and editor contributions, it doesn't appear that corporate influences were directly a factor; if anything, I think some editors may have just relied too much on company lines when fleshing out the article. Hopefully this can be fixed, otherwise I expect we'll be seeing this here again soon. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 03:28, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There's been a decent sized debate about this in the UK. I remember a lead editorial in the Telegraph about it, and the Guardian and BBC have, as stated above, covered it and used this title. I think this will be a useful resource when the debate comes up again in 2008, when the plane actually gets delivered. I'm not opposed to renaming and redirecting Blair Force One to a more encylcopedic title, but I do think at least having the redirect from Blair Force One is important.

<dd><b>Comment/clarify</b>: Citing Google always really concerns me. The "thousands of entries" include an awful lot of duplicates, blogs (not acceptable under WP guidelines for external links, which puts them on dubious ground as references), and rebranded copies of Wikipedia itself. As for the ocurrences on reputable sources like the BBC, that's a fair point and indicates a reasonable level of public familiarity can be presumed. However, that does nothing to move us away from the problem that as an article title, it's too narrow, and lets down Wikipedia because it tries to be clever rather than trying to be informative. The discussion of politics (as opposed to concrete fact) is perfectly valid, but that's not the point here. The politics are not an article in themselves. I'd like to clarify my vote, since it's possibly lost since I nominated the deletion; in the light of this discussion it's a <b>strong rename</b> but not precluding a <b>merge</b> with the other relevant articles, such as that about the now defunct <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Flight_26fa.html" title="Queen's Flight">Queen's Flight</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> This "Blair Force One" will be not be operational until after Blair has ceased to be PM (assuming statements are correct), so the name is unlikely to survive.

<dd>Your point in keeping this one was that, in your opinion, there are other pages of less notable content. That's the old high school excuse, "Mom, I only drunk at the party because my friends Dave and John were doing it too." Just because some other people posted useless genealogy cruft pages doesn't mean we should let someone else's page stay. Just delete 'em as we find 'em. Otherwise you're using the "They jumped off a bridge, so I'm going to as well," excuse.

<li>Perpetual stub - Would someone looking for information on Japanther get any useful information out of this article that their website would not massively superset?</li>
<li>Limited number of contributers.</li>
<li><i>Wikipedia ought not to be another platform that places "mainstream = notability" constraints on independent music.</i> Can you think of any reason why Japanther is more notable then any other of the 5 million bands in New York City.

<li><b>Comment</b>, "obviously" notable is apparently in the eye of the beholder... This band is very near the line of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. There are 3 provided sources, but none is so expansive as to make the "trivial" clause of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> a non-argument. The tour could be argued either way as well. Personally I don't rate bar shows as a tour. Probably the best claim towards <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is that Japanther is notable on their local scene, but nothing has been advanced to prove this. I still opine keep because while they are on the line, they appear to be on the inclusion side, but calling this obvious is hyperbole and Amazinglarry would do well to read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> before saying this should never have been nominated.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:49, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Japanther has a very large cult following all over the U.S., more so than other mundane bands" is not quantifiable. Many barely notable indie bands have "national tours" (perhaps this should be discussed wherever AfD criteria is supposed to go). Playing crappy Food Not Bombs shows for three years&#160;!= notability. Last.fm inclusion is a very very dubious criteria as it has a much more liberal inclusion policy and little editorial oversight. Again, if you can expand the stub, please do so.

<li>I'm torn, leaning <b>Weak keep</b>. (I'm just copying my comments from the other AFD.) Obviously, we CANNOT delete just one of these lists by ethnicity - it needs to be an all or nothing proposition. Lists on Wikipedia are useful if they either (a) provide meaningful information that you can't get out of a category (eg a table like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NCAA_Division_I-A_Football_Programs_9349.html" title="List of NCAA Division I-A Football Programs">this</a>) or (b) include redlinked elements to assist in the creation of articles. This list contains really only a citation ... so there is no added value from that standpoint for having a list vs a category - the citation could just as easily be in the article itself. It contains very few redlinks ... and really, in the time you take to add someone to the list, you could create a stub for them. So I don't know that these lists really serve any good purpose that couldn't be accomplished by a category. However, because it would be wholly inappropriate to delete them piecemeal, keep. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:05, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I would note that "getting" your record on Amazon requires you to procure a UPC symbol, and essentially nothing else; the whole point of AMG, meanwhile, is to be a complete listing whether its inclusions are notable or not--surely that's not to be WikiPedia's guideline. In short, there's a reason neither Amazon nor AMG are in the guidelines. I don't want any war over this, but having been an editor at a music magazine, I assure you there are <i>many</i> thousands of bands across the globe that sell in various chain stores and have opened for a more notable band.

<li><b>Keep</b> The reason for keeping the article is actually in the nomination itself. It's on Keenspot, an independent for-profit syndicate for webcomics, which means it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> clause 3. (I won't budge on this issue, so express your concerns with a separate recommendation, not a comment to this one.) It should be renamed to God Mode (webcomic) though, since the term is far older than the comic itself. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 15:10, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it does get kept, I agree it definitely needs moving. Having two articles differing in capitalisation is bad enough, but since it appears the "God Mode" capitalisation is sometimes used in relation to the gaming term, and that's both older and more widely used, it's definitely a bad idea. (I spotted and corrected a link to the wrong "God Mode" article in a Doom-related article earlier when looking through "what links here".) - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 18:40, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It should be pointed out that the above keep is based on incomplete information. As described below, the creator of God Mode, Chris Cosby, is a co-founder of Keenspace; as such, its position in Keenspace specifically does <i>not</i> meet the third clause of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which requires that it be distributed through a site that is both "well known and <i>independent of the creators</i>." --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 20:08, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is notable. God Mode has been published in print as a 32-page cover feature of a Free Comic Book Day issue (Comic Genesis 2006), with a circulation of tens of thousands of copies. Additionally, God Mode was created by Keenspot co-founder and Superosity and Sore Thumbs creator Chris Crosby, who many consider to be a notable figure in webcomics. Crosby pays Ryan Kerns a page rate to produce the comic as work-for hire, which is highly unusual and notable for a webcomic. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.35.99.246 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.35.99.246_cfdd.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.35.99.246">contribs</a>) 22:03, July 5, 2006.</small></li>

<li><strike>I (still) reckon it's probably essentially impossible to do what you're asking in terms of sources for any webcomic (even, say, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a>) and any attempt to try will result in an outdated and incomplete article. In fact, the only webcomic article I've seen so far that achieved this is <a href="../../../w/h/e/When_I_Am_King_8ff1.html" title="When I Am King">When I Am King</a>, and it had severe problems (mainly the fact that it consisted mainly of quotes and provided next-to-no information about the webcomic), though those weren't entirely a result of this - and that was a comic that's no longer updated, apparently got a reasonable amount of media attention, and clearly meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for that reason. Most of the webcomic articles (even ones that clearly meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) don't stand a chance. You may well have a point about notability though; however it's somewhat debatable as to whether it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion 3 (depends if Keenspot counts as "an online publisher" or whether it's more of an invitation-only webcomic community with its own private hosting service attached - it seems to be something of a hybrid AFAICT, which makes life a bit difficult - and there's the slight complication that it was apparently created by a Keenspot co-founder). This could be a bit tricky; maybe I should've started with something clearer-cut.</strike> - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 19:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regarding <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a>, it (like many other webcomics) easily meets our standards for verifiability and reliable sources -- the article already uses The New York Times as a source, and a quick look in my library shows other articles from The San Diego Union-Tribune, Publishers Weekly, South Bend Tribune, The Tennessean, etc. Regarding <a href="../../../w/h/e/When_I_Am_King_8ff1.html" title="When I Am King">When I Am King</a>, yes, it needs expansion; that's why I tagged it as a stub. Its importance, however, has been clearly established by reliable sources. This article, on the other hand, has no real claim of importance and no third-party reliable sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy, and therefore ought to be deleted. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 03:02, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> uses the New York Times as a source for one small, minor part of the article (the bit about it requiring a certain amount of "obscure knowledge"); the rest of the article cannot be supported by information in the NYT article (or the Iowa State Daily one) and mainly seems to use megatokyo.com itself as a source (which is pretty much par for the course, unfortunately). <strike>Unless it's something like This Is Home, deleting webcomic articles on verifiability grounds is probably a bad idea - this is best decided on the basis of notability alone, if possible (and the article does have some issues there).</strike> - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 10:37, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am interested in any activists or people who are working for social change or for something other than there own personal gain, be it animal rights, anti-war, environmentalism or any other cause. This is not a broad article, no, but I find it far more interesting than the Immortal Goddess and her fraternity. Just personal opinion of a regular wikipedia visitor.

<li>Ok, well I've just found this article about myself. No I didn't write it, I'm sure no one is that self-interested! A friend of mine wrote this. Yeah, ok, my life's not of any great "notability" (yet), but I don't appreciate the not so nice comments here. People need to lighten up. I don't mind if this is deleted, it was a bit of a laugh, I'm not really fussed. But I do find it amazing how people spend so much time on this site, picking at and commenting on other articles. If you know the codes and criteria of a site I think that's a bit sad, yeah it's a handy site, but living your life in front of a computer is never a good thing!

<li><b>Comment</b> - This was made because the current list at: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_war_crimes.html" title="List of war crimes">List of war crimes</a> is where the allegations against the Iraq War was originally posted. The Iraq War portion was moved their because allegations should not be in the other list, because a list of war crimes is different from a list of alleged war crimes. The arguement posed for not moving it however is that most war crimes are not prosecuted and so its ok to put allegations into the list. Jsut some background for everyone. I am not gonig to vote however. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:47, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would ask therefore that if voters DO feel the content should be moved back, that they explicitly say so by voting <b>Merge</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Accusations and allegations, if held by a significant minority or even majority, belong in subject specific articles. In the content so far, that would be the article on the Iraq War. Lists should be limited to established items - for crimes that means one that have already received legal determinations by the required tribunal.

<p><b>Delete</b>. This was nominated for CSD because "This is no such Group in Chassidic Judiasm; hoax" - CSD was obviously declined.

JJ, the Hasidic CSD nominator, told me, and I trust him. I have no independent way of confirming this. As a matter of fact, both the article and the AfD nomination constitute OR - there are simply no sources to be had. Google will show nothing to obscure splinter Hasidic groups, and all research is pointless - it could be as little as a dozen dudes in a basement synagogue calling themselves a movement.

<p>The derogatory-intended nickname is actually usually used by followers of the Bobover Rebbe of 48 for the bobover rebbe of 45th. so therefore someone made a hoax-which-plays-upon-a-hoax and titled the 48 rebbe with the Kartchin Moniker...</p>
<p>I am very familiar with the chassidic world and I am 10000% confident of this hoax. it's not even a splinter group.. its like some people calling the satmar rebbe the flintsone rebbe and that getting a "NPOV" wikipage....</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't know what to do about this. We need more information. I do not understand in what way 'Kartchin' is a derogatory nickname. It is the name of a Polish (?) town and there does/did apparently exist a chassidus by that name. Just as that we have Zenta which is affiliated with Satmar. And Siget.

<li><b>Delete</b> Looking at all the above comments, shows how helpless Wikipedians are. Someone can be 10,000 percent sure; but still Wikipedians aren't convinced; they need more information. It seems to me that we have to have a <i>Chelemer Asifah</i> (a meeting of the wise men of Chelem) to determine if "Kartchin" is an entity. On a serious tone; how do you prove a negative? I'll try. Question number 1: Are there Kartchiner Chassidim? The answer is absolutely no. Question number 2: Is there a Kartchiner Rebbe? The answer is absolutely no. (If you want; you can write an article of the Kartchiner Rebbe who passed away over a hundred years ago). This whole thing reminds me of the newspaper heading "The President denies hitting his wife". The story goes that a news reporter asked the President if he hit his wife? for which the President answered "no"; now go prove that. Last for all who want to know how the "Kartchin hoax" (please don't make an article with this name) came to pass; I talk about it on the Bobov talk pages; if you would care to read. <a href="../../../i/s/s/User%7EIssac_edfa.html" title="User:Issac">Issac</a> 16:36, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the nomination was <b>Keep</b>. For starters, the "vote" was 4-2 Keep. However, only one of the Keep commentors made any real argument. But that argument is reasonable: she holds the all-time scoring record in a major sport of at a (famous) Division I school. But... <i>the program only started the year she joined it</i>, so how big an accomplishment is that? Nevertheless, she was a star (and later played professionaly for the Philadelphia Rage). She doesn't lack notabilily <i>to the extent</i> that it would be proper to go against the majority in closing, I don't think. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 02:11, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I vote for keeping it. It is a legitimate term that was used to describe humourous and raunchy Oi!/punk bands in 1980s Britain. Just because there isn't a lot about the term on the Internet doesn't mean it's not worthy of a Wikipedia article.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 16:38, 5 July 2006 (UTC)Spylab

<li>If Punk Pathetique had been invented in the mid nineties when zines &amp; the internet were both running simultaneously, it would certainly recieve the apparently important google hits. However, it was invented in 1981 &amp; didn't catch on. It however, did exist. There is the quote there from Max Splodge about it. There was a definite English Music Hall Comedy Dickensian Punk thing going on. It clearly begins with Johnny Rotten. The band Tenpole Tudor fits into this as well. As far as the whole thing about it being accepted by the world at large, many genres of Punk can be deleted for this reason, &amp; i'm sure Punk could be deleted as well, based on similar ideas. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_P._Aaberg_c695.html" title="User:Sean P.

<li>On the contrary, the concept of a musical genre and culture known as <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk.html" title="Punk">punk</a> has gained widespread acceptance in the world at large, as the references and further reading in that article demonstrate. I didn't ask for "Google hits". I didn't mention Google at all. I asked for <i>cited sources</i>. I ask again for cited sources.

<p>Whatever your views are against the Punk Pathetique article, the "original research" argument doesn't hold water at all. The concept of Punk Pathetique is neither new nor unpublished. It originated in the 1980s, and I've seen the term used in books, articles and record sleeves. The term was mostly used in Britain, but I didn't think a term had to be used worldwide (or more to the point, in the USA) to be worthy of a Wikipedia article.<a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 19:16, 5 July 2006 (UTC)Spylab</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> <s>and move to Funny punk</s>. <i>Punk pathetique</i> has always been obscure as hell, but more so since the mid-1980s, so it isn't likely to be found on the Internet. The reason why it's so rare is because the term "funny punk" replaced it twenty or so years ago. The general idea caught on under that name, so by the time the Internet rolled around in the 1990s, people were calling it <i>funny punk</i>. <i>Funny punk</i> is still a very obscure term, but I can find some citations for it, like <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~droplegs/PUNK.html" class="external text" title="http://members.tripod.com/~droplegs/PUNK.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. <a href="../../../e/c/t/User%7EEcto_9fec.html" title="User:Ecto">Ecto</a> 22:50, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Punk Pathetique hasn't been replaced, it just isn't popular. Funny Punk exists as well, but it was never so defined as Punk Pathetique. Funny Punk includes bands like AOD &amp; the Descendents yeah? That's the American hardcore version of the same thing. Black Flag could even be part of that at times, the Circle Jerks definitely.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have to say, I know for a fact this sub-genre existed.

Just because you disagree with me does not give you the right to accuse me of "abuse". As it happens I do believe that this article could constitute <i>"content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make any use of it whatsoever"</i> and therefore could conceivably be considered patent nonsense. That is my opinion and interpretation of the "patent nonsense" policy.

<li>Extending the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a> criterion to cover things that are simply <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nonsense" class="extiw" title="wikt:nonsense">nonsense</a>, not <i>patent nonsense</i>, is abuse of the criterion, plain and simple, as discussed in many places, including <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EPatent_nonsense_957f.html#Misuse_of_this_criterion" title="Wikipedia talk:Patent nonsense">Wikipedia talk:Patent nonsense#Misuse_of_this_criterion</a>.

That is abuse of the speedy deletion criteria, whether you wish it so or not. Speedy deletion is deliberately restrictive, and the purpose of the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a> is to cover those articles that are utterly and permanently incomprehensible, <i>not</i> to cover articles that are, as this one is, readily comprehensible. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:19, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have conceded right from the start that this is <i>not</i> a case of patent nonsense and changed my vote accordingly. Would it have killed you to have simply written "I disagree with Islay Solomon, this is not a case of patent nonsense" rather than resorting to a patronising lecture? If I had actually added a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-nonsense_a295.html" title="Template:Db-nonsense">db-nonsense</a>}} tag to the article then of course I would be abusing the patent nonsense criteria. But that is not what I did. I simply stated, in a debate initiated by "Weregerbil", that I thought a speedy nonsense delete was appropriate. As it happens I was wrong. Instead of conducting yourself in a civil manner you have deluged me with vile and sarcastic insinuations of stupidity and ignorance that I find extremely offensive.

<li>I made no mention whatsoever of stupidity, as can be plainly seen above. You are taking offence at something that does not exist in what is actually written in front of you. Indeed, I have made no comment about you at all. Simply writing that it is not patent nonsense would not have encouraged you to stop abusing the criterion. Hence, I politely asked you to stop abusing it. That you found a polite request to stop abusing the patent nonsense criterion, followed by answers to your questions as to how you were abusing the criterion, to be offensive, is quite bizarre. <i>I simply stated that I thought a speedy nonsense delete was appropriate.</i> — which is <i>exactly</i> how you abused the patent nonsense criterion. There is no "nonsense" speedy deletion criterion, only <i>patent nonsense</i>.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Of course this is nonsense; Uncle G, you're seriously insisting on the crucial distinction between word sald (patent nonsense) and stuff made up in school one day? Yes, they're distinguishable, but so what? Neither belong in an encyclopedia, which is the real point of this discussion. Where the distinction matters, i.e., the tag used for deletion--well, Islay <i>never</i> used it. Uncle G, you owe Islay an apology. (and yes, I'm addressing arguments, not people, as your comments are hostile and ultimately unsupportable. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReimelt_5d48.html" title="User:Reimelt">Reimelt</a> 20:02, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, the distinction is between <i>nonsense</i> and <i>patent nonsense</i>. On the contrary: <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a> <i>did</i> recommend speedy deletion. Xe wrote "Speedy delete".

<li>I said he never used the <i>tag</i>. Please familiarize yourself with the previous posting. (you see? It's really rather brusque to insist on the minutiae.) And yes, Uncle G, you were right in detail and Islay was wrong. No one is sayng otherwise. I'll stop posting here as this has gotten way out of hand and the contributors here are way too valuable (from what I can see) to belabor this. For my part, I just didn't want any hurt feelings over an entry that should be deleted. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReimelt_5d48.html" title="User:Reimelt">Reimelt</a> 16:37, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am intrigued by your argument over a subjective term such as "nonsense." For instance, some of us would feel that the word nonsense may apply to a group of people who go on the internet to search for entries in a <i>free</i> online encyclopedia, even as this entry does not conern them in the least and can simply be ignored. Surely you all have better things to do with your time than decide what students, who are in some cases over 3,000 miles away, should be allowed to read online and laugh at. As far as the contention that this entry is "patent nonsense," this entry is decidedly coherent and while <i>some</i> "reasonable" people will undoubtedly find this entry useless, that certainly does not apply to the population as a whole. Although I myself am not a student at UW-Madison, I do have several friends there who have heard of and taken part in "foodpunting," in addition to people at my own school who I have seen doing it. If students at one of the most prestigious universities in America find this term relevant, why should it be taken down to satisfy someone who is so completely "sensible" that they have nothing better to do than scour the internet for terms that are objectionable to <i>them.</i>--Borat416
<ul>
<li>If ignoring the entry is the "sensical" (sensible?)thing to do, why are you so verbose? I for one couldn't care less what UW-Madison students (or anyone else) finds amusing; I do care what goes into Wikipedia. Moreover, "simply ignoring" it does not do anything for the finite storage capacity of wWikipedia's servers. Most important, if you have nothing to say re the article itself, don't post here. Also, please sign your comments. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReimelt_5d48.html" title="User:Reimelt">Reimelt</a> 23:00, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Reimelt, until wikipedia assigns you to some sort of policy-making position and adds you to the payroll, I am going under the assumption that they do not need you to monitor the storage capacity of their servers. Until then, you and everyone else has to understand that although you may not disagree with the content/relevance of every article on wikipedia, that does not mean that the article breaks some kind of rule. The article does not reflect a promotional intent, as I doubt "foodpunters" are trying to profit off of this activity. The author's argument that "foodpunting" is similar to "drunk dialing"(also a wikipedia entry) in that both are common activities performed by intoxicated persons is a valid one. As for your supposed right to determine what goes into a FREE online encyclopedia, if you are that controlling then I suggest you stop commenting on random articles, get a job, purchase your own encyclopedia, and then rip out the pages that you don't agree with.--Borat416
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>What on earth does wikipedia being free have to do with anything? "On the payroll"&#160;? The whole <i>point</i> of Wikipedia is to have collaboration by volunteers. Moreover, where does anyone accuse the article's authors of trying to profit from it. Finally,"Drunk dialing" is verifiably notable, foodpunting is not. That's the the rule the article breaks: non-notability.<br />
As to the "get a job" sneer--comment on the arguments, not the people. In that vein, you do realize that this is the page where editors vote on articles for deletion, right? What's '"controlling" about participating in the collaborative process? I was adding my vote <i>on the page for voting</i> and then you insult me as controlling? What's that about?. On that note, I think I'll stop feeding the trolls for a while. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReimelt_5d48.html" title="User:Reimelt">Reimelt</a> 00:14, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's right, I consider somebody who needs to put their two cents in on something that has little to no effect on them is indeed controlling. Get a life.--Borat416</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Just as anybody may edit, anybody may contribute to the consensus as to whether things should be kept.

<li>Even if you did have a consensus(which you do not, by the way), should every decision in the world be made by a bunch of internet weirdos with nothing better to do with their time?

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> a) The consensus is clearly for deletion and b) this is hardly tantamount to the making of all decisions in the world, it is being made by people who have a vested interest in Wikipedia and know how policy works.

<p>This should NOT be deleted...as a recent college graduate, I participated in many foodpunts. It became a part of our vernacular. All slang words have to originate from somewhere and this one is no different. It would be a travesty to delete this word from wikipedia.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If it were really a widely-used neologism, try wikidictionary. But, of course, it is not a part of the vernacular of wikipedia users (or any other large group--including students) when it gets <i>Zero</i> hits on Google.

<li>Just out of curiosity, have any of the "haters" on this board even tried a "foodpunt," because it seems as if everyone who has tried punting food has liked it. After all, you can't spell foodpunt without F-U-N. ArtVandelay7 02:09, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to agree with Art Vandalay...to all the haters...next time you see some undesirable food in your fridge try to punt it out the back door...make sure you yell "foodpunt" and that you have a witness...then write about it on your blog so it gets some google hits and then you'll feel better about the foodpunt being on wikipedia. Then remember before Star Wars came out and there was no such thing as a light saver. Neologisms are okay...they even describe real things like computer nerds. Foodpunters don't hate computer nerds so computer nerds shouldn't hate foodpunters.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Blogs are not a reliable source, so we would not feel better. I don't know why you assume we hate foodpunters - what we actually hate is unverified and non-notable vanity articles.

<p>We are writing this stuff on a website completely devoted to things that you could not find in a regular encyclopedia...words and phenomenons associated with vernacular, including neologisms and slang are a part of that. There is no reason to be on such a high horse about what does and doesn't belong in a bootleg encyclopedia. Some of the best stuff in here could only be found here. That's what makes it great...VIVA LA FOODPUNT!!!</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Suspicions of what exactly? If you want to accuse me of sockpuppeting - then you need to go through the process properly. Although I did contact jcompton to find out the original source of the quote, I was by no means trying to persuade him to contribute or defend the article. I'd like to see the logs on wikipedia search, but I'm willing to bet that the term is searched for often enough that when people finally found it in wikipedia, they wanted to contribute or defend it. I believe your statement to be abrasive and totally uncalled for. I'm a newbie here, but I've tried to follow the wikipedia policies as best I can. --Terevos 13:25, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No you didn't. You have not edited the Bruce willis is a robot article <i><b>at all</b></i>. One of the skills of sockpuppetry is <i>remembering from which account you did what</i>. And you've forgotten to do this. Now as it happens, I don't give a stuff whther you are or are not a sockpuppet, nor indeed do I care much what is the outcome of this discussion. But let's just for fun look at your posting history &amp; that of Terevos. (Oh, and btw, you asked what led to the AFD. The use of a lower case w in willis led to my interest; You've still not rectified that point.)</li>
<li>Terevos arrives at wikipedia on the 5th July at15:18 (and is very welcome, as all new wikipedians are). He posts away on the BWIAR article until 16:38, when he takes a break.</li>
<li>Goatwarrior turns up at 17:38, now that the article if on AF, and lasts until 17:57, when, exhausted by the effort of contributing only to the BWIAR debate, he gives in and...</li>
<li>Terevos arrives back at 18.25 for the night shift.</li>
<li>Next day Goatwarrior is up first, at at 13:04 to 13:43, but has no stamina, and is replaced by</li>
<li>Terevos, weighing in from 14:01 to 15:02 before</li>
<li>Goatwarrior takes the baton at 15:22 &amp; 16:45 and then its back to</li>
<li>Terevos, for the early evening shift of one post at 19:50, and wouldn't you know it</li>
<li>Goatwarrior reapprears for two posts at 20:06

<li>So what you're saying is that terevos and are the same person who can deticate his entire workday and personal day to commenting on a wikipedia article. Sorry, but I don't have that kind of time. For the record, I did in fact edit the article. I'm sure the moderators can show that I came from a completely different IP than any of the other posters.

<li>It also might be worth noting that the 6th Sense debuted in 1999 and the forum references are from 7/02, 2/04, 2/04, and 2/05 so while it's not exactly crushing the internet it is certainly persisting. Whether you chose to delete the stub or not doesn't change the fact that is used. goatwarrior</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Let me address the concerns that have been stated by the moderators.
<ul>
<li>1. Neologism: Although it might be able to be classified as a neologism, it's more like a colloquialism. As stated by goatwarrior, the Sixth Sense was out in 1999 and it continues to be referenced throughout the years.</li>
<li>2. Poor Citations: Yes, there are not very good citations, but I would argue that it's because of the nature of the phrase itself. It's used when in the middle of a conversation about a movie, you find out that someone hasn't seen it. That situation is very unlikely in even forums and would be totally inappropriate use of the phrase in any kind of website. It is not a net friendly phrase. However, wikipedia is not just about net friendly or written word friendly articles.</li>
<li>3. Lack of google hits: please see number two.</li>
<li>4. Nonsense: I may be biased because I'm the author, but I've tried to make the article as well written as I could. It was not written with any ulterior motive. I used the phrase in conversation with some people who didn't know what it mean - I said look it up on wikipedia, it's probably there. And lo and behold, it wasn't. So I wrote it hoping that others would contribute.</li>
<li>5. As you can see by the forum post links, I did not make up the phrase, I'm simply reporting on it because it is a piece of history (ongoing).</li>
<li>6. Keep in mind this is a colloquialism, so just because you may not have heard of it, doesn't mean it's not true or doesn't exist. How many of you use the term <a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansible.html" title="Ansible">Ansible</a> or have even heard that word before? I think that 'Bruce Willis is a robot' is used far more than that particular colloquialism. --Terevos 18:32, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have added what to the best of my knowledge is the origin of the term to this article. (Disclaimer: I was not involved in the creation of the article, but my post was one of those cited as a reference to the term.) As for the "lack of search hits" on the term, that was actually a source of frustration to me as I tried to piece together where I'd read the thing in the first place, since the Old Man Murray article doesn't seem to be readily findable on a reasonable sort of "bruce willis robot" query. It was only by blind chance that a friend, who had heard my lament about how my Sixth Sense viewing experience was corrupted by this bizarre bluff spoiler, stumbled upon it and filled in that gap in my memory. So I would put to the "delete" crowd that the lack of ready explanations for the term is in fact a good reason to keep it available in WP. --Jason Compton <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.183.46.179 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.183.46.179_0518.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.183.46.179">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>You've come to Wikipedia with the wrong idea of what this project is. Wikipedia's goal is to be an encyclopaedia, not to be a repository of information that doesn't exist outside of Wikipedia.

<li>A neologism is something that's 'new'. This phrase is over 6 years old. This isn't popularization, I'm not trying to increase the use of the term, simply to report on what it is. It is well known by the people that use it. It is well documented on many forums and it will never be used in anything but forums because of the nature of the term. I'm not sure what the problem with the use of forums for colloquialisms is.

<li><b>Comment</b> Please note that Weregerbil does not seem to understand the proper usage of the term. Otherwise he would not have suggested to wait until newspapers start using it in movie reviews. The term is primarily a speech-only phrase.

<li><b>Delete</b>, because if I, a total non-entity, were to post this phrase once to any old random forum anywhere on the internet, I would be increasing this phrase's entire verifiable global circulation by about 10%, and I would not be diluting the notability of its pool of adopters one iota either.

<li><b>Comment</b> Earlier in this talk session, I was accused of being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_sock_puppet" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_sock_puppet" rel="nofollow">Sock Puppet</a>. If you follow the link to the wikipedia article refering to internet sock puppet, you'll find no references other than a single usenet that references the term. Other than that, the article has no other reference to the term. Having been on the usenet for many years, I have never heard this term before, but it is nonetheless used by a handful of people on the net. I'm not saying by any means that we should delete the Sock Puppet article at all, I'm simply wondering how it slipped through the sensors. After all, according to weregerbil, if it were an actual term, shouldn't it be documented in a major news paper? Anyways, it's just something to think about. (For the record, I am not a "sock puppet".) --Goatwarrior 00:27, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Sockpuppet is notable in that sense anyway because Wikipedia uses it. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 01:43, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand the point being made above per Goatwarrior. "Sock puppet" gets rather a lot of <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22sock+puppet%22&amp;safe=off&amp;qt_s=Search" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/groups/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22sock+puppet%22&amp;safe=off&amp;qt_s=Search" rel="nofollow">Google Group hits</a>, and a glance at these shows these are most often in the internet sense of the phrase. "Bruce Willis is a robot" gets <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22bruce%20willis%20is%20a%20robot%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wg" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22bruce%20willis%20is%20a%20robot%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wg" rel="nofollow">rather fewer hits</a>. So the subject of the article under discussion is unnotable because, um, there's no evidence anyone's using it. There's lots of evidence that "sock puppet" is widely used in the internet sense, so it's notable. Even the <i><a href="../../../l/a/_/LA_Times_c23e.html" title="LA Times">LA Times</a></i> has quoted the phrase <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mccurry5jun05,1,4169062.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true" class="external text" title="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mccurry5jun05,1,4169062.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true" rel="nofollow">in one of its stories</a>. If <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">the article</a> doesn't reflect that fact with enough references, then feel free to clean it up. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 02:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The LA times article doesn't use the term sock puppet in the same way defined by the wikipedia article. The LA Times article is not refering to a mule account or anything internet related. I do plan on doing the proper research to legitimize the sock puppet article, I just have yet to find what this forum refers to as a legitimate reference for this term. As to your claim that sock puppet gets more hits than 'Bruce Willis is a robot' is because the term sock puppet is a multi-purpose term for more than just a mull account. Whereas the phrase 'Bruce Willis is a robot' is not static and it's usage may vary. For example, you can say, 'So in the end, Bruce Willis turned out to be a robot', 'So, anyways, Bruce Willis ended up being a robot', 'So it turned out that Bruce Willis was a robot'. The phrase being a partial sentence is bound by English tense and a variety of circumstances. --Goatwarrior 13:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If I went out and marked all the neologism and primary source articles for AfD, that would be against the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> policy. The discussion MUST include talk about other articles and about the policies themselves if you really want this to be a fair proceeding on AfD. So the discussion is not just about BWIAR, but about all colloquialisms, since they rarely have a primary source outside of wikipedia. (See <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badonkadonk.html" title="Badonkadonk">Badonkadonk</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet_%28internet%29.html" title="Sock puppet (internet)">Sock_puppet_(internet)</a> for starters. I can find a whole lot more if you'd like.) Personally, I've never heard the term 'Sock Puppet' used like the wikipedia community does - therefore, according to your interpretation of the neologism guidelines, I can justly put that up for AfD.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with terevos. Other articles definitely come into question when applying the same rules and the same logic. In applying the same rules to this article as we do other articles, how can we ignore what else is out there? We don't live in a vacuum and we most certainly do not want to ignore how the wikipedia rule apply to other articles. A mass proposed deletion of a series of other articles is not the answer.--Goatwarrior 20:06, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If that is seriously Wikipedia's official policy, there are a whole lot of articles that are currently in Wikipedia that are 1. Primary source and 2. Neologism. Shall I start putting them all up for AfD? No, because people look to Wikipedia for all kinds of information. Is it hurting anyone to have <a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansible.html" title="Ansible">Ansible</a> or <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badonkadonk.html" title="Badonkadonk">Badonkadonk</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet_%28internet%29.html" title="Sock puppet (internet)">Sock_puppet_(internet)</a> on Wikipedia? Should those entries be in Wikipedia even though they are Neologisms and/or primary source articles? I would argue they should be in Wikipedia. The primary source thing is to prevent falsification, not to prevent colloquialisms from being entered into Wiki. --Terevos 14:05, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "primary source thing" is part of the fundamental goal of this project: to be an encyclopaedia, a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>. Editors who believe that Wikipedia should be a primary source have come to the wrong project, and should look elsewhere for a project whose goals match theirs. This project's goal is to be an encyclopaedia. You'll also find that, in stark contrast to this article, there is secondary source material describing the concept of an ansible. There is certainly plenty of source material describing puppets made from socks (not least shelves full of children's activity books in bookshops). Articles on either subject can be written from sources. Articles on <i>this</i> subject cannot. Articles on this subject are original research. Your comparison is wholly flawed. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:42, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've read the Wikipedia guidelines on primary source. It doesn't apply to articles like this one. It's primarily referring to actual research on scientific data. Ansible is not a primary source article, you're right, but it is a neologism. Badonkadonk is both primary source and a neologism. And you're looking at the wrong <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet_%28internet%29.html" title="Sock puppet (internet)">Sock_puppet_(internet)</a> article. The one I referred to is about a pseudonym account. That article is both a primary source and neologism. --Terevos 15:02, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm confused. You say you have <i>read</i> the policy (not guidelines) on primary sources? Then you will have read the section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policy that prohibits: "Primary (original) research such as proposing theories and solutions, original ideas, defining terms, coining new words, etc." Does the "defining terms" and "coining new words, etc." not apply here somehow? I rather think it does. The policy is in no way restricted merely to "research on scientific data".

<li><b>Comment</b> The purpose of 'primary source' is to prevent unverifiable articles and disputes. As you can see from the multiple links given in the BWIAR article, they all use the phrase the same way. There is no disagreement on how the term can be used. Shall we start getting rid of all what you consider to be 'primary source' articles in Wikipedia? Maybe we could start with <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet_%28internet%29.html" title="Sock puppet (internet)">Sock_puppet_(internet)</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badonkadonk.html" title="Badonkadonk">Badonkadonk</a>? Just because the article says 'References' doesn't mean that those are referring to 'reliable sources' as you define them. Again, please address how Sock Puppet and Badonkadonk are different than BWIAR. Why are those valid articles, but this one is not? And don't tell me to put them up for AfD, because that would be against <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. --Terevos 14:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, first of all, I'm glad you seem to have dropped the opinion that WP policy on primary sources doesn't apply to this article because that policy is restricted to "research on scientific data". That was my main concern here. I hope it's clear now that primary source policy is eminently applicable to this article.
<p>The difference I feel that exists between the current article and the others you cite is this: first, AfD is not cleanup. Second, I am confident that if I had the time to sit down and research either of the topics you name, I could come up with enough reliable third-party sources to satisfy any future, projected AfD for them. I base this view on the fact that those articles deal with subjects that, when all the evidence available to me <i>now</i> is weighed up, seem capable of demonstrating a usage outside of a handful of unreliable third party sources. BWIAR, on the other hand, does not fill me with such confidence. That's a judgement call that each WP editor here is making, including me, and including yourself. That's why those articles do not belong in AfD IMO - if they were placed here, editors would be mobilised to defend the articles, as editors are mobilised here to defend this one, and I feel sure the result would be a keep in those cases. That's all. My opinion is <i>an</i> opinion, but it is <i>not</i> one just plucked out of the air. If there was <i>anything</i> here, or <i>anything</i> "out there", that made me confident that BWIAR merited a WP article, then let me assure you that I would make that belief known here. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 16:12, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> So basically it doesn't come down to WP policies of whether something gets placed on AfD, it's more of just how the Wikipedia editors 'feel' about a particular article. If AfD is not about cleanup, then why was BWIAR placed in AfD immediately after its creation, rather than giving it some time for other contributors to add what is needed. In time if it couldn't comply with the complaints against it, then put it on AfD. It's not like its presence is harming Wikipedia or anyone else. --Terevos 18:11, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Of course it comes down to WP policies, haven't I stated this clearly enough? " My opinion is <i>an</i> opinion, but it is <i>not</i> one just plucked out of the air." Please re-read my comments if in any further doubt. You have time in the five days of AfD to clean this up and convince us all that the BWIAR article does not constitute primary research of a neologism. Good luck with it, seriously. As to why this is in AfD, ask the nom. It certainly isn't here for any bad faith reason that I can see. I am merely dealing with this AfD now that it's here. As should we all. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 18:17, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, I have read your comments. And it appears that you are implementing the Wikipedia policies strictly here, but not for <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet_%28internet%29.html" title="Sock puppet (internet)">Sock Puppet</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badonkadonk.html" title="Badonkadonk">Badonkadonk</a> and many many other Wikipedia articles. If it were true that Wiki does not accept colloquialisms and neologisms which are primary source on Wikipedia, there would be a whole lot less Wikipedia articles. So essentially, it's left to how you 'feel' about BWIAR as opposed to the other neologism/primary source wiki articles. Unless you truly believe that <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet_%28internet%29.html" title="Sock puppet (internet)">Sock Puppet</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badonkadonk.html" title="Badonkadonk">Badonkadonk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatocracy.html" title="Corporatocracy">Corporatocracy</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prequel.html" title="Prequel">Prequel</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumping_the_shark.html" title="Jumping the shark">Jumping the shark</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posterized.html" title="Posterized">Posterized</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaxploitation.html" title="Blaxploitation">Blaxploitation</a> (just to name a few with very minimal effort) should all be deleted if they cannot provide primary sources outside of Wikipedia. --Terevos 20:03, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, what else can I do but implement WP policies strictly here in AfD? Other than go off and develop my own wikis elsewhere? Your argument now seems to be yawing round to imaginary questions of the "what would you do if X were AfDed" variety. I feel I have anticipated such a move, and made it clear what I would do in such a scenario. I would do exactly as I am doing now. I would evaluate the case on its own merits, then post my view, per WP policy. As would - I believe - everyone else. What more need anyone do? The article would stand or fall on its own merits. In all this time being spent debating the patently obvious, I personally can't help thinking the BWIAR article could be being properly sourced and cleaned up, assuming such a feat were humanly possible. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 00:03, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> With all respect, GRBerry, I think you are seriously mis-understanding what is meant by "things made up in school one day." It does refer, of course, to things schoolkids make up--but it also implies that it subsequently gains no more notoriety beyond the schoolyard in which it is made up.

<dd>It's a fair point that the NYTimes reference is quite small, but it is still coverage in a national newspaper. The Phoenix may be tabloid quality, but it's still a substantial paper, as is the Houston Chronicle. The coverage of all three, combined with the high google hits and international nature of the Aerican Empire still makes me inclined to think it should stay. I'm almost tempted to move down to a Keep, but I really feel that articles of this type (explaining things that are important enough that you'll occasionally hear references to them, but not so important as you'd be inclined to use another source) are one of the things that make Wikipedia so great. Anyway, two substantial newspapers, one paper of record and over 100,000 google hits is notable enough for my tastes, so I'm sticking. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVickser_b9a2.html" title="User:Vickser">Vickser</a> 05:18, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As a 'Citizen' of Aerica based in Australia, i believe that Aerica has every right to a page on Wikipedia. As a micronation - wether real or imagined - a reference within Wikipedia should exist simply to inform users that it exists. I personally use Wikipedia as my number one source of information for my work, and like doing a google search these days - if it doesnt come up, then it doesnt exist in the real or internet world. Similar pages (such as Flying Spagetti Monster) will assumedly remain if Aerica is removed. Does it hurt anyone if it stays? - Martin (not a wiki account holder)

<li>Your argument is proposing the mis-use of Wikipedia as a free wiki hosting service for primary source documentation. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is neither a free wiki host nor a hosting service</a>.

</li>
<li>For micronations, notability generally involves some impact by a micronation upon the real world. Declaring a field to be an independent nation and telling only Wikipedia about it such as the Nation of Pogo (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nation_of_Pogo_6b35.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nation of Pogo">AfD discussion</a>), or setting up a club on a web site such as the Republic of Atlasia (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Republic_of_Atlasia_665a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Republic of Atlasia">AfD discussion</a>), do not impact the real world at all. Whereas <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/d/Ladonia_%28micronation%29.html" title="Ladonia (micronation)">Ladonia</a>, in contrast, have elicited mainstream news coverage, and have involved real disputes, real territories, and real court cases. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:27, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With respect, this is kind of like saying that David Letterman isn't noteworthy because he didn't become a news anchor. Ignoring for the moment the huge confusion and disagreement about an acceptable definition of the word micronation, you're saying that an aspiring state is only noteworthy if they affect real-world change -- apparently ignoring that 1) it takes time to do so and 2) not every group aspires to that kind of thing. Sealand and Ladonia have made the mainstream news, but it's a matter of opinion if that exposure was of any value to them or covered them in any positive value beyond their being a novelty. The Empire has had *less* coverage, but it has still had international news coverage. This is not a state which has appeared only on Wiki, nor is it merely a website, and it has impacted the real world (albeit, only on a small scale so far). <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimcrow_b867.html" title="User:Timcrow">Timcrow</a></li>

<p>Aerica is both growing and powerful within the Micronational world. Though Aerica may not be as widely powerful as it once was, that doesn't mean it is subject to deletion! Pogs were once very popular and influential and they almost completely disappeared, yet they still have a wikipedia page. Aerica may not be an item but it surely diserves a page much more than some currently ignored toy. This is true not only for its past influence, but its current growth, power and love. Please do not delete this wikipage or you will have undone our only history on this site that was once small too. Please continue your endorsement of so little bandwidth into our nation of Aerica.hiho216 16:06, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I can see why some people would say that this isn't a notable entity, but from an alternate point of view, obviously the people who created the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronations.html" title="Micronations">micronations</a> article think that it's notable enough to mention in the article even though they don't cite many others of the "thousands" they say are out there. The people who frequent that article are the ones who know best what's notable, and if they think it's this one is noteworthy even while they call it "self-aggrandisement" then I'm inclined to go with their call. Plus, someone obviously a fair amount of work into getting some actual content up there quickly -- this isn't just a ten-year-old kid writing about his hobby during a five-minute break from cleaning his room. --Archmage2001 22:07, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm a member of the Empire and, being biased, don't feel able to ethically vote, but I did want to just pipe up about the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Category_talk%7EMicronations_5136.html" title="Category talk:Micronations">Category talk:Micronations</a> criteria. 1) The Empire's existence is clearly cited by more than 5 offline sources (not including reprints of the NYT article). 2) This material has come to the attention of people in more than 1000 people in America, Canada, Israel, Australia, and Portugal (based on known circulation values of the newspapers involved). 3) Admittedly, it has not produced coins and passports, but this is by choice and not ommission -- we've never seen the point in producing these items before there's reasonable hope of them being worth the paper (or copper) they're printed on. You can't hold it against us that we don't want to waste our or anyone else's money on novelties. For what it's worth, we do produce clothes and mousepads and such through Cafepress which has sold several hundred USD worth of merch, we do have a limited range of actual medals which have been given out (The Order of the Tinfoil Halibut, for example -- it doesn't sound respectable, but it's a real-life medal), and some of those warhammer figures shown on the page have been produced and sold as collectibles (only in a small run because, after all, they're all individually hand-painted). I just hope that those who are voting pro-delete aren't doing so just because the organization appears silly; we're serious about what we do, we just laugh while we do it, and while I can't speak for anyone else, the Empire has played more of a part in my offline life than my online life for about seven years now. I also hope that the fact that I'm not a registered wiki user doesn't make my arguments carry any less weight; I love wiki and use it constantly, and just because I read rather than write isn't supposed to devalue my input in the community. --70.51.181.50 04:10, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Personally, it seems that they are Chicago's (and thus very likely Illinois' and the Midwest's) leading vendor of loose leaf brewed tea, which is the next wave in gourmet beverage if you ask me. Unfortunately, this is somewhat opinionated. Nonetheless, I think they are the leader in this type of gourmet tea. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notes an alternate test of expandability (Will the article ever be more than a stub?

<p>WRT, future store openings, I don't know much about independent source info. WRT awards and sales, I have begun searching for independent source info. Online there seem to be several beverage industry info sources: Beverage World Magazine, American Beverage Association, The Beverage Network, and Beverage Digest Online. I can not even find stats for tea sales online other than a reference to Snapple as the #3 tea seller. I find references to Ready To Drink (RTD) tea, and organic teas as well as loose leaf teas. However, nothing shows how things stack up nationally. Regional stats are probably impossible to find by a non-subscriber of the Beverage Digest Fact Book. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">Tony The Tiger</a> 19:18, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, yes... you are reading too much into it. I was not in any way accusing you of somehow orchestrating a change to Gabba's MySpace page so the text would be different than the article, thus rendering my comment incorrect without generating an edit log on the Wikipedia article.

<dd>No offense intended, I was just being proactive in the full disclosure departement. As for the MySpace text: considering that any article dealing with them will quickly feature a memorable sentence such as "Stig Honda decided to fuse the disco pop of Abba and the punk rock of The Ramones", I guess that anyone is quite easily liable to get <a href="../../../d/%C3%A9/j/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu.html" title="Déjà vu">déjà vu</a> over them, even when the sentences are different. -- 62.147.37.122 18:44, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Assertions of notability are made, but none of them seem to be backed up. Can we get some links to press coverage, or at least something more specific than a list of media outlets? Having three albums is great, but two of them are not even available anymore and one is banned (for whatever reason), which does not indicate notability. The extent of the group's entry on allmusic.com is one album listing - no biography of any kind. IMO, the claim to notability is extremely weak here, especially given that this is only a tribute band. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7ECholmes75_fc51.html" title="User talk:Cholmes75">chit chat</a>)</sup> 13:47, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>About the "banned album": According to the band, " <i>GABBA release their complex 3rd album, the Spanish language "Tijuana Dance". However, the album was banned and withdrawn from sale after just 1 week for being "Anti-Establishment", due to some confusion over Bee Bee's appalling Spanish translations which inadvertantly accused the Queen of England of being a Nazi Stormtrouper (in a stupor, no less)</i> [refers to the song "Estupendo Choque Trouper"]<i>. It is unclear if the album will ever be released again.</i> " <a href="http://www.gabba.co.uk/disco.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gabba.co.uk/disco.html" rel="nofollow">from Gabba's own discog</a> (of course, that's the sort of detail from their site that I find could be playfully bogus, hence my hidden comment in the stub about the need for independent research. Only two Spanish-speaking sites seem to discuss this album. But then, if Wikipedia wants to delete them, I don't imagine the UK media reporting about a tribute band's CD being censored.)</li>
<li>They claim to have coined "discopunk" for their style of pop-punk (quote "as the inventors of Discopunk" in <a href="http://www.gabba.co.uk/archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gabba.co.uk/archive.html" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>). While there is currently no discopunk article, the word is much in use and has become an emerging subgenre name, apparently boosted by a 2002 album <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:yf4uakjk0m3p" class="external autonumber" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:yf4uakjk0m3p" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> of that name (43,000+ Google hits, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/going_out/clubbing/2003/04/02/discopunk.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/going_out/clubbing/2003/04/02/discopunk.shtml" rel="nofollow">a 2003 BBC article about its US version</a>, a quote from NME using this genre name about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adored_fdbb.html" title="The Adored">The Adored</a>, and there is <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/discopunk" class="external text" title="http://www.last.fm/tag/discopunk" rel="nofollow">a page for discopunk at Last.fm</a>, for instance). The point being, if they coined it and some roots of that style, that's a claim to fame and notability, albeit little.</li>
<li>Another point: it's not just yet another minor tribute band to Abba or the Ramones, but a merging of the two, there's not exactly a plethora of similar bands -- that's why they're featured as one of the examples in the much-coveted lead of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribute_band.html" title="Tribute band">tribute band</a>, are cited as "an extreme example of punk cover versions" in <a href="../../../c/o/v/Cover_version.html" title="Cover version">cover version</a>, and are often cited in magazine articles about the tribute bands phenomenon: they're a striking example (just like <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini_Kiss_8858.html" title="Mini Kiss">Mini Kiss</a>), and they're a simple Hollywood pitch, "imagine Abba played by The Ramones" (just like <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalyptica.html" title="Apocalyptica">Apocalyptica</a>, "imagine Metallica played by four cellos").</li>

<ul>
<li>Their single "Gabba Gabba" is allegedly on sale on <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/" class="external text" title="http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/" rel="nofollow">the iTunes UK store</a> (I can't check that, I don't have iTunes for browsing their catalog, or rather catalogue). That's the song they had contributed to an international tribute album to the late <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Ramone_a188.html" title="Joey Ramone">Joey Ramone</a> (a 2001 CD, cf. article).</li>
<li>They had been reviewed in <i>The Ramones UK Fan Club Newsletter</i> (Number 24, February 2000) - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010619080057/http://www.gabba.co.uk/temp/rukfc.jpg" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20010619080057/http://www.gabba.co.uk/temp/rukfc.jpg" rel="nofollow">A thumbnail screenshot of it</a>, because the full image is broken at Archive.org</li>

<li><b>Meta-comment: jury duty</b> (In a calm, relaxed tone.)
<ul>
<li>I'd like to say I find it rather appalling that people who voted "Delete" never came back to the debate, to confront the evidence about the article they had sentenced to death. And this, despite their being informed twice on their talk page about the detailled list of notability evidence gathered, and despite being wiki-active since.</li>
<li>I understand that an AFD isn't a vote per se, and how its reviewing process can strengthen an article -- but this works better, and doesn't give such a sorry spectacle, when an actual debate takes place.</li>
<li>Yet it's currently possible to just mass-slap AFD's and Delete's without any further involvement, personal responsibility, accountability, or moral sense of duty.</li>
<li>The results can then give the appearance of pathological <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch-hunt.html" title="Witch-hunt">witch-hunting</a> or <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo_court.html" title="Kangaroo court">kangaroo court</a>, rather than debate. As if a bunch of jurors would just say "Burn the witch" early in a trial, then leave the court before defense is pleaded. "It'll git a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_trial.html" title="Fair trial">fair AFD</a>, and then y'all can delete it."</li>
<li>As a rule of thumb, I think that someone who initiates or participates at some point in an AFD should have some sort of a "<a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury_duty.html" title="Jury duty">jury duty</a>" to come back at least once on the 4th or 5th day, especially when he voted "Delete". He could then review evidences, update his vote or explain why he maintains it -- or at the very least counter-sign his vote with a second ~~~~, so as to act of his presence before the sentence he's in part responsible of.</li>
<li>As a rule of thumb, someone should thus not engage in more AFD debates than he can, or intend to, actually handle.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If it is any consolation, this is 99.99% certain to close on at least a no consensus which would default to keep. I don't know if you noticed, but I removed my deletion opinion several days ago pending investigation of the sources. After looking at the sources I'm not 100% convinced they meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but they are very close to the line. It's close enough that I'm simply rendering no opinion either way. If there were <i>no</i> deletion opinions I would probably withdraw this AfD nomination. But as it stands I'm fairly certain this article will be kept, and with the improvements you've made to it over the past few days 62.147.37.122 I think the article makes a stronger case towards <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> now than the version that was there when I nominated it... and thanks for staying <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> throughout the debate.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:02, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, at this point I'd suggest that you please don't withdraw it, anyway: its being archived and referenced on the article's talk page should provide a valuable starting point for the many next AFD's I'm sure such article will go through again: I've merged all sources and references into the article, but we have here some additional angles of defense that can't be put into the article itself. And on an optimist note, it would also provide a useful starting point for mounting a request to undelete. -- 62.147.37.122 18:44, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I do share this opinion, but as far as I know it's just your opinion and mine: I mean, I don't remember anything in the AFD documentation that suggest, recommend, or prescribe treating votes in this fashion, to the admin who'll have the <s>fatigue</s> task of closing this debate. -- 62.147.37.122 18:49, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not so. It's not votes; it's a discussion, and if in a discussion someone makes a point which is then answered, and that first person remains silent, they have tacitly concurred. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 19:18, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly, and codifying this would take away the admins' discretion upon closure. I think <i>most</i> admins look at what has transpired and if evidence was provided at some point that makes a case towards guidelines or invalidates an argument, they take that into consideration. Regardless of the outcome, hopefully the admin will tag the talk page with a banner showing this already underwent AfD and what the outcome was.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:03, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hoax article/unverified/publicity: take your pick. Requests for verification have gone unanswered, even though there is an odd "death by elephant" claim in the article. The supposed death took place on May 12, 2006. Amazingly, Mr. Sigler managed to upload some more photos to the iStock site mentioned in the article <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/cats/wild_cats/lions/1800636_animals_lion_cub.php?id=1800636" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/cats/wild_cats/lions/1800636_animals_lion_cub.php?id=1800636" rel="nofollow">[73]</a> some 2 weeks after his own death.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> As this is supposed to be an open and free website designed to share information with the world One is forced to ask the question "Why are there people on this site who feel the need to submit pages for deletion and voice such petty and small minded comments..?" Could it be that these people can only raise the level of ther own fragile insecure egos by pulling down other people. Surely it is better to allow the inclusion of pages such as this and allow the visitors to the website the option of forming their own opinions about the page or indeed allow them the option to amend the page as they see fit rather than just delete it in such an extreme form of censorship. Anyone would think that this site is being operated by Fascists given the arbitrary way in which its administrators appear to be setting themselves up as gods with the power to tell people what to think whilst still purporting to be administering a "Free and Open" knowledge source.The Traveller<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by The Traveller (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Traveller_0167.html" title="User talk:The Traveller">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Traveller_c2a6.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Traveller">contribs</a>) 13:06, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

Reviewers in the custom computer space do not regurgitate press releases. I strongly considered buying a custom computer a few months ago, but eventually realized that I had more sense than money. Their target market is people who have more money than sense and lack the time/skills to build their own computer. Finding the best sources to cite will be a bear though, because while there are about 42,000 google hits on their name, there are only about 136 unique hits - so about 300 hits per domain... <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:42, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Being reviewed by people whose job it is to review any company like yours in a field doesn't qualify as obscurity, but by the same token I don't see it as establishing notability either. I'd feel better about this company if they'd been covered in the mainstream media. What seems to be the nature of the author's contributions does not help much either. Could be swayed with further evidence but from what I can see there's not much reason to keep this listing. GassyGuy 08:51, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I beleive all newly created articles can meet those criteria. Maybe because it was tagged for deletion in less than an hour after the creation time. For the first reason (in importance criteria), that's POV judgement, and cannot be objectively shown I think because it didnt get enough time for anyone to show that nobody is interrested to this article. Maybe it could've be more reasonnable to put a merge tag instead, or in the worst case the proposed for deletion tag. That why I think that this tag may be caused by an early judgement. --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanzoo_2f91.html" title="User:Banzoo">Banzoo</a> 18:08, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then you belive something that is clearly wrong. As for alternate tags - I have no problem with merging the scant information in this article with the broader <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Grapes_of_Wrath_e071.html" title="Operation Grapes of Wrath">Operation Grapes of Wrath</a> article, which is where I think this AfD is heading. I just don't think a non-notable attack that occured asd part of a larger military operation is worthy of an article, and expalined my reasoning. Can you shed some light on why you think this is a notable event? <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 21:15, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm glad to see that the deletion tag is bit unjustified. That said, I'm not with meriging, maybe my idea was misrepresented, i was saying that other tags could've been more understandable than the deletion one. I support having a separate article for this one for the first reason that I was inspired by other wikipedia articles, and since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, so whenever someone would do a research it would find what ever was searching for. Even though, having an <i>article devoted to every single instance where a building was attacked as part of a military operation</i> seems reasonable for a good group of people, specially when considering that this <i>instance</i> resulted with a notable civilians cost. So maybe we'll <i>end up with several thousand articles for every recent conflict</i> but I dont see why this cannot be acceptable. After all, in my opinion Human loss during conflicts is not something to be neglected. --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanzoo_2f91.html" title="User:Banzoo">Banzoo</a> 17:05, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please don't put words in my mouth. The fact that I'm willing to accept a merge does not mean that the AfD tag is unjustified. I have yet to see any evidence that having an <i>article devoted to every single instance where a building was attacked as part of a military operation</i> seems reasonable for a good group of people. Human cost as part of a conflict is obviously not somethign to be neglected - and it isn't. The <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Grapes_of_Wrath_e071.html" title="Operation Grapes of Wrath">Operation Grapes of Wrath</a> already notes the number of civilain casualties in this conflict. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 17:23, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No. There is evidence that the Sbarro incident is notable - a google search for Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing yeilds over 20,000 hits. The event has several pages dedicated to it on the Israeli MFA web site, and was the subject of numerous articles in print -for example <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,534748,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,534748,00.html" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,534461,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,534461,00.html" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>. The <a href="../../../s/b/a/Sbarro_restaurant_suicide_bombing.html" title="Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing">Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing</a> is in the same class as <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_massacre_859b.html" title="Cave of the Patriarchs massacre">Cave of the Patriarchs massacre</a> - a terror attack on civilians, which gathered much public attention.

<dd>I didnt know that this is the way to measure notability. But since it was mentioned, what was the stats for the article on question? Military conflict? isn't it the case for that bombing that took place during the al aksa intifada (that's considered as a conflict as far as I know). And why an attack on a civilian building in nabatiyeh is not considered as a terror attack? --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanzoo_2f91.html" title="User:Banzoo">Banzoo</a> 18:46, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi-I am a member of the band Boru's Ghost. I am not the writer of the article here, nor did I have anything to do with it's writing.(We were extremly flattered to be included in the Wikipedia though.) After reading the guidelines for inclusion on notability, I agree that we do not meet them. However we are working on it. I also noticed that you did not include Howl-o for deletion based on their website being included in the article, and our website is also included in our article. Also, we are very proud of the fact that this past March, we were included in the line up at North Texas Irish Festival, one of the largest Irish festivals in the United States. Our new album, Rites of Passage, is now currently being played by several podcasts...and picked up by several more weekly. Our <i>demo</i> and a recording that we did on a compilation was reviewed by Modern Bard, if interested you can read an exerpt at modernbard.org/reviews/borusghostdemo.htm. We are also currently involved in the creation of a new association for those interested in Celtic hertiage, the Oklahoma Celtic Heritage Association. I realize that Wikipedia is an academic tool and not a promotional tool. I would also say that although Boru's Ghost does not meet the guidlines yet, we are well on our way. Thanks- Audra Boru's Ghost...audrasingsforyou@yahoo.com</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There's a bunch of these <a href="../../../y/o/_/Yo_Gotti_5697.html" title="Yo Gotti">Yo Gotti</a> album/tape articles, one that matches this one in "content" is <b>Yo Gotti Life</b> (completely blank save an infobox). Main thing is, all of them are mistitled (they start Yo Gotti... rather than end ... (Yo Gotti album)). The rest of the articles contain a track listing only (<a href="../../../y/o/_/Yo_Gotti_Back_2_Da_Basics_bc25.html" title="Yo Gotti Back 2 Da Basics">Yo Gotti Back 2 Da Basics</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/_/Yo_Gotti_Shop_Open_dca8.html" title="Yo Gotti Shop Open">Yo Gotti Shop Open</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/_/Yo_Gotti_I_Told_U_So_ebc4.html" title="Yo Gotti I Told U So">Yo Gotti I Told U So</a>). I'm not sure about non-notability (this album up for AfD is available at amazon for example), but the mistitling is probably not helping (actual title of this album is just <i>Full Time Hustlin'</i> , for example - you get more Ghits with that). I suggest this lot be renamed to ... (Yo Gotti album) format and links at <a href="../../../y/o/_/Yo_Gotti_5697.html" title="Yo Gotti">Yo Gotti</a> be fixed as appropriate. As to what to do with completely blank album articles like this one and Yo Gotti Life, not sure. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 01:00, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
