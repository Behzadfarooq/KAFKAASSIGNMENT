<p>Unsourced, unverifiable list with a generic inclusion criteria of "famous" and "success". Basically a page to hype up one's favorite pet projects. No continuity between topics. Some attention should also be given to List of famous failures in science and engineering. While I can think of possible sources for the latter, what sources are there for this?</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> MMx1, to quote one Daffy Duck, you... are... despicable. Don't take your F-14 anger to ruin other WP articles. Failure to conform to NPOV is usually remedied by editing, Mmx has shown serious judgement failure in the past. He has appointed himself final arbiter of truth on the F-14, see talk on <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14.html" title="F-14">F-14</a> even though he refuses to recognize any citations contrary to his POV up to Janes Defence, and a VP of Grumman. He has simply followed a link at the bottom of the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-111.html" title="F-111">F-111</a> page, from the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14.html" title="F-14">F-14</a> page, and is simply another example of removing material from the WP without justification. This page is obviously well trafficed and edited, and of use to many people. WP states that deletion of information which does not improve WP is vandalism. His intent is to knock down other people's carefully constructed sandcastles, not improve the WP. In my opinion, this is exactly what Mmx1 is attempting to do.

<p>This article fails WP:NPOV and WP:NOR in every possible way. The group of songs listed seems very random, and there are several listed that I would definitely not consider the worst ever. At the end of the day, there is no way this article can be NPOV. Many of the songs follow with explanations of why the user PERSONALLY feels the song is one of the worst ever. This article is mostly original research. I don't see it being useful in any way, as it will always be filled with personal opinions and views. --Musicpvm 01:06, 1 July 2006 (UTC) This article was nominated for deletion on 21 November, 2005.

<li><s>Strong Keep</s> Are you guys nuts? This was created by me as a success mirror to the failure page. POV is not judged by the article, only that a large number of people have judged a project or product to be a spectacular success. There are many pages like this listing articles and objects that are most or least of something, and routinely done by journals such as Car and Driver for automobiles. I would much rather have a WP inclusive of these sort of pages than invoke a ban. Surely WP would not object to a list of most famous authors, top grossing movies, or most important events in the 1970s. Many entries show successes that were intially failures. If you kill the science success / failure pages, you'll also have to eliminate the similar list of computer flops, movie flops, governemnt flops, education flops, and sports flops. I don't think you can delete this page unless you can show a WP category ban for this sort of thing. If there is a ban, you'll have to enforce it across all topics, say so in the Wiki documentation in the appropriate list of what not and not to include in WP, and WP will be much poorer for it. I was about to nominate the J79 engine as a success, but you folks are going to take it all way. PlEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ don't kill it.--<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 10:37, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Things like top-grossing movies and the like are objectively verifiable based on takings and profits. This is a big list of unencyclopaedic personal opinions and depend inherently on the viewpoint of the reader or editor. I am sure we would object to lists of the most important 1970's events and dicsussions of who is the most 'famous author' as these labelling exercises depend on no objective basis and are not informative. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 11:11, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Using words like <i>success</i> or <i>failure</i> if you haven't noticed involves a necessary normative judgment that is largely a matter of personal position, opinion or taste. I don't know exactly what your above comment means, but I assume you are saying that a list of achievements is needed. One like this is not for my stated reason. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 11:11, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand your point re "finding" <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Apollo_b4b9.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a>. Any user can type in e.g. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_travel.html" title="Space travel">space travel</a> and find Apollo pretty much immediately. They can then decide for themselves whether it was a "success" or "failure". The list includes several entries that say "no replacement in sight" as sole validation for inclusion. This is simply not good enough for an encyclopedia. There is no consistent rationale for inclusion in this list, so it boils down to an editor's whim, and that's what makes it deletable as a NPOV/NOR failure. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 12:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>User has deleted the AfD notice<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_projects_considered_to_be_unusually_successful_in_science_and_engineering&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61689297" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_projects_considered_to_be_unusually_successful_in_science_and_engineering&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61689297" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and moved the article to List_of_projects_considered_to_be_unusually_successful_in_science_and_engineering<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_famous_successes_in_science_and_engineering&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61692090" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_famous_successes_in_science_and_engineering&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61692090" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Which is now worse. What's "usually"? Also, moving a page during AfD is bad form and so is removing the AFD notice. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 16:32, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> My issue is with the content, not the title. A change of title will not save this article from deletion for POV/NOR failure IMO. Please assume my comments apply to the new page(s). I would guess all other comments above should be considered the same way. The removal of AfD notice and this monkeying around seems to show a general contempt for the AfD process. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 16:41, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Even if the <b>title</b> of the article were appropriate, which I dispute as "usually" only makes it more POV, wiki is permitted to delete an article to restart if the content is inappropriate. I don't think there's any doubt that the content is amateur, unsourced, and essentially the opinions of one editor. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 16:53, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This list can never be anything other than subjective. Subjectivity is fine in articles, as long as they're attributed to people, but there's no evidence of that here. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 22:02, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
