<li><b><s>Delete</s></b> Don't think 'speedy as recreation' applies, since it was speedied before, not AfDed, but sources look slim, and it seems a fairly obvious ad (written in first-person, soliciting submissions, the usual) and might be speediable on those grounds. Biggest claim to fame seems to be an honorable mention (for which I note a quote is presented and not sourced).

<dd><b>Comment</b> The tone is better now, but the other problems still remain. Has this magazine been mentioned by any independent, third-party sources? The information about the award itself (as opposed to the magazine's receipt of it) doesn't belong -- it would on the UNESCO Prize for the Promotion of the Arts article, though (addition: if we had one...). And I remain unconvinced that an honorary mention makes this magazine noteworthy -- a reference to the award in an independent source (not UNESCO or Moondance, and not a reprint of a UNESCO or Moondance press release) would go a long way toward addressing this issue. Thank you for your efforts to address the issue, though; you've made a good start. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 01:42, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>More information (again) for article has just been added.</b> Still working to improve entirety. Please check newest version. In reference to noteworthiness of publication. The start date for the mag (1996) places it as one of the earliest serial online mag/journals. 187,000 readers per issue may have some merit also for this case. UNESCO gave web awards up to the year 2003... so current pages showing the award for 1999 (which applies here) are much harder to produce but might be found. I'm looking now. It is possible for me to contact UNESCO directly to get an email letter issued on this for your validation needs. Thanks for all your suggestions. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysanzia_8cb1.html" title="User:Lysanzia">Lysanzia</a> 06:33, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>Changing to <b>Weak Delete</b></s> -- it's a much better article, but I still see no independent sources. All of the links provided are to Moondance's site, except for one to UNESCO (referencing an UNESCO award -- so not independent for that purpose) and one to the IMDB (referencing the magazine's creator's former career, which doesn't seem relevant to the article -- and IMDB certainly doesn't mention the magazine). I would <b>support relisting</b> to allow extra time to find sources, because I see a good-faith effort is being made and I don't think a firm consensus has yet been reached, but without at least one independent source confirming the information, I'm afraid I can't&#160;!vote keep. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 07:55, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oops, I missed a couple of the links at the bottom. There are, in fact, a few more that are not to Moondance's site. However, none of them seem to actually mention Moondance. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 09:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A recreation should only be speedily deleted if it's substantially similar. That is not the case here; the page I deleted was very short and lacked sources, the page as it is now has neither of those problems. I'm not entirely happy with its layout (e.g. the list under 'readership' should be prose instead), but that's a matter of cleanup, not deletion. However, the weird thing is that I can't find mention of Moondance in any of the sources mentioned, except for the Unesco one (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Abrookes.ac.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Abrookes.ac.uk" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Anethistory.info" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Anethistory.info" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Azakon.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Azakon.org" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 09:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Moondance magazine Article Deletion -Revision</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Hi Radiant! Just added many external links to many university (collage level) sites that have this magazine listed in their cirriculum (most are Women's Studies Depts, some English Depts and a Political Science Consortium of 80 universities). I am pleasantly surprised so many universities are using this magazine in their classes.You can link over to review this at <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moondance_magazine.html" title="Moondance magazine">Moondance magazine</a>. I'm cleaning up and trying to improve all other aspects.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I'm impressed that it has been around for so long, but its Alexa ranking is over 2 million; I have a hard time believing it has the readership that it claims. Maybe it has that many "hits" per month, which could translate into maybe a tenth that many actual readers? Still reads like an advertisement. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 10:45, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

<li><b>Hi Guy, Thanks for taking a look at the article for <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moondance_magazine.html" title="Moondance magazine">Moondance magazine</a>. I have just added a large number of sources (embedded citations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Embedded_Citations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Embedded_Citations" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) for the magazine and its use in the public eye(spec. w/academia). The info added is a list of universities inside the U.S. and one in Spain that currently does use the quarterly in their their class cirriculum(s). When you said the article needed more "sources" not sure you had a chance to see this. If it's alright could you detail more comment info (in the AfD discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Moondance_magazine" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Moondance_magazine" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) about your needs that makes you want to delete this article? After I know more I can then adjust the material accordingly. Working now to closely meet all Wik standards.

<ul>
<li>Changing (again) to <b>Weak Keep</b>. I'm concerned that a lot of the new links look less like curriculum usage than like pages of links to websites vaguely related to women's studies. I'm not fully convinced that these pages are substantially significant. However, I'm willing to accept them for now -- as an indication of notability, all those listings do put it at least marginally above a random website. Would still very much like to see a solid secondary source, but I'm willing to err on the side of caution for now and revisit the matter in a couple of months if necessary. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 04:00, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. This looks like something that should be notable, because of the UNESCO honorable mention and the fact that a few university departments link to the magazine, but I'm not sure how we're supposed to write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article without <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable, independent</a> sources that have more than one line about this organization. The result is the article is based solely on the organization's website, and that isn't encyclopediadic. I mean, for all the Gender Studies departments listed that are linking to this page, no one has written anything about this?? Find one or two, and the case for keeping this gets stronger. - <a href="../../../a/a/g/User%7EAagtbdfoua_3bd2.html" title="User:Aagtbdfoua">Aagtbdfoua</a> 04:46, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
