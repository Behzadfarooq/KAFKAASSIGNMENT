<p><br />
MATRIX FUN FOODS is a third generation family run business starting in 1965 based in Melbourne Australia. They specialise in mobile ice cream and fun food catering, trading at shows events and at sites throughout Australia for over forty years. They are well renowned as the early pioneers of the 'Mr Whippy' concept through the mid 60's in Australia. During the last 40years they have built an enviable reputation for our professionalism and quality of service.</p>
<p>Matrix Fun Foods have set many performance benchmark throughout the evolution of the Mobile Ice Cream vending industry with our new and modern vans, innovative ideas and attitude. They were the first Australian mobile Ice-Cream business to fully design and build a mobile Smoothie &amp; Juice Van. We also were the first to introduce a healthy option menu with Low Fat Soft-Serve, Fat Free Gelato and health drinks. Matrix Fun Foods is the only Australian Mobile ice Cream Company to have received the pretigous 2005/2006 Melbourne Bayside Healthy Food Awards.</p>
<p>Recently in conjunction with 'Nestle Peters' they had the privilege of being part of the Commonwealth Games Queen's Baton Relay tour which covered well over 20,000km around Australia.</p>
<p>In their van line up, they have 3 beautifully restored Classic style Ice-Cream Vans from the early 70’s. These vans have been restored to their original condition. Preserving these old ice cream vans has taken real dedication, as few have survived, and finding any parts that are unique to these variants can be a real challenge.</p>

<p>Paris in Flames was a short-lived Litte Rock Arkansas spazcore band. They performed together throughout the summer of 2006, and recorded one live EP entitled "Paris in Flames - Live at Vino's," as well as an unreleased, unfinished three song demo recorded at the home of Jimi Gibbons. Band members included vocalist Brice Rosa, vocalist Garret Hollaway, guitarist Coby Tucker, bassist/vocalist Cameron Colebank, keyboardist Jake Geick, and drummer Nathan. Also temporarily in the band were second guitarist Travis and vocalist Ian Williford.</p>
<p><br />
PiF played several shows, using local metal venue Downtown Music as a springboard to eventually play shows at larger venues such as Vino's. They developed a cult following who were attracted to the band's trademark use of "the shocker," and their care-free "screw this" attitude.</p>
<p><br />
Their second show at Vino's was recorded and released as an EP; however, many band members panned this recording as being of a low quality, and not reflecting the sound of the band, as evidenced by the still-evolving guitar style of Coby Tucker and style of vocalist Brice Rosa. Sales of the EP were low, discouraging any further sales of recorded material. The unfinished demo was never completed, with the only copy of the vocal track being destroyed in a freak accident by vocalist Garret on the car-ride back into town. Original, non-vocal editions are rare, with only three known hard copies in existance.</p>

<p><br />
Ron Bauer began his magic training at age eleven in Portland, Oregon under the tutelage of Ted and Marie Hall, R. Vernon Cook, and Stan Payne of Star Magic. In his mid-teens, he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he was able to work part time as a professional magician, an actor in local radio, television, and live theater, and a disk jockey. Here he was fortunate enough to be guided by Jack Dean and Charles Aste, Jr. (at the time, illustrator for Ed Marlo). He was the first magician to appear on the two new television stations in Memphis, WMCT and WHBQ-TV. (These were the call letters in the fifties.)</p>
<p>In 1959, he married and moved to Detroit, Michigan to complete college. Instead, with the first of his two daughters on the way, he found a very active career as a professional magician and MC in clubs, and became the first full-time professional close-up magician in the Detroit area.</p>
<p>During this time, he belonged to the Society of Detroit Magicians, the Society of American Magicians, served as secretary of the Detroit IBM ring, and president of the Windsor Magic Circle in Ontario, Canada. Also, he began his training in marketing at Maxon Advertising, serving such national accounts as Gillette, Heinz, Pittsburgh Glass and Paint, LaChoy Chinese Foods, and General Electric.</p>
<p>For nearly a decade, beginning in 1968, he led an ensemble of magicians, clowns, puppeteers, and party planners in what developed into the largest and most successful children’s entertainment company in the Midwest (possibly anywhere), Mr. Trix Enterprises, with offices in the center of downtown Birmingham, Michigan.</p>
<p>In the late seventies, he wrote, produced, and marketed the first course in non-broadcast video production, which led him to working for Sony in California during the early eighties. In the mid-eighties, he authored several books on computing, including the best-selling Easy DOS It! (used by Alex Elmsley to learn the Microsoft operating system).</p>
<p>He’s still writing for the computer and video industries, but always finds time to contribute to the magic community. Some of his contributions can be found in Genii, The New Tops, The Linking Ring, and M-U-M magazines. He also contributed to such books as The New Modern Coin Magic, Kort, L.I.N.T., Daryl’s Ambitious Card Omnibus, Card Finesse II, Card Fixes, and a few others.</p>
<p>These days, Ron can be found heading up a group of young magicians at the Lake Orion Round Table meeting in Michigan. In this group Ron continues to help out any way that he can by teaching them and giving advice and helping them to become better at magic. Because of Ron’s background in theater, he is a great help to those who work very hard to become better at the magical art. Aside from the sleight of hand (of which Ron is a master), he concentrates on getting these young men to look at their presentation from all angles, as only one of theatrical background can. Also in attendance is Milt Kort, who rarely misses one of these weekly meetings. Ron is very committed to these young men and their admiration of Mr. Bauer, who is a legend in his own right, is quite obvious and well deserved.</p>

Ann Davison was the first woman to single-handedly sail the Atlantic, departing Plymoth, England, May 18, 1952, to ultimately land her 23 foot boat "Felicity Ann" in Barbados on January 18, 1953, at the age of 39. Her autobiographical account was published as "My Ship is So Small", following her first disastrous voyage with her husband, chronicled in her book "Last Voyage." The Felicity Ann, built in 1939, is currently in private possession in Seward, Alaska.</p>

<i>Kayea ferruginea</i> , belonging to Clusiaceae (or Guttiferae) family, was renamed as <i>Mesua ferruginea</i> and references from 1980s refer to <i>K. ferruginea</i> as <i>Mesua ferruginea</i> . It is a small riverine species. The distrubition of this species has been recorded (Ridley, 1922) in Eastern Johore, Sungei Endau southwards, Pahang, Ayer Etam, Kelantan, Temangan and far ranging Andamans. The fruits are 6 cm across, enveloped in four loose leathery fleshy sepals. Flowers found in short, axillary panicals and leaves are elliptic of 8 x 3 to 12 x 4.5 cm size. The local or common name referred to as Sembawang tree in a paper (Ridley and Curtis, 1897) and thus comes the name of a park in northern shore of Singapore - [Sembawang Park]<a href="http://www.nparks.gov.sg/nparks_cms/display_park.asp?parkid=20" class="external text" title="http://www.nparks.gov.sg/nparks_cms/display_park.asp?parkid=20" rel="nofollow">Sembawang Park</a> .</p>

<p>Met-enkephalin is an endogenous opioid receptor agonist produced by the adrenal gland which probably secretes it in response to stress. It was discovered, along with leu-enkephalin, from brain extracts in 1974 by groups in England and Sweden. It is believed that it acts on both mu and kappa opioid receptors in the CNS. It is also believed that the enkephalins act very similar to morphine but have more potent effects.</p>

<p>FRATRES LUCIS Unmasked (Desmascarada) or No llores por mí Argentina (*)</p>
<p>De tempos em tempos o mundo Iniciático se depara com sua terrível sombra, a contra-Iniciação que nos dias atuais escolheu mais uma vez o idioma espanhol para fazer as suas vítimas.</p>
<p>Não é de hoje que ela, a contra-Iniciação, "fala" em espanhol e se alastra como uma verdadeira praga; no passado tivemos, por exemplo, o egóico colombiano Samael Aun Weor que com seu fanatismo e seu culto a si mesmo como um Mestre infalível levou muitos aos hospícios.</p>
<p>Da mesma forma que a Iniciação se adapta ao seu contexto histórico, a contra-Iniciação assim também o faz, e contrariando o mundo profano onde os hermanos paraguaios são os grandes falsificadores do continente latino, a maior charlatanice do momento no mundo do Esoterismo vem de um país devastado por crises econômicas, um "país encardido" como diria Galvão Bueno.</p>
<p>Alejandro Silvani, mais conhecido através de seu forjado título de "Frater Lucis" FIDUCIUS, ex-mestre da Loja Rosacruz Buenos Aires&#160;? AMORC sem dúvida alguma é um grande estudante e conhecedor do cenário Esotérico, mas por outro lado desde a sua invenção "Ordo Fratres Lucis" há aproximadamente cinco anos atrás se transformou - ainda que indiretamente - no grande mentor do vazamento eletrônico de materiais privativos de várias Ordens, e por conseqüência direta de sua criação o mais novo representante da contra-Iniciação em um milênio que está só começando; é bem verdade que alguns ibéricos poderiam até mesmo quem sabe concorrer com ele, mas a "obra" de FIDUCIUS é por demais notória. A exemplo de Adolf Hitler que estimulou seus seguidores a praticarem aquele gesto de saudação particular, criando e alimentando assim sua própria Egrégora, FIDUCIUS ao inventar a sua própria e esdrúxula saudação "S+R+P+C" faz com que diariamente assinantes de várias listas de discussões sejam bombardeados com a "marca da besta". Com a ajuda da internet, a facilidade do idioma espanhol estando presente em vários países e com o auxílio de fiéis seguidores como o recém-desmascarado "Frater Lucis" Coruja do Norte, a contra- Iniciática "Ordo Fratres Lucis" faz sucesso e adquire em média de 10 a 30 novos membros por mês.</p>
<p>Em primeiríssima mão, vocês da Lista Martinistas e Martinezistas irão conhecer uma história furada que deu certo, e que deu certo graças à falta de questionamento por parte de alguns e por interesses pessoais por parte de outros; irão saber os métodos de arrebanhar membros pelos "Fratres Lucis", suas táticas subversivas de subtrair materiais privativos de várias Ordens e poderão concluir que a contra-Iniciação se disfarça com palavras fraternas, palavras como 'Muy Querido Hermano'.</p>
<p><br />
UMA ORDEM CONTRA-INICIÁTICA</p>
<p>Segundo René Guénon, um dos mais conceituados e aceitos autores quando o assunto diz respeito à Tradição juntamente com os critérios da Iniciação, bem como outros autores - e certamente aqueles que nos lêem não terão nenhum problema em reconhecer como verdadeiros determinados critérios -, é preciso que exista uma Transmissão (Depósito) na Ordem que se pretende Iniciática ocorrendo de um Iniciador para um Iniciado em alguma Cerimônia ou outro tipo de Transmissão, MAS QUE SEJA DE FORMA PESSOAL, COM INICIADOR E INICIADO PRESENTES FISICAMENTE.</p>
<p>A "Ordo Fratres Lucis" ao ser tirada da "cartola mágicka" de FIDUCIUS que achou bonito o nome Fratres Lucis e resolveu se apropriar dele, nunca recebeu NENHUMA TRANSMISSÃO PESSOAL. Mas foi algo que deu certo enquanto empreendimento "virtual" e por conseqüência recebeu o reconhecimento de um suposto antigo Frater Lucis que teria emitido uma Carta-Patente em favor de FIDUCIUS, porém, segundo pessoas próximas a FIDUCIUS tal Carta-Patente foi apenas mais uma jogada do Charlatón em um momento que sentiu salutar tentar provar a sua suposta autoridade.</p>
<p>O próprio FIDUCIUS reconhece publicamente que apenas recebeu a Carta- Patente, mas que NUNCA ESTEVE PESSOALMENTE COM O EMISSOR. Ora, que podemos concluir disso até aqui? É muito simples, até aqui temos uma Ordem que não possui nenhuma Transmissão Iniciática e que foi forjada através de supostos documentos.</p>
<p>Mas o que torna a "Ordo Fratres Lucis" uma Ordem definitivamente contra-Iniciática é o fato de seus principais responsáveis estarem CIENTES do que foi exposto acima e ainda sim ESTAREM TRANSMITINDO FALSAS INICIAÇÕES, SENDO QUE ELES PRÓPRIOS NUNCA RECEBERAM ABSOLUTAMENTE NADA NO MESMO SENTIDO. A "Ordo Fratres Lucis" já conta com algo em torno de 40 Lojas pelo mundo transmitindo (ou em 'stand- by'), REPETIMOS, FALSAS INICIAÇÕES. Este cenário descrito é, por conseqüência, uma AUTÊNTICA CONTRA-INICIAÇÃO E NÃO HÁ DESCULPAS, pois estão CIENTES de suas mentiras e ainda sim transmitem FALSAS INICIAÇÕES como se fossem verdadeiras. FIDUCIUS sabe disso e sabe da necessidade de estar pessoalmente com o suposto Emissor de sua Carta- Patente e ele próprio planeja em um futuro se encontrar com o tal. Enquanto isso não ocorrer é inadmissível que uma "Ordem" nestas condições continue a se espalhar e a transmitir supostas Iniciações.</p>
<p>Fechando este tópico, precisamos dizer que não é nosso propósito neste artigo fazer uma análise da Simbologia da "Ordo Fratres Lucis", mas ao bom observador dois pontos chamam a atenção e são dignos de risos. O primeiro deles diz respeito aos princípios desta "Ordem" que são, a saber: Luz, Vida, Amor, Liberdade, Igualdade e Fraternidade, estando mais do que evidente que isto é uma invenção, FIDUCIUS simplesmente misturou princípios da AMORC com os princípios da Maçonaria. O segundo é em relação ao Sol que é usado pelos "Fratres Lucis" em seus Templos e vestimentas e que por coincidência ou não, é o mesmíssimo Sol da bandeira Argentina, indicando com isto possivelmente o caráter nacionalista desta "Ordem" que pretende se espalhar pelo mundo, o próprio Diploma que os membros da "Ordo Fratres Lucis" recebem faz lembrar a bandeira Argentina.</p>
<p><br />
A FRATERNIDADE É AZUL E BRANCA</p>
<p>'Muy Querido Hermano', com essas palavras fraternas escritas em um teclado e enviadas através de uma conexão à internet, o argentino Silvani (FIDUCIUS) conquista membros ao redor do mundo para a sua organização. Bom e eficiente atendimento, palavras fraternas o tempo todo, materiais gratuitos aos domingos em sua caixa de e-mail, direito a ter um nome místico antecedido pelas iniciais F.'.L.'. ou S.'.L.'. e a pomposa saudação "S+R+P+C", tudo isso somado a possibilidade de se receber uma suposta Iniciação são os grandes diferenciais que tem atraído cada vez mais incautos para a "Ordo Fratres Lucis".</p>
<p>FIDUCIUS, com esta metodologia tem feito escola, sua corja de fiéis seguidores segue exatamente seu estilo comportamental, dificilmente você encontrará na internet um 100% "Frater Lucis" falando mal de alguém, pelo contrário, para os "Fratres Lucis" é tudo uma grande irmandade e todos são bem tratados sempre e de forma fraternal. Com tanta gentileza quem ousará imaginar que a contra-Iniciação está justamente aí??? Receptivos e meigos, os "Fratres Lucis" estão sempre antenados no que está ocorrendo na internet - seu principal veículo e a base da "Ordem" -, eles não hesitam em puxar assunto com alguém que demonstre algum conhecimento e abertura a eles. Logo eles falam de si, afirmam ser membros de diversas outras Ordens, o próprio FIDUCIUS sempre assina com seus graus de acordo com o tema da conversa, ou seja, se o assunto é Maçonaria ele mostra seus graus no M.'.M.'.; se é Rosacruz, ele faz uso do 'FRC' se "apoiando" na AMORC e mais recentemente passou vergonha ao afirmar que era SII de uma Ordem Martinista que não existe e cujo Diploma lhe foi conferido via correio por outro Charlatón, o pseudo-Sâr Camael.</p>
<p>Os "Fratres Lucis" quando percebem que sua potencial vítima leva jeito fazem chegar até ela uma tonelada de informações e possibilidades, e é claro, seduzido como foi, fatalmente irá ingressar na "Augusta" "Ordo Fratres Lucis". "Iniciações", fraternidade, os "Fratres Lucis" tem tudo isso para lhe oferecer e muito mais. "Ligue jáá"...</p>
<p><br />
OS MATERIAIS E RITUAIS SUBTRAÍDOS</p>
<p>FIDUCIUS lançou moda ao enviar instruções de sua "Ordem" via e-mail, uma moda que meia década depois começa a apresentar mais frutos podres e nocivos do que uma boa colheita.</p>
<p>No mês passado, o carioca "Frater Lucis" Coruja do Norte - principal "laranja" de FIDUCIUS no Brasil - foi desmascarado distribuindo indiscriminadamente uma série de materiais privativos de algo em torno de vinte (20) Ordens, entre elas: AMO, OMCC, OM&amp;S, OTO- A, RER, Memphis-Misraim, Carbonária, The Holy Grail, Igreja Gnóstica Spiritualis, Igreja Gnóstica Joanita, Igreja Gnóstica Católica Latina, Elus Cohen, Igreja Expectante, Orden de la Paloma y del Grial, Alexandria Institute of Advanced Spiritual Studies, Sociedade de Ciências Antigas, Center for the Study and Research of the Humam Spiritual Potential.</p>
<p>Como se isto já não fosse o bastante, além da distribuição administrativamente ilícita de materiais, os "Fratres Lucis" tem o hábito de realizar "Iniciações" com base nos Rituais que conseguem via internet através de outras pessoas e a partir daí acreditam estarem iniciados e então saem a exibir seus graus pela internet. O próprio FIDUCIUS com suas respostas e colocações bonitinhas e fraternas em relação à Iniciação consegue enganar muitos Buscadores e repetimos, FAZ ESCOLA.</p>
<p>O esquema corrupto dos "Fratres Lucis" - que já começa a ser desmantelado graças à ação exímia de pessoas treinadas em contra- espionagem, entre outras Artes - consiste em se aproximar do máximo de pessoas possíveis que possam fornecer a eles materiais de diversas Ordens.</p>
<p>Juramentos Iniciáticos não existem para os "Fratres Lucis", eles "acreditam" que já são Adeptos e ao fazer amizade com eles a vítima recebe materiais de várias Ordens. Porém, tudo tem seu preço, e em troca a vítima é fortemente encorajada a scannear e a xerocar todos os materiais que tem em sua posse e enviar a eles, logicamente, eles primeiro perguntam tudo o que a pessoa tem e começam a escolher o que lhes interessa, realizando assim um troca-troca virtual de materiais, uma verdadeira "suruba" literária que deixaria Mr. Crowley - que em sua época divulgou materiais da Golden Dawn - comendo poeira e morrendo de inveja! Não são apenas materiais que interessam aos "Fratres Lucis", mas também Diplomas de Iniciações para realizarem falsificações com base neles e depois se colocarem como "Iniciados" na tal Ordem do Diploma e chegam até mesmo a enviar seus Diplomas falsos para impressionar as suas vítimas. Como disse alguém em certa lista uma outra vez: "quando algo não tem valor é preciso deixar à mostra para outros ver e invejar, e através da cobiça alheia passa então a ter algum valor, pois se alguém quer, então deve valer alguma coisa", e isto tem um nome: vampirismo.</p>
<p>É graças a este comportamento "Frater Lucis" que temos visto nos últimos tempos tantas pessoas na internet colocando Graus e mais Graus ao lado de seus nomes, é graças a este lixo do Esoterismo chamado "Fratres Lucis" que temos visto tantos supostos iniciados em várias Ordens. E é graças a esta porcaria inventada por alguém que deveria ir dançar Tango na falta do que fazer que mais e mais Ordens estão se fechando.</p>

<p>Thomas Melville is an interesting person in his own right, apart from being the Grandfather of Herman Melville, author of several books . The most famous today being Moby Dick which I beleive he got a lot of information about whaling &amp; the Whaling Enderby's from sitting on the knee of his grandfather &amp; listening to his tales. Thomas Melville steps onto the pages of History by being one of the Mohicans at the Boston Tea Party, during the war of Revolution of the British Colonies he is a Major in the Rebel Army. After the war he is for a time the Harbour Master at Boston Mass. In 1790 he is sailing as captain for Enderby &amp; Sons, of Pauls Wharf, London, who were the spokesperson to the British Government on Whaling &amp; trans Atlantic shipping. Two of the three ships at the Tea Party were Enderby ships! Before the war British shipping included American.Most of the Boston Whalers before the war were owned by British concerns.</p>

DJ Rave-a-thon is not actually a DJ. DJ Rave-a-thon is infact an inside joke that has become wide spread refrence through out the northwest electronic music scene. "DJ Rave-a-thon" is actually a derogatory remark, in regards to a DJ whom is not very good at what they do, or does very selfish, often obnoxious things. It was first coined at a venue entitled the cool school, in Portland Oregon. As the venue was closing, and everyone was relaxing and enjoying the silence, a less than talented DJ Decided it would be a good time to turn the music back on, turn the sound system up as loud as it goes, and play happy hardcore. No one at the time enjoyed this DJ doing such a thing, and so everyone left, while the dj continued to blast music for just himself. This DJ (whom shall go un-named) was from there on out jokingly refered to as "DJ Rave-a-thon".</p>
<p>The term "DJ Rave-a-thon" has mutliple uses, and the definition is loose at best. The closest depiction of a "DJ Rave-a-thon" is a DJ, whom is not good at what they do, but is convinced otherwise, and is convinced their music surpasses personal choice, and is the epicenter of the universe at any given time they play it. DJ Rave-a-thon is often jokingly placed on time slot sheets for raves, from 6 to 6:03 am. This references the original "DJ Rave-a-thon:, whom believed his musical choice surpass the rest of the worlds desire to sit down and be able to hold a conversation after a long night of music.</p>
<p><br />
DJ's will often be refered to as DJ Rave-a-thon, when they deliver horrible live performanecs, alongside an obnoxiously over the top stage presence. DJ's are also refered to as being "DJ rave-a-thon" when they play music at ungodly hours, as loud as possible, with no regard for talent, or the actual desire of those around them to hear the music. For example, some one whom was a "DJ Rave-a-thon" would enter a room where no one wanted to hear music, play the most obnoxious rave anthem he could find, and then yell over the music that everyone should begin to dance... even on a sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Heiner Erke designed a fascinating world of unique balance sculptures. The stony beach of Cap des Falco Ibiza (Big Brother Italy) became a wonderful sculpture landscape.</p>
<p>The fascination of Heiner Erke´s stone sculptures consists of placing the stones precisely point to point on top of each other, without any aid whatsoever. The stones have not been treated and the balance results from the gravity of the stones selected.</p>
<p>Heiner Erke (48) first started creating balance sculptures when he was 16 out of stones on the banks of Bavarian rivers and at Lake Constance.</p>
<p>Since 1976 Heiner Erke has regularly balanced the gravity of large stones at striking locations around the globe. So far there have been more than 120 balance events world-wide at which Heiner Erke repeatedly challenges people to copy him or to help with his sculpture landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Heiner Erke produces graphics, acrylic paintings and chill-out sound collages around the theme of balance. When not designing his artistic creations Heiner Erke operates as a media and communication expert and advises renowned personalities, companies and institutions world-wide.</p>
<p>All proceeds from the sales of his graphics, pictures and image rights and events go to charitable purposes such as The United Nations Children's Fund - UNICEF, or HelpAge Sri Lanka.</p>

Anna got her start in Moscow. Rebelling from her traditional family's ballet customs, Anna took to the sword. As Laura describes it, she found that Anna had, on a cold winter day, typical to Russia's harsh winter season, mangled a everyday wire hanger into something that closely resembled a sword. Laura screamed, "AN-na, put that down! that's dangerous and may harm your Russian brothers and sisters. Why can't you just put on some dancing shoes and stick to tradition!" This was only the beginning of the rebellion that would soon become Anna's craft. Finally Laura, Bob and even little Michael could not deny her of her passion and Anna soon was able to trade her mangled wire hanger for a metal saber. Though Anna's parents had struggled to become amateur ballerinas, Anna mastered her art almost instantly. The way she handled her sword was reminscent of the way Picasso handled his paintbrush or the way Babe Ruth maneuvered his baseball bat. Anna competed all over Europe, slashing her way through countries and counties. It was so clear that the sword and her left hand were a perfect fit. She became one of the few left handed sword fighters of her day, reigning top tier in a field of all right handers. Anna fought through the hardships of tradition, poverty and the pressures of a Russian family and a left handed tendency to become a master sword fighter.</p>

<p>196.27.76.110 10:39, 16 August 2006 (UTC) The Cretan pictograph or Minoan pictograph came from the Moan civilization that existed on the Mediterranean island of Cretan picture symbols were used as early as 2500B.C. About 135 surviving pictographs included figures, arms, other parts of the body, animals, plants and some geographic symbols. Although the visual similarity between Cretan pictograph and early alphabet characters is striking, many palaeographers question whether Cretans pictographs were the wellspring for the alphabet.</p>

<p>Lowbie is a term used often in the context of computer games. A person who is a lowbie isn't necessarily a new player but instead is more commonly a person who has a higher level character and created a new charatacter. It is not considered an insult unless and insult preceedes the lowbie term. example: "You stupid lowbies never understand." - insult "Yeah this is my lowbie I just made him today" - non-insulting.</p>

<p>Fortis Healthcare was established in 1996 by the promoters of Ranbaxy Laboratories, among the world's top 10 generic companies, also India's largest pharma company. Founded by the late Dr. Parvinder Singh, the architect of Ranbaxy's growth, Fortis is driven by the founder's vision of "creating a world-class integrated healthcare delivery system in India, entailing the finest medical skills combined with compassionate patient care".</p>
<p>Fortis hospitals are benchmarked to International standards - achieving quality through the relentless adherence to the protocols observed in some of the world's leading hospitals.</p>
<p>Our founder envisioned a world-class healthcare delivery system 'as a larger-than-life concept. A privilege for the many, rather than the preserve of a few'.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, Fortis has initiated several outreach initiatives.</p>
<p>Top Fortis specialists hold outstation OPDs deep in the North Indian heartland. Already over 50 towns in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu &amp; Kashmir have been covered.</p>
<p>Free health camps and clinics in outlying towns are part of the effort to extend the benefits of specialist treatment to the masses.</p>
<p>The 'Friends of Fortis' initiative is redefining the doctor-patient relationship. Fortis surgeons visit previously operated patients in far-flung towns to offer valuable follow-up advice at relaxed social get-togethers.</p>
<p>An ambitious Tele-medicine venture is establishing connectivity with community doctors across North India. It forms a vital bridge, enabling access, to the expert knowledge of our specialists at our Centres of Excellence. The Fortis Foundation aims to set up a corpus of funds that will enable critically ill patients from the deprived segments of society to access world-class medical care.</p>
<p>Our compassionate care springs from the heart and knows no boundaries.</p>

<b>Surgeries abroad - Fortis</b></p>
<p>India is fast becoming the world's first choice destination for Surgery services. With rapidly expanding infrastructure, clinical expertise and international standard implementation, India is servicing the healthcare needs of international patients from around the world.</p>
<p><b>Cardiac Surgery</b></p>
<p>Director-<b>Cardiology</b> at <b>Fortis Hospital</b> Noida. Dr. Kaul is an MD Medicine (1975) and a DM Cardiology (1978) from Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi. His Post Graduation training in Interventional Cardiology was obtained in Australia under the aegis of the Australian Post Graduate Federation of Medicine in 1983-84. During his long and distinguished career as a Clinician, Researcher and Teacher, Dr. Kaul has held several coveted responsibilities. He has been on the faculty of G.B Pant Hospital, New Delhi, PGIMER, Chandigarh and was Professor of Cardiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. He joins Fortis after a very successful innings at Batra Hospital, New Delhi where he held the post of Director, Interventional Cardiology and Cardiac Electrophysiology.</p>
<p>Amongst the earliest pioneers in coronary interventions in India, Dr Kaul introduced several new techniques in this discipline. He is an active member of several professional bodies, has participated in and conducted numerous live interventional cardiology demonstrations at National and International meets. He is on the faculty of several prestigious universities in the USA, Europe, Far East, China and Australia. Dr. Kaul ia a past President of the Cardiological Society of India and is currently the Vice President of the SAARC Cardiac Society. He is the recipient of the Dr. BC Roy Award for 'Developing Specialities' for the year 1999 and has more than 450 publications to his credit.</p>

<b>Joint Replacement with Minimum Invasive Technique</b></p>
<p>Ten thousand steps a day. That's approximately how far you walk everyday. But if, like millions of people, you find walking painful or you fear your joints might buckle beneath you, each step might as well be a mile.</p>
<p>Your knees and hips are your largest joints, and they support your body's weight while allowing your legs to move freely. Even walking at a leisurely pace puts a force that is double your body weight on each leg. Running or descending stairs quadruples that force. According to health surveys, hip and knee pain is on the rise in older Indians. Almost one in four women and one in five men experience significant and persistent knee pain.</p>
<p>Both knees and hips are subject to repetitive trauma, wear and tear as you age. For many people, these problems become so intractable that the best solution is to replace a worn-out knee or hip with an artificial joint.</p>
<p>Medical care has changed in recent decades. Doctors used to treat many knee problems by immobilizing the joint with a plaster cast. Weeks of immobilization causes the muscles to weaken and shorten, resulting in long-lasting stiffness and poor function. Today, you can wake up from surgery with your knee already being gently bent and straightened by a machine. In addition, knee and hip replacements have freed thousands of patients from life in a wheelchair or crutches.</p>
<p>The Orthopaedic Department at Fortis Hospital consists of a team of highly experienced and leading consultants. All of them are well known in their respective fields. Surgical techniques are the most advanced at FORTIS NOIDA. The orthopaedic department routinely undertakes management of recent, old, neglected and failed fractures with previous surgeries. Reconstructive procedures are also done post-deformity. The consultants specialize in Arthroscopy &amp; Joint replacement using conventional and minimum invasive techniques.</p>
<p>Arthroscopic surgery is performed through tiny incisions using an arthroscopy and most patients are discharged on the same day. They mobilize much earlier and recover much faster. Injuries for knees and shoulders especially in sports persons (recreational or professional) are mostly managed with arthroscopic surgery, allowing patients to return to active sports much quicker.</p>
<p>Arthoplasty a difficult ands complex undertaking, requiring special instruments, implants and skill, are undertaken regularly. Joint replacements are carried out using conventional and minimum invasive techniques.</p>
<p>Partial and total hip replacement, Unicondylar, Total knee replacement, Revisions (redo), shoulder and knee replacements are done by the specialists.</p>
<p>A separate orthopaedic surgical ICU has been created to give undivided attention to orthopaedic patients. The OT complex consists of a Lamellar flow, video monitoring, recording, and projection system. It has dedicated recovery rooms and pre-surgery rooms.</p>
<p>And finally, prevention has moved to centre stage, alongside surgical repair and rehabilitation. More aggressive treatment of osteoporosis can reduce the risk of hip fractures. Better training practices can help prevent common knee injuries. Strength training added to your daily exercise routine, helps support the joints and protect them from injury.</p>
<p><b>Laparoscopic Anterior Resection For Carcinoma Recto Sigmoid</b></p>

<p>An Essay on Hypocrisy By Timothy McVeigh</p>
<p>The administration has said that Iraq has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons ("weapons of mass destruction") -- mainly because they have used them in the past.</p>
<p>Well, if that's the standard by which these matters are decided, then the U.S. is the nation that set the precedent. The U.S. has stockpiled these same weapons (and more) for over 40 years. The U.S. claims that this was done for deterrent purposes during the "Cold War" with the Soviet Union. Why, then is it invalid for Iraq to claim the same reason (deterrence) -- with respect to Iraq's (real) war with, and the continued threat of, its neighbor Iran?</p>
<p>The administration claims that Iraq has used these weapons in the past. We've all seen the pictures that show a Kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons. But, have you ever seen these pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from Hiroshima or Nagasaki?</p>
<p>I suggest that one study the histories of World War I, World War II and other "regional conflicts" that the U.S. has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of "weapons of mass destruction."</p>
<p>Remember Dresden? How about Hanoi? Tripoli? Baghdad? What about the big ones -- Hiroshima and Nagasaki? (At these two locations, the U.S. killed at least 150,000 non-combatants -- mostly women and children -- in the blink of an eye. Thousands more took hours, days, weeks, or months to die.)</p>
<p>If Saddam is such a demon, and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation, why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of "mass destruction" -- like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above?</p>
<p>The truth is, the U.S. has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy when it comes to death of children? In Oklahoma City, it was family convenience that explained the presence of a day-care center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building. Yet when discussion shifts to Iraq, any day-care center in a government building instantly becomes "a shield." Think about that.</p>
<p>(Actually, there is a difference here. The administration has admitted to knowledge of the presence of children in or near Iraqi government buildings, yet they still proceed with their plans to bomb -- saying that they cannot be held responsible if children die. There is no such proof, however, that knowledge of the presence of children existed in relation to the Oklahoma City bombing.)</p>
<p>When considering morality and mens rea [criminal intent] in light of these facts, I ask: Who are the true barbarians?</p>
<p>Yet another example of this nation's blatant hypocrisy is revealed by the polls which suggest that this nation is greatly in favor of bombing Iraq.</p>
<p>In this instance, the people of the nation approve of bombing government employees because they are "guilty by association" -- they are Iraqi government employees. In regard to the bombing in Oklahoma City, however, such logic is condemned.</p>
<p>What motivates these seemingly contradictory positions? Do people think that government workers in Iraq are any less human than those in Oklahoma City? Do they think that Iraqis don't have families who will grieve and mourn the loss of their loved ones? In this context, do people come to believe that the killing of foreigners is somehow different than the killing of Americans?</p>
<p>I recently read of an arrest in New York City where possession of a mere pipe bomb was charged as possession of a "weapon of mass destruction." If a two pound pipe bomb is a "weapon of mass destruction," then what do people think that a 2,000-pound steel-encased bomb is?</p>
<p>I find it ironic, to say the least, that one of the aircraft that could be used to drop such a bomb on Iraq is dubbed "The Spirit of Oklahoma."</p>
<p>When a U.S. plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people, this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise. What a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the morality of killing is not so superficial. The truth is, the use of a truck, a plane, or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself.</p>
<p>These are weapons of mass destruction -- and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons.</p>
<p>Whether you wish to admit it or not, when you approve, morally, of the bombing of foreign targets by the U.S. military, you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in Oklahoma City. The only difference is that this nation is not going to see any foreign casualties appear on the cover of Newsweek magazine.</p>
<p>It seems ironic and hypocritical that an act viciously condemned in Oklahoma City is now a "justified" response to a problem in a foreign land. Then again, the history of United States policy over the last century, when examined fully, tends to exemplify hypocrisy.</p>
<p>When considering the use of weapons of mass destruction against Iraq as a means to an end, it would be wise to reflect on the words of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. His words are as true in the context of Olmstead as they are when they stand alone: "Our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example."</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Timothy J. McVeigh</p>

<p>The Very Special Guests (VSG) are a 5 piece pop/rock band from North London consisting of lead singer Kieran Lynch, Bassist Adrian Moore, Drummer Bobby Davies and guitarists Jon Collard and Ant Roberts. They formed in 2004 and quickly began touring the London club circuit playing their blend of groove based rock, pop and funk fused by their own devilishly catchy songs.</p>
<p>Thanks to their guitar style, bass and drum led grooves and charismatic singer, they inevitably drew comparisons to bands such as the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_Roses_9a01.html" title="Stone Roses">Stone Roses</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Mondays_fd45.html" title="Happy Mondays">Happy Mondays</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primal_Scream_627b.html" title="Primal Scream">Primal Scream</a>. They currently have two EPs in circulation, 2005's 'GuestSlot' consisting of 3 tracks - Gotta Get Out of Here, Shine Alone and Factory; and 2006's 'Union', consisting of You Should Know and Union. Their highlights to date include headline slots at some of London's most reputable music venues such as The Metro, The Hope and Anchor and The Bull and Gate. They are continually playing the London circuit and information on the band, as well as sound clips and CD requests can be found here at <a href="http://www.veryspecialguests.co.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.veryspecialguests.co.uk" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and here at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/veryspecialguests" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.myspace.com/veryspecialguests" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>After the storming of the Bastille Jail on July 17, 1789, a mass uproar spread from Paris to the countryside. Noble families were attacked by hunger-driven peasants and the aristocratic manors were burnt. Abbeys and castles were attacked and destroyed. The peers started to emigrate to the cities of France, and incidents of brigandage multiplied by the moment. The season was of ‘La Grande Peur’ (the Great Fear) --- a period of social hysteria and anxiety over who was going to be the next victim of a faceless mob of cruel debauchers. What they failed to understand was that the violence that started the Great Fear (in most cases) was begun not by homeless people but by settled countrymen who took this opportunity to further their own cause.</p>
<p>The Great Fear opened up the vulnerable nature of the French Government--- there was a lack of authority at the very centre of it. The prolonged riots and massacres led to the general anxiety that things might get out of control… and it did. Seigneurial game was the main target of these rioters. It was an experience that the country had never undergone before.</p>
<p>By late July 1789, as the peasant revolt reports poured into Paris from every part of the country, the National Assembly of France decided to reform the social pattern of the country in order to pacify the outraged peasants and encourage them towards peace and harmony. The discussion continued through the night of the fourth of August, and on the morning of the fifth the National Assembly abolished the Feudal System, and eliminated many clerical and noble priviledges. The August decrees were finally completed a week later.</p>
<p><br />
The Decrees</p>
<p>Article One – The National Assembly declared the feudal system abolished thereafter. Within the “existing rights and dues, both feudal and censuel(This refers to the cens, a perpetual due similar to the payments made by English copyholders), all those originating in or representing real or personal serfdom shall be abolished without indemnification.” [1] All other dues were redeemable, but the terms and mode of redemption was to be fixed by the National Assembly. Those dues that were not removed by this decree were to be collected as usual until indemnification took place.</p>
<p>Article Two – The exclusive rights to allow birds to graze and dovecotes were abolished. The pigeons were to be confined during the period mentioned by the community, because during that time, they would be looked upon as fair game and anyone would have the right to kill them on their own land.</p>
<p>Article Three – The exclusive rights of keeping unenclosed warrens were abolished as well. Every landowner shall have the rights to destroy all kinds of game in their own land. However, public safety regulations must be maintained by them. All hunting spaces, including the royal forest, and all hunting rights were similarly abolished as well. There were provisions made for the king’s hunting, however, for his personal pleasure in it. The president of the Assembly was commissioned to ask of the king the release of those people who were sent to prison or exiled for the violation of the previously existing hunting rights.</p>
<p>Article Four – All the Manorial Courts were suppressed, but the judges and other officials of justice were allowed to continue with their duties until further instructions from the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Article Five – Any kind of tithes, as well as any substitution for them were abolished. Whosoever possessed them,“…secular or regular congregations, by holders of benefices, members of corporations (including the Order of Malta and other religious and military orders), as well as those devoted to the maintenance of churches, those impropriated to lay persons, and those substituted for the portion congrue[This expression refers to the minimum remuneration fixed for the priests], are abolished, on condition, however, that some other method be devised to provide for the expenses of divine worship, the support of the officiating clergy, for the assistance of the poor, for repairs and rebuilding of churches and parsonages, and for the maintenance of all institutions, seminaries, schools, academies, asylums, and organizations to which the present funds are devoted.”[2] Until these provisions were made, the National Assembly allowed the priests to collect the tithes. All the other tithes, which were not abolished under this law, were to be collected as usual.</p>
<p>Article Six – All sorts of ground rents were redeemable at a price the National Assembly fixed. No dues were to be created in the future that was irredeemable.</p>
<p>Article Seven – Selling judicial and municipal offices were abolished. Justice should be dispensed freely. However, all such magistrates were to do their duty until further instructions from the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Article Eight – As soon as the portion congrue was increased, the fees of all parish priests and curates were abolished.</p>
<p>Article Nine – Fiscal priviledges in the payment of taxes were abolished forever. Taxes were to be collected from all the citizens, in exactly the same manner, and plans were to be considered to set up a new method of tax collection.</p>
<p>Article Ten – All particular priviledges given to certain provinces, district, cities, cantons and communes, financial or otherwise, were abolished because under the new rules, every part of France was equal.</p>
<p>Article Eleven – All citizens, no matter what class or birth he might be, were eligible for any office in civil and military service.</p>
<p>Article Twelve – No allowances were to be made for “…annates or for any other purpose to the court of Rome, the vice legation at Avignon, or to the nunciature at Lucerne.”[3] The clergy should apply to their bishops for financial donations and benefits, which shall be given free to any church of France.</p>
<p>Article Thirteen – Various ecclesiastical dues were thereby abolished by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Article Fourteen – The revenue limited to the clergies were restricted to the sum of three thousand livres. Any individual could not enjoy the benefits of several pensions at the same time, if the pensions that he already enjoyed was more than three thousand livres.</p>
<p>Article Fifteen – The King and the National Assembly would together consider all the reports that were to be presented with regards to pensions, favors and salaries, and would have a right to suppress or reduce that which was undeserved.</p>
<p>Article Sixteen – A Medal was to be struck in the memory of the important deliberations for the welfare of France, and “…a Te Deum shall be chanted in gratitude in all the parishes and the churches of France.”[4]</p>
<p>Article Seventeen – King Louis XVI was proclaimed the Restorer of French Liberty.</p>
<p>Article Eighteen – The National Assembly was to present itself as a body before the king and submit this important set of decrees, and Te Deum was to be sung in the chapel of the king.</p>
<p>Article Nineteen – As soon as possible, the National Assembly was to give grave consideration to the drawing up of the laws that would be help carry out these decrees.</p>
<p><br />
The Impact of the Decrees</p>
<p>The August Decrees were declared with the idea of calming down the populace and encouraging them towards civility. However, the August Decrees revised itself over and over again during the next two years. King Louis XVI, in a letter, on the one hand expressed deep satisfaction with “…the noble and generous demarche of the first two orders of the state…” who, according to him had “…made great sacrifices for the general reconciliation, for their patrie and for their king.” On the other hand, he went on to say that though the “…sacrifices were fine, I cannot admire it; I will never consent to the despolitan of my clergy and my nobility… I will never give my sanction to the decrees that despoil them, for then the French people one day could accuse me of injustice or weakness.”[5] What Louis was concerned with was not with the loss of position of the French nobility and clergy, but with adequate reparation for this loss. But his phraseology showed his inability to accept the concept of all men being equal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the August Decrees paved the way for the National Assembly to make the Declaration of the Rights of Man. It brought forward the first concrete steps towards Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.</p>

<p>Moffett attempted a political comeback in 1986 seeking to gain the Democratic nomination over incumbent Governor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_O%27Neill_3490.html" title="William O'Neill">William O'Neill</a>. That effort failed. Moffett later was a broadcaster on <a href="../../../w/v/i/WVIT_b5a0.html" title="WVIT">WVIT</a> television Channel 30 in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hartford.html" title="Hartford">Hartford</a>.</p>
<p>Moffett's final comeback effort was in 1990 when he moved to the 5th District town of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtown.html" title="Newtown">Newtown</a> to seek election to the open congressional seat vacated by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Rowland_bc68.html" title="John Rowland">John Rowland</a>. His opponent , <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterbury.html" title="Waterbury">Waterbury</a> alderman <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Franks_cb75.html" title="Gary Franks">Gary Franks</a> pilloried Moffett as a carpetbagger far too liberal to represent conservative 5th District voters. Franks won the election.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/f/Moffett.html" title="Moffett">Moffett</a> is now a Washington consultant and works with firms such as <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monsanto.html" title="Monsanto">Monsanto</a>. Ironically, in 2004 he broke with <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Nader_6df8.html" title="Ralph Nader">Ralph Nader</a> regarding his independent candidacy for President.

<p>Peter loves the advertising business but hates the red tape that comes with it. For more than 20 years, Peter has been a practitioner of advertising and a keen observer of the ever changing marketing environment. 'Change is the only constant' he observes.That credo has largely been the philosophy of his Agency- ganforhire he co-founded with his wife 10 years ago. Always evolving and reinventing himself, Peter has proclaimed that; 'Advertising is dead. Long live Advertising' In preparation of that fact, he has recently ventured into IT solutions with Indian IT specialists to build businesses online.</p>
<p>He plays golf, invokes Gandhi, Neil French and Oscar Wilde, has Peterpan on his handphone and in his spare time, tears up the road on his Ducati. He spouts New Age theology as effortlessly as he talks about the virtues of sustainable development, all the while espousing the importance of history, faith and a good glass of wine. Peter Gan is a man of the times with a penchant for ideas that are before their time, inspiring his people to create work that defines the times.</p>

<p>ln l971 another four-cylinder motorcycle appeared in the "CB500 500 Four".</p>
<p>1972 saw the "CB350F 350 Four" new on the show room floors.</p>
<p>ln 1973 both Mr. Honda and Mr. Fujisawa retired, 25 years after the formation of the Honda Motor Company. Mr. Kiyoshi Kawashima was named the new president. For sale were the new 'ATC70' which was the first mini ATC. The first "XR" mini model was in the "XR75". The "TL125" which was the first trials motorcycle and the first two-stroke sold in the U.S., was released this year.</p>
<p>1971 saw the introduction of several new model concepts in the "CB200", the "CRI25 Elsinore". the "MT125 Elsinore" and the "MT250 Elsinore" dual purpose models. The "CB200", the "CL200", the "XL350", and the "CB360T" which replaced the popular "CB350".</p>

<p>In 1976 Honda released it's first automatic transmission in a motorcycle with the "CB750A Hondamatic". The "GL1000 LTD Gold Wing" limited edition model, with only 2000 units produced, caught the eye of a few lucky buyers.</p>
<p>When 1976 came around, we saw a new kind of four-wheeler off-road vehicle in the "FL250 Odyssey". American Honda's first "no-ped", the "NC50 Express" found homes in the states. The company became the first to announce that a Japanese motorcycle manufacturer would move a portion of it's process to the U.S. A new corporation "Honda of America Manufacturing" broke ground to assemble and manufacture products at a facility in Marysville, Ohio.</p>

<p>In 1980, a larger "GL1100 Gold Wing Interstate" headed the model year. It was the industy's first full-dressed touring bike. The "CB900C Custom" was also introduced as the first dual-range transmission for the street.</p>
<p>In 1981, Team Honda gave America a first in world team motocross. The Honda Race Team swept both the Motocross and Trophee des Nations events. Team Honda repeated the sweep in 1982. A series of motocross bikes were out as well as a new "GL500 Silver Wing" and a "GL500I Silver Wing Interstate" designed to be a mid size touring bike.</p>
<p>ln 1982, two industry firsts appeared with the introduction of the modern V-Four engines in the "VF750S Sabre" with a new hydraulic clutch actuator and in the "VF750C Magna". The first production use of turbocharging with electronic fuel injection specifically designed for a V-Twin motorcycle appeared in the "CX500TC Turbo". Also new was the "FT500 Ascot" and the "GL1100A Gold Wing Aspencade" with the first audio equipment grouping as standard equipment.

<p>A new president was ushered into America Honda in 1983 with Tetsuo Chino. Along with some new scooters, Honda rolled out a new "CB550SC" and "CB650SC" Nighthawks, the "VF750F V45 Interceptor", and the "CX650T Turbo". This year was the birth of the "Shadow" motorcycle. Both the "T750C Shadow/;which incorporated the first hydraulic valve adjuster, and a"VT500C Shadow" was in the showrooms. It took a few years, but the shadow is here and a better bike for the ones that came before it.</p>

<p>Part Three</p>
<p>The Shadow Years</p>
<p>by Bob Maynard</p>
<p>The inntroduction of the first "Shadow" models was in 1983. It was the result of years of development and synergies by Honda to address the needs of the American market. I believe most of our readers will agree it is the best bike Honda has made to date.</p>
<p>1983</p>
<p>The "VT500C" introduced this year was available in Candy Wineberry Red or Black. The identifying features of this model are the painting of both the fuel tank and rear fenders. The side covers are chrome and engine covers black. The Black and Red "Shadow 500" decal was on the side cover with a gold outline from '83 to '86. The headlight was chrome and rectangular and had a single horn. The engine was 491cc OHC 3-valve, liquid cooled V-Twin with a six-speed, shaft drive transmission from</p>
<p>'83 to '86.</p>
<p>The "VT750C" also introduced this year was also available in either Black or Candy Wineberry Red. Special identifying features of this model are the round head lamp, instrument casings and the chromed front fender. The backrest was standard equipment. The painted side covers had the "Shadow 750" decal. The engine is a 749cc SOHC 3-valve Liquid Cooled V-Twin with a six-speed shaft drive transmission.</p>
<p>1984</p>
<p>The "VT500C' was available in Candy Scorpio Red or Black. The identifying features include the fuel tank and rear fenders painted the same. The front fender is chrome and this year the side covers and engine covers were painted black. The black and red "Shadow 500" decal was on the side cover with a gold outline. The headlight was chrome and rectangular and there was a single horn. The engine is virtually the same as the '83 model.</p>
<p>The "VT700C" was introduced this year as a direct result of increased tariffs placed on Japan's imports. The U.S. raised the import tariffs on engine sizes above 701cc's. So the engine size was reduced from a 750cc to 700cc to get the bikes into the U.S. This years model was available in either Black or Candy Scorpio Red on the tank, side covers and rear fender. Special identifying features of this model are the round head lamp and instrument casings with a chromed front fender. The front wheel bore a dual disk brake system and dual horns mounted on the front. The painted side covers had the "Shadow 700" decal. The engine is a 694cc SOHC 3-Valve Liquid Cooled V-Twin with a six-speed, shaft drive transmission from 1984 to '87. New hydraulic valve adjusters and twin plug cylinder heads were used</p>
<p>from 1984 to '87.</p>
<p>1985</p>
<p>The "VT500C" model was available in either Black or Candy Glory Red. The head lamp was now round and chromed. This model continued with the dual horns. A two piece seat with an integrated backrest was incorporated. Starting this year, the engine covers were polished chrome and the fins enlarged. The "Honda" tank decal was curved instead of straight.</p>
<p>The "VT700C" model was available in either Black or Candy Glory Red. Special identifying features of this model year included the polished chrome engine side covers. The painted side covers had the "Shadow 700" decal. The engine is the same as the '84 model year.</p>
<p>The "VT1100C" model was introduced and available in either a two-tone Black and Red or Black and Silver tank with black fenders. The side cover is painted two tone black and silver. The "Shadow" side cover decal is silver. The dual horns are still located on the front and turning indicators are square shaped. A few guages are located on the tank. The new engine is a 1039cc SOHC Liquid Cooled V-Twin with a 5-speed, shaft drive transmission for '85 and '86.</p>
<p>1986</p>
<p>The "VT500C" model was available in either Black or a new Candy Scorpio Red. Everything else was virtually the some for the '85 model.</p>
<p>The "VT700C" model was available in either Black or Candy Brilliant Red. On this year's model, the front and rear fenders and tank were all painted the same color. The rear fender took on a flair look over the rounded style. The "Honda Wing" and "Shadow" decals were speckled gold and orange. The engine is the same as the '84 model with the right engine cover graphic painted black. The mufflers were a little lower and changed from the flair look to a more straight style. The rear foot peg support bracket became solid and the back rest was absent this year. The cast wheels changed from a 10-spoke to a 5-spoke design and the access covers were chromed.</p>

The "Honda Wing" decal was changed to brown, orange and yellow. The engine is the same as the '84 model but with the right engine cover graphic not painted. The side covers are chrome, 5 spoke cast wheels with a single front disk brake.</p>
<p>The "VT1100C" model took on a brand new look with a lower 26-inch high seat`, a longer 65 inch wheel base, a large 3.4 gallon fuel tank and a 41 mm extended front fork design. Both mufflers were run along the right side and a small back rest was brought back. It was available in either Black or Candy Wineberry Red. The tank is striped in silver. The frame color is black and the spark plug wires are yellow through '88. The engine is a 1093cc SOHC 3-Valve, liquid cooled V-twin with a 3-speed, shaft drive transmission.</p>
<p>1988</p>
<p>The "VT800C" model replaced the "VT700C". The paint options were either two-oned Black &amp; Candy Glory Red or Candy Wineberry Red &amp; Dry Silver Metallic. On the Black unit, the "Shadow" tank decal is silver and on the Red unit the "Shadow" tank decal is gold. The engine was increased to a 800cc SOHC 3-Valve liquid cooled V-Twin with a 4-speed, shaft drive transmission.</p>
<p>The "VT1100C" model was available in Black and a new Candy Wineberry Red color. The fuel tank stripe was deleted this year. The frame was color matched to the tank and fenders. The spark plug wires went back to black from the yellow color.</p>

The engine is a 583cc SOHC 3-Valve liquid cooled 52 degree V-Twin with a 4-speed transmission and chain drive. The wheels are spoked.</p>
<p>1989</p>
<p>The "VT1100C" model was available in two colors this year, Candy Wineberry Red and a new Indian Lake Blue Metallic. The seat was improvement was softer and tucked. The "Shadow" tank logo was changed to a script style.</p>
<p>The "VLX" "VT600C" color options for this year was Candy Wave Blue or Candy Wineberry Red and the "Shadow" tank logo was also changed to a script style.</p>
<p>1990</p>
<p>The "VT1100C" model was available in only one color this year, Indian Lake Blue Metallic. The frame sryle and engine mechanics have not changed.</p>
<p>The " VLX" "VT600C" was not made this year but did make a come back in 1991.</p>
<p>1991</p>
<p>The "VT1100C" model was not manufactured this year. Seems inventories were still high enough for the '90 models to suspend manufacturing of 91's. Dealerships heard about it and huge orders were placed to buy up all existing stock. The model would return with a vengeance in 1992.</p>
<p>The "VLX" "VT600C" returned this year but in Black only.</p>
<p>1992</p>
<p>The "VT1100c" came back with a grand entrance boasting some new custom two-tone paint options on either a black or silver frame; Spectra Red with black or silver inserts on the tank and fenders, Teal with silver inserts, Cascade Silver Metallic with either teal, red or black inserts, Black with either silver, red or teal inserts.

This year all bikes had the California option of an emissions control device mounted below the radiator.</p>
<p>The "VLX" "VT600C" this year came in a bright Candy Glory Red paint. The engine and body style was retained from the '91 model year.</p>

Again the two-toned versions could be ordered with one of two different "Shadow" tank decals. Other than the 26 color and logo options, the basic bike is being cranked out pretty much the same as previous model years.</p>
<p>The "VLX" "VT600C" was rolling out the dealerships in Black this year. The Deluxe version "VT600D" introduced this year added more chrome on the engine cases and valve covers. This model is available in a two-tone Coral Reef Blue with black inserts. The seat on the deluxe version is soft and tucked.</p>

<p>Addendum:</p>
<p>In 1995, the V-Twin market really got going, the market expanded and all the manufacturers were coming out with new, larger and expanded model lines. Harley had begun to wear out its welcome with many although the sales remained strong, the market began to pass it by because of sheer numbers, many devoted enthusiasts of Japanese and European brands and its continued the continued distain of a segment of the market. Harley did build a new facility in Kansas City and introduced a new engine in 1998 for the 1999 model year.</p>
<p>Yamaha introduced variations on its V-MAX/Venture engine called the Royal Star and this line expanded with a smaller version.</p>
<p>1996 was the last year for the "standard" VT1100C. In 1995 the American Classic Edition was introduced. It featured more retro styling that the standard with a full rear fender and induced vibrations from a single crank engine. The model also lost about 10 horse power, much to the dismay of some owners.</p>
<p>1997 saw the Standard replaced with the Spirit with more chrome on the engine ala the ACE but the same basic engine as the standard. An ACE Tourer was also introduced based on the Spirit engine but the ACE styling.</p>
<p>In 1998 the Aero came into being, again based on the ACE engine with the single crank, but a larger two into one exhaust and more retro styling. In the US, the ACE 750 was also introduced. Throughout these years the VLX remained essentially unchaged mechanically but the models and the options were changed yearly, as they were on all models. While many of the manufacturers began to expand 1500cc class model lines, Honda opted to replace the basic Gold Wing Interstate with a basic Valkryie with six carbs and boosted engine performance. In 1999 a dressed up Tourer model was added as the Interstate. The Shadow line remains the smaller V-Twins at Honda, one of the most complete lines of V-twin Cruisers on the market, and argumentably the best engineered.</p>

Rinse a very new word discoved in 2003 in Kent. If someone got rinsed, it would mean 'done over' or 'riped off'. The word is very hard to explain in standard english. Yet it is used for more things than this, if something was amaziningly classic in a funny good experience way, this would also been know as a rinse.</p>
<p>examples:- . "you got rinsed on that beer" that beer was a rip of . "that party was a bare classic rinse" that pary was increadibly classic, great time.</p>

<p>Jordan Sundher is currently playing for the Victoria Shamrocks of the WLA. The 5'10 195 pound pivot is a force on defence and has drawn comparison to Rochester Knights MVP defenceman Andrew Turner. Sundher is a physical specimen and is on his way to hopefully win another Mann Cup. The Vicoria native is happy to finally be playing in his hometown after unsuccessful stints in Calgary, Nanaimo and Edmonton. The situation is Calgary was simply not ideal and Edmonton didn't work out much better.</p>

<p>The concept of letter-sound relationships between two interacting languages has been named biphonics in this project, and is distinct from the term phonics, which defines letter-sound relationships in one language only. The interaction between two language phonic systems may occur from L1 to L2 (from a student’s first language to a second/additional language, usually English in the USA) or from L2 to L1 (from English to a student’s first language).</p>

<p>Yammie Lam Kit Yang (藿潔英) is also known as Nam Kit Ying, Nammie Nam, and Yammie Nam. She was born on April 27, 1964 and became a Hong Kong actress in the 1980's. She took the TVB actor training class and graduated in 1984. Thus, her early career started in many TVB television series. Her film career was not as popular as her appearances in television series. In the mid 1990's, she did not continue her acting because of a mental illness. Just recently, she came back to act in Troublesome Night 16 and reappeared in other shows.</p>

<p>What is Hydraulic Fracturing?</p>
<p>This half century-old technology is used in oil and natural gas production. This technique allows oil or natural gas to move more freely from the rock pores where they are trapped to a producing well that can bring the oil or gas to the surface.</p>
<p>After a well is drilled into a reservoir rock that contains oil, natural gas, and water, every effort is made to maximize the production of oil and gas. One way to improve or maximize the flow of fluids to the well is to connect many pre-existing fractures and flow pathways in the reservoir rock with a larger fracture. This larger, man-made fracture starts at the well and extends out into the reservoir rock for as much as several hundred feet. The man-made or hydraulic fracture is formed when a fluid is pumped down the well at high pressures for short periods of time (hours). The high pressure fluid (usually water with some specialty high viscosity fluid additives) exceeds the rock strength and opens a fracture in the rock. A propping agent, usually sand carried by the high viscosity additives, is pumped into the fractures to keep them from closing when the pumping pressure is released. The high viscosity fluid becomes a lower viscosity fluid after a short period of time. Both the injected water and the now low viscosity fluids travel back through the man-made fracture to the well and up to the surface.</p>

<p>The Red Masque, founded in 2001, is an original, avant rock band from Philadelphia. Primarily influenced by such progressive rock and psychedelic bands as King Crimson, Magma, Van Der Graaf Generator and Art Bears, one of the group's first concerts was at the Prelude to the North East Art Rock Festival (NEARFest) in 2001 where they performed with the likes of Land of Chocolate and Wine of Nails). Other notable shows include the 2005 Rogue Independent Music Festival in Atlanta, where the band headlined on Saturday night; the 2001 World Con Science Fiction Convention, the New Jersey proghouse series, Orion Studios in Baltimore; the Philadelphia Landing Pad Space Rock Festival; and The Gate to Moonbase Alpha concert series at the Rotunda in Philadelphia; as well as organized and performed in the 2002 and 2003 Philadelphia Underground Music and Culture Festival. The Red Masque has also opened up for notable performers and musicians such as Chris Cutler (Henry Cow, Art Bears), The Muffins, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, and Present.</p>
<p>Steadily growing an audience within the underground progressive and psychedelic music communities for their uncompromising and intense style of music, The Red Masque have released to date one EP ("Death of the Red Masque" in 2001), and two albums ("Victoria and the Haruspex" in 2002 and "Feathers for Flesh" in 2004). "Feathers for Flesh" was released through the Big Balloon Music label out of Washington state and garnered critical reviews in the press, including Wire Magazine (issue no. 248), Harmonie Magazine, Progresiste Magazine, iO Pages, Colussus Magazine, Tarkus Magazine, Progression Magazine, Expose Magazine, and various online newsletters, blogs, and review sites. Interviews in various progressive music media also followed, including Progression Magazine and Expose Magazine.</p>
<p>The band is currently working on a third album, "Fossil Eyes", which is due to be released later this year (2006) with an independent avant garde label (to be announced). A preview of the song "Carbon 14" off this new album were played at the 2006 NEARFest to garner publicity.</p>
<p>Current band lineup includes band founders Brandon Ross (bass, keys) and Lynnette Shelley (vocals, percussion), and Brian "Vonorn" Van Korn (drums, keys, theremin, assorted other instruments, and producer of "Feathers for Flesh" and "Fossil Eyes"), Andrew Kowal (guitars, mandolin and violin). Former members include Kevin Kelly (drums), Steven Blumberg (guitars), Nathan-Andrew Dewin (keys, electric concert harp, percussion), and Kiarash Emami (guitars, mandolin).</p>

<p>From 1938 the main color for Soviet military equipment (armored and unarmored vehicles, including aircraft and artillery) was "Protective Paint Green, Shade 4BO". In the West, 4BO was referred to as "Russian Olive" or "Russian Green". During the Great Patriotic War, tanks and other equipment left the factories unpainted. 4BO was delivered as components and was mixed in the field. The formula [40-60% Ochre; 15-20% Kron (zinc hydrochromate); 10-20% Zinc White; and 8-13% Ultramarine] has wide error bands resulting in a spectrum of mostly but not entirely green colors. Left to itself, 4BO blackens as it ages, but when exposed to weather, it whitens. Thus it's both lightening AND darkening at the same time. Olive (NOT Olive Drab) is a reasonable match for the basic 4BO color.</p>
<p>The Formula [Source: "Instruction on painting of 1941"]</p>
<p>Ochre 40-60% - yellowish mineral paint from the clay rich in the oxides or solvents of oxides of Ferrum. Goethite (brown ochre) is a mineral of hydrated iron oxide and abundantly present in iron ore deposits. Goethite is the yellow compound in mineral pigments known as ochre, sienna and umber. A yellowish-brown pigment from mines in Kaluzhskaia, Russia.</p>
<p>Zinc Kron 15-20% - (light) yellow paint from lead salt of zinc acid. Kron was originally based on highly toxic zinc hydrochromate (later replaced with calcium chrome phosphate). Zinc hydrochromate, aka chromium zinc oxide / zinc tetraoxychromate / chromic acid (empirical formula: ZnCrO4*4Zn(OH)2), is the most potent carcinogen among chromates commonly found in industrial settings (lowest published lethal dose: 30 mg/kg). Another zinc chromate is dark green to black and has a different composition: ZnCr2O4*4Zn(OH)2</p>
<p>Zinc White 10-20% - zinc oxide Belila Tsinkovye (zinc oxide) is a synthetic inorganic pigment of white color received by sublimation and oxidation of metallic zinc.</p>
<p>Ultramarine 8-13% - dark blue, complex sulfur containing sodium aluminum silicate Empirical formula: Na(8-10)Al6Si6O24S(2-4)</p>

<hr />
<p><i>The Cyodrake's Gaze</i> is a Neopets plot that is happening. It started in August 2006, and it involves an Asain-themed ship, and It's crew. The main focus so far is Hoban, the ship's navigator. After a storm that the crew claims he sailed them into, he went missing. Through the plot, you hear each crew member's different side of the story on how Hoban went missing. Here is a list of the crew members:</p>
<p><i>Type of Neopet-Name-Position</i> Blue Gnorbu-Tuan-Captain Yellow Shoyru-Kentari-Weapons Master Green Scorchio-Shumi-First Mate Red Nimmo-Orrin-Inventory Yellow Ruki-Unknown-Doctor Yellow Aisha-Hoban-Navigator Pink Kougra-Linae-Unknown Orange Blumaroo-Bonju-Chef</p>
<p>Everyone couple of days, <i>The Cyodrake's Gaze</i> dissapears, then re-appears in a different Neopian land. Each time it re-appears, a new crew member has their perspective of the situation to tell.</p>

<p>Squirrel Scouts are fictional girl scouts in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Lazlo_f636.html" title="Camp Lazlo">Camp Lazlo</a>.</p>
<p>The girl scouts were called Squirrel Scouts. The girls there had a lot to do, arts &amp; crafts, campfires, nature hikes, volleyball, soccer, pine cone sitting, tea parties, croquet, &amp; many more things. However, 1 particularly favoured sport of the Squirrel Scouts was making fun of the Bean Scouts of Camp Kidney, a more underfunded camp on the other side of the lake. While the Squirrel Scouts HAVE had rare moments where they were nice to the Bean Scouts, for the most part, they considered the Bean Scouts inferior to them in every single aspect except idiocy. They would pull pranks on them on occasion, or even take things from them, like their cabins’ flags. However, even they had their limits as to how much they would mistreat the Bean Scouts. The Squirrel Scouts were the group of girls who were about the same ages as the bean scouts and lived in a natural environment setting like the bean scouts. Only, it was a lot more appealing and beautiful to the eye and from a very different perspective it looked like a giant Jewel, sparkling and radiant. They did, it was for the sake of showing off to the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bean_Scouts_9d8d.html" title="Bean Scouts">Bean Scouts</a>. The headmistress of the Squirrel Scouts was Ms. Jane Doe, and the object of affection to Algonquin C. Lumpus, Scoutmaster of the Bean Scouts. Her assistant, who manages to contain a cold attitude, was a warthog by the name Ms. Mucus. They lived in a camp called Acorn Flats. The commonly seen scouts are Patsy Smiles, Nina Neckerly, &amp; Gretchen.</p>

Making of the Modern World is part of the general requirements in the Eleanor Roosevelt College (ERC) at University of California, San Diego. Its goal is to educate students on the history of different cultures from not just the perspective of foreigners, but from their perspective. While the idea works in theory, it is far too ambitious to be useful for any but non-science majors, which account for less than fifty percent at UCSD. Furthermore, despite the best efforts by professors to make the curriculum more enjoyable and more in line with the ideals laid out by the founders of the MMW courses, the excessive authority given to the teaching assistants make the overall quality of the course more of a crapshoot. The worst of all, those who do not find the courses enjoyable are unable to transfer to another college within UCSD, and most are simply stuck with the uninformed choice they made in high school while applying.</p>
