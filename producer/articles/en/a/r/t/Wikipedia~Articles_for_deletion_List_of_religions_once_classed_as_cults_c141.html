<p>This article practically brags about being a POV fork of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a>. There also appear to be exactly two sources for the article: a single Encarta article and a personal website, and if the essays written by the owner of the personal website are eliminated as a source (which I believe they would have to be, by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) then the list is exactly four entries long. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:18, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>The article has three reference because only one editor has had time to add any other links. Lists have to start somewhere. I'm sure there are many other sources.</li>
<li>The OCRT reference is considered a reliable resource for other lists. Specifically the List for Groups Referred to as Cults which Antaeus Feldspar frequently edits.</li>
<li>There does not seem to be room for these quotes on the Groups Referred to as Cults list.</li>
<li>If Encarta considers making a list like this (albeit shorter) to be encyclopedic then why wouldn't Wikipedia?</li>
<li>The list is designed to be Neutral in POV in that it only reports on the viewpoint of reliable sources and does not express the views of the author. I don't think it can be any less POV than the list of groups referred to as cults which expresses the view points of journalists and cult experts.</li>
<li>The article needs to be viewed with the other articles in its category. It enhances the information provided by providing a heading which shows a real life viewpoint. If you look at the cult categories below you will notice that all the articles refer to the scholarly groups which point the finger at what they thing are cults. This list brings up the real world viewpoint that some other scholarly groups have to the contrary. I think it looks good in the category list below. It feels right to provide a balancing article on such a controversial topic. But if you all think it's too much of a POV fork and that then means that the article needs to be merged into another then so be it.</li>

<li>Perhaps the Title of the article is throwing people off. I tried many times to come up with something that reflects the NPOV nature of the information.

<dd>Frankly, I am very surprised that OCRT was ever generally accepted as a source for <i>any</i> article. Part of the reason I have not protested it as a source for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a>, however, is that OCRT has a strong tendency (I would say "bias" except it might be misinterpreted as criticism of OCRT) <i>against</i> referring to groups as cults; thus, it is far more indicative when OCRT <i>does</i> come out and say "yes, this group actually should be regarded as a cult" than when they say "this group should be regarded as a new religious movement and <i>not</i> as a cult." (Please see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Partisan_websites" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Partisan websites</a>.) To put the shoe on the other foot -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Ross_3494.html" title="Rick Ross">Rick Ross</a> is specifically <i>not</i> accepted as a source for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a>, and you've never once complained about that. If Ross were to declare, however, that "X group was once referred to as a cult but should not be any longer", don't you think it would be noteworthy that a man who's supposedly so predisposed to see cults everywhere he looks, looks in this direction and sees the opposite? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:51, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've reconsidered as you want, and I still say it's subjective. Microsoft does not determine what is encyclopedic; they clearly have a POV conflict of interest in producing an encyclopedia. The difference between a 'cult' and a 'religion' is whether the community accepts it or not. The Hare Krishna movement are a cult in Australia, but in India they'd be pretty tame. In Japan, Mormons are considered cultish whereas in Utah, they're normal. It's impossible to draw a distinction without being subjective. I don't accept the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> movement as anything other than a dangerous cult of folie a deux, but that doesn't stop Hollywood from accepting it. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 05:48, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Take your logic and apply it to the list of groups referred to as cults: It should include everything then! That list is not concerned about whether the Scientologists are a cult inside or outside of Hollywood it is only concerned about opinions expressed by reliable references. I think the religions once classed as cults list should be able to do the same thing but on the other side of the coin. cairoi 06:09, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How exactly are the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hare_Krishna_734d.html" title="Hare Krishna">Hare Krishnas</a> a cult in Australia? lol! I think the word cult itself is almost used like a word of insult so it's difficult to describe any movement as a cult without being non-NPOV, thus in reverse it's hard to see a logic behind things being non-cult aswell (in terms of Wikipedia).

<dd>Hi Cairoi, this is exactly the point. There is no religion which would not be on this list. This makes this a POV fork, simply because if this list is identical to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_religions.html" title="List of religions">List of religions</a>, then the title of this article is simply a sideways way to push "cult" into the mix.

<dd>I'm not sure: are you asking me a question? If so, could you restate? Interpreting what I think you're asking me, yes, there are certainly subsets of Hinduism that "are classed" as cults. The Hare Krishnas (ISKCON) come to mind: in New York or Sydney, they're considered a cult, whereas in Mumbai or Chennai ISKCON is a wholly unremarkable organization. All I'm saying is that every young religion was once considered a cult, because frankly a reasonable definition of cult is "a religion without any political or economic power". Can you name <i>one</i> religion which would not appear on this list? --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 16:05, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
