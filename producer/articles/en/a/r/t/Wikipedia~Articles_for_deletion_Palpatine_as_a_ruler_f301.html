<p><b>Delete</b> Star Wars cruft. Obviously some work has gone into this and I feel a touch guilty but this doesn't belong. It's a meandering series of thoughts and comparative observations on a person that doesn't exist. "Certain of his superiority and merit, Palpatine lost no sleep over various massacres"; "Needless to say, all these facades merely masked Palpatine's ultimate goal: eternal life and power"; and later "Palpatine wrote extensively on political theory, military strategy, publishing them to considerable acclaim and circulation. Few realized that these writings would prove to be a roadmap which Palpatine himself would follow to gain and maintain his empire (in an eery parallel to the scant heed paid Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf)." Uh, no. I particularly dislike the precedent of "...as a ruler." I suppose I could live with "Churchill as a tactician" but in terms of fan-cruft it's just not encyclopedic. The main article on <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> may absorb some of this but it's already 66k. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:21, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I cited essentially everything in there; fancruft is a bit insulting when it is official canon material. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 18:49, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize if my def of fancruft is overbroad. And I do realize the page has many cites. But "official canon material" on any fictional topic does not in itself accord notability. Palpatine is not a person. This level of detail would be questionable for any subject. This page consists in large part of derivative observations on a movie character. If the main article can't accomodate this then you may have to consider whether it belongs at all. We have 66k on Palpatine to begin with. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:51, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The page was separated from <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palpatine&amp;diff=29303103&amp;oldid=29302257" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palpatine&amp;diff=29303103&amp;oldid=29302257" rel="nofollow">edit</a>), where it's no more crufty than the rest of the article. I can't see justifying its deletion as a unique entity without creating a precendent for the parent article as well (and by extension, a lot of other sci-fi/fantasy articles). Though I'd suggest a possible retitling as something other than "Palpatine as a ruler," per nom. - <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 14:54, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I love <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>, but this is just an unnecessary fork. Some of this information could be merged to <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a>, but the level of detail here ("Palpatine as a writer") is just too great for a general encyclopedia.

<dd>I was kinda thinking/typing out loud. I mean there's nothing out there that as a main source covers this, so someone would have to research all the mentions of him in the works and weave it together. However, I think that comment (and half-baked thought) was a little off, not to mention irrelevant to the discussion at hand. Sry, I'm having <i>one of those Wikidays</i>. I'm changing my vote to Merge, or perhaps re-conceptualize it somehow, <b>Star Wars Rulers</b> or something. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpencerTC_dc6d.html" title="User:SpencerTC">SpencerTC</a> 00:02, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That makes more sense.
