<p>Disputed prod; my prod reason was "notability not asserted". Appears to be a minor community radio station. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> removed the prod with "may be just as notable than the others on this list--just needs some editing". There have been an enormous number of radio station stubs added over the last two months; are these stations notable merely by their existence? I doubt it; hence this AfD.</p>
<p>Let me add <a href="../../../w/e/a/WEAF_%28AM%29_45d5.html" title="WEAF (AM)">WEAF (AM)</a> to this AfD; simply because I prodded both at once. After prodding these two I noticed how many had been added, so I stopped at that point. It'd be great to get some consensus here. I'll stay <b>neutral</b> for this. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 05:12, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There ought to be a policy which says "all radio stations are notable". The only relevant policy-like document that I could find is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28TV_and_radio_stations%29_767d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (TV and radio stations)">Wikipedia:Notability (TV and radio stations)</a> which is labelled as inactive. I would argue that most radio stations which have ever existed are notable in the context of the culture, news and politics of the cities and countries in which they operate or operated, and that establishing notability in individual cases is difficult without detailed knowledge of the station's operations. A band or musician may have gotten its first big break by getting airplay on a particular radio station (which would help establish notability for that station), but how easy is it to verify this 25 years later? This is another example of the gap between notability and <b>demonstrable</b> notability. I would prefer to keep these articles, even if they are just stubs, and avoid deletion votes for radio stations which will be a lot like the deletion votes for high school articles, which satisfy noone and exhaust everyone. That way, when a radio station becomes famous for breaking a news story or being the first to broadcast a particular song, Wikipedia will have a good stub on which to build. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 06:25, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So every one is notable? Even campus radio stations, for example? <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 22:56, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(Reply to Eastmain) I don't think notability should be either speculative or inherent. Even if it turns out that, say, some band really did get its first play at WEGO, that would not automatically imply that WEGO is notable. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability on Wikipedia</a> is a totally practical concept: are there enough external sources that we can use to write a verifiable article? In this case the answer seems to be no for both WEGO and WEAF (which is no surprise -- most small radio stations wouldn't pass WP:N). Of course, if the articles are deleted now and appropriate sources surface later as you suggest might happen, nothing prevents anyone from recreating the articles. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:19, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Conditional delete</b>, there absolutely ought <i>not</i> to be a policy which says all radio stations are notable. Nothing, IMO, could be farther from the truth. Many are barely notable within their community (see <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>), let alone outside. In any case, however, in the absence of tspecific policies and guidelines, more general ones must apply, This does not assert any notability nor does it provide independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, so it <i>must go</i>!

<li><b>neutral</b> I asked for the AfD to get just this sort of discussion. We judge the subject as being notable, not the article, and I can tell what stations suit my interests, but not whether or not they are notable, so I was hoping for some guidelines. If there aren't any they all must stay is at least as stubs. A poorly written article which for some reason doesnt have the detail of the 100s of parallel articles needs the detail in, not the article out, and just needs to be marked for expansion.</li>

<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, looking at a number of radio station articles, most of them don't have much to say. They all have the same sources, which are reliable if not very informative. Some belonging to major chains have more (they CBS ones, for example, have the CBS box at the bottom.) The only one in this geographic area with real content has been protected over a debate on the reliability of a web site. In almost all cases the sources are 1/ the website 2/lists that include all radio stations. Neither of them counts. I don't want to do it myself as a project like the removal of transmission towers, but any argument for removing these 2 applies to 95% of them.</dd>
<dd>As I said, I'm neutral. In or out. I dont think it is essential content, since the outside lists are available &amp; they all have websites.

<dd>You omitted the subsequent text <b>Lower power radio stations limited to a small neighborhood, such as Part 15 operations in the United States or stations with a VF# callsign in Canada, are not inherently notable</b>.

<dd>Part 15 stations are not listed in the FCC database, because they're not licensed operations. Since WEGO does have <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=WEGO" class="external text" title="http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=WEGO" rel="nofollow">a page</a> in that database, by definition, it has to be a licensed station.

<dd>You misread it. Are these lower power stations? Some I saw seemed to be. The rest of the text is an example, not an exhaustive list. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't misread anything. I was personally involved in the process of determining how best to <i>write</i> that particular precedent statement, so I know <i>exactly</i> what it means. What it means is that if a station operates under a legally-issued FCC license, then it gets an article. The exclusion applies to <i>unlicensed</i> operations. It does <i>not</i> permit any kind of cutoff that splits FCC-licensed stations into licensed-and-notable vs. licensed-and-not-notable piles on the basis of some arbitrary minimum transmitter power. If it's FCC-licensed, then it's in, period. That <i>is</i> the established AFD precedent, and that <i>is</i> what the precedent statement expresses. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 07:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You seem to be taking this the wrong way; perhaps I could have worded better. My apologies. It doesn't say what you claim though; if it did it would read "As an exception, Part 15 operations in the United States or stations with a VF# callsign in Canada, are not inherently notable."</dd>
<dd>Regardless, prior consensus is not set in stone and can change; this has happened several times already. What little consensus exists in this discussion does not match what it apparently was before. As another example, today you de-prodded the campus station <a href="../../../w/p/p/WPPJ_5b87.html" title="WPPJ">WPPJ</a>; however I really fail to see how that station has any genuine claim to notability. In other words, I think the precedent as you see it is too broad. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 11:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're misquoting me. Allow me to rephrase myself: until such time as somebody articulates a new policy <i>specifically about radio stations</i>, the precedent <i>on radio stations</i> is the final word <i>on the matter of a radio station</i>. It's <i>not</i> sufficient to cite <i>general</i> policies about which people can and do genuinely <i>disagree</i> on whether radio stations meet them or not — the precedent as it stands reflects a lot of debates in which those policies <i>were</i> already taken into account, and the determination was that radio stations <i>do</i> meet them if they're duly licensed by the appropriate regulatory authority and originate at least a part of their own programming schedule. It's not as though you're introducing some radical new litmus test that nobody ever thought of before; in fact, you're citing the exact same policies that were brought to bear in <i>setting</i> the precedent in the <i>first</i> place. So if you don't like the precedent as it stands, then try to build consensus around a new policy statement that specifically addresses <i>radio stations</i> in <i>particular</i>, because as things stand right now, it's not as though you're citing anything that hasn't already been taken into account. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:10, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Reply to Bearcat) The debate between you and Akihabara about what WP:AFDP actually means in regard to radio stations is fascinating but irrelevant. It's irrelevant because WP:AFDP is a description of what has happened in past AFD's, not a prescription for what should happen in future AFD's. Outcomes of prior AFD's have nothing to do with whether <i>these</i> 2 articles should be kept. In fact it says in bold at the very top of WP:AFDP that "This page is not policy." By contrast, WP:RS, WP:N, and WP:CORP are derived from WP:V and WP:NOT, core policies. I would say those trump WP:AFDP. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:00, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"The determination [at prior AFD's] was that radio stations <i>do</i> meet [the general policies] if they're duly licensed by the appropriate regulatory authority and originate at least a part of their own programming schedule" -- You are citing AFD <i>outcomes</i> as if they can determine general policy.

<li><b>comment</b>If N and V are properly applied, they will give consistent decisions. If similar cases coming up now are being decided differently, then the standards are not being properly applied. The AFDD page states what is intended as an honest summary of past consistent decisions. As WP evolves, it may be desirable to change some of these. Some matters, like the wording of the N standard itself, are changed in a legislative sort of way by amending the standard; if thought desirable, a standard or guideline on radio stations could be developed. At present, it's essentially a judge-made standard, made by continuing AfD discussions such as this one here. I understand the meaning of precedent in WP to mean that we should continue prior practice in individual cases, until we intend to change it. As in the RW, one of the factors to consider is how such change will affect the cases treated in the previous decisions. Since WP has the peculiar rule that articles kept may be brought up repeatedly, those interested in consistence may want to re-discuss early articles.</li>

<dd>I'd support and take part in creating a brief guideline for radio stations; no need to make it too long or wordy IMO. As a starting point I'd suggest notability is given by broadcasting to a sufficiently large area (certainly all large cities would qualify) or having a DJ or presenter that is notable.
