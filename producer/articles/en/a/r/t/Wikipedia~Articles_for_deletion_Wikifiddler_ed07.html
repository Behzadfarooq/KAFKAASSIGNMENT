<ul>
<li>I've already responded to the nominator's criticisms. I'm sure the article is not a dictionary definition. Several people obviously agree with the nominator's point about the title of the article being a neologism, but deleting an article on the basis of its title alone is not acceptable, and the contents of the article describe Orlowski's criticisms of Wikipedia editors. Apart from anything else, a very strong justification for the contents of the article is that Orlowski's criticisms are spot on. I'm pretty sure Orlowski has some experience editing Wikipedia, and maybe he has even been through "Articles for Deletion" a few times. So many people lining up to try to delete this article, when a similar neologism, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlewashing.html" title="Googlewashing">Googlewashing</a>, also by Orlowski, but never subjected to deletion votes, seems to me to show how on target Orlowski's criticisms are. This vote for deletion is like one of those puffs of smoke coming out of Saddam's bunkers after the cruise missile has just flown in through the chimney. What people inside the Wikipedia "group" don't realise is that, by showing how the criticisms have hit home, and deleting the article, it is a kind of victory for the critics. I don't expect to win friends here on Wikipedia by saying so, but taking the up-front policy, refusing to censor criticism, and keeping the article here on Wikipedia, is in practice the best antidote to Orlowski's criticisms. For myself I also feel that the current "shocking" title is the best one, but if others have a better suggestion, please respond on the talk page of the article itself. Thank you to all participants in this discussion for sharing their views. DannyWilde 05:05, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only argument I've seen about why this isn't a dictionary definition isn't that you wouldn't find a dictionary that would choose to cover this word. That's not exactly the point of the rule against dicdefs. You state that deleting an article on the basis of its title alone is not acceptable, but you fail to address the more salient point, which is that if it was under the non-neologistic title Andrew Orlowski's criticisms of Wikipedia would anyone see any reason for such an article separate from <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> to exist in the first place? You are correct that the article describes Orlowski's criticisms of Wikipedia editors, including that they are "spotty teenagers", but we have a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> article already, where we can decide whether allegations that Wikipedia editors have acne are <i>significant</i> instances of that subject. As for the fact that <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlewashing.html" title="Googlewashing">Googlewashing</a> has not been nominated for deletion yet and that supposedly proves bias, BS. There's a lot of outright vandalistic articles that fly under the radar for a long time before they get spotted. You're trying to argue that the same editors who are voting to delete Orlowski's neologism Wikifiddler and its associated existential fallacy must have seen <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlewashing.html" title="Googlewashing">Googlewashing</a> and said "Oh, that's okay then!" thus proving a bias; the problem with this assumption is that if you actually looked at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlewashing.html" title="Googlewashing">Googlewashing</a> you must have seen that the article was created in two edits by a single person and that no one has ever edited the talk page; in short, there is precious little evidence that the people you're accusing even <i>knew of the page's existence</i>, let alone applying a double standard to it. The rest of your arguments amount to "If we don't allow Wikipedia to become a platform for Orlowski's insulting personal attacks on Wikipedia and its editors, it'll prove that Wikipedia is biased." Again, I say that's BS, and all the flimsy analogies about "this is somehow like a puff of smoke; there, I've proved my point!" won't change the actual facts, which is that Wikipedia is not obligated to keep articles on <i>any</i> journalist's neologisms invented to encapsulate a personal attack, not when those neologisms have failed to meet vital standards such as actual notability. The fate of this article should be the same as Internet Shell Shock -- deletion. To claim that we must keep it, because we are the target of the attack? <b>That</b> is the double standard. <i>Oh. And one last thing. When you notice that there's a debate going on which will decide whether an article will be deleted or not, and whether its content will be deleted or merged elsewhere?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I also believe the information contained in this article can be useful for general users as well as editors, so I oppose deleting it. I also oppose merger to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> since that article focuses on criticisms of Wikipedia and this is more like an <i>attack</i>. (The contents of this article are a lot more specific than a general criticism. The attack also focuses more on Wikipedians rather than Wikipedia in general.) Perhaps a new article named Attacks on Wikipedia should be created? In any case, I favor keeping the article the way it is. <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman"><b>Aucaman</b></a> 00:52, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Maybe Attacks on Wikipedia could be construed to sound slightly POV, but it would be a better title than Wikifiddler. Until somebody finds a better title, I support a <b>move</b> to Attacks on Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>It looks like an expansion of this article into a broader article documenting various attacks on Wikipedia could create some controversy (for one thing, it is not within Wikipedia's interest to be circulating [otherwise dead] attacks on itself). Whatever outcome of that controversy, I think this article need to stay the way it is (since it is very detailed, specific, and potentially useful). <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman"><b>Aucaman</b></a> 02:17, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, someone could move the relevant criticism parts to somewhere in the Wikipedia namespace (although I'd think they are there already), but the article by itself is about a neologism that's not in wide use.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The term seems to be gaining currency, I've found it used in several places other than here and The Register. It's too new, as yet, to be in a dictionary, and it's very relevant to Wikipedia editors. Most of whom, it seems to me, suffer a sense of humor failure when criticised.

<li>I was contacted about this because DannyWilde seems to be including the whole article in <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Orlowski_20f6.html" title="Andrew Orlowski">Andrew Orlowski</a>. Because the AfD is still active, and there is no consensus to keep or merge, such an inclusion constitutes circumvention of AfD. The Andrew Orlowski article should be kept as it is until this AfD discussion has closed. — <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 05:35, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
