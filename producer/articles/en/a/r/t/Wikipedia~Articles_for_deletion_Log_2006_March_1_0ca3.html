<p>This page appears to be an advertising page for the commercial link at the bottom, disguised as an attempt to describe a purportedly general term. A Google search doesn't readily turn up any use of the word "internetdiary" that doesn't relate to the linked company.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I will say that you are free to do as you wish. The topic does have a lot of issues. However, I would argue that what I originall wrote was giving a relatively accurate view of the subject after the mid-90s. I was wrong in not mentioning that a literal translation is "new construction". Sure, remove the second paragraph, and rearrange the first. The last paragraph comes directly from the Russian Governments television report in the news on RTR. In response to personal attacks that I don't speak Russian, I do. Thank you to Irpen for pointing that out. I was born in Kiev and do speak both languages fluently. Such personal attacks without any proof whatsoever should be considered as proof to question the attacker. (Ironically, part of the original nomination was lack of proof.) <a href="../../../m/n/o/User%7EMno_3310.html" title="User:Mno">mno</a> 20:38, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK I made mistake about the knowledge of Russian by the contributor. It was simply beyond my understanding how a Russian native speaker would write <i>Новостройка is a term used to refer to Western-style apartment buildings</i>, which is so obviously wrong. It is just like to write <i>"<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_poetry.html" title="Russian poetry">Russian poetry</a> is a term used to refer to literary works of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pushkin_8d12.html" title="Alexander Pushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a>"</i>. But the key phrase from the article is <b>"The most, and usually only, difference is the fact that there were constructed more recently"</b>.
<ul>
<li>My reasoning behind this now that I think back over it, is that I wanted to emphasize that they were not necessarily better than the old buildings. You are right, the most important point has to be that it simply means new construction, and perhaps ideas from the rest should be moved elsewhere.&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/n/o/User%7EMno_3310.html" title="User:Mno">mno</a> 21:34, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This says it all. If one wants an article about Residential construction in Russian Federation, it must be way better than that. There is no big deal for the original author and those who support him, to salvage what is salvageable from the text, do a little bit more google search and start a new, decent article for an important, but missing topic. A single RTR news report is not enough. Also, please don't forget to list the sources; see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Not to <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:05, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In fact, there is even no Residential construction in wikipedia at all! Even <a href="../../../c/o/n/Construction.html" title="Construction">Construction</a> article has no such section. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:23, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Just to add: I generally do not just publish something and let it be there. I always ask for comments from others indirectly by announcing my articles somewhere. Perhaps announcing it only on the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Portal%7EUkraine_New_article_announcements_8640.html" title="Portal:Ukraine/New article announcements">Portal:Ukraine/New article announcements</a> was not enough, considering the breadth of this article. There was no response from anyone, and now there is the motion to delete the whole article. Why not instead cut it to make it what is should be? As some others pointed out, there is some text there that could be scalvaged. Regarding RTR: of course, it's not enough for the whole article, but it is proof, regardless. <a href="../../../m/n/o/User%7EMno_3310.html" title="User:Mno">mno</a> 21:40, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. (from another native Russian speaker). The usage of the word "Novostroika" I am most familiar with is to refer to the areas of the cities containing mainly apartment complexes, usually built in the last 20 - 30 years. Often these areas are very different from older parts of the city. The word existed (with the same meaning) even before the collapse of the USSR. Not sure if it deserves a separate article in Wikipedia. I removed the mentioning of the collapse of the USSR from the article, so it should not bear on the decision to delete or to keep the article Vlad1 01:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, Vlad. I think that since now we have significant attention on this article and topic (which is actually a very backwards way to give it attention, but that is partially my fault, too), I would like to propose that we <b>not delete</b> the article but rather work on it to make it viable. Maybe split it into several sections or articles. If you still feel that you don't want to have the original article visible through the history, then I guess that would be OK if we delete and then recreate it. However, I don't see any point to this, as I'm sure there are articles that have had a lot of incorrect information in them not be deleted but rather changed, with the history still there. <a href="../../../m/n/o/User%7EMno_3310.html" title="User:Mno">mno</a> 03:25, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I suggest you compare your project with the page for <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_the_Outlands_57ac.html" title="Kingdom of the Outlands">Kingdom of the Outlands</a>. The Outlands page basically says, we're a club, here's a bit of our history, here are links to our activities and websites. Wikipedia is a not a free web host and it is not a substitute for your own web site. Also, the indivdual articles on awards and other internal kingdom business really do fall below Wikipedia's notability guidelines, and are written in a very silly way, as if they are things in the real world. I suggest you rework the main article in your user space <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> and then recreate it here when it's done. To keep it from being speedily deleted, note on the new article's talk page that it is not a recreation of a deleted article but a substantial rewrite. Thanks for contributing.

<li><b>Keep</b>. "Kingdoms" in the SCA aren't really "local chapters" in the way you're thinking of them; the Kingdom of Calontir encompasses about 40 local SCA groups in five states. I can't find membership details for the kingdom as a whole, but the local groups I'm familiar with have numbered at least 50-100 people so that would put it at 2000-4000 members.

Each SCA kingdom has its own history, customs, events, royalty, traditions, and awards, as distinct from the SCA as a whole.

<dd>Perhaps you and Guido can collaborate on a rewrite. That info is very much along the lines of a real encyclopedia entry but was not included in the original entry, nor based on the outline would it be. Nearly all of the Kingdom info (traditions, awards, customs, etc) should be on its own web site, which it already has. The Wikipedia entry should say when you were founded, what area, how many local chapters, describe the most notable events (like the Lillies war) and then direct users to other sites for detailed information. See the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_the_Outlands_57ac.html" title="Kingdom of the Outlands">Kingdom of the Outlands</a> for what I think is a better example.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:23, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Looking at it again, the person concerned is approaching the borderlands of notability. Still, I can't see evidence of anything that has yet had an influence, such as solid publications. This looks to me like a career that <i>will be</i> notable, if all goes well, but probably isn't there yet. I could understand the subject of the article being slightly embarrassed by it at this stage, if that is the situation - there are a lot of other people with promising careers who don't yet have wikipedia articles - but that's not the reason for my view. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 07:05, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> the article asserts that it's about a smart fellow with a lot of research assistant and undergrad level accomplishments. However, that's not notability. Calling the Professor Test into consideration, this guy isn't even a Professor. The most notable comment is about getting the bronze as part of the Turkish team in the International Olympiad of Infomatics which is a redlink in the article. Being a research assistant even if it's in a notable area is not notability - there are thousands of research assistants. I haven't done any research outside of the article to look for notability but the arguments presented in this AfD seem to suggest that the article itself asserts sufficient notability and I cannot see that to be the case.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'd be a bit happier with this if the Unix/Linux equivalents were nominated for deletion too. Otherwise, it's systemic bias. Unix is cool, Windows isn't. (I use both, and have done for over a decade). Why should we delete an article on "the core executable file in control of every Windows NT based Windows Operating System" and not "the program on Unix and Unix-like systems which spawns all other processes"? --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:56, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In principle, I concur with <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a>. However, we shouldn't keep one non-notable article because other non-notable articles have also been retained; otherwise we would have to <i>Keep</i> all AfD nominations or <i>Delete</i> all the fancruft related to Pokémon <i>et al</i>. Each article should be judged on its own merit.

<li>Yes, I'm well aware your first argument (it's a sound one) and of course I'm aware that I can nominate <a href="../../../i/n/i/Init.html" title="Init">init</a> for deletion&#160;:). What I'm really saying is: take a step back. Imagine this is the article about the Linux equivalent. Would it be deleted? I don't wish to nominate <a href="../../../i/n/i/Init.html" title="Init">init</a>*, which makes it hard for me to support the deletion of <a href="../../../n/t/o/Ntoskrnl.html" title="Ntoskrnl">Ntoskrnl</a>. *<a href="../../../i/n/i/Init.html" title="Init">init</a> could use more encyclopedic tone and I will tag it as such. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 15:01, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Another comment</b>: The article, in its current form, just describes the <i>name</i> of the file, not anything technical about what it does, so having a separate article is not really serving any purpose, at least not yet. The difference is that Unix administrators are expected to know what /etc/init does, Windows administrators do not deal with ntoskrnl.exe. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 15:05, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have now noticed that there is already the article <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_NT_Startup_Process_3227.html" title="Windows NT Startup Process">Windows NT Startup Process</a>, which in turn links to many (but much better written) articles in the same vein as the ones I nominated, including <a href="../../../n/t/o/Ntoskrnl.exe.html" title="Ntoskrnl.exe">Ntoskrnl.exe</a>, of which <a href="../../../n/t/o/Ntoskrnl.html" title="Ntoskrnl">Ntoskrnl</a> is a (probably unintended and pointless) fork.

<p>The result of the debate was</p>
<p><s>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus</b>. On a strict vote-count, I see 11 deletes and 5 non-deletes. I also see two invalid votes for merge (I call them invalid because they said "Delete all and merge". I simply counted them as "Delete all"). As such, this is right on the keep/delete borderline. I would highly recommend either merging them into one article or holding another AfD and letting everyone know that <i>you can't delete and merge</i>. In any case, it doesn't require an AfD to merge articles. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">athphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 13:48, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

I changed my mind after going through the first dozen of these articles and truly seeing no content beyond what's printed on those little cards. I'm applying my admin's discretion and making the "merge" votes into "redirect" because there's nothing to merge. That way, the content (what little there is) is still in the article history.

<dd>I still don't understand what there is to merge. I specifically choose articles with no additional content, thus nothing to merge. the only thing to "merge" is the fact that the digimon has an x-version, which really isn't a merge at all. Not only that, but I don't think there were x versions for most of these digimon in the movie, making most of the articles speculation towards an x-version. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 04:00, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete all</b> We do not need both the X version and their no-X counterparts. Leroy Jenkins 07:32, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It doesn't make any sense to include the X Digimon in the Digital Monster X-Evolution movie, as most of them don't even appear in the movie. Although the X Digimon articles undoubtedly need some more work to incorporate further information, the X Digimon are different Digimon from their normal counterparts, having (sometimes drastically) different appearances, different attacks, and in some cases, different types. If any action is to be taken other than revising and adding on to the articles, it should be to merge them with their non-X counterparts (with redirects).

<li>We have an article on Brighton Road because it is one of the longest roads in London. Period. That is standard practice for road articles, which many voters here, who work on road articles, fully understand. Following your logic, we should delete <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_%28New_York_City%29_d7a4.html" title="Broadway (New York City)">Broadway (New York City)</a> because we have an article on <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Route_9_b528.html" title="U.S. Route 9">U.S. Route 9</a>. Or maybe it's the reverse. Furthermore, since you seem to be arguing for a merge, and have even gone so far as to place a merge tag on the article, why vote delete? That just seems so incredibly inconsistent. Roads have a curious habit of changing names or becoming known under multiple names. See <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Route_41_1391.html" title="U.S. Route 41">U.S. Route 41</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamiami_Trail_31ad.html" title="Tamiami Trail">Tamiami Trail</a>. In answer to your question, yes we must have road articles. Why? Because we are trying to provide people with the information they need. Wikipedia is not an address book- it's an encyclopedia. On a side note, I would appreciate it if you would refrain from using derogatory slang to slam editors that are merely trying to expand the contents at wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:32, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yet again, I see AfD is dominated by faulty logic. You are not comparing like for like. A UK equivalent of your first comparison is <a href="../../../a/4/0/A40_road.html" title="A40 road">A40</a> and <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Street_63ad.html" title="Oxford Street">Oxford Street</a>, and your second the naming of the <a href="../../../m/2/5/M25.html" title="M25">M25</a> as "London Orbital Motorway". Because Brighton Road is on a par with neither Oxford Street nor the M25, your argument fails. I object to your branding of this as "trying to expand the contents at wikipedia" (sic), when perhaps instead of junk like the <i>names of individual streets in London</i> (in case you hadn't noticed, Wikipedia is not the London <a href="../../../a/-/z/A-Z_0c43.html" title="A-Z">A-Z</a>, nor is it a guide to genealogy or local history), perhaps you might want to try some activities which would actually contribute something worthwhile, welcome, and (more importantly) necessary.

<li>Local history can be encylopedic, but not all such is. Bascially, it needs to be significant somehow - a particularly notable piece of local history, that has more than local interest. We keep being told that this road is notable, but really, I think we need more details of that so that we can understand why the road is more significant than so many other roads.

<li><b>Question</b>. What is it that this article lacks that other Halls at Bristol have? It really does not make a lot of sense to look at articles on Halls at X in isolation. Some of the other articles are better than this one, I agree. I think this should have been given more time. 8 minutes is far far too short.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but improve. Several points.
<ul>
<li>Halls of residence of often more than "Dorms" with a function of just offering accommodation. They often offer tutorial support, provide rooms for senior members, a link between students and those senior staff members, and they play an important role in the social and sporting life of a university.</li>
<li>To Melcoir. Yes, <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badock_Hall_a0d9.html" title="Badock Hall">Badock Hall</a> is the next worst, but what about the two older halls where the article includes some history and architectual details. Are the older ones notable?</li>
<li>Merging to University article. There is already a brief table. More details would unbalance the university article. If you want a merge, I suggest merging all Hall articles to Bristol University Halls of Residence similar to what was done recently at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Exeter_Halls_of_Residence_b68a.html" title="University of Exeter Halls of Residence">University of Exeter Halls of Residence</a>.</li>
<li>The question of Halls of Residence, particularly in the British and Commonwealth countries, as opposed to the USA, needs to be thought through carefully and not done piece meal. I have suggested to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Universities_a389.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Universities">Wikipedia:WikiProject Universities</a> that they consider all the issues, but they do not seem to be active.</li>
<li>Students going to university want good NPOV information on Halls of Residence, not just the advertising POV material from the university itself. Of course that means we have to write good articles, but it does not mean we have to delete them just minutes after someone starts the article. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:51, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Merging to one article is an excellent idea.</li>

<dd>My problem with that argument is that all information is useful to somebody. It doesn't say "Wikipedia is not a consumer guide" anywhere, but I think it's a reasonable reflection of our values. We don't have an article on every nursing home for the sole purpose of helping people decide where to put their parents. We also don't have an article on every university residence for the sole purpose of helping people decide where to put their kids. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 22:57, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment and question</b>. Coming from the UK and Australia, I dislike the term "Dorm", rather than "Hall of Residence" or "College", but I do not understand the US system. So I have a few questions - Do US dorms provide anything other than housing for students? Are Faculty (to use the US term) associated with a dorm? Do dorms compete against each other in sport? Is there any academic support (e.g.tutoring)? If the answer to these questions (or even most of them) is "no", then dorms are not like Halls of Residence and the comparision is not valid. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:18, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was delete. The sources presented do not appear to satisfy our guidelines, and several of the "keep" recomendations that are based upon notability are thus unverified. At least two "keep" recomendations are given with the caveat that notability appears to arise from vanity press alone. Given this, the delete outcome is a matter of <i>sources</i>.

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b>. The first thing I'd like to say is that I've already added four powerful references to the article A. Graham Maxwell. Compare that to the six references supporting the much longer article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventists" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventists" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventists</a> (two of which are mine).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Second: If someone is interested in expanding the article by writing on the upbringing of A. Graham Maxwell and his early life, they are very welcome to do so. Realize, of course, that many people are only remembered for their life's work and goals, not lesser experiences. Joseph Goebbels is known best for being Adolf Hitler's Propaganda Minister. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels</a></dd>
<dd>At least for me, I am more interested in those details about Goebbels. And while some persons don't want to see evidence documenting the "final solution," I don't mind someone making a Wikipedia article out of it.</dd>
<dd>According to everything I know, the only encyclopedic significance of Graham Maxwell is the schism he has created in the Seventh-day Adventist church:</dd>
<dd>"A faction in the church rejects the historic Christian belief that Christ died vicariously for our sins and accepts, instead, the controversial theology of A.

<li><b>A Comment That Proves Indisputable Notability:</b> Here is a great quote documenting why A. Graham Maxwell is a notable figure: In reference to Christ's atonement and the Division of Religion at Loma Linda University, David P. McMahon wrote, "In this department are those who repudiate the historic Christian doctrine of the substitutionary atonement in order to embrace 'the moral influence theory.' In fact, the moral influence theory has widely permeated West-Coast American Adventism. It has such a stranglehold on the church's principal financial base that the leaders of the church appear paralyzed and frightened to touch it." David P. McMahon, <i>Ellet Joseph Waggoner: The Myth and the Man</i>, p. last. - In the cited references, Maxwell admits that he is accused of teaching the moral influence theory. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerspicacious_39a9.html" title="User:Perspicacious">Perspicacious</a> 12:03, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Could you please explain in more detail Maxwell's contributions to the moral influence theory (either theologically or in relation to its spread in the Adventist Church)? Or even better, add that explanation to the article? I can't tell how the two are related, since moral influence theory is not mentioned in the body of Graham Maxwell, nor is Maxwell mentioned in <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement_%28Moral_influence_view%29_4978.html" title="Atonement (Moral influence view)">Atonement (Moral influence view)</a>.

Combined with the fact that you can't provide these, obviously, widespread issues to us in terms that we accept as encyclopedic influence and significance, means that someone else who is not deep into adventism will know, or ever care, about these issues.

<p><b>1.</b> Desmond and Gillian Ford, (1982) <i>The Adventist Crisis of Spiritual Identity</i> pp. 124, 141, 142.</p>
<p>[Chapter 9 in this reference is titled <i>Enquiry's Progress</i>. Here, Gillian Ford tells a story of an Adventist journey written in the style of the classic book <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>. The story begins as follows]:</p>
<p>An earnest seeker for truth, Enquiry was his name, was wandering through a certain country, looking for sign-posts along the way. In the midst of a desert, he saw afar off a man seated on a rock with his head in his hands. "Maybe this man can direct me to some more fertile place," thought he to himself and hastened towards him.</p>
<p>"Good-day friend. My name's Enquiry, and I am seeking for the garment which will protect me in the coming earthquake. Can you help me?"</p>
<p>The man seated on the rock, Confused was his name, sighed deeply and wrung his hands.</p>
<p>"I wish I could, sir, but I need help myself. For I too have heard that there's an earthquake coming. They say that it's already rumbling, and folks round here are afraid that the whole town will be destroyed."</p>
<p>[Enquiry and Confused gather up their belongings and set off to travel along the highway. Here's the part I like. They arrive inevitably at Maxwell's house].</p>
<p>As they trudged south, they came to a place called Pretty Hill, and seeing a light, thought to ask for rest that night. They approached timidly, fearing that they might be turned away, but were warmly greeted from afar off by two figures on the porch who greeted them most cordially, and welcomed them like brothers.</p>
<p><i>Tender-heart</i>: "Our names are Love-alone and Tender-heart. There are no words used in this house such as blood, or wrath, or penalty, or punish, or propitiate. We teach that the architect can be trusted."</p>
<p>Enquiry and Confused found the hosts most congenial, the stay most comfortable, the beds soft and the food easy to digest. And as they talked together, Confused especially felt at ease, for he had often been told that the architect was a stern judge, ready to throw a ton of bricks at all who displease him. Thus he had grown up afraid of him. But Enquiry grew very quiet and thoughtful, and caused Confused to ask if all was well.</p>
<p><i>Enquiry</i>: "It seems to me that I could not really trust a God who took evil lightly and did not punish those who murdered, stole and dealt unjustly. The blueprint speaks with those words of which you do not approve."</p>
<p><i>Love-alone</i>: "But those words are mere figures of speech. For though the blueprint speaks of judgment—such judgment men bring on themselves. They reap what they sow. The architect himself does not act out in judgment, because he is love and cannot act against himself. As for wrath—it is merely that the architect gives up on men, when after much patient coaxing, he cannot win them. And blood and penalty! Did the son of the architect have to die to 'pay for our sins'? We say not. It was to show that he loved us so much that he would die to prove it.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Weber, Martin. (1994) Who's Got the Truth, <i>Making sense out of five different Adventist gospels</i>, pp. 15-34.</p>
<p>Here are some pertinent quotes:</p>
<p>"Obviously, all of these spiritual leaders have much to contribute in terms of gospel truth, or they wouldn't have their large followings of thoughtful Seventh-day Adventists." p. 5.</p>
<p>"Reading <i>Servants or Friends</i> makes obvious why Graham Maxwell is so popular with thousands of thoughtful Adventists." p. 15.</p>
<p>"I wish I could accommodate Dr. Maxwell's desire to be left out of this book, but because his view are cherished by thousands of Adventists, I would be remiss not to consider them worthy of inclusion in this analysis. And so I have proceeded without Dr. Maxwell's participation."</p>
<p>"He feels so strongly that I should not include him in these pages that he contacted the denominational publishing house with which I was arranging to print this book. He asked that they not publish it if it includes my chapter about him. Out of respect for his wishes, the book editors there complied with his request. Consequently, I am publishing this book personally with the Home Study International Press."</p>
<p>"To summarize: The name Graham Maxwell is well-known and beloved by Adventist around the world; he is too significant a thought leader to ignore." p. 33.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> David P. McMahon wrote in his book, <i>Ellet Joseph Waggoner: The Myth and the Man</i>, in reference to Christ's atonement and the Division of Religion at Loma Linda University, and I quote: "In this department are those who repudiate the historic Christian doctrine of the substitutionary atonement in order to embrace 'the moral influence theory.' In fact, the moral influence theory has widely permeated West-Coast American Adventism. It has such a stranglehold on the church's principal financial base that the leaders of the church appear paralyzed and frightened to touch it." p. last.</p>

<p><b>GOD WILL NOT KILL THE WICKED</b>—The present author’s research study, The Terrible Storm, is the most complete collection of Bible-Spirit of Prophecy material on this subject. Revelation 14:9-10 predicts a terrible storm of God’s wrath is soon to fall upon the incorrigibly wicked. But Satan wants the Third Angel’s Message repudiated in the minds of men. In place of it, he substitutes a different message: “Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you go to heaven anyway.”</p>
<p>In spite of a multitude of clear statements in the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy, for over two decades Mike Clute taught the false doctrine that God never has, and never will, execute capital punishment on the wicked. In recent years Mike went into universalism, the teaching that none of the wicked will ever die. That evil teaching is solidly denounced in Great Controversy, 537-539.</p>
<p>This error, which Paul Heubach used to teach in the 1950s and 1960s at La Sierra and Walla Walla (he was the one who taught it to Mike), is being taught by Graham Maxwell of Loma Linda University (Graham Maxwell, Servants or Friends? Another Look at God, 1992). Maxwell says he has a “matured” view of God, which helps him see that the “many references in the Bible to God’s destruction of the wicked” must be understood as God’s “just using a figure of speech.” --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerspicacious_39a9.html" title="User:Perspicacious">Perspicacious</a> 05:50, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I decided to add some rationale to my Keep so I striked out my vote at top. About verifiability, there is a link at the page and about the play, it is only likely that a Bengali play performed only at Kolkata will have no mention on Google. The Google can hardly be taken as the index of all Truths. The movie site clearly mentions Joy Basu, so I can't see how the notability is not verifiable, unless you say that writing the script of a movie and a play being regularly performed by a prominent theater group of a large metropolis does not count as notable. About the other Joy Basu, I know of him. If someone does write an article about him sometime, then both should be kept on different pages and the current Joy Basu page serve as Disambiguation as is standard practice for several people with the same name. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoom91_0629.html" title="User:Loom91">Loom91</a> 12:06, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the article doesn't actually have any genuine content. The content that is currently displayed has nothing to do with what the article purports to be about. There are allegations of bad faith editing on this article but I am not able to see whether those allegations are correct or not. If some future article on examples of self-cannibalism in nature were to be developed, it would have nothing to do with this one and none of the information here would be relevant. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 12:38, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> for now. I'm willing to let this article stand for now because Radio Rainbow may possibly have some notability. Unfortunately the current article makes alot of unsubstantiated claims (i.e. Secret Service jamming; offshore broadcasting). If these claims are not sourced soon they should be removed. Also author should be warned about spamming links to Radio Rainbow around to other Pirate radio articles without sourcing his or her wild claims.<b>Abstain</b> pending further investigation (see below).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<li>I'm extremely surprised to see you voting Keep after just debunking the article on Talk:Radio Rainbow, but there we go&#160;:) He has <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPERSBUREAU_AZP_456f.html" title="User talk:PERSBUREAU AZP">been warned</a>, but I just spotted that the talk page was edited by the same name in lower case (<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersbureau_azp_17be.html" title="User:Persbureau azp">User:Persbureau azp</a>). --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:04, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Upon some further investigation, I withdraw that keep for now. There are quite a few uses of this name out there in the world. There is an Afropop station, a defunct streaming clubmix website, A yogi webcast, and a plethora of gay pride stations, all using the name. Furthermore, a quick check finds evidence of other pirate &amp; clandestine sites using the same name: <a href="http://193.63.162.100/7rainbow.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://193.63.162.100/7rainbow.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, <a href="http://www.clandestineradio.com/intel/station.php?id=65&amp;stn=51" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.clandestineradio.com/intel/station.php?id=65&amp;stn=51" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. These are apparently talking about 2 stations that are different from the one referenced in this article, one run by an Irish and one dedicated to Ethiopian issues transmitting from Germany. Still, some of the info from the article seems to be taken from these sites. The only other evidence is the blogspot site, but that isn't really evidence at all. I say all sorts of crazy stuff on my blog; that doesn't make it true. All of this is nudging me away from a Keep. Even if this station is demonstrated to be true, how is it any more notable than the dozen other stations/websites using the name?--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:24, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My findings were similar, but a few days or weeks ago (I've been dealing with this nonsense on the Caroline article for some time).

<p>As the author of this article i assume i shant be taken objectively, however- Gracie was not just a dog. She was a cultural symbol and a tool for parvo awareness. I believe the speedy deletion as a bio did not take these facts into consideration. I shall attempt to address the other issues, but that is the reason for my reposting. User: Coinman</p>

<dd>Well, that's sorta what Afd decides, isn't it? Personally, I don't think we need to worry too much about where to draw the line- we let our sources draw that line for us. If reliable sources aren't saying much about this mall, we won't have much to say about it either. But, for those that want a firmer guideline, we do have <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> for inclusion of companies. I see nothing in the article to indicate the mall company meets the guidelines.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This was the number 3 mod after CS and TFC for halflife 1 until DoD came out. It was on contract with valve for distribution with all new HL cd's I believe starting with game of the year edition. It was featured in PC Gamer magazine. Won mod of the year from PCGamer and runner up game of the year for 2000. Do a google search, and you'll come up with hundreds of hits. Go to forums.worldatwarmod.com, and you'll see a huge following on the Firearms section there for it.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This mod was among the most enduring Half-Life mods ever created, and still has a following to this day, nearly eight years after first being released. It also features a very innovative bipod system that I have yet to see used in another game, which allows bipods to be deployed at any point on a map. MrFiend497 05:12, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Whoever believes Firearms is an unnotable mod must either have a very short memory or not be aware of the facts listed above. Firearms was one of the premiere Half Life 1 mods and even today, eight years after its initial release, a strong player base supports it. Firearms is also the innovative game that brought the reinforcement (AKA, ticket) system, in game parachutes, a massive inventory of armaments, and true to life firemodes into computer games. Valve themselves offered to purchase Firearms during its prime. The only thing unnotable about this game is how interested the generic Counter-Strike player is with it.

<li><b>My apologies</b> Sorry, I didn't check into the article very well. As you see, the most played Enemy Territory (3rd most played FPS) modification got AfD'd (the article itself is good) because someone thinks it's unnotable. Yes, and I'm talking about people who don't know a tiny bit about games making useless bullshit into the deletion talk. I provided them with: magazine scans plus referance to two magazines featurin the mod with a full text and files included on a DVD, over 8 external communities and fansites, several leagues and clanwar meeting channels on Quakenet, number of players (300-400 at any given time, also taking to notice that it's the first _test version_ with irritating bugs which haven't been updated for over a year now! (0.49 will come out at the end of March, so you, as honorable gamers, know what would happen then - people haven't forgotten this mod; never, I haven't, I just don't play because it hasn't been updated, and oh-oho-ho HOW MANY players like me will come back when the new update hits download servers, with tons of improvements - take the number of players registered at the forums: 2000, so how many players do register at the forums? Maybe 50-60%, so it's your move now to decide its notability)). So, per their manners in handling notability, I decided to quickly check up some _definitely_ unnotable mods for BF/HL/etc and listed them all for AfD (if <a href="../../../e/l/i/True_Combat%7E_Elite_f033.html" title="True Combat: Elite">True Combat: Elite</a> is actually worth an AfD, then why wouldn't they be?). The thing is, that I didn't really read the articles and thought that 11-14 total AfDs from a very large list of mods wouldn't bring up so many "bad targets", but I was wrong. I'll remove the AfD. Apologies for this. --<b><font color="#FF4F00">nlitement</font> <sup><a href="../../../n/l/i/User_talk%7ENlitement_5351.html" title="User talk:Nlitement"><font color="#000000">[talk]</font></a></sup></b> 16:23, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>WITHDRAWN</b> by nominator (me). There's clearly no deletion concensus emerging.

<li>Can't argue with that logic. I maintain that it's quite a hopeless article, however. How about collecting all of these (as I'm sure there are others out there) in something like Beatles unreleased songs or Beatles outtakes? Another option, given it's apparent inclusion in the film <i>Let It Be</i>, is to merge it to <a href="../../../l/e/t/Let_It_Be_%28film%29_3a8a.html" title="Let It Be (film)">Let It Be (film)</a> which is currently a (promising) stub and which could use some padding. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 19:04, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The suggestion is good, only I would recommend teritorial, rather than temporal disambiguation: Kingdom of Kurdistan (Sulaymaniyah) and Kingdom of Kurdistan (Palu), because the time way may misleadingly say that it was one and the same, only at different time periods. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 19:24, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Please aloow me to respectfully disagree. "History of Kurds" is a big topic, with potentially a very big article. "Kingdom of Kurdistan" is a small but a separate topic. It is in wikipedia tradition to create separate articles by cutting fdrom big ones, not vice versa. The statement "can't grow" is also probably made in polemic haste. I am sure that in due time Allah will guide a Kurdish editor to expand the article. I am not an expert in this historic time and place, so I added only some basic details, but in fact I've already seen much more in the internet. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 19:12, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> no need for this poor quality article when <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html" title="History of the Kurds">History of the Kurds</a> exists and is a high quality article. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am afraid this opinion is made with poor judgement. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html" title="History of the Kurds">History of the Kurds</a>, as good as it is, does not say a <b>single</b> word about the topic you want to delete. And this is reasonable: such a general topic cannot be contained in a single article. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html" title="History of the Kurds">History of the Kurds</a> must be a broad overview, with details scattered in subpages. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 19:17, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My judgement is based on the following: - there exists an article called <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html" title="History of the Kurds">History of the Kurds</a> and in this article is a section called <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurds_00e1.html#Modern_History_of_the_Kurds" title="History of the Kurds">History_of_the_Kurds#Modern_History_of_the_Kurds</a> with a link to a main article called Modern history of the Kurds which is currently redlinked. The section in question covers the period 1828-present day. There currently isn't any reference to the two items of information in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Kurdistan_6a34.html" title="Kingdom of Kurdistan">Kingdom of Kurdistan</a> which are an attempt at independence from the British mandate which did not last long and an attempt at independence from Turkey which did not last long. These two pieces of information are part of the modern history of the Kurds and should be referenced there. An article about independence struggles in Kurdistan would have more than just two basic pieces of information and would not be called Kingdom of Kurdistan. There should in my view be an article on the modern history of Kurdistan and at most, the information presented in Kingdom of Kurdistan would be a small section within that. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 19:32, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The key words in your kind reply are "redlinked" and "should", which only confirm my opinion that the nomination for deletion was a bit of misunderstanding. You just don't delete information from wikipedia just because it should be a part of the article which <b>does not exist</b> yet. I am not in a position to evaluate the validity of the term "Kingdom of Kurdistan"; I may understand the position that if someone proclaims himself King, this does not necessarily mean that there is a "Kingdom". But this is a different issue, and again, you just <b>don't</b> delete a correct and significant information from wikipedia. We already have an article about <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Mahabad_bbfb.html" title="Republic of Mahabad">Republic of Mahabad</a>, which was just as shortlived. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 22:19, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmm.... <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Mahabad_bbfb.html" title="Republic of Mahabad">Republic of Mahabad</a> was also called kingdom of kurdistan... I for one am confused in this flood of 3 kingdoms with identical titles. Even a disambiguation page would be hard to create. Since all 3 of the kingdoms existed/ceased to exist repetively in the same time period. It is perfectly fine to explain this under a "modern hostory of kurds" rather than pathetic individual articles that cannot grow beyond stubs. Each article can hardly fill a stub.
<ul>
<li>Where was the RoM called the Kingdom of Kurdistan? Well, disambig pages are for clearing up confusion (ambiguity)!&#160;:) Again your baseless assertions that the articles can "hardly fit a stub", please prove this or refrain from reiterating it. We have huge articles on demonstrations that only lasted one day, so to say that a country or rebellion that lasted in one case 2 years and in another a number of months can't fill an article is pure propaganda. - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 09:19, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is lots of problems with the content as well. Those few issues mentioned in it which qualify as historical studies must be merged into another article.

<li>If you google the word "Shamezdin not much will be shown", but if you google the word "Nochiya" or "Assyrian AND Nochea" then alot of information will appear.

<li><b>KEEP</b> - The name change to 'Nochiya' makes a lot of sense because Nochiya is not just a geographical area, it is also an important Tribe of the Assyrians, who are currently leaders in both religous and political matters. Admitably, the information needs to be re-arranged to make sense, a clean up is required. Deleting this information would indeed be a loss for Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> - It is a very usefull article containing alot of information</li>

<p>I seen Cashville Records website and looked at it clearly. I believe that it's possible for it to true, but there is no official word from Interscope Records. Interscope has the say in that matter. To me, personally, it looks like a fan site devoted to Young Buck. The B.G. is in talks with G-Unit, but not a signed member of the group or an artist established to any label other than Chopper City Records, his own established label. I doubt B.G. would be a part of any label after Cash Money cheated him out of money. Not saying G-Unit would, but it's more likely he wouldn't. <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELILVOKA_f991.html" title="User:LILVOKA">LILVOKA</a>.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Right now I'm listening to a song called "Straight out of Ca$hville" released on Cashville records, by Young Buck, Ludacris, and the Game. If that's not notable (the 3 arguably hottest currently producing names in hip-hop) then I don't know what is. Young Buck is a rap star. Not just an average rapper, but a star. His label, therefore is also notable. Also, it's a derivative from G-Unit/Interscope Records, what anyone would consider a highly notable group. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 22:17, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This appears to be a hoax. Firstly, the user that created the article has a username very similar to the name of the article.

</ul>
<p><b>Now, coming to this discussions, there is again <i>no new information presented</i>:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There are several calims to "internet meme" status, but no evidence given to support these claims. As there is no agreed upon definition of what's a "meme" or what metric it is to be measured by, claims of this nature do not have <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiability.html" title="Falsifiability">falsifiability</a>. I'd suggest that this be taken up on the talk of the only relevent guideline, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28websites%29_4134.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (websites)</a>.</li>
<li>There are several complaints about "having too many AfDs" but this does not adress the article in question and is also impossible to refute. The simplest answer would be "no there haven't been" but that's not terribly satifying. As this is a systemic problem resulting from the <i>general</i> handling of AfD closure for contentions topics, this would best be adressed at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_977d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion</a>.</li>

<li><b>Response to comment</b>: There is nothing at all notable about this page to those outside of its home board. Many of the Keep votes from past nomintions for deletion came from board users who rarely use Wikipedia, that just voted Keep once they saw their so-called-meme was up for deletion.

<li><b>Dismiss this request for deletion</b>. I <i>am</i> from the board that this fad is from, and while this meme may not be notable in my own opinion, the mere fact that 2 administrators have decided to keep the page, as it currently stands, seems reason enough to me to leave this page alone. Seriously, just like <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a>, the page will continue to be nominated, and lack of concensus will still show. Certain memes are notable, certain memes are not. The community has twice failed to demonstrate a lack of notability in this meme. On another note, the community that spawned this meme has their own version of <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digg.html" title="Digg">Digg</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myspace.html" title="Myspace">Myspace</a>, and even a full Shoutcast radio station. They are a big community, dedicated to solidarity and expansion. They are not likely to sit down and watch this page die without a fight. Many of them, like me, are reliable members of Wikipedia, who contribute regularly, boldly, and in good faith. And as for notability, here is an article whose subject is much less notable, but still has survived one VfD, and thus was decided by the community to not be non-notable: Limecat. That's all I have to add. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a></strong><em><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Simpson</font></a></em> 21:11, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I don't agree with the relisting of this for AfD so close to the closing of the last one, but to play devil's advocate for a moment, 2 administrators did not <i>decide to keep the page</i>: there was simply not a consensus to delete based on the opinions rendered and the closing admins did the correct thing: labeled the AfD as no consensus and thus kept the article by default. Furthermore the notability of the community that spawned this meme is not what is being debated here and really has no bearing on the general notability of the meme. I suppose an admin could dismiss the AfD, but it's just going to happen again, so IMO it might as well play out. If this ends <i>No Consensus</i>, it needs a tag that it has survived deletion 5 times so people don't continue to AfD it.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:29, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Uh, that's a gross misrepresentation. The first debate was no consensus, the second was an improper speedy delete, the third was the only one that had a keep outcome, but that was keep/merge and there was little consensus (information could be kept, but really doens't need an article), and the last one had no consensus, mainly due to heavy vote padding.--<a href="../../../t/o/f/User%7EToffile_98ee.html" title="User:Toffile">Toffile</a> 17:45, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Intertwined with <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>, <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a>, <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBaum%27s_World_2f93.html" title="EBaum's World">eBaum's World</a>, drawball, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shigeru_Miyamoto_6a47.html" title="Shigeru Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, etc...too expansive to simply merge, too notable to delete. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronMasters_79bb.html" title="User:BaronMasters">BaronMasters</a> 20:37, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really. GameFAQs and its spinoffs are the only places this has notability. The fact that some people from LUE/LL got a printout of the ASCII signed by Miyamoto, took a picture of it taped to the eBaum's offices, and are trying to draw it on Drawball does not give it notoriety outside of the LUE/LL community. If several others not linked to LUE were also using it and referring to it as "LUEshi", it would be different.<br /></li>
<li>As it stands, this meme is virtually excLUEsive (see what I did there?) to GameFAQs, LUE, and its spinoffs, and the article's content does nothing to convince me otherwise. My biggest problem here, which I partially stated during the last VfD, is the fact that <i>LUE itself has been deemed not notable enough for its own article</i> (a decision which I personally disagree with, being a regular visitor myself). If the main originators of this meme can't even get their own article, why should their mascot get one? <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">WarpstarRider</a> 11:10, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, a lot of people do. LUE, unlike SA and 4chan, is not open to the public (although not by board concensus or vote), and so is quite secretive, appearing elitist and snobby to most of the surrounding communities. Oh, and here's another meme that should be deleted, if the "<i>zomg only oen comunitie uses it, LOLXD delte delete lue sux&#160;!!!oneone!!</i>" argument is considered valid: <a href="../../../o/s/-/OS-tan_f23e.html" title="OS-tan">OS-tan</a>. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a></strong><em><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Simpson</font></a></em> 20:49, 6 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not the best example you could've chosen. I've seen those used plenty outside of Futaba Channel. Plus the OS-tan subject includes a number of different characters, as opposed to a simple ASCII representation of Mario and Yoshi.<br /></li>
<li>Also, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a>. I have nothing against LUE; quite the opposite, if you read all of my previous comment. But if LUE itself can't get an article, I don't think this should either. It seems that most of the keep votes here either say "it's notable" with no supporting evidence, or voted to keep simply because it's been voted on with no consensus so many times already. I haven't seen a convincing argument yet as to why this deserves a standalone article. I'd much rather see an article for LUE made, then have the content here merged into it. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">WarpstarRider</a> 00:04, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The link to the smithsonian seems to have expired, and I am removing it and mention of his smithsonian display from the article unless someone can get a cached version that mentions him.

<li>Of course note that besides this, <b>ALL</b> his media coverage has come from no serious publication or entity viz a viz art or technology, but rather from hobbyist/enthusaist magazines.

<p>The result of the debate was delete.</p>
<p>With regards to very new contributors, Wikipedia welcomes with opens arms, however these discussion have two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "discovery" phase, in which evidence is found and presented, and</li>
<li>The "waffle" phase, in which the relevence of the evidence is debated.</li>
</ul>
<p>While everyone's "facts" are equal, the presumption is that more experianced wikipedians will be better able to judge how a particular article "fits" into wikipedia. Thus they are often given greater weight in waffling. In this discussion there was no <i>new</i> evidence presented, and the guideline for inclusions of websites was mentioned explicitly several times. I thank everyone for taking the time to contribute.<br />

<p>The following was left on Talk:Canadaka.net by PeterFinn. I am reposting here as it is only fair to have the original submitters comments listed. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames084_3305.html" title="User:James084">James084</a> 21:20, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, I am a US citizen and California resident who joined Canadaka.net as a member about a year ago. I've since donated US$100 to help keep the site running. It is not a pay-per-view site and the owner, Trevor May, is subsidizing the site as a labor of love. I posted the site when someone mentioned it was not on Wiki and the fact that the site has been noted on CBC &amp; CTV as having a measurable influence on the recent election and the Gomery affair (discussion of the affair was banned in Canada but this site stood up for free speech by posting links to US sites where content could be found). I'll be happy to learn about Wikifying the page and I will take responsibility for it. But I will also stand by my premise that not only is the site notable (at least in Canada) it is acknowledged as having an influence outside of the site itself. Delete the item if you must, but the site will continue to grow and it will play a greater role in the next issues facing Canada: a new defence policy, oil sands, US trade, and Parliamentary and Quebec Separatism elections.</p>
<p>Visit the site and check out the forums before making a decision. It is a serious site and the discussions are quite real. Thanks, Peter.</p>

But the 100K thing isn't listed as a criterion anymore. So we look at media citations — the claimed CTV and radio citations do seem to pan out, from what I can tell, and Alexa's webtraffic graph shows a <i>massive</i> spike in per-day page hits in late February, which clearly suggests <i>some</i> kind of media coverage happened around that time. (Though I would appreciate a few more verified coverage links, if possible.) So, while the sockpuppets swarming around this do give me pause, I'm willing to call it a cautious <b>keep</b>, although it does need some cleanup to conform to Wikipedia style, and I do reserve the right to change my mind if people don't start behaving. (And as for Canadian Democratic Movement, while it <i>looks</i> like an interesting site I'm not sure how, if at all, it meets any of Wikipedia's criteria.

<li><b>Keep</b>. User:Recon0 asked, "Has the person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in the specific field?" The answer is yes. First, as I wrote in the article, he created three works that are <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_treasures_of_Japan_d662.html" title="National treasures of Japan">National treasures of Japan</a>. Second, the article is part of the Missing Articles project, and I believe the reason is that there is an article on him in 1911 Britannica. Third, there is an article on the Japanese Wikipedia. Finally, a prestigious national museum and a historically prominent temple complex, as well as a Nobel-prize-winning author have collected his works. I'm confident that this dispels doubts about his lasting contribution to art. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 22:34, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree. The band appears to have a long list of albums (that aren't full length), and a google search of Kezia "protest the hero" returns nearly 1000 hits, while leaving the quotes off generates close to 10,000.

As for the NPOV, I simply transfered the Kezia section from the main <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protest_the_Hero_8e41.html" title="Protest the Hero">Protest the Hero</a> site to its own article because it was fairly large and didn't really belong on the Protest the Hero article site. The Story Line section was not written by myself. It should be noted that I am the primary authour of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protest_the_Hero_8e41.html" title="Protest the Hero">Protest the Hero</a> article however. --<a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBouyeeze_93be.html" title="User:Bouyeeze">Bouyeeze</a> 00:12, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> A wholesale copy from their website may constitute a Copyvio. I don't know though, so someone else may want to comment, or change the article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_my_leg_8d24.html" title="User:Not my leg">Not my leg</a> 00:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment on above</b> When I said I transfered the Kezia section from the main Protest the Hero site, I meant its wikipedia article site (<a href="../../../p/r/o/Protest_the_Hero_8e41.html" title="Protest the Hero">Protest the Hero</a>). Sorry for the confusion. --<a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBouyeeze_93be.html" title="User:Bouyeeze">Bouyeeze</a> 02:11, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> My mistake, I probably misread it. Obviously not copyvio if it cam from this site. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_my_leg_8d24.html" title="User:Not my leg">Not my leg</a> 17:01, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Never heard of them myself, but they appear to be a notable band, and the album really does exist, based on web searches (unlike a lot of articles about "planned" albums or movies which are basically vaporware). <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:17, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>-Their full-length Kezia has not yet been released in the USA, but they have begun touring there. They also are planning a UK tour--<a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBouyeeze_93be.html" title="User:Bouyeeze">Bouyeeze</a> 00:37, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Protest the Hero are an amazing band and this is their upcoming album I have just bought tickets to see them support Everytime I Die In the UK, I am confused as to why keeping this article is being debated!?</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm going to go ahead and remove the article deletion tag for <a href="../../../k/e/z/Kezia.html" title="Kezia">Kezia</a> since there is overwhelming support for keeping it. I'm going to remove it in about 6 hours in case there is any objection to me doing it. --<a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBouyeeze_93be.html" title="User:Bouyeeze">Bouyeeze</a> 18:37, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
