<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus, so keep.</b> Pity indeed the administrator who sorts this one out. It would seem to be the opinion of the keep voters that the article has indeed acquired referencing. This is often the goal of deletion nominations which rest on the question of referencing and verifibility (if it can be referenced, then it shall be kept). No clear consensus to delete; "cruft" has never been a criteria even though we've all done it at one time or another. On a further note, this is the third nomination in three months. Absent strong consensus this is not inappropriate, although a fourth nomination would need to address different criteria. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 15:27, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> This article is a textbook definition of original research. In its original nomination for deletion nearly a month ago, and in the defense mounted during the subsequent deletion review, the most convincing arguments to be kept were made by those suggesting that the material was good but that they would need to prepare citations from "games and several books" or from various other references. Since the time of the article's nominations coming up on three weeks ago, no efforts at improving the article's references have been made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lightsaber_combat&amp;diff=60514292&amp;oldid=57198551" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lightsaber_combat&amp;diff=60514292&amp;oldid=57198551" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, although the article has been actively edited by many editors. To me, this demonstrates a lack of interest in bringing this article up to Wikipedia verifiability standards. Other keep votes during the original AfD had no substantive policy support behind them, only using phrases such as "this is important" and "this is interesting" and "it does no harm" and "it really helps out my Jedi Academy clan" which offer no supportive Wikipedia policy for keeping an uncited, unverified original-research article on Wikipedia. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:51, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Clerical note.</b> I'm sure others will argue that I've nominated this again too soon. I disagree. Wikipedia's deletion policy states that "[t]here is no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations," and the community of Star Wars fan editors on Wikipedia have had several weeks since the original nomination was opened to improve this article with regards to its citation of sources and its verifiability. I do not consider this an "immediate" renomination. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:56, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>CLERICAL NOTE REGARDING MERGE AND/OR TRANSWIKI VOTES.</b> For those who would vote to merge and/or transwiki, please clarify whether or not your vote stands for preservation or elimination of the material, as some closing admins have in the past interpreted merging and transwiki-ing as keep and delete votes, respectively. Furthermore, please note that you may instead wish to vote either as a <b>straight keep</b> or as a <b>straight delete</b>, as <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat" class="external text" title="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat" rel="nofollow">Wookieepedia already has an article on lightsaber combat</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 18:15, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><small>When this nomination began, it was listed as <i>Lightsaber combat (second nomination)</i>. During the course of this nomination, it became clear that the article had been nominated once before under a different name. I went through and renamed <i>lightsaber combat'</i>s first nomination as a second nomination (correcting references), and then renamed this nomination as a third nomination (correcting references). However, when I nominated this, I was only aware of it having gone through one other nomination; I was assuming that when someone referred to it have gone through "two other nominations," one of the two they were referring was the article's deletion review. Hopefully, though, the matter is now clarified. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 15:42, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The AFD was closed 11 days ago as Keep, it hasn't even been two weeks, let alone several. This is ridiculous. 11 days is still too soon, especially if we're dealing with non-full time, non-professional editors. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 18:08, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>response</b> It has been three weeks since the date the article was first nominated — June 6, 2006 + 21 days (3 weeks) = June 27, 2006. Nothing prevented editors from cleaning up the article while it was being considered for deletion — in fact, that's often a common tactic used to save articles from deletion, as was seen in <i><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lost%7E_The_Journey_%28third_nomination%29_838d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lost: The Journey (third nomination)">Lost: The Journey</a></i> — when someone completely rewrote it during a deletion review of the article's second nomination, it pretty much saved the article — it was relisted and its third nomination looks to be either a straight keep or a keep by no consensus, when it was definitely going to the graveyard before. <i>Star Wars</i> editors have had the opportunity to rescue this article for three weeks now — they've done nothing to the article's citations, although they <b>HAVE</b> done a plethora of other wikilinking and tweaking. It's obvious there's no desire to bring this up to Wikipedia's verifiability standards, and so, it needs to come for community review again. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 18:21, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - When an article is threatened with deletion, most editors scurry around and do something to improve it within an hour or two. Three weeks is plenty.

I see no evidence of suppositions, no interpretive claims, no original ideas, just information compiled from many different pieces of fiction, all of which are verifiable as Lucas canon.

<li><b>Delete</b> - this is the definition of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. However, since it just survived an AFD and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_June_16&amp;diff=59854984&amp;oldid=59854029" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_June_16&amp;diff=59854984&amp;oldid=59854029" rel="nofollow">DRV</a>, you will probably have eleventy billion people citing the new <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">speedy keep</a> criteria where basically if you survive an AFD, you get a six-month get out of jail free card. At any rate, the patently wrong decision was made before. There are a disproportionately high number of redlinked users who basically said "keep because I like it". The concern that it is completely and totally original research was never addressed by anyone advocating keep in the first AFD. This is a textbook, obvious delete. If I were to write a similar article about a subject which did not have such devoted and loyal followers, it would probably be unanimous. Unfortunately, however, the popularity of Star Wars does not allow the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy to be violated. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 19:05, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Someone posted this a while back in a userbox debate ... it's a great quote ... from Alice in Wonderland ... I absolutely love it and it's very relevant to this discussion. <i>At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.' Everybody looked at Alice. `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice. `You are,' said the King. `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen. `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.' `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King. `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice. The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</i> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 19:50, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> First, sources mean nothing if they're not documented within the article itself. If you'd like to take the time to bring the article up to a situation where it's adequately referenced and sourced, all the more power to you. Second, there are articles on Wikipedia that have been nominated for deletion for five or more times, because despite being on a popular subject, they flagrantly violate one of Wikipedia's policies. This article is in the same vein. And lest you forget, Lord Hawk, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">as a Wikipedia editor, you are not supposed to engage in personal attacks</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 20:28, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please note that being "a great resource" is not a criterion for inclusion. There are plenty of things that are "great resources" that are not on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a free webhosting service. The Wookieepedia article - <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat" class="external free" title="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat" rel="nofollow">http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat</a> - covers basically the same content as this one. The Virginia Tech message board is a "great resource" of football knowledge, but I wouldn't suggest pasting everything that everyone says there into a Wikipedia article. Further, I would remind you of the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> policies.

<li><b>Response</b> <s>Putting aside the issue that a comment such as the one you've made above <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumes bad faith</a> on my part,</s> deletion policy specifically states that there's not even a <i>consensus</i> for a specific time between nominations, and three weeks to sufficiently clean up an article strikes me as plenty when you're dealing with a fan community as robust and active and defensive of their articles as Wikipedia's Star Wars fan community is. Furthermore, an article that does not verify its content and that contains original research, as said above, contains problems that, <i><b>by policy</b></i>, automatically supercede community consensus. Finally, the community's "consensus" last time was largely a matter of ballot-stuffing by individuals whose supportive reasoning made no cites to Wikipedia policy and, with most votes, directly contradicted same. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 11:35, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not at all clear why you think I am assuming bad faith, although you are clearly assuming bad faith regarding my vote- further demonstrated by your attempts to move my comment out of context. A renom 11 days after a close = a speedy renom. I see no need for it following a keep result. In those cases, I always vote speedy keep, which is perfectly valid and in no way precluded by policy. It also does not in any way reflect on you, particularly as I have no idea what motivated your renom. I would suggest you try to WP:AGF regarding all participants in this discussion. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 16:53, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think I may have been a little hairtrigger the <i>first</i> time I accused you of assuming bad faith, JJay, and for that, I'll withdraw the comment here and apologize to you; but the above portion of your comment — "further demonstrated by your attempts to move my comment out of context" — <i>is</i> a textbook assumption of bad faith. I also honestly have no idea what you mean when you suggest I'm assuming bad faith behind your vote itself — I'm instead saying that you have no supportive guideline for <i><b>speedy</b></i> keep, which is a very specific item, outlined at <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a>. Just as if someone votes to speedy-delete in a discussion, they need to provide why it matches under the speedy-delete guidelines (and not just general deletion guidelines), if you vote speedy keep in a discussion, you need to provide why it matches under the speedy-keep guidelines (and not just general keep guidelines). As for moving your comments, it was not to "move them out of context," as you suggest, but because the first time you wrote the above comment, you gave it a single bullet. That placed it not as a reply, but as a new comment in the main stream of the discussion. Votes and comments are supposed to be kept in chronological order in an AfD, per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDM_d240.html" title="WP:AFDM">WP:AFDM</a>. However, I wouldn't have messed with a message thread, and had you had a double-bullet, indicating your comment was a corollary to your vote, I wouldn't have moved it. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:06, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for your apology. You should be aware that WP:SK is a guideline. Editors choose to apply it or not, but there is nothing binding in a guideline. WP:CSD is policy. It is not a guideline and should not be equated with speedy keep. They are very different beasts. I have repeatedly indicated why I voted speedy keep- my thinking here is not at all unusual, and does not have to be explicitly included in the guideline page. Otherwise, I do not think it is proper for you to move comments on the page, whether double bulleted, single bulleted, or no bulleted. This is a discussion - one that you started - not an art project. Frankly, I think you need to focus less on style guidelines and more on the crux of the matter - namely that there is no consensus to delete this article. That was the case two weeks ago and is still the case today. Despite self serving comments like "I just want to gauge community opinion", the fact is that repeated renoms waste everyone's time. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:28, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>To respond to your comment:
<ol>
<li>A guideline is "something that is: (1) actionable and (2) authorized by consensus" (<a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">WP:RULES</a>). My sense of it has always been that it is semi-policy: it can be countermanded, but only with good reason.</li>
<li>My citation of <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a> was basically to denote that your "speedy keep" vote is exactly equivalent to a "keep" vote; the "speedy" adjective prepending your vote had no supporting weight to it in the <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a> guideline. I believe the only policy reference to "speedy keep" is in a section of <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> where it refers to "if a clear consensus for non-deletion is quickly reached." That instance would be an end result a closing admin would come to when closing a matter early, not a result an individual editor could vote for.</li>
<li>With regards to whether or not it is proper to move comments to improve readability, that was already decided on Wikipedia a very long time ago by community consensus — yes, it is perfectly acceptable to refactor a discussion to make it more readable.</li>
<li>With regards to your comments about it not being an "art project," your belief that I've made "self serving comments," and your belief that this nomination "waste[s] everyone's time," I would appreciate it if you would <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">remain courteous</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">not attack me personally</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 03:36, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Mike, given your clear propensity for wiki lawyering, it would have at least been intellectually honest to cite the second line of WP:Rules, namely: <i>Guidelines are not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception</i>. There was eminent common sense in my speedy keep, designed to prevent the writing of hundreds of lines of text in a sterile debate ten days after the close of a previous discussion on the same topic. Therefore, I would ask that you stop trying to impugn the validity of opinions on the opposite side of the aisle. Regarding your remark on refactoring, moving an obvious response to a comment to a completely different part of the discussion does not help "readability". It lessens readability. It creates confusion. You should desist from moving comments on this page and not edit war when your moves are reverted. I'm also not sure why you continue to harp on civ, npa, etc, etc. Challenging the validity of someone's vote, and then displacing an explanatory comment, is likely to provoke a reaction. It is not personal, despite your continued assertions to the contrary. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 13:29, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To respond to your comment:
<ol>
<li>Wikilawyering (<a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WP:WL</a>) is defined as "[u]sing legal terms inappropriately regarding Wikipedia policy" or "[a]sserting that technical interpretation of Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines should override the principles they express." You've not cited principles I've attempted to override with technical interpretations. If you are calling me a wikilawyer simply because I am familiar with Wikipedia policy and am responding with it when disagreeing with you, I don't believe that qualifies.</li>
<li>With your regard to my quotation of <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">WP:RULES</a>, I paraphrased the second sentence you cited by immediately saying thereafter "it can be countermanded, but with good reason." That was my sense of the phrase based on the term "<i><b>occasional</b></i> exception" (emphasis added). Therefore, I don't think you can validly call me intellectually dishonest.</li>
<li>With regard to moving the comment, I moved a comment which replied to my message to an indented spot underneath my message. This is how it is done in Wikipedia nearly universally. It is not only permitted by the guidelines, it is a common action performed by numerous Wikipedia editors every single day.</li>
<li>I am not attempting to impugn the validity of opinions on the opposite side of the aisle. Please do not use straw man arguments when disagreeing with me.</li>
<li>Despite your citations of "eminent common sense," I again do not see any justification for calling your remark a "speedy" keep. I was not arguing that prepending the adjective "speedy" made your vote worthless (again, a straw man argument), only that it was of no practical difference from a normal "keep" vote.</li>
<li>Finally, I am "harping" on one of the core pillars of Wikipedia (pillar #4 of <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a>, also see <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRI_cf98.html" title="WP:TRI">policy trifecta</a>) because you appear not to be respecting it, once again with your phrase "clear propensity for wiki lawyering," as well as with the implication that I was intellectually dishonest, and the poor characterization of my actions. And even were we to assume that I had done a wrong to you, a point I do not concede nor agree with, being wronged is not considered acceptable grounds here for <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">being rude</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personally attacking someone</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 14:07, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Sorry, but you moved my response to your comment to a completely different part of the discussion, while leaving your comment in its original place. Here is your diff to refresh your memory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FLightsaber_combat_%28third_nomination%29&amp;diff=60822116&amp;oldid=60817432" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FLightsaber_combat_%28third_nomination%29&amp;diff=60822116&amp;oldid=60817432" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. By so doing, you created enormous confusion. You destroyed the readability of the exchange. You forced me to review numerous diffs to try to figure out what happened to my comment. You forced me to restore my comment to its original place in the discussion. You also added a comment implying that I was trying to vote twice. This was a significant waste of my time, and attack on my character, but then you went further by edit warring over the change. Otherwise, as far as I am concerned, the tenor of many of your responses here, such as the one above, demonstrate a continued focus on wiki lawyering. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:23, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To reply to your comment:
<ol>
<li>Either a comment is made separately, in which case it is then moved to chronological order within a discussion, or it is a comment made in reply to a statement, in which case it is indented properly to show that it is a reply. I moved your comment to chronological order; when you made clear it was underneath my comment as a reply, I indented it for you to denote that it was a reply. This sort of formatting is longstanding and frequently enacted in AfD by numerous editors every day, and is widely considered acceptable.</li>
<li>I believe your following comments that employ heavy hyperbole — "enormous confusion," "destroyed readability," "significant waste," and so on — really do not have any meat in them to which I can respond. They are very much your opinion, as counter to normal deletion practices as that may be.</li>
<li>I find it odd that it took you "many diffs" to locate your text quickly given that most browsers have within them the ability to look for text within a webpage — it is something I frequently do when my own comments have been refactored or are not where I expected them.</li>
<li>It appears to me that simply responding to you while citing policy to support one's response is enough for you to label it as "wikilawyering." If that is not the case, I would appreciate what guidelines you use to differentiate wikilawyering from the simple action of citing supportive Wikipedia policy in a policy discussion.</li>
<li>With regard to your comments about the tenor of my arguments, I cannot say that I have been impressed by the manner in which you have decided to present yourself during this disagreement, either. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 14:46, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you think a perceived missing bullet authorizes you to move comments on the page, start edit wars, and waste my time, more power to you. You are clearly someone who relishes argument and looks for every shred of a line in a policy, guideline, or essay- linked and selectively quoted over and over - to try to support their point of view. You also continually make accusations of incivility whenever anyone disagreees with you. None of this is not my approach. Good luck in the future. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:59, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDM_d240.html" title="WP:AFDM">WP:AFDM</a> allows anyone to move comments on the page in certain ways in order to improve the readability of comments and their responses. I think whether an edit war was started is a subjective comment on your part. I think only you have a metric as to how your time is wasted. The remainder of your comments were <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, and thus not able to be responded to.

That's fine. But this one is ... overboard. An article discussing lightsaber's usage in the movies would be one thing ... but this one is describing terms that never appear in the movies and techniques that never appear in the movies. It would be like if someone started writing articles on all of the stuff in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Star_Trek_Star_Fleet_Technical_Manual_9642.html" title="The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual">The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual</a> and other related books. If the term never appears in an episode/movie, then I just have a hard time seeing it as having interest outside of the Star Wars world. I love Star Wars. I have the movies. I saw the prequels on the day they came out. I'm not some anti-sci-fi guy desparate to delete anything and everything sci fi. Lightsabre combat is fine for a topic ... but maybe the article could be restructured so that it just discusses actual scenes from the movies.

<li>Yes. Sure. You're reading <b>way too much</b> in to what is fun, kiddies entertainment. Star Wars is not a philosophy, a way of life, its a series of childrens movies. They're fun. They're not documents to be intertextually analysed based on the writings of people with way too much free time. There can be nothing interesting to be said about the movies based on these post-hoc inventions and rationalisations of its over-excitable fans. The Star Wars "canon" doesn't even rise to the level of Tolkien's writings on Middle Earth; Tolkien, at least, had a motive for invention beyond profit, and the intelligence to weave interesting themes into his mythos. Lucasfilm is a machine for churning out vaguely-coherent product for gullible fanboys. Feel free to write as much about these meritless, fan-driven "interpretations" at Wookieepedia, and leave wikipedia for things that have an existence and importance beyond bored college kids in internet chatrooms. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>

<dd>Which of the sources are not "Reputable"? The web pages are in general either official in and of themselves, or are copies of official material; and I have absolutely no idea why you are objecting to the quotations from novels, legitimate published canon sources. The article is not original research; all of it is/can be sourced (and indeed, in a number of cases I had to tweak text to shy away from plagiarism, which is as <i>unoriginal research</i> as you get). As it is not OR, your NOT contention is irrelevant, and I believe I've established that this subject is neither OR as everyone keeps chanting and also not an "over-analysis" (see my discussion with Gareth Owen and the sources in the article); assertions that the used websites and novels are somehow not references for this article (but references for other articles) smack of a double standard to me. Incidentally, being "an example of the systemic bias" on Wikipedia is not a deletion criteria. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 22:02, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A reliable source would be a book, or article, on the subject. Now, if the article is based on "Fightsaber: Jedi Lightsaber Combat" and the like, and if <i>Star Wars Insider</i> is considered a reliable source on Star Wars, all would be well. Is it&#160;? If not, it looks original research. Another <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> problem is the vast list of neologisms (shiim, jung ma, so chung).

<li>Oblivionboy, your argument isn't very helpful- the primary reason proffered for deleting this article is that it is unreferenced and made up by its editors; simply saying that it <i>could</i> be "substaniable" does not blunt their argument.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I earlier objected to how quickly this current AFD came about, and I was rebutted by Mike with the example of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lost%7E_The_Journey_%28third_nomination%29_838d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lost: The Journey (third nomination)">Lost: The Journey</a>. That was an anecdote, an extreme example which no argument was made for why it was the <i>ideal</i> way OR issues should be resolved. Frankly, to properly source this article, if it was legitimate, would be a monumental task. It is long and filled with detail, seemingly cobbled together (by me, at least) with numerous sources, adding those sources is not something I would do in my spare time. Yet, with this AFD, editors are being forced to do so. This AFD is a virtual revolver pointed at the article with a threat saying "edit this or this dies". People who value this information and could add the appropriate sources are forced to edit this page to an acceptable point. I don't agree with forcing editors to work and make edits. It's unfair and against the spirit of cooperation, with editors forcing the hand of their peers.<br />
<br />
Now, going into the article history, at the time this AFD was listed there were two line-items within External links referencing "Star Wars: Attack of the Clones The Visual Dictionary" and "Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith The Visual Dictionary". I believe this (improperly formatted) sourcing is enough to establish that "Lightsaber combat" is an actual concept that has been structured, explored and documented by people at Lucasfilm. The keep votes from previous AFD established its notability. Both points should save the article from deletion. In my view, the proper thing to do here is to wipe the page clean save for the few sentences that are so general they could be verified, tell the talk page or Wikiproject Star Wars what you've done, and asked they go through the page history and copy and paste the sections of the article that could be verified, along with the right source. It takes more work than a simple AFD, but it's the procedure outline in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>. Instead, the AFD route was opted, a route that <b>failed twice already</b>. If those sources were contested as false, then that is a completely different matter that to me would merit a third AFD. But it wasn't, and it smelled like an attempt for consensus by attrition (per Kotepho).<br />
<br />
Over the last two days or so, if you check the page there is a growing number of bracketed numbers in superscript, I believe they qualify as proper sourcing. Maru, <b>thank you</b> for your work, I think you went above and beyond what editors are meant to do on this encyclopedia. I was suspecting this AFD had more to do with the tastes of editors (witness the instances of "fancruft" in this AFD, irrelevant because again its notability was established by older AFDs) than actual <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> issues. I know <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sets a high bar which can translate to a "guilty until proven innocent" requirement. Still, I'm unsettled about raising the bar higher to the point where proper formatting, a matter as trivial as grammer and spelling, is required. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 05:28, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> An encyclopedia article on Wikipedia should be appropriately referenced. That is not a choice, that is a mandate, and it is one that has existed from the beginning of the project. Articles on Wikipedia that are not appropriately referenced do not belong on Wikipedia. That is, again, a mandate that has existed from the beginning of the project. Whether or not you believe articles that do not currently fulfill Wikipedia requirements should be allowed to stay in the mainspace indefinitely while they grow is a difference of wikiphilosophy: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:eventualism">eventualism</a> versus <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/immediatism" class="extiw" title="m:immediatism">immediatism</a>. It is a debate that has no more chance of being resolved than those between <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/deletionism" class="extiw" title="m:deletionism">deletionists</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/inclusionism" class="extiw" title="m:inclusionism">inclusionists</a>. Any Wikipedia editor, however, is required to be civil to their fellow editor and to assume that that person means well; I would therefore suggest that using such melodramatic hyperbole as "virtual revolvers" isn't useful. Moreover, it's not accurate: content is not killed when it is deleted. Even if already deleted, any administrator is happy to retrieve and then userfy an article (move an article, with its edit history intact, to someone's userspace) so that it can be worked on in a non-"live" atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Your argument then goes on to suggest that I nominated this article on the basis of lightsaber combat not being a Lucasfilm concept (even were we to assume that the existence of 'visual dictionaries' amongst the vast array of Star Wars merchandise was somehow indicative of the concept of formally denoted styles of lightsaber combat being officially endorsed), or it not being a notable concept, or even nominating it due to spelling and grammar issues. I did not nominate this article based on same. I sent it to deletion review because I believed the closing administrator in the second nomination allowed sheer numbers to blind him to a bevy of extremely poor arguments (such as the infamous "Jedi Academy clan" remark). I renominated it for deletion because people made absolutely no effort to improve the article in the three weeks since it was originally up for deletion by Milkandwookies. And, to make it clear, like others here, I agree that <i><b>extensive</b></i> quotations from <i><b>novels</b></i> whose canonicity has not been well-established is insufficient to rescue this article from the venue of original research. <b>Obviously, others here will disagree with me, but if the closing administrator reads these particular words, I would respectfully ask them to look at the quality of the references, not just merely the fact that the article in question has now been referenced.</b><br />
<br />
Furthermore, lightsaber combat is neither a source of interest or expertise to me, so I would not enjoy rewriting this article, nor would I be of help rewriting this article, nor is such a rewrite required of me. If you feel policy requires same of me, I would appreciate specific cites. I enjoy the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy and do not agree with GWO with regards to his commentary about those who do, but I simply do not believe that the subject of this article is able to be saved in a way that its content would be supported by Wikipedia's policies as to what it should and should not contain. My action to nominate it a second time for deletion was thus, in my eyes, an entirely appropriate way to handle the article in question.<br />
<br />
With regards to a "guilty until proven innocent" requirement for articles, perhaps more accurately described as "considered unverified until actually verified" requirement, yes, that is required by Wikipedia's policy: "The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain."<br />
<br />
Finally, with regards to your comments how you believe the matter "smells" and it dealing with the "tastes of editors," I think one of the most disillusioning aspects of the debates I have engaged in with regards to articles I've nominated for deletion is the large number of people who chose to disagree rudely and in a personal way. Very few people had the sheer class, such as Nick Cook did, to keep the matter a civil exchange on policy and reasoning, with a final resolution to agree to disagree. Instead, the vastest majority of people have chosen to accuse those supporting deletion of massive malicious intent, conspiracy, and a host of other silliness. It makes people such as Mr. Cook stand out as class acts, and it illuminates the very sorry state of affairs upon Wikipedians' attitudes towards Wikipedia's requirements that its participating editors <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">be courteous to each other</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume that the person holding an opposing belief to yours means well, even if they disagree with you</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 15:13, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

For this article I count now over 35 just for this page, which seems exceptional for me even for normal wikipedia articles. Surely this meets the requirements of even such a dedicated editor as yourself. Also I feel that trying to polarize the issue into bioptional points prevents a possible larger view of the issue. My question would not be option A vs option B (eventualism versus immediatism), but rather what are all the options. Instead of delete-ism, what are the other options, what would it take to bring this article up to standard? After all, even if you got it deleted, someone would be able to come back and just recreate it again, even if under a different title. Hardly a win-win situation for all of us.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>, the article is mostly original research. It is also named for an *imaginary* action. As far as I'm aware, there has never been any actual lightsaber combat. No soldier has ever gone into battle wielding a lightsaber. Lightsaber stunt work... yes... lightsaber combat... no. After committing this basic error, the article then evolved by, in large part, being written as if fighting with lightsabers is a real subject and Jedi Knights are real. I'm waiting for the next article, "X-Wing piloting", to come along and further degrade any credibility Wikipedia has as an encyclopedia written by people with both feet in the real world. This article needs to be deleted and then restarted as a more correctly named encyclopedia article <i>about</i> the stunt work for the lightsaber fights in Star Wars... who worked on them, and so on. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 15:47, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I think that it IS the point. This article is not about filmmaking (the art and the science), rather its objective is to add information to a fictional universe that people might be interested in. I think its completely releveant from that perspective, and the delete call originated from whether or not the article "was just made up" or had actual referenes in order to substantiate itself. Not if it was "imaginary" or not. A subtle difference for some people perhaps. Naturally you are more than welcome to start a page on the stunt work in the starwars movies if you're interested. I'd certainly like to read it too.&#160;:) However the larger question of if wikipedia should only contain articles on "real" things, or "fictional" things (Hemmingway's characters are fictional yet are articled in Wikipedia), is perhaps a debate out of scope for this discussion - <a href="../../../o/b/l/User%7EOblivionboy_4ebe.html" title="User:Oblivionboy">oblivionboy</a> (<a href="../../../o/b/l/User_talk%7EOblivionboy_fe6e.html" title="User talk:Oblivionboy">talk)</a> 20:14, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The issue is not whether Wikipedia should contain articles on fictional subjects... it is whether those articles should be named and written as if they are real subjects. This article commits both of those major crimes against an encyclopedia. If Star Wars fans cannot separate fact and fiction enough to write a suitable article, then it should be deleted... no matter how much work has gone into it, and no matter how many fans show up to shout "keep". As much as you might like it to be, this is not a Star Wars fan site, it is an encylopedia. Wookiepedia exists to allow Star Wars fan to play these sorts of imagination games. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 21:17, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're kidding, right? Pull the other one, it's got bells on it. The article states in the <u>very first line</u> "Lightsaber combat is the <i>fictional</i> style of lightsaber fighting used by Jedi and Sith in the Star Wars franchise." Fictional, and Star Wars. It is categorized as a <b>Fictional</b> martial art. What more do you want to ensure people don't inadvertently think this is real - besides the whole solid light thing. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 22:11, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, So what? Just sticking "fictional" in the introduction does not solve it. Read the rest of the article, and look at the name of it. If you added a disclaimer at the top saying that "this article has been written by people who have difficulty telling real from imaginary", it still wouldn't work because disclaimers shouldn't really be necessary in an encyclopedia. The article is fundamentally inappropriate (hopeless would be another way to describe it), by its name and by the style in which it was written. It should be deleted and restarted as an encyclopedia article that is both named and written from a real world perspective. The only reason it's survived this long is fan voting. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 07:57, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, Do you hav any idea how many thousands of articles would need to be deleted under that logic? There are many hundreds in each of the Star Wars, Star Trek, and Tolkien universes that exhibit these same tendencies (just to name the fandoms that I follow). While I am sympathetic to the need to maintain the focus on the "real world", there is <b>clear</b> community consensus for inclusion of these articles. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 12:57, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is far more notable than a number of other fictional topics covered on Wikipedia, and it's no longer primarily OR. I can also think of a number of reasons non-Star Wars fans would be interested in this; Gillard's work developing lightsaber combat for the SW prequels is pretty important to anyone researching, say, modern stage combat, or fight choreography in American films. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenelope_D_a4b7.html" title="User:Penelope D">Penelope D</a> 04:06, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Wikipedia's policy allows as many nominations as needed, and the reasons used for this nomination were not only acceptable but perfectly justified.

<li>I'm just being short and to the point, not intentionally incivil per-se. Apologies if it seemed that way. What I'd like to know is what is the point of re-nominating in rapid succession like this? You could see volunteer time as a kind of donation to us.

<li>No hard feelings -- and that's a nice way to think about editors' time, and I'll have to keep that perspective in mind in future interactions. But my reason for renominating it was that people had obviously had time to work on the article since the article's second nomination — but evidently the community chose not to work on it in a way that would bring it up to community standards. It was that that led me to believe a third nomination this shortly after the second would be appropriate. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 00:41, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
