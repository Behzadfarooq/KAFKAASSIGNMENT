<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>. Sorry, but there isn't a sufficiently overwhelming majority for deletion here to be called 'consensus', and lists like this <i>can</i> be sourced - the counterpart for films is significantly better-sourced than this. This list isn't <i>intrinisically</i> unverifiable.</p>
<p>Given the concern expressed over this list's sourcing (most if not all delete supporters cite this as their reasoning, and many supporters also admit that this is a problem), I encourage editors to be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> and remove every single song that doesn't cite a reliable, well-respected source. Don't worry, you probably won't have to spend the next few weeks defending your edits - in my experience, when people find lists in Wikipedia they add their own pet thoughts and then never look at the article again, so if you remove those thoughts you don't encounter any opposition. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 03:49, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. Unbelievable this article is now in its 3rd afd nomination. Wikipedia is not a free webhosting service for "funny" lists dreamed up in your spare time <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:15, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> per nom.</s> <b>Keep</b> - the arguments presented by others for keeping are convincing, particularly those presented by Captainktainer.

<li>Good point, I'm actually starting to think it should.

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the article cites sources and is not POV, it is referable to polling, sales and the like. Same applies largely for the others. This will always invite debate, but the listings are not referable purely to the editors' opinions. I would definitely vote delete if this were a ranking page, but it is merely a list of some songs that have garnered spectacularly bad reputations, reviews and opinions. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 02:09, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see any problem with this, since much of the content is cited and based on things like polls and media coverage. I also don't think this and the other similar lists should be continually nominated for deletion even after being kept through previous AfD attempts. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmazinglarry_1a7d.html" title="User:Amazinglarry">Amazinglarry</a> 04:06, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> It is bad procedure to keep renominating articles for a start. This is not <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a> as it clearly cites sources such as:</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The contributors have done a good job sourcing their statements and providing relevant context, which is what an encyclopedia <i>should</i> do. If there's a problem with selection bias, the appropriate response is "fix it," not "delete it." If you don't have time, that's fine, but don't deny someone else the opportunity to fix the article. I'd also like to second the "bad form on nom" comments. Continually renominating things for AfD because the "right" consensus wasn't achieved is just wrong. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 17:33, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, the last times this article was nominated were in November and December 2005, so I don't see what the problem is in nominating it again over 6 months later especially when the majority of the problems mentioned in the last two AfDs were not fixed and it continues to fail NPOV and NOR miserably. There are thousands of polls constantly taken all across the world by many different organizations (television shows, magazines, websites, critic lists, etc). Even if a song is voted #1 on some random worst song poll, I don't see how it is automatically eligible to be considered the worst ever. This article picks and chooses certain songs to display. Many statements are opiniated and do not even mention sources and others that do, do not even provide a link to the actual poll data. No matter how much cleanup it goes through, it will always be an extremely POV list. This is as unencylopedic as it gets. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">Musicpvm</a> 17:53, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - unencyclopedic. We've been through this before with other lists. Where does it end? "List of songs in English that someone doesn't like"? "List of songs in English that make someone want to puke"? The whole thing about "indiscriminate lists" is that a list should be helpful in some fashion. Lists like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_00_ZIP_codes_b43b.html" title="List of 00 ZIP codes">List of 00 ZIP codes</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Acts_of_Parliament_in_Singapore_b307.html" title="List of Acts of Parliament in Singapore">List of Acts of Parliament in Singapore</a> may not be particularly encyclopedic, but they serve a function - they show redlinked articles that need to be created. Something like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NCAA_college_football_rivalry_games_1c50.html" title="List of NCAA college football rivalry games">List of NCAA college football rivalry games</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NCAA_Division_I-A_Football_Programs_9349.html" title="List of NCAA Division I-A Football Programs">List of NCAA Division I-A Football Programs</a> is useful, because it shows you more information than you can get out of just a category.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This article is woefully subjective, and as tired an argument as it is, I don't see how this article could ever truly be made neutral.

<li><b>Delete</b>. We are building an encycolpedia here! Collecting indviduals comments in this manner feels very much like OR. And then we have personal/non-source opinions like <i>Photograph's cloying, obvious sentimentality and omnipresence on radio in early 2006 led to it being named by some as the benchmark of bad songs for the twenty-first century.</i> Really! <a href="../../../i/n/n/User%7EInner_Earth_8c4b.html" title="User:Inner Earth">Inner Earth</a> 22:08, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as there is precedent.

<li>Thanks. Reading the article I have one editorial comment: There is no such thing as consensus in matters of musical taste. I might say Keep but only if this list can be renamed and restricted to songs that have been <i>voted</i> worst songs in meaningful polls (with a definition what <i>meaningful</i> entails). Barring this, I have to go with <i>Delete</i> as indiscriminate list. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 02:36, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That wouldn't quite work as some of these were not "voted" on. The title would need to be something like List of songs labeled worst ever.

<li><b>Please note</b>. I have just been through the article and deleted the editor's own descriptions of the songs (which I feel are probably accurate as it happens). However, he does give the source of the "worst song" tag in each case, so it is not <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a> (i.e. it's not his choice), not is it <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>, as it's not his opinion.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem here is that the author has simply picked and chosen whatever entries he dislikes from these lists and included them in this article. That is both <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>. The only possible way this article can avoid violating both these policies is if the article was rewritten to show the top five or top ten of various "worst song lists" from reputable sources, ie VH1, BBC, Rolling Stone, etc. However, in that case, it is merely listcruft, and violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as it would be an indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 16:20, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I've just spent some time trying to tidy up the article - deleting sections which have no sources or which are contradictory. Putting in references and links.

I like the humour. I can see how such articles can become popular. But if we want Wikipedia to be taken seriously then we have to say that articles like this are great fun, but they belong in a general interest magazine and not an encyclopedia. As much as any of us like them personally and want them to remain, they do nothing good for Wikipedia's credibility. Such articles are the one's the media focus on when it comes time to drag Wikipedia's name through the mud. For the greater sense of what serious editors are attempting to achieve on Wikipedia we have to let these tongue-in-cheek, trivial articles fall by the wayside. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 22:18, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Forgive me, but I'm not seeing the excellent citations a bunch of you are mentioning. The criteria for inclusion are vaporous and subjective (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), and two of the six sources cited are nothing more than lyrics pages. I hate to say this, but I'm not convinced of the article's encyclopedic notability, or of its factual objectivity, or if it even has any capacity to <i>become</i> factually objective. There's evidence of cherry-picking by editors -- one source lists 100 songs, another 50, another 40, and the last one 20; how, then, do we find the article itself listing 21 songs, if not by an editor's own opinions? See <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> again, along with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. One of the sources is even a forum, which runs afoul of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As I see it, none of the pages cited make any serious effort to provide the means by which they've designated any of these songs as "the worst ever," and none of them strike me as particular authorities on the matter. Citing a few op-ed pieces from an incredibly minute sample of mostly-unheard-of websites doesn't quite cut it, for my tastes.

<li><b>Comment</b> To the people electing "Keep", please explain how the current "cleaned-up" version of this list passes <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> - it still contains such blatant POV as "Aqua's satirical dance number is not strictly noted as the worst..." (so it should <i>NOT</i> be in this list) and "'Disco Duck'... Near the top of The Book of Rock Lists' list of worst #1 hits" (so it should <i>NOT</i> be in this list), and that's just the first few lines. This list must use solid verifiable criteria for inclusion, or it is just obvious editorial picking-and-choosing per Luna Santin et al. These two examples prove the point categorically. Since no such selection criteria have been asserted or seem likely ever to be asserted, this is an obvious Delete as intrinsic NPOV and NOR failure with no hope of credible fix-up. <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#Lists_and_criteria_for_inclusion_of_list_members" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST#Lists and criteria for inclusion of list members</a> is absolutely clear on this. It is not enough when it comes to lists to cite a random unnotable source per entry - criteria must be clear, self-evident and unbreakable from the start, and must apply to <i>every</i> entry in the list. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 11:15, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The simple solution is to establish criteria and apply them, e.g. the song must have been called the worst ever by an individual of note, or it must have been called the worst ever on a notable medium such as TV, radio, press etc., or it must have topped a worst ever poll. The top three or five songs of such a poll could be a cut-off point. Anything else should be deleted from the article. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 05:53, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alright, I'll bite the bullet and check the citations, to back up my arguments.

I'll go through and list the rankings in that order (C4, Maxim, FR,PCM). A number is the song's placement on a list; an x means the song does not appear on the list; a yes/no applies to FR, which did not order their list.</li>

<dd>As we can see, six of the songs mentioned appear nowhere on the cited pages, and five of the songs only appear in one of the cited pages; that's half the page that's barely or never mentioned in the references. I'm curious how we listed #1, #2... then #6... and suddenly jump from #9 to #43, with regards to one page -- subjective cherrypicking, anyone? Maxim, probably the most notable source, is only used once. One source is a blog or forum, and isn't really admissable as a source... but that's one of the most-used sources in this article (removing it as a source puts seven more songs into the only-one-mention group, upping the ante to at least 18 of 21 songs we might call inadequately sourced). There doesn't appear to be any strong consensus between the cited pages, and I <i>seriously question</i> the argument that the pages cited represent any serious majority opinion among notable critics and organizations. If somebody wants to keep this sort of content, I'd encourage very strict criteria and listification to the effect of "songs called worst by X," instead of a central list (though a central list might link to other lists). The centralized page seems too high of a POV risk, to me, even before we address questions of notability. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 11:16, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, provided that songs included are derived from lists from *reputable* sources, eg Rolling Stone or whatever recognised music publications there are. Nothing from people's random blogs or bulletin boards should be included. And it shouldn't just be a case of "critic X doesn't like song Y, therefore Y is included", the song in question should be agreed by several *respected* authorities to be among the worst.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if Wikipedia were an indiscriminate collection of information, this list is far too subjective and cannot be considered anything approaching NPOV. Even with "reputable" sources, the writers there would be compiling their own subjective worst list, to sell a few magazines; this is not the Washington Post reporting events at the capital or multiple scientific experiments validated in peer-reviewed journals.

However, the problem with POV in this article to <i>me</i> at least, is that editors can cherry-pick from these various sources, in order to include the songs they <i>feel</i> are "the worst", and in order to exclude those songs they do not feel are the worst. Because the inclusion criteria are <i>so very broad</i>, POV problems are inherent to this list article. To go the other, "inclusive" route, and include everything from every "worst song" list ever made, would inevitably give us an article of unwieldy length with probable copyvio issues. So either way, this article topic is simply unworkable in WP, and the problem is its inherent POV issues. I think the <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#Lists_and_criteria_for_inclusion_of_list_members" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST#Lists and criteria for inclusion of list members</a> guideline makes the point very well for cases like this, and I believe Luna Santin's research bears this out. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 16:34, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You have interpreted me correctly, up to the point where you mention "cherry picking", which would obviously be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> and hence not acceptable. There must be objective criteria establshed. I have previously suggested the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>The simple solution is to establish criteria and apply them, e.g. the song must have been called the worst ever by an individual of note, or it must have been called the worst ever on a notable medium such as TV, radio, press etc., or it must have topped a worst ever poll. The top three or five songs of such a poll could be a cut-off point. Anything else should be deleted from the article.</i></dd>
<dd>The current version needs severe editing on that basis. --<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 17:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>There is little possibility of reasonable criteria for this. Do we say "4 reliable sources" must list a song as worst? None of the entries qualify for that. So then we say "1 or 2 sources", but then we can easily find a bunch of "Worst" lists that do not list the song. The so-called "reliable sources" must have considered the matter carefully and decided that the song is not worst, but they are not going to publish "the 1 million songs that are not the worst". Maybe just list every song that has ever been in one of these lists, but then the article has 500 entries and becomes really long and rather unmaintainable, do we then split it off into "List of songs labeled worst ever by Rolling Stone", "...by Maxim", etc. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 18:27, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is really something for the article talk page. However, the article is not called "worst songs", but "labeled worst songs", i.e. a song has been called the worst, not that it necessarily is the worst. There may be a song that is held by majority opinion to be outstanding genius, but could be in the list, because some notable person has called it the worst song ever, or it topped a poll somewhere. That's how I'm reading it, anyway. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 18:43, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, if the current article is <i>immediately</i> hacked down to include only the songs voted <i>the</i> worst (i.e. number 1) on the various "Worst Of" lists, and if the criteria of the article are adjusted to make it absolutely unequivocally clear that inclusion involves being voted <i>the</i> worst (i.e. number 1) on any such reputable and reliable third party list, then I would happily change my stance to Keep. But! If an editor were to subsequently remove such stipulations from the criteria for inclusion, or to edit them in any meaningful way, or to reciprocally do such a thing, to the extent that an edit war or wars were to ensue over this article, then I would expect a <i>very</i> speedy delete process for the article, without any of this AfD discussion having to be trawled through yet again. Because as it stands, this is an inherent POV article worthy of deletion IMO. It can only be kept under the very strictest caveats, which I believe (even if they were implemented or implement<i>able</i>) may even violate WP's core policies per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.--<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 00:36, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
