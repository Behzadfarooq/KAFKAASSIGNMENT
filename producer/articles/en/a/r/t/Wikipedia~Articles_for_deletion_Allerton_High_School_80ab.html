<li><b>Comment</b> This seems very contradictory to me (the nominator). If this school has so much notability, then why isn't it spoken of on the page, and why aren't any external references spoken of. Should a High School the size of Columbine be listed? Should <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_85e4.html" title="Columbine High School">Columbine</a> be listed? Those are two different questions. My own High School isn't listed on Wikipedia, and I doubt it should be, but it services an area of over 60,000 people sharing that with only one other school. It's huge. So what? I have nothing against schools and this isn't personal. I base my nominations strictly on the quality of the article at hand. Two of the references were broken, and all three were to the same primary source. Is there anything else in the world that points out that this school is somehow notable above other schools? I see many say yes, but, the article disagrees. Ste4k 17:31, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I corrected the links several hours before you made this comment, and another link has been added to provide verification from another source.

<dd>I just took another look. There is one reliable secondary source that says the school is "very good". Aren't there any sort of notable publicity ads, or articles, or newspaper refs, or did anyone die there, ghosts, visits from the Queen, any kind of "Hey this school was THAT one!" sort of thing? I don't mean to sound unfair or against schools, but there are literally hundreds of thousands of schools in the world. I think that this article is safe from being deleted from the looks of things. About the comment below about templates, though, they're a joke that start edit wars, get reverted and ignored. They haven't any policies written on their enforcement, they perform a good job when an editor is applying the tag to their own article to attract help from the general environment, but that's about it.

<li><b>Delete</b> Nothing in the article even hints at notability. Existence isn't notable. Having tennis courts and a lot of Jewish students isn't notable. It's poorly referenced and not even useful to anyone looking for information about the school, since most of the content comes directly from the website anyway. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 17:52, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> â€” Obviously I disagree with the usual arguments for deletion. But notability is a relative term anyway. I find nothing abhorent in the idea of Wikipedia including encyclopedic articles on High Schools. For a substantial portion of the population it is their last formal education, and high schools often form perhaps the most notable institution in many smaller towns. There are many pages on wikipedia I find profoundly trivial, so I have no difficulty in continuing to support the existence of articles on valid high schools. They are substantial institutions with character and histories that influence a significant number of people over the course of their existence.</li>
<li>As for the original premise for the deletion, these sort of issues should be handled through appropriate templates first. I don't see by the history that any such attempt has been made. The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> section titled "problem articles with alternatives to deletion" should have been utilized in preference to a deletion attempt. â€” <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 19:31, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I know this is getting stale, but every time I see this argument it baffles me (not just picking on Ramseystreet, or this article, either). The post office down the road is important to the people down the road, but not to anyone else. My left foot is important to me, and I'm guessing the most ardent school inclusionist doesn't think my left foot is worthy of an article, but that's the extreme of this argument. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 06:22, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You might be on to something there, maybe that is why <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> is an essay and not an actual policy or guideline. Although I do not live anywhere near this high school, I believe that it is noteworthy, moreso than a small town with a population of 8 would usually ever be.

<li><b>Keep</b> First, Wikipedia includes thousands of high schools with no apparent requirement for notability. Maybe this should change, but until then, this high school should have its article. Second, we've all seen much worse articles than what I'm seeing as of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">7 July</a> -- improve it, don't kill it. Finally, it's been around for almost 2 years and seen over 50 edits by multiple editors, including over a dozen with named accounts (note: I'm not including vandalistic edits and reversions in these numbers). I just don't even see why this article has gone to AfD when Wikipedia has 1000s of much worthier potential candidates. We could have collectively fixed, even perfected, this article and written two more for the all time spent on the AfD process.--<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.
