<p>Original research.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Wikipedia is not the place to explain every single verse in any written work, and as RickK said above, it looks like the writer intends someone to write articles on other verses too. -- <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittySaturn_4d7a.html" title="User:KittySaturn">KittySaturn</a> 08:00, 2005 Feb 5 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think it is a bad idea for Wikipedia, to include some information about every passage of the gospel. A lot of (Christian) people might very well be interested in such articles, and if Wikipedia can provide good, neutral information about every passage, then I think it is only positive. Also, the article is in my opinion not a low quality article, and include some good references. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStereotek_fc8d.html" title="User:Stereotek">Stereotek</a> 08:24, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have a friend who is an established atheist (he willingly gets into impromptu debates) but he regularly reads the Bible because he feels that it is a good source of morals. He doesn't believe that all the stories are true, he just believes that they are <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable.html" title="Parable">parables</a>. Besides, if someone wants to read the Bible, but doesn't have their own copy, wouldn't it be good for them to have a resource that they can refer to that has commentary built in? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStalefries_e401.html" title="User:Stalefries">Stale Fries</a> 15:41, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are plenty of online resources for such people (Eg. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b>. It is a worthy project, but not appropriate for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_Comedy_c383.html" title="Divine Comedy">Divine Comedy</a> is a good example of a work that is Encyclopedic in scope, where one can literally write pages of material for every passage. Indeed, there is a 6 volume encyclopedia that does just that. But if someone where to try and do that on Wikipedia, it likely would not be accepted. In the same sense, The Bible is certainly the greatest literature in the world, but I don't see Wikipedia as a "bible encyclopedia" (they do exist). There are many specialized encyclopedias in the world. I would say keep if this was a "notable" passage. --<a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 09:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> There is no reason why this, and every other Biblical verse cannot have an article on Wikipedia - and I'm not even a Christian! Wikipedia, is afterall, not paper. Ultimately, there is no reasonable reason to not include such articles in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 09:42, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Well, there certainly aren't any references, or any names that the article mentions that make these claims. They're just baldly-stated opinions disguised as facts. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 09:54, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do not recall a lack of references ever being a qualification for deletion. The article does not put forth any particular POV or controvetial statements. I think it is a simple matter of requesting that the writer simply supply references. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 10:03, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi OldakQuill, you mentioned that there is no reason why not every verse shouldn't have an article. But don't you think it belongs somewhere else, like Wikibooks as suggested above? Since for one thing we wouldn't even include the full text of the Bible here, let alone commentary... -- <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittySaturn_4d7a.html" title="User:KittySaturn">KittySaturn</a> 10:14, 2005 Feb 5 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, there is no reason why every single verse cannot have an article if they are well written, factually accurate, and varifiable. I do not think it should be on Wikibooks as these would be essentially encyclopaedic articles - Wikibooks serves to hold coherent projects on non-encyclopaedic isseus (such as WikiJuniors and language learning). A full text of the bible is located at Wikisources - we could add anchors to the text at each verse and link straight to them. Verses are so short, in general, that their full text may be included in the encyclopaedic articles about them. Nothing in the Wikipedia deletion policy justified the deletion of this article. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 10:41, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have studied the Bible at University - not some trailer a Fundamentalist has set up in his backyard, but a well respected secular University in Australia. The Bible is both historical and literary. The level of detail that Biblical scholars (from all theological persuasions) have worked on in the past 4-500 years is almost unmatched in any other area of human scholastic endeavour. We're not talking about "Crackerbarrel theology", we're talking about the study of divinity. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 05:48, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Certainly <b>not</b> original research, having read both references. It is what it has to be: terciary source. I (and I think everybody) would really love to read pages of material for every passage of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_Comedy_c383.html" title="Divine Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>. For this Bible matter, it also would be great if we could have at each article/passage the interpretation of each different church which worship the Bible and, maybe, scholar version of what really happened (if applicable). --<a href="../../../e/u/y/User%7EEuyyn_f321.html" title="User:Euyyn">euyyn</a> 10:17, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Imagine that there is a Wikipedia entry for every verse of the Bible. Each entry contains a few different translations of the verse, along with a summary of the context in which the verse occurs. By starting at the <a href="../../../1/_/_/Genesis_1%7E1.html" title="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</a> link, and following the Next Verse links, it would be possible to read the entire Bible in Wikipedia, in several different translations at once, but with an enormous amount of redundant summarizing. The entire text of the Bible does not become encyclopedic just because it is entered a verse at a time. --<a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZarquon_3c86.html" title="User:Zarquon">Zarquon</a> 11:23, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is not paper, nor does the keeping or deletion of this article mean we will have an article on EVERY verse.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this material, especially since it's discussing a particularly important event. But please don't try to do it verse-by-verse, do it in larger chunks. Every verse needs too much context, even this one doesn't contain enough by itself. So hopefully <b>merge</b> this with a larger unit. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 11:40, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. If we can have a separate page on each article, clause and amendment of the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Constitution_e5c4.html" title="US Constitution">US Constitution</a>, then why not on each of the more interesting (but not all!) verses of the Bible? â€“&#160;<a href="../../../k/p/a/User%7EKpalion_93cc.html" title="User:Kpalion">Kpalion</a> <a href="../../../k/p/a/User_talk%7EKpalion_7aef.html" title="User talk:Kpalion">(talk)</a> 13:11, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't believe that this page matches any of the conditions for deletion, in and of itself. So long as the article is well written. In addition, rather than simply getting 16 different christian outlooks on a given verse, we will also get different outlooks. When he gets around to Ezekiel 25:17 we can add a reference to it's use in <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulp_Fiction_f567.html" title="Pulp Fiction">Pulp Fiction</a>, and for John 3:16 <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin_9bd5.html" title="Stone Cold Steve Austin">Stone Cold Steve Austin</a> 3:16 might be appropriate.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This level of detail is precisely what makes wikipedia interesting. If we want to be the "sum of human knowledge" nothing can be too specialized. Linking can be a practical problem - but <i>in practice</i> it's highly unlikely every verse will have its lemma. If views are too personal, objectify them. If research is too original (a very rare occasion) find better supported data. MWAK--84.27.81.59 13:28, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. If passages in the bible are allowed, where does it stop?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Dare I call it bible-cruft? It is unencyclopedic to have articles on specific Bible passages, and I'm appalled at the idea that someone is going to start writing articles on every passage in the Bible. If someone argues that if it is unencyclopedic to have an article about every Bible passage then it is unencyclopedic to have one on every Star Trek episode: Yes, true, that is what the despised deletionists have been trying to tell you. A general encyclopedia gives an overview and summary of every topic of note within human knowledge. But general encyclopedias are just one kind of book in the library; they don't aim to *be* the library. Wikipedia does not replace the Internet or the Library of Congress. Among the other books in the library besides general encyclopedias are "encyclopedias" on specific topics, the "Encyclopedia of Science Fiction", the "Encyclopedia of Jazz", or the "Encyclopedia of American High Schools", etc. Is Wikipedia a general encyclopedia? Or is it the "Encyclopedia of X for all X? The two are not the same, and the inability to decide is tearing the place apart. The "Encyclopedia of X, for all X" should be organized differently than a general encyclopedia, for one thing. Somehow this must be decided. Regarding this specific article: it is original research. Even if it were cleaned up, it shouldn't be an article. If this passage it is an especially notable passage, it should be covered in one of the serveral articles that we already have on Bible topics. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:31, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>The thing is, if Wikipedia was treated as though it were indeed paper despite the general understanding that it is not, then we would have far fewer readers and far fewer editors, and those of us who were left would be doing a lot less good. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:55, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwikibooks</b>. Major verses could be encyclopedic, and this one probably is.

<li><b>Keep</b>, as the creator I obviously want this to be kept. I am shocked that some see this as original research, since I am far from a Biblical scholar and am not even a believer and couldn't do such research if I wanted to. Almost all the information comes from the two sites I listed as references. While I would be delighted to see an article on every verse, I do not intend to create them any time soon as I do not have the expertise or the interest, but I hope that this pilot article encourages others to work in this area. My hope is that in several years we might have the whole Bible covered. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 15:46, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I would have to say that the charges against this article are pretty much settled, based on what I have have seen. The author has just stated that almost none of the research is original, and that all of the third-party research can be found at the two links at the bottom. Also, about the dilemma of having an "article to discuss every Bible passage" has been at least been fixed by having larger portions of text for each page, essentially condensing the amount of "paper" used. Based on this, I think this is a <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStalefries_e401.html" title="User:Stalefries">Stale Fries</a> 16:07, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Line-by line textual analysis of individual books spread across masses of individual articles is inappropriate for an encyclopaedia.

<li>Hesitant <b>keep</b> ONLY if this is considered a major verse (also isn't this the verse you see on billboards, etc?). There are tens of thousands of verses in the Bible and I do not support the idea of every one having an article. Being included in the Bible is not, IMO, necessarily a sole criteria for notability. Perhaps the creation of a Bible-Wiki should be considered if that's the case. But I'm OK with keeping articles on major verses, but I'm not well-versed enough with the Bible (no pun intended) to judge whether this is one or not. Also, interpretations of the Bible range so widely that I fear the more controversial ones would turn this place into a battleground. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:32, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Desperately needs merging as suggested above. Bible verses date from the 16th century and are not appropriate "units" for discussing Biblical text; they are useful as references, not as snippets misconstrued as being meaningful in isolation. As we says elsewhere, "the impulse of people to conceive of verses as units of syntactical meaning, though baseless, is strong... Interpretation of isolated verses often leads to imputed meanings that are at odds with those that would be derived from the same words in their Biblical context." If Wikipedia is to have useful articles concerning Biblical content, they can't be based on verses. Previous experiments along these lines have pretty effectively demonstrated this. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:09, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extreme Keep</b>. The Bible is one of the most widely read books in human history and its contents have been at the basis of many decisions made by leaders throughout this history. Sometimes these actions can depend upon the interpretation of a particular verse. Many of you do not realise that Bible commentaries come from a wide variety of commentators, from conservative evangelical to atheistic liberal. Every commentator seeks to explain what a verse is about and understand it from a linguistic, grammatical and historical perspective. I am one who will argue very strongly for Wikipedia articles that cover every verse in the Bible (which does not mean an article for every verse). Because Wikipedia is not a religious publishing company, these articles should (eventually) reflect every single point of view about the verse, along with refutations of every point of view. If you go to your local university library you will find many books from many different points of view that examine certain books and verses in the Bible, and what they mean. Go to <a href="../../../s/i/z/Wikipedia%7ESize_comparisons_8076.html" title="Wikipedia:Size comparisons">Wikipedia:Size_comparisons</a> - you will find that the 10,000 monographs on Chemical compounds are listed as a potential growth area in Wikipedia, along with each of the 20,000 human genes, 24,500 common law legal terms and so on. These should get a mention, why not Bible verses? There is a growing multitude of Christian theology-related articles and many of these articles refer back to Bible verses. Maintaining NPOV will be a problem, but even if an article on a verse is written badly, then the solution is a re-write, not a deletion. Ask this question - in ten years time when Wikipedia hits 100 million articles, do you expect that Bible verses be included in this?

<p>The terms <i>POV</i> and <i>NPOV</i> are being used by the deletionists in this discussion without making clear whether they mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>different POV's among Christians - of which sadly there are many but which I think Wiki can handle</li>
<li>differing POV's between Christians and other religions - which is something which <b>must</b> be discussed and above all accepted.</li>

<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Christians accept Jesus Christ as Lord and saviour"</li>
<li>"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved"</li>

<li>I voted for delete above. However, I think the most notable verses of the Bible or comparable works do deserve an article (I wouldn't vote to delete John 3:16), but absolutely, absolutely not every verse - I don't see why an encyclopaedia would do something like that. If someone wants to do a project to explain every Bible verse, they should set up another wiki elsewhere on the web, and it will be a lot more effective because people wanting to know about Bible verses will go there, whereas people don't expect an encyclopaedia to have this sort of material. It is not a matter of Wiki is not paper; if appropriate an encyclopaedia will include it even if it is paper, just like volumes after volumes of the printed Oxford Dictionary. Anyway, instead, in my opinion, there can be articles that discuss more than one verse, or a chapter. However, I am still of the opinion that this kind of articles belongs to a more specialised site than one like Wikipedia. As an example, there seems to be an abundance of maths articles in Wikipedia, but people who want to know about this mathematical term or that mathematical object will tend to go to a site that is specifically mathematical like MathWorld, so those articles in Wikipedia seem actually somewhat useless. -- <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittySaturn_4d7a.html" title="User:KittySaturn">KittySaturn</a> 10:38, 2005 Feb 6 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia should have articles on each book of the Bible. For some books, a separate article on each chapter may be justified. But not an entire article on every single verse. (Can anyone imagine a Wikipedia-worthy article being written on, say, Matthew 1:13 or Genesis 36:41?) John 20 is a very significant chapter in Christianity, but an article covering the entire chapter is sufficient. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 15:37, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Transwiki</b> or <b>Delete</b>. And ditto for all similar articles. I think an article on each book (including Gnostics) should be enough for Wikipedia. Any analysis of verses is likely to be severely P.O.V. (Even if its only a generalised Christian P.O.V.) - Also an attempt would be needed to be made to do likewise for the Qu'ran, and then every Hindu sacred text (and they can get <i>pretty</i> long).--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 12:55, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Any subject can be dealt with according to NPOV. POV, or potential to become POV, is no reason to delete anything. And saying that we would need similar articles for other religious texts would be like saying to delete an article on <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Buchanan_f59c.html" title="James Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> if there wasn't one on <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millard_Fillmore_5e1f.html" title="Millard Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:07, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b>. Strong delete. Whatever. Listen, we can make a WikiBible if you guys want. But the base nature of Wikipedia is that it's an <i>encyclopedia</i>, not a textual commentary. Furthermore, the WikiBible Project would be its own self-contained project about specific knowledge regarding a specific field. It is simply too big of a project to include a Bible commentary in the Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not meant to engulf PubMed, and it is not meant to engulf an ongoing Biblical commentary. We already have things like <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodom_and_Gomorrah_832d.html" title="Sodom and Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, et cetera. That is how the Wikipedia is meant to operate--with encyclopedia articles. Again, the WikiBible looks nice, but it deserves its own project, and is too specific for the WikiBible. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 03:56, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - WikiMedia does not operate in content forks, only media forks. Such a WikiBible would be a forking of Wikimedia content with no difference in media. There is absolutely no reason why Wikipedia cannot contain articles on individual verses. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 20:20, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
