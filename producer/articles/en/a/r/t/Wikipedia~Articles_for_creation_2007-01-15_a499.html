<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>Unofficial servers existed but didn't become widely popular until 2005. Daily updates to these servers and new zones such as Front Lines, Kill Zone, and Hockey Zone were introduced.</p>
<p>Many players who previously played but left rejoined this unofficial movement. Games tended to be hosted on a per user basis but later more permanent servers were used. This had the effect of widely popular hosted games independant of the official servers.</p>
<p>The unofficial server, developer by aaerox supported Lua scripting, giving new features for custom zones, such as "Zombie Zone".</p>
<p>As of 2006, the server is run by 4 main staff, who are dangerz, 7hm, X15 and aaerox and funded by donations.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Game zones</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Capture the Flag</b> - Fast-paced basing action, the most popular zone. Various maps exist, including a private-team Extreme form. Has multiple weapons for players to purchase, allowing player customization.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>RPG</b> - Role-playing. Based off of a past-time zone favorite, WZA (War Zone Alpha).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bug Hunt</b> - Marine vs. the Skrall. The Collective Marines attempt to extract scientific research from a small research facility on a moon inhabited by the Skrall, a hostile alien race.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Skirmish</b> - Massive team vs. team fighting. Several variants exist. Some include tanks and other vehicles. Most employ static flags for territory holding. Features more realistic settings and game physics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Gravball</b> - Sport zone. Players pilot hoverbikes on a large map with various obstacles, attempting to shoot the ball over their own goal square while avoiding opponents' weapons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>HardCorps</b> - An almost realistic version of war, featuring incredibly fast and invisible projectiles, like you would expect on a real battlefield. Employs maps, and requires military/squad tactics to undertake victory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Boom Ball X</b> - Sport zone. Players play on a small, hockey-like arena and are restricted to either to aft, mid or fore sections of the field.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Soccer Brawl</b> - Sport zone. Eleven-a-Side razzle-dazzle soccer where players are allowed to body check one another.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ambush</b> - Fast-paced action. Players use jetpacks or hoverboards to fly around collecting flags and blowing up other players.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Team Deathmatch</b> - Fast-paced action. Players use multitudes of weapons against each other in tight corridors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>TankODrome</b> - Arcade-style play. Players drive tanks, launch projectiles at other players and computer turrets to collect tokens. Tokens are used to buy vehicle upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Chambert's Moon</b> - A classic, King-of-the-Hill slower paced zone with aliens, psionics and vehicles. Uses a drastically different item set.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>War Zone Alpha</b> - The predecessor of RPG/Eol, WZA is a popular pure chaos zone that features different classes, vehicles, weapons and a less structured experience buildup system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>WZA:UC</b> - A Free Infantry remix on the classic War Zone Alpha. Features a completely revamped armor system, energy system, and a new map. The style of play is much like the classic WZA, however there is much more complexity in the way people customize their character. Also noteworthy is the unique vehicles, bunkers, and base building capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Frontlines</b> - A Free Infantry skirmish zone based on the popular <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Person_Shooter_098e.html" title="First Person Shooter">FPS</a> game <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html" title="Battlefield 2">Battlefield 2</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dodgeball</b> - A Free Infantry sports zone where the players throw ball-like projectiles at each other with intentions of "getting each other out" Don't worry, once you're out you can drive around the arena in a nice fast race car!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser Tag</b> - A Free Infantry Laser Tag style zone. You must defeat the other team by being the first team to score 25 points. You earn 1 point from killing an enemy, and 10 points from destroying their base! Winning team gets to play around in the Celebration Vehicle for 45 seconds until the next game starts!</li>

<p>The Indian Telly Awards were founded by media analyst Anil Wanvari (he is also the founder of <a href="http://www.indiantelevision.com" class="external free" title="http://www.indiantelevision.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiantelevision.com</a>) in 1999 as a way of recognising excellence in television. In their seventh year (2007), the awards started with 18 categories. The first awards show was held at south Mumbai's Oberoi Hotel with sponsorship from Star TV, Sony Entertainment, Zee TV and Channel Nine. In 2006, The Indian Telly Awards have 83 categories ranging from Popular Awards such as Best Actor to Best TV Anchor to Technical Awards such as Best Videographer to Best Costume Designer.

<p>Ginny Sanchez is the midday personality at <a href="../../../w/m/t/WMTR_6f2c.html" title="WMTR">WMTR</a> in New Jersey.</p>

<p>In the winter of 2000, Ginny began her career in radio as a prank caller to the <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_and_Fez_bce9.html" title="Ron and Fez">Ron and Fez</a> show in New York City. By Spring, she was their producer and a regular show character called <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasteless_Ginny_e282.html" title="Tasteless Ginny">Tasteless Ginny</a>.</p>
<p>Ginny worked at <a href="../../../w/n/e/WNEW-FM_05e4.html" title="WNEW-FM">WNEW-FM</a> during the demise of the station from a talk station, through the Blink and Mix formats, until it's eventual flip to "Fresh 102.7" and change in calls from WNEW to WWFS. She was the only programming employee to last from talk until the last days of "Mix," the most tumultuous era of that station's history.</p>
<p>During this era she worked as a jock for <a href="../../../w/g/h/WGHT_5397.html" title="WGHT">WGHT</a> radio in New Jersey, earning her "chops" as an on-air disc jockey and refining her knowledge of the oldies format. From there, she went on to <a href="../../../w/m/t/WMTR_6f2c.html" title="WMTR">WMTR</a> as the midday lead-in to the Golden Gup.</p>

<p>Ginny's show employs trivia of the music and artists which are aired on the station. Regular features of the program are "Hometown Historical Highlights" and "this day in history," which highlights less-known items from history (such as inventions or political events) and not the normal fare of artist birthdays.</p>

It was programmed in 1997 by Matt Ayres and Paul Hsu.</p>
<p>Qoole's strength as a level editor lies in its ability to <i>group</i> objects and manipulate them in those groups, hence the "Object-Oriented" part of the name. These groups of objects could also be imported and exported. For example, one user could create an intricate stairway, export it and give the file to another user. That second user could import the stairway into a level he or she was editing, rotate and position the stairway, even change its size.</p>
<p>Qoole enjoyed a certain amount of popularity but it fell out of use as <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake.html" title="Quake">Quake</a> became less than state-of-the-art.

<p>Hisaichi Ishii was born in Tamano (Okayama prefecture) on the second of February in 1951. He graduated from Kansai University with a sociology degree in 1974.</p>
<p>As an author he writes stories which have topics going from current topics in politics and economy to stories about professional baseball or mysteries. He is also known for making caricatures of Japanese celebrities.</p>
<p>He dislikes being directly interviewed by the press. Instead of being interviewed, he sometimes draws himself on his short comics (see picture) and gives an answer in his comic instead.</p>
<p>In 1972, while studying at Kansai University, he debuted in “バイト君” magazine, an informational magazine in the Kansai region. Considered one of his masterpieces is “がんばれ!!タブチくん!” (Go Tabuchi!).</p>
<p>Most of the time his comics are comic strips consisting of 4 cells (四コマ漫画in Japanese). His most famous one isとなりの山田くん (name changed into ののちゃん later on). It has been serialized in every morning edition of Asahi Newspaper since 1991. Because it is published in a widespread newspaper it often deals with hot topics such as new movies, politics, fashion and economy. Tonari no Yamadakun was adaptated into an animated film in 1999 by the acclaimed director Isao Takahata.</p>
<p>In 2003 his work was awarded with the 7th Tezuka Osamu Cultural award. In 2006 he also received the 54th 菊池寛賞（Kikuchikan award）for his literary contributions.</p>

<p>A Brass Razoo is an Australian term that arose as soldiers slang in World War 1. It is heard often in the statement "I haven't got a brass razoo" when someone is out of money.<br />
There is no actual thing called a brass razoo, though some speculate it arises from Egyptian or Indian currency. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a razoo as a "non-existent coin of trivial value"<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Moiré Deflectometry</p>
<p><br />
An interferometry technique entitled moiré deflectometry [1], in which the object to be tested (either phase object or secular surface) is mounted in the course of a collimated beam followed by a pair of transmission gratings placed at a distance from each other. The resulting fringe pattern, i.e., the moiré deflectogram, is a map of ray deflections corresponding to the optical properties of the inspected object. Hence Moiré Deflectometry is a powerful tool for nondestructive optical testing. A major advantage of Moiré deflectometry is that it less sensitive to mechanical vibration and therefore it is widely used in ophthalmic industry flam analysis and wind tunnel measurements as a quantitative replacement to Schlieren photography and Shadowgraphy.</p>

<p>Complex metal hydrides are <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrides.html" title="Hydrides">hydrides</a> that do not fit into the traditional picture of a metal hydride. While typical metal hydrides, such as transition metal hydrides, contain hydrogen ions arranged in a lattice with the metal ions, complex metal hydrides typically contain more than one type of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cation.html" title="Cation">cation</a> and a more complicated crystal structure. While simple metal hydrides exhibit primarily <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionic_bonding.html" title="Ionic bonding">ionic bonding</a> between the metal and hydride ions, complex metal hydrides contain ionic bonding between a positive metal ion and negatively charged molecular ions containing the hydrogen. These negatively charged groups exhibit significant covalent bonding between the hydrogen atoms and the second metal or metaloid atoms. Generally complex metal hydrides are of the formula MM'H<sub>4</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>M'H<sub>6</sub> or, less commonly, MM'H<sub>5</sub>, with M an <a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkali_metal.html" title="Alkali metal">alkali metal</a> and M' a <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_13_element.html" title="Group 13 element">group 13 element</a> (boron or aluminium).</p>

<p>Projects: This project aims at analyzing the stability and force balance of a simple prototype that demonstrates the principle of magnetic levitation. The prototype consists of a pencil suspended in mid-air essentially by the action of forces exerted by four ring magnets fixed in a sponge base on two similar magnets attached to the pencil (see Figure 1). The configuration is found to be in perfectly stable equilibrium; the pencil can perform small oscillations and also rotate about its long axis. The six magnets used in the system can be arranged in a total of 2(6) = 64 different polarity configurations. We found, by direct experimentation, that only two independent configurations among can lead to stable levitation. The force balance in these configurations was studied. We mapped the field lines of all the magnets using a compass. This was used to understand the various forces acting in the system. We found that an upward repulsive force exerted by the base magnets balances the weights of the pencil and a horizontal magnetic force along the pencil was balanced by a normal reaction force exerted by a thin plastic chip fitted on the sponge. To check these theoretical results, further experiments were conducted by tiling the system at various angles. The results confirmed the earlier findings. Various practical applications of this concept are being explored. This project provides an understanding of magnetic levitation of static extended bodies and shows that a prototype can be built with inexpensive, everyday, materials</p>

<p>(b. Meridian, Miss. April 18, 1897 d.&#160;? 1989) Granberry was a pianist, professor at Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida, novelist, short-story writer (A Trip to Czardis, which won the O'Henry Award, is perhaps his best known), and author of the novels: <i>The Ancient Hunger</i> (1927); <i>Strangers and Lovers</i> (1928); <i>The Erl King</i> (1930). From the early sixties until his death, he wrote the story for the comic strip Buz Sawyer (red link at Buz Sawyer article), the strip originated by Roy Crane. Granberry was a literary critic for the <i>New York Sun</i> and introduced Margaret Mitchell's <i>Gone With the Wind</i> to readers. They remained friends throughout her life. --&gt; (Late in life (about 1965), Granberry expanded his short story, A Trip to Czardis, into a novel by the same title which did not do well. It told the backstory of the short story, which removed the ambiguity that made the short story so powerful.</p>

<p>mLife was a multi-million dollar marketing campaign designed by Ogilvy &amp; Mather for AT&amp;T Wireless, now Cingular. The 'm' in mLife was intended to stand for mobile, modern, and multi-faceted.<br />
Initially, this campaign consisted of ambiguous ads directing people to mlife.com. In a 60 second slot during superbowl XXXVI, AT&amp;T Wireless officially unvieled its connection to mLife.</p>
