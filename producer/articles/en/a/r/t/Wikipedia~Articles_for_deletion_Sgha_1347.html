<li><b>Don't Delete</b> This article relates to a small hockey league in a small Canadian town, organized by a few dedicated volunteers. It was organized to allow underprivileged youth from the surrounding area to participate in hockey for free. It is important to the community and we thought it would be fun for the kids to be able to read about themselves online. It completely arrogant to suggest this isn't important; it has made a big difference in the lives of several kids. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cameronbuttz (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cameronbuttz_dad1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cameronbuttz">contribs</a>).</small>(user's only edit)
<ul>
<li>If you want the kids to be able to read about themselves online, why not make a page on MySpace or even eteamz.com? This, however, is a general reference encyclopedia, and the criterion for including articles is not, unfortunately, whether they make someone happy or whether they make a difference to "several kids".

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> SGHA does not fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> as news of the league has been reported on quite frequently in several local newspapers as a venue where the premier roller hockey players in the region gather to compete. There has also been a long standing, and very significant SGHA webpage, which until recently was the source for all SGHA-related information. Many of the techniques and strategies formulated within the SGHA league hierarchy have been implemented in professional rollerhockey associations across Southern Ontario, most notably the Greater Toronto Inline Hockey League. The SGHA is widely known, with hubs of interest pocketed across the country, and in many cases across the continent. Locations as varied as Portland, Calgary, Toronto, and New York City have all had their own unique and significant experiences with the organization. I will do my best to update this entry with the correct references and format in due time. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.119.232.186 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.119.232.186_d416.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.119.232.186">contribs</a>).</small> (user's only edit)

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> The SGHA is a well known developmental/summer league in the Greater Toronto Area. Those who have chosen to delete it are extremely unfamiliar with it and thus are therefore threatened by it's reality. Many professional players play in this league during their off-season. Most Americans are unfamiliar with the SGHA term. A conflict of cultures is apparent in those who are attempting to delete this entry. 23:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zinco100 (<a href="../../../z/i/n/User_talk%7EZinco100_1331.html" title="User talk:Zinco100">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zinco100_da57.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zinco100">contribs</a>).</small>

<ul>
<li><b>Note</b> Kicking222 uses the term "personal attack" as a scapegoat due to his inability to debate/accept accurate information and statements. Suggesting Kicking222 should formally refrain from posting on any Canadian content is not a personal attack.

And per <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>, your 'factual' statement is unverified and therefore not suitable for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraicone_e5d6.html" title="User:Draicone"><b>Draicone</b></a> <a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDraicone_3170.html" title="User talk:Draicone"><sup><span style="color: #FF9933;">(talk)</span></sup></a> 07:42, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The AfD process is designed to allow for improvement of the article within the five day course of listing.

I have seen no desire by the supporters to improve the article to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as explained herein, despite repeated requests to do so, and thus there is no need to break process in this instance. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 13:48, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> Draicone, I'm sorry to burst your bubble but there is no hierarchy of authority in regards to deleting pages based on Wikipedia experience. It doesn't matter if a user is newly registered or been on here since the beginning. We are all equal. I refuse to be bullied. (Zinco100 16:07, 17 August 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Response</b> Zinco100, I'm not saying that there is a hierarchy of authority for AfD. However, new users are not always familiar with policy, such as the four listed above by Whpq which clearly apply in this situation. In addition, I am not attempting to bully you. However, if you feel this way, then <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> no longer applies and the standard policies that Whpq listed above state that this article should be deleted, end of story. Failing notability generally is not an issue, but verifiability, vanity and original research don't give very much reason to keep the article. If you feel it deserves a place on the web, I suggest you put it on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a>. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraicone_e5d6.html" title="User:Draicone"><b>Draicone</b></a> <a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDraicone_3170.html" title="User talk:Draicone"><sup><span style="color: #FF9933;">(talk)</span></sup></a> 07:47, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It seems like the general consensus is to do so, but I'm adding another vote to make it clear in light of all the debate and argument.

<li><b>Delete</b> I guess it needs to be said...While I can respect the feelings that some of these anons have completely, the fact of the matter is that this AfD is not about censorship or picking favorites or suggesting the organization isn't important to the children. <b>It is about if the Article can pass all of Wikipedia's rules.</b> Let me help out a bit so the people new to wikipedia understand. The real problem with this article is that it doesn't follow the three pillars of wikipedia. An article must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> through multiple, reliable, reputable, independent, third-party sources. It must not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which means there are no sources to back up the claims of the author(s). It must also have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point-of-view</a> and not show bias. As a guideline for the above rules, an article must <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite it's notability</a> with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and be must be <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopaedic</a>. This article fails to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, some sections of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, does not follow the guideline of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of <b>verifiability, not truth.</b> An article on this org must cite multiple, reliable, secondary, independent of the organization, non-trivial, third-party sources such as books, magazines, and papers that have national and/or international coverage. The articles must be based, or completely focused on just this org. Just a mention in passing is not acceptable (as it is concidered a trivial source...even if it is in the New York Times...the source isn't trivial, but the coverage by the source was. So far no one has shown that there are reliable secondary sources that fit this criteria for this article. <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a></b> is one of Wikipedia's three content-guiding policies. The other two are <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> (as explained above). Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. <b>The principles upon which these three policies are based are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus.</b> In essence, please explain why this article should be allowed to not follow WP:V when all other articles must.
