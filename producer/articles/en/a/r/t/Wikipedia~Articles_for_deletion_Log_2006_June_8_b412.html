<li><b>Comment</b> Crz is correct that in cases where an article is a cut-and-paste hagiography (or even simply a promotional vehicle), <i>delete</i> is likely as appropriate as <i>keep and cleanup</i> even if the subject is likely notable, inasmuch as most of the text likely can't be used in any event. In the case that there is salvagable text here (much of the detail of course, is unencyclopedic), and if we're generally in accord with the proposition that the subject is notable, perhaps <i>stubifying</i> the article (e.g., as <b>Syed Mohammed Hameeduddin Sharafi</b> is a scholar of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> history, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a>, and founder of the <i>Islamic History and Research Council India</i>.) and then allowing others to expand might be the best route to go. Alternatively, if deletion is agreed upon, it's likely best that the subject be added to <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">WP:RA</a>, in order that a bio may be crafted in the future. My thinking, I guess, parallels that of Lambiam, and, as he, I'm not certain what we ought to do... <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:46, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.I dont know who created this page, i just wikified it a bit, after a search brought me to this page, as noted it is straight copy from the official website but it is not self-promotion as I partially help maintain that site and noone from our team created this page, it was me who added the non-copyright notice to avoid deletion. Dr Sharfi is one of the most respected and prominent scholars of Islam in Hyderabad and India and I think keeping this page will enable a better page over time.If Google search was possible in Urdu you will get hundreds of links about Dr.Sharfi.

<li><i>Do you want to move it to Birth of Kingston Rossdale?</i> What part of "isn't all that notable, even to magazines like <i>People</i> or <i>Hello!</i>" did you manage to overlook? It wasn't all that long a clause, really.</li>
<li><i>And how many sources would I need to present to demonstrate notability here? At what point would you agree with me that he's notable?</i> Probably about the time you present a source demonstrating he's done something more notable than gurgling and pooping. Of course, if you have any sources for notable gurgling and/or notable pooping, I'll accept that, too. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:53, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't have any sources about him doing anything notable, but I've already made the argument (as I always do in these cases—we had a fuss over Britney's baby, I think his was deleted, but JFK's prematurely deceased baby was kept) that notability is assigned and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with accomplishments or actions. If people <i>think</i> the baby is notable—and that can be demonstrated by public interest manifested in the press—then he's notable regardless of anything else. I'm not interested in what this newborn has accomplished, but rather in how many people are aware that Gwen was pregnant and that she recently gave birth. And I think there's a pretty big number. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:10, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>I've already made the argument...that notability is assigned and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with accomplishments or actions.</i> Which was, as I pointed out, irrelevant, but I guess you missed <i>that</i>, too.</li>
<li><i>I'm not interested in what this newborn has accomplished, but rather in how many people are aware that Gwen was pregnant and that she recently gave birth.</i> So this is the logical place for information on Gwen Stefani's pregnancy, as opposed to, say <b>the actual article on Gwen Stefani</b>? (<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airplane_%28film%29.html" title="Airplane (film)">"No... That's just what they'll be expecting us to do!"</a>) Besides, who's going to look this name up? The only articles it links from is from the parents's articles -- and if you're coming from there, <b>you already know everything that's in -- or could be in -- the article</b>.

I would argue it is not possible to compare a Countess with a singer's baby, not even if she is the Queen of Pop, because the Countess has a RL nobility title.&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 16:26, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If we're going for notability, though, I'm sure that more people have heard about Gwen Stephani's baby than some random Countess in the Netherlands. That would be even more true if we were to talk about some other celebrity kids' pages that have been redirected, like <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Preston_Federline_5125.html" title="Sean Preston Federline">Sean Preston Federline</a>, or <a href="../../../s/u/r/Suri_Cruise_64f5.html" title="Suri Cruise">Suri Cruise</a>. In both cases, the only "notable" thing the kids did was be born to really famous parents - exactly what qualifies the Countess. (Don't get me wrong - I'm in favour of <b>deletion</b>, I just don't see the point of indiscriminately collecting articles about non-notable members of the royalty.)

<dd>Not that I like medieval titles that were left behind by most countries in the world, mind you. However, it is my belief that, by using the 100 year ahead test, there are more chances for a dutch to have heard about the Countess (as she may be included in history books due her affiliation with the Crown, minimun as it is) than the baby of a famous singer (which may very well discover an AIDS treatment in the future). I don't like nobility titles, but if determined countries still use them, it is because they believe in them (if not the people, the government). -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 17:08, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anytime someone's article includes the phrase <i>"nth in line to the throne"</i> where n is in single digits, it's pretty guaranteed that person's entry gets kept, rightly or wrongly.

<dd>For the matter of including the movie in Wikipedia, I base myself in one of the WP:NOT guidelines: supposing the movie had already been released, would it be a fair article? From what I know, it is the sequel of a notable movie (that has its own <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stir_of_Echoes_6e9c.html" title="Stir of Echoes">article</a> at Wikipedia). We have the producers, director, screenwriter, main actor, distributor and estimated date of both shooting begin and display. Knowing <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Lowe_ed9d.html" title="Rob Lowe">Rob Lowe</a> is starring it (just to point my neutrality, I have never heard about him until this AFD), and knowing that in out of 26 movies he acted (according to his article), 23 have articles, I believe this article could exist as a stub. That behaviour is common in the cvg environment in Wikipedia, like <a href="../../../t/h/e/Avatar%7E_The_Last_Airbender_%28video_game%29_dd3b.html" title="Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)">Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)</a>. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 16:17, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but it also has to be "almost certain to take place". Until a film reaches theaters, that's almost an impossible criterion to meet. IMDB is very unreliable for things like that (Boondock Saints 2 comes to mind), and whether an article in Vogue constitutes "well-documented" speculation is certainly debatable.

<dd>(edit conflict) I can change it (as I did many times in the past) if it is probed this movie is a hoax (in example, the Variety source from which all these media sites did not exist) or there wasn't at least a confirmed actor, the director and distributor (like in X-Men 4). Note that these are my own thoughts based on the policy, and why I support this movie but not X-Men 4. The Variety article exists <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117943335?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117943335?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and so far there are that minimun of elements _for me_ (including being the sequel of a movie that is considered notable in Wikipedia). If tomorrow this Lowe denies he will be starring the movie, I would change it to <i>Weak Delete</i> because it is just a step behind becoming Wikipedia worthy. The <i>Weak</i> qualifier in this case is not because I am unsure, but instead because, right now, it has the minimun elements for notability I require. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 17:52, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Discussing every Delete vote does nothing, and may annoy some. You had had your opportunity of establishing why it should be kept in your vote, there is no need to discuss every vote, especially if they are not <i>Weak</i> votes. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 13:54, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We disagree. Certainly, if people are annoyed by someone pointing out their faulty citing of policy, people could be annoyed by faulty citing of policy in a deletion discussion, too. Discussing every delete vote (which, BTW, I have not done) does plenty - it notifies the closing party that there is a problem with the rationale given. AfD, being a discussion, almost requires it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:56, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The one who will close will read all the votes and determine which ones are correct. You have already explained why it should be kept. Letting an "I disagree" in most Delete votes (better?) does not add to the discussion. I <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and think someone who votes have read all the previous votes and determined which one was correct (if any), and supported that. AFD is a discussion, yes, but in a discussion with friends you don't just shake your head and say "You are wrong." after hearing every opinion. Once you give all the arguments you can think of, it is better to sit down, take a breath, and watch the development of the discussion.

<ul>
<li>Somebody who is looking for a university program should be consulting their school careers advisor, not looking in an encyclopdedia. Wikipedia is not intended to be a replacement for the entire Internet, it is intended to be a replacement for proprietary <i>encyclopedias</i> like Britannica and Encarta.

<li>I continue to contest this as a conflation between the semiotics of a label and and the content identified by that label. As a generalist, rather than specialist discipline, the same or extremely similar bodies of content may be studied but with different labels for that same content (just as different natural languages may have different words for the same object or object type). <i>Keeping</i> an article such as this fascilitates a hyperlinked encyclopedic overview of the various <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venn_diagram.html" title="Venn diagram">Venn diagrams</a> mapping of the more generalized and amorphous disciplines of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interdisciplinary.html" title="Interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> and <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybernetics.html" title="Cybernetics">cybernetics</a> studies.

<li><b>Keep</b> If this were something common, like applied mathematics, there would be no need for this page. However this page does an excellent job of describing what this program is about and how to reproduce it. It talks about the integration of the fields, which is unusual. The fact is, there are few things similar to this. Perhaps combining it with a page on cybernetics, but, that would be a rather weird place to store it. It merits it's own page simply because it is unique, there is no cmparable field of study to reference it from, and it provides a how to for students and educators alike to learn more about such programs, hopefully leading to them building one themselves. Just lumping it within La Salle Uni seems like a waste of potential, not to mention this is a small noteworthy program that would get lost within the rest of the college. Goodship11 20:40, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The world and society is in constant demand for a constant catch up in the fields of science and technology. This is a ground breaking major and just because it does not fit a text book definition of a major, should not be hindered by narrowmindedness. There would be no difference for having a major such as this or double, or even triple majoring, in a science, business, and technicology separately. Although the specific name of Integrated Science, Business, Technology is not named at other universities, does not necessarily mean that similar programs do not exist. If programs and studies such as this were not constantly explored and taught, progression in these fields might not be to today's growing standards.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.192.206.185 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.192.206.185_41b4.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.192.206.185">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I still do not see any good reason to delete it. If it helps people stay informed about this program, then its useful.

<li>I notice my vote has attracted a bit of attention, I really don't want to discourage anyone from contributing to Wikipedia and I appreciate this process can be a little intimidating. My vote above should really just be viewed as saying that I believe this article does not fit with the focus of Wikipedia and may be better served by another wiki. Wikipedia recieves 100's of new articles everyday, many of which need quick review in terms of whether they stay or go. This can be why deletion votes are often very terse and, sometimes, brash in their explanation. If the ISBT degree is a significant degree at La Salle University then please feel free to add it to the La Salle University article. I just don't feel this article accords with the focus of the Wikipedia project. This is because, although Wikipedia certainly covers university programmes that are not fields in their own right such as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-med.html" title="Pre-med">pre-med</a>, this article seems to focus on the programme at a specific university and Wikipedia tends not to contain articles on programmes from specific universities. For example, there is no Pre-med (Harvard) article on Wikipedia. If the programme was more widespread and written about in this context then the article may be appropriate for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedars_695e.html" title="User:Cedars">Cedars</a> 11:36, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I share your concern for dedicating pages for individual programs. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrative_learning.html" title="Integrative learning">Integrative learning</a> programs like <a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBT_731d.html" title="ISBT">ISBT</a> are sprouting in droves and we view our program as one of the early leaders in an emergent field of study, rather than yet another department at yet another university whose curriculum follows the dictates of the professional organizations that govern it. I am very keen on the idea of shifting our efforts to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrative_learning.html" title="Integrative learning">Integrative learning</a> article for an explanation of this nascent field. We are content with using our own Uni's servers to advertise and manage our program, but we are eager to share our enthusiasm for this new field, so that as you have stated, programs such as this are more widespread and written about.

<li><b>As the creator</b> of the <a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBT_731d.html" title="ISBT">ISBT</a> article, I appreciate the current debate. I glean there is a bimodal discussion pertaining to the significance of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrative_learning.html" title="Integrative learning">Integrative learning</a> and the appropriateness of an article on Wikipedia for a specific undergraduate program of study that embraces it. Perhaps it is too early to recognize this area of study as a legitimate academic subject. I find it ironic that a course of study founded firmly on the collaborative efforts of specialists is not considered notable in the Wikipedia arena. Perhaps collaboration has reached such a heightened level of pervasiveness as to be commonplace and non-notable. If that is the case, then a major goal of the <a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBT_731d.html" title="ISBT">ISBT</a> program has been achieved. The user page of the previous commenter, <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedars_695e.html" title="User:Cedars">Cedars</a>, states this user is studying for a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Engineering with majors in electrical engineering, computer science and applied mathematics and specialized interest in commerce, economics, psychology and law. This user is exactly the archetype student our program wishes to serve. As for the article not providing enough content, the <a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBT_731d.html" title="ISBT">ISBT</a> program hosts is own MediaWiki-based wiki on internal program servers. Our IT department is migrating the ISBTwiki to external servers over the summer school break. The ISBTwiki currently contains over 1,500 pages in the database, with over 100 legitimate content pages. Perhaps an interwiki map to the ISBTwiki from the main Uni page would assuage the sensitivity to limited space on the Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../q/s/w/User%7EQswitch426_2cad.html" title="User:Qswitch426">qswitch426</a> 11:48, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>FWIW, many, if not most (or even damn near all) lists on Wikipedia go back to the days when a) the Category system hadn't been implemented in the software, so lists were the only way to collect 'like things', and b) when there were few articles, so the lists of redlinks were a good way to encourage article creation. Some number of lists (no idea what percent--haven't been editing on EN much the past, um, year, nearly) have since been deleted if it was determined that they had so few redlinks that they no longer served that purpose, in which case many people argue that they are redundant with the category, thus no longer needed. 24.18.215.132 03:26, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is false. Watch yourself...Al. First of all, Rand is not my favorite philosopher. I'm only vaguely familiar with Objectivism and am in the process of trying to learn about it. Secondly, I'm not deleting it because I can't get Rand in it. I explictly stated in Talk that I didn't really care if Rand was in it or not, because no one reads this article anyway. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_philosophers&amp;diff=57112319&amp;oldid=57112012" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_philosophers&amp;diff=57112319&amp;oldid=57112012" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> Contrary to your claim, at no time did I ever state that I was attempting to delete it because I couldn't get Rand in. I simply stated in Talk that its existence appears to be in opposition to Wikipedia policy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_philosophers&amp;diff=56348256&amp;oldid=56345197" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_philosophers&amp;diff=56348256&amp;oldid=56345197" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. An additional reason I'm voting to delete it is it is distracting editors (including myself) from working on articles that people actually read. As evidence of my good faith and selfless devotion to policy, see here where I recently voted to delete a similar article even though I thought the article was useful: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_anarchism_web_resources" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_anarchism_web_resources" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> (that's where I learned of the policy) I'm trying to keep Wikipedia content in compliance with policy.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Main actors in the debate have stopped argumenting. Consensus of the debate was that no <b>objective definition of major philosopher</b> can be constituted. My suggestion is to make a redirection to the philosophy portal. Intangible 03:51, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Whether or not we have arrived at an 'objective definition' (a standard that seems unreasonably high given that most regular English terms cannot be defined with complete objectivity), there is no consensus that 'major philosophers' is problematic. Plenty of us are fine with it. I also think it's telling that everyone who has voted to 'delete' has been part of the unsuccessful campaign to produce a consensus to add Rand. It looks a lot like sour grapes to me. <a href="../../../f/i/9/User%7EFi99ig_a691.html" title="User:Fi99ig">fi99ig</a> 04:19, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are you serious? It's not a philosophical term! 'Akrasia' is a philosophical term. 'Apperception' is a philosophical term. 'Analytic' and 'synthetic' are philosophical terms. But 'major philosopher' is just a regular english term.

<li><b>Very intensely STRONG KEEP</b> - What's the point? Here's the point: the list system and category systems are parallel (in purpose). However, they each reflect a different style of construction (and maintenance), and therefore tap the different strengths of users - some users like working with lists (perhaps because those users are good at spewing lists right out of their heads, or maybe they like lists because the links are centralized for easy access), and others like tagging articles (the decentralized approach - you can't edit the links at the category). Lists are here to stay, in spite of the category system's overlap/redundancy - this is a long-standing precedent. If we get rid of this list for the reason of category redundancy, then we might as well put up all lists for deletion at the same time and save the trouble of deleting them one-by-one (there are thousands of them). The list system isn't being replaced by the category system, as each system has its strengths and weaknesses. Also, the list of lists included on this page alone makes it worthy of keeping. As for the list of major philosophers, since there have been so many philosophers throughout the ages, it is <i><b>helpful</b></i> to have a list of the most influential ones. Therefore, it is not a mere list of internal links, rather it is a valuable summary or condensation. It may interest you to know that the list is slated for inclusion in the project <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConcise_0bf0.html" title="Wikipedia:Concise">Wikipedia:Concise</a> (<i>see</i> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EConcise_2871.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Concise">talk page</a>), which would not be possible if this list had been deleted! --<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolar_Deluge_b7f6.html" title="User:Polar Deluge">Polar Deluge</a> 12:57, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article has multiple problems. One is that it's written in the style of an essay, not an encyclopedia article. That could be cured by a (major) rewrite. The real problem, however, is that the subject matter is inherently open-ended and thus impossible to cover adequately. Perhaps there should just be a category of obsolete things? Also, the fact that the article has been around for a year doesn't make it a good article; it just means nobody has noticed it yet. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 13:17, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia is meant to show the sum of human <i>knowledge</i>, not details of every single artefact ever created by human civilisation. The concept of shopping malls in general is knowledge, and therefore suitable for an encyclopedia to discuss; individual examples are only suitable material where they are distinguished from other examples. This is exactly the same principle as we apply to humans -- every human is important to his or her own family and friends, but <i>Wikipedia</i> only writes about the ones who are important to entire countries.<br />
The battle to keep non-notable schools out has been lost due to the large number of immature contributors who are unable to understand what an encyclopedia is. This does not mean we should abandon all semblance of quality control and start admitting articles on individual toenails (except where those toenails have actually affected world history in some way). — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 16:46, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is just pure promotion. It's not notable, it's a mall. A place where people gather and do commericalism day after day. If, say, said mall had a mall santa that molested small children and then robbed a jewlry store, prehaps a page is warranted. A radio station might have a cult following, or a high school be notable for strigent academia. Not everything here has a page, and AfD has the purpose of ensuring that pages that shouldn't be here don't exist. The system works, it just needs time. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 16:54, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the replies, Yanksox and Haeleth. While it appears that we disagree over whether malls are notable as regional socio-economic centers (even if they are subnational) or not notable as hunks of concrete where people buy stuff, do you agree that there should be some sort of guideline on malls/shopping centers? As it stands now, some malls get deleted while others get kept for indistinguishable reasons. This would give people something to cite when they say nn or notable.

<dd>If I may borrow from the most immature of reasons given in any debate: "sez you." While I have seen you around and know that you are an intelligent, articulate editor, your gut feeling (or mine, for that matter) isn't really something a pillar on which to prop the project as a whole. Notability should be a consensus-driven thing, not just an opinion. For some issues, I agree that one's gut is the best meter possible, but on the issue of shopping malls, i would like to see an independent yard stick in place, even if it doesn't reflect my opinion on the issue. Also, thank you too for the lively debate. This does not happen nearly enough on AfD.

<dd>You actually made my day alot of better, thanks. Well, I know it's a strange issue when dealing w/ notability. However, in the instance of this article all I see is just a list of stores. Again, beating a dead horse, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> adverts, promotion. It just seems to be a really average mall, nothing special happened in it (which for the mall might be a good thing). According to a search<a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-27,GGLD:en&amp;q=%22Burlington%20Center%20Mall%22%20New%20Jersey&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-27,GGLD:en&amp;q=%22Burlington%20Center%20Mall%22%20New%20Jersey&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, the most notable thing this mall has done is host an event. It's really complicated, but think of it under a different scope. Imagine that someone wrote an article about a McDonalds or Wendys they work at. What makes that chain unique from others?

<dd><b>Comment</b>. If verifiability can be found, is it still something to be deleted? Or are most malls, by default, nn? I checked out the mall website, and those stores are indeed there. I'm not saying that the article in its present form isn't a steaming pile of you-know-what. I'm eventually going to put together a centralized discussion on malls that, despite my inclusionist leanings on the topic, will take into account the consensus-based notability standards of a cross-section of wikipedians. The Mall of America is, of course, notable, and the abandoned strip mall near your house is nn. I'm trying to delineate the threshold inbetween so future editors can zap the cruft and keep the interesting. So what i am getting at: do you think that malls are default nn unless something notable happens or if it some sort of superlative? <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 18:53, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> As I have said, I live in the area and know this mall. There is nothing notable about it. There is a Strawbridge's (going to convert to Macys, I believe), Sears, JCPenny, and other stores. This mall is not well known outside of the region, as other editors have demonstrated. No notable event has ever happened there (per above, such as shooting, or something of that nature). Verifiability is not the problem here; the website exists, I am sure newspaper article exists, and I have first hand experience, but that is not what matters. It is NOT notable. It is located in South Jersey, and as much as I hate to say it, South Jersey is as unnotable as it gets. The Cherry Hill Mall, on the other hand, one of the "competing malls" mentioned MAY be notable because it caters to the affluent and Cherry Hill is a well known area even to North Jersey and out-of-staters. The Burlington Center, on the other hand, is not. Any of the information here could probably just as well be in the general Malls article. Having said that, I do believe this article was created in good faith, but listing every mall in America is unproductive. <b><a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../h/o/b/User_talk%7EHobbeslover_fb13.html" title="User talk:Hobbeslover">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hobbeslover_dec5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hobbeslover">contribs</a></sup> 23:32, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I do add malls, but they do need some reason for inclusion. Adding your average local shopping mall is not a good direction to take. Likewise if something is used as a way point in providing directions does not make it notable, just noticable. Since all chuches are not notable, the fact that it houses a church kind of says it is not notable. For the record, the latest trend in the west seems to be chuches buying malls and using the rent as income for the church. Do we need to add all of these mall based chuches and the malls they own? <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 22:22, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Here's the thing, there are an extraordinary amount of malls that exist within North America, so for one mall to be considered encylopedic it has to stand up among the rest. Agreed? Well, in this article all this is listed is a description of eateries and big chain stores. There isn't anything exceptional about it, it's just...normal. Also for the comment about being a socio-ecomonic center, that is giving way too much credit for what the establishment is. By using that rationale, I could inculde my barber shop since a great deal of people from the area get hair cut there and there is a monetary transaction. The same could be said of a local McDonalds. It doesn't become an exceptional example if it is one of many. The current article is written like a directory and it can't get better. The only solution would be to elminate it since, it just has no notable whatsoever. This is deletable under, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (promotion, advert, indiscrim. list of info.

<dd>I must disagree with the delete part for two reasons. 1)The history will still be there in case someone can show exceptional notability for this mall and can build off of past history and 2) (and more importantly) so we can get a precedent going for speedy redirects for other malls without having to go through process to get the history deleted. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 14:27, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I'd be perfectly happy with a redirect-without-merge. At this point, deleting the history is overkill. I don't think histories should be deleted unless there's some very serious issue with the material in the history along the lines of libellous. In this case, retaining the redirect serves the purpose of leaving a placemarker to show that at some point someone, somewhere wanted an article about the mall, and the history does at least contain the address of the mall and its website. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:23, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Concerning the deletion, I need to ask for some advise. Since Walter ReMine happens to be connected with Haldane's Dilemma, I would think he cannot be left out completely. Readers will expect to find some mentioning of him. The question, though is, whether a separate article should be devoted to that, or that would rather be something for EvoWiki to deal with. Or, alternatively, a section in the main article should be decvoted to that. As long as ReMine was around to interfere with the article, I thought it best to try to confine him to his own article; but of course, it's not meant a necessarily permanent solution.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A list would be a terrible way to present the sum of all physics equations. Equations are meaningless without context and ideas. Anyway, good idea or no, it's not realistic nor useful to put <i>all</i> physics equations from <i>all</i> branches of physics in a single list. On the other hand, comprehensive lists of equations are often used for college physics 101 courses, and it would be nice to have such a list. But first, it has to present itself as being such a list, and nothing more.

<li>Yeah, that's true. Different levels of physics use different versions of the same equation. I did not propose a solution to that problem, because it's not my problem, as a Wikipedian. Let them figure it out at Wikibooks. But, since you ask, I will suggest at least three solutions: 1. Give each equation at a general (vector calculus) level, and subsequently mention how it simplifies in certain cases (reducing to no-calc, no trig equations). 2. Give 3 separate lists, for three separate levels of intro physics (this is not as silly as it sounds, we will eventually have a thing called wikiversity, right?). 3. Choose one level, mention at the top which level and prerequisites the list requires, and let students who need a different level sink or swim. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 07:15, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>[previous discussion]<s><b>Keep</b> or <b>Transwiki</b> to wikibooks.</s> The list of equations needed to do high school or introductory college physics DOES NOT grow, it is a relatively short and very static list.

<li>Well thats not exactly true. The laws of physics are pretty universal. If one were really going to flush this idea out you would want to have equations with algebra and calculus variations, but other than that....

<li>The 'thousands of equations' would be needed to give any semblence of a somewhat complete list of Physics equations. The list does not claim to be a list of only 'High School Physics Equations'. Even for high school or introductory college physics, what level are we to assume? I have heard that some high school physics courses don't even require basic trigonometry. The introductory college physics course I took used the differential form of Maxwell's equations. There is an immense variation in the amount of math used in introductory physics courses. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConstantine_Evans_2b64.html" title="User:Constantine Evans">Constantine Evans</a> 05:40, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This show airs on Raven Radio, a legitimate public station in Alaska. This isn't some guy broadcasting his pirate radio show from his bedroom, this is a legit (maybe small fanbase but still legit) show on a legitimate FCC certified radio station. Therefore, it isn't a vanity piece. On Wikipedia we have dozens of entries for small TV stations, radio stations, and radio shows. Is it notable? To the listeners of the radio station it MUST be since it is still on the air. Just because it is a small fanbase does NOT mean it is NOT notable. We have entries on artists and jazz muscians who NO ONE has heard of outside their respective genres and does THAT mean they are not notable? of course not.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This page may not be the most informational on Wikipedia, but it does meet the polices. It is a real show on a real radio station and if someone wants information on it, where are they going to go? Just because it doesn't show up on Google means nothing. If you google search "Ricahrd Larry Rusk," you don't get anything. Although that man ran the biggest underground drug operation in the state of Texas known to this day. He was eventually gunned down by the FBI. Just because you can't find his name on google means that his operation wasn't notable? No, it doesn't mean anything. Same thing here. The "Other Appearances" was meant to be intertaining and not taken seriously. Anyone who knows this show is obviously from Sitka or surrounding small communities and will un-doubtedly know that those people never were on the show. We also can be fairly certain that the only people who are reading this or the article are people who know the show because...who else would care? The pictures are there to represent the light-heartedness of the program and its atmosphere, not to make it look sophistocated. But what it all boils down to is: There are three policies plus the copyright policy. This page meets all of them. It has a neutral POV, the information about the show is viable information, its obviously not original research, and what copyright could it possibly be breaking? There is unlimited space on the internet. Its not stealing anything away from you. So why not let it stay?--Dnomyar 7:13, 8 June 2006.

<li>Your "Ricahrd Larry Rusk" argument is particularly amusing -- yeah, such an article would be deleted <b>since there's no proof he exists other than your say-so</b>. Besides, I'm not following the logical chain here: because an unprovable subject doesn't have an article, yours should?</li>
<li><i>its obviously not original research</i> Two untruths in one clause: no, it's not "obviously" or even debatably -- "not original research" -- it doesn't have a <b>single</b> reference, not even the bog-standard MySpace page every garage band has.</li>
<li><i>The pictures are there to represent the light-heartedness of the program and its atmosphere, not to make it look sophistocated.</i> Pictures should added visual information to an article -- I hardly think a <i>radio</i> show requires pictures -- especially those that drive home the point that the whole enterprise is Amateur Night in Dixie. I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest the actual reason for the photos has more to do with ego than illustration, and to which I say, see the above reference to MySpace. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 23:32, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Message from the Pirate Party of the United States:</b><br />
This article was NOT published by anyone who is affiliated with the Pirate Party of the United States. We believe that we are not yet established enough to warrent a wikipedia article. However, as most of you comment this is not some organization founded with no basis. Wired Mag. is currently working on a story and we have the full support of the Pirate Party of Sweeden. This article should be deleted at once, and in the future, when the organization is firmly established there should be an article made about it.<br />

<li><b>Keep.</b> Yes, I know, it is not yet a registered party, it hasn't yet been in an election, etc etc etc. The thing is, in 2 or 4 or 10 years, when(or if) this <i>is</i> a notable party and people <i>do</i> come to Wikipedia to read about it, I'm sure many of them, like me, will go back and see what the earliest revision is so we can watch how it developed in intimate detail. Wikipedia's strength, in my mind. is more than just its ability to update quickly and that it only has to pay minimal attention to bandwith/storage space, but rather it's ability to preserve each revision of the article in it's entirety, thus proving to be a researcher's dream in watching the development of ideas, and, yes, politics. Is this article detrimentally affecting Wikipedia's credibility or functionality? No. On the other hand, if we choose to delete the article, do we risk denying people what they come to wikipedia for, namely, information? Absolutely. --<a href="../../../a/k/7/User%7EAK7_0492.html" title="User:AK7">AK7</a> 00:33, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and the content must therefore by notable and encyclopedic at the time of articles creation.

<li>I've written a few responses but I'm having trouble explaining my views... basically what I'm trying to say is, first, Wikipedia loses little by keeping. Second, whlie we can only claim to be an encyclopedia, we are made into much more by our circumstances: we are a source of information, and I suppose one could say of "meta-information." We store not just a review and summary of the ideas that shape our world, but also how those ideas are formed and shaped, inasmuch as they have been in the years wikipedia has been around. Third, we should be concious of helping along future researchers. I'm well aware it's against policy to keep an article on the off-chance it could become notable, but the very-early revision histories would be a gold mine for future researchers, and the losses from it are infintesmally small. What do we lose by keeping around the article for 6 months (or 1 month) and seeing what comes of it? On the other hand, what do we potentially gain?</li>
<li>I should note that this is more of a general argument. I'm not saying that the revisions I see in this article's history are clearly going to be used for the historybooks a hundred years from now. I am saying that we don't yet know what information will or will not be useful a month, a year or a generation from now... so why not just leave it and let them sort it out? Have you ever heard a historian complain of too much information, too much documentation? The problem is almost invariably the loss of information.--<a href="../../../a/k/7/User%7EAK7_0492.html" title="User:AK7">AK7</a> 02:23, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> AK7, The simple answer is "because that's the way it is." You are making a sound and coherent argument about the purpose of Wikipedia. To be honest, in many ways I agree with your contention. In spite of this, the topic was fully hashed out to a different conclusion long before either of us arrived on Wikipedia's steps. Wikipedia has a clear mandate about what it is and what it isn't. And it is an encyclopedia (and this topic isn't encyclopedic) and it isn't a crystal ball. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 14:12, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't contest that there are a million policies that were decided long before we got into WP, but policy should <i>enable</i> us to keep useful information and delete the rest- not force us to say "well that's the way it is" and delete something that we (or just myself?) think is going to just be recreated before long (and that time, rightly so). I don't have any illusions of these people actually getting anyone on a ballot, let alone in office, but simply presenting a public face counter to the **AA's would make them notable- and every indication is that this is what will be happening in the next weeks and months. I do, however, get the feeling I'm pretty much alone in thinking this way, so if the consensus is on the other side, then that's where it is... --<a href="../../../a/k/7/User%7EAK7_0492.html" title="User:AK7">AK7</a> 18:53, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article is much too narrow (not only investment bankers get bonuses, almost everone might) and contains stuff that is more POV than information.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sorry, but those citations don't cut it. They all reference people "talking about making the movie" and "having a plan in place" but those don't mean anything in the industry.

Per <i>"It is appropriate to report discussion and arguments about the prospects for success of future proposals and projects or whether some development will occur, provided that discussion is properly referenced."</i> Seeing how Kojima has talked about it in his own radio show, in various interviews, including in PSW and OPSM magazines, Konami has talked about, official Kojima Productions promo materials talk about it, I think this can be made into a well referenced claim. Holywood is notorious for <a href="../../../d/e/v/Development_hell.html" title="Development hell">development hell</a>, but that doesn't mean that we can just write this off under the crystal ball guidelines. Hideo Kojima has talked about it, and obviously feels it is going to happen ("False facts aside, a movie project is underway. I have finalized a Class-A contract with a party in Hollywood."), Konami has made public statements about the project, and Kojima Productions has actually advertised with the project at e3. <s>Article needs some work on source cites though.</s>--<a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodemonkey_e6ae.html" title="User:Codemonkey">Codemonkey</a> 06:18, 10 June 2006 (UTC) Rewrote the article, providing proper source cites. --<a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodemonkey_e6ae.html" title="User:Codemonkey">Codemonkey</a> 08:05, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b>, The delete votes don't offer any rationale (i.e. "Because") and the article not only has references but is based off of interviews from major players in the Metal Gear franchise, not 3rd party speculators. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilversnake020_a94c.html" title="User:Silversnake020">Silversnake020</a> 14:31, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> None of this changes that there is no script, no budget, no shooting schedule, no director, no anything except an intention to make a film. Intentions don't warrant articles. There's enough now to warrant a mention on the Metal Gear Solid page, but not its own page. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 15:54, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I feel they do warrant an article, as long as the 'intentions' are notable and verifiable enough. I feel they are. The way I read it, Crystal Ball policy both explicitly allows for this, and the stated basis of said policy is indeed verifiability and notability, thus something to be kept in mind when reading that policy. The policy is there to cut down "unverifiable speculation". This article isn't, I feel. --<a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodemonkey_e6ae.html" title="User:Codemonkey">Codemonkey</a> 20:00, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think this meets notability. It's documented and would be worth mentioning on the Metal Gear Solid page. I can't see it being notable until it actually goes into production as most popular video games have someone intending to make a movie at some point. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 02:03, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The crystal ball policy states this regarding notability: "All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable, and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred." I think that is true for this article. Or are you talking about some additional requirements? Something from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, or linked from WP:N? --<a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodemonkey_e6ae.html" title="User:Codemonkey">Codemonkey</a> 04:47, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a vanity addition, of a non notable band.</p>
<p>If you Google; Exovedate Daneka Lisa Smith, (the band and their vocalist, as Exovedate is also just a word)... it gives only 13 results. Giving only links to the bands website and this article.</p>
<p>The band fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> completely. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> 08:28, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is wrong! Exovedate is Canada's most successful Goth band. They have existed for 12 years. They are a signed band with the same label as Clan of Xymox. Their music has charted all over the world. They have released 3 CD's, and are on SEVEN gothic compilation CD's. To remove this page would be arbitrary and discriminatory. A googlr search for exovedate gives 649 results. You have some weird hate on for this band, and are acting in an aggressive and highly inapproriate manner. Wiki is not just a resource for Americans.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, the band meets the following "notability" requirements:</p>
<p>Has had a charted hit on any national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country.[1]</p>
<p>They have charted all over the world</p>
<p>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</p>
<p>They are working on their 4th CD and are signed with Pandaimonium Records.</p>
<p>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</p>
<p>Simon Wilcox was a lead singer with them. Check her article! Canadians know who she is even if you don't! Stop systemic discrimination!</p>

<li>1. Exovedate is also a word, not just a musical project, hense why a search coupled with the vocalist's name heralds more realistic results (13 results)</li>

<li>3. There is <b>no evidence</b> for the claim that the group have "charted all over the world", (unlikley considering the band has 13 Google results) in the bands article it claims their songs have appeared on local college radio once or twice, that is common-place for most bands.</li>
<li>4.

<p>I would like it noted that the individual who is asking for deletion has also VANDALIZED the Exovedate page. Delete Exovedate? You obviuosly have something personally against them, because there are plenty of bands in wiki, and specifically on the list of gothich rock bands, of less renown than them. This is so silly. Their music appears on 10 CD's. They are Canada's most accompmlished goth band, no one else has done that. You are very mean-spitirted actually. You expect a goth band to be as well known as the Beatles or Bob Marley your non-american examples? You ARE being discriminatory. Shame!</p>
<p>Clearly they met the objective criteria as has been previously stated, so I won't repeat it. But I would like it noted that every thing in the article appears accurate, and clearly they are therefore notable, unless something in there is wrong! - <i>unsigned comment by <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirandah_96d4.html" title="User:Mirandah">Mirandah</a></i></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Retaliation for what? Since the movie isn't in production, it can't be cancelled. It hasn't been budgeted, etc, onylicensed. Most hot properties get licensed. In many cases, the license is never actually used. Lord of the Rings had the rights sold more than thirty years before it was made. If the Wikipedia had existed at the time, would it have been appropriate to have an article that whole time just to inform people of who had the rights? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 11:03, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure what ShadowZach means with retaliation means either. But if you read the actual interviews, press release, etc. it's more than just licensed, or optioning of the movie rights of some property. They've entered an agreement to produce a movie together. I hope I have edited the page enough so that it, verifiably, reflects this. Crystal Ball guidelines are there to cut down on 'unverifiable speculation'. I feel the project is in such a state that an article about it will not be 'unverifiable speculation', and that in fact the current state of the article is evidence of this. --<a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodemonkey_e6ae.html" title="User:Codemonkey">Codemonkey</a> 16:41, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think that there is a place on Wikipedia for certain TV series, movies, video games etc. that didn't happen, so long as they're notable (either as a significant spinoff of something as notable as <i>Buffy</i>, or by a particularly notable creative team), and that there's enough interesting information and history to make the article worthwhile. Had that been the case with <i>Ripper</i>, I'd have voted Keep. However, despite looking at one point like it would go ahead, I don't think things ever got far enough along the line (with plotting, potential casting, whatever) for this article to ever be particularly substantial - unlike, say, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_Animated_Series_00ce.html" title="Buffy the Animated Series">Buffy the Animated Series</a>, which I feel is a worthwhile article. <b>Note</b> that if this is deleted, there's information in it that it would be worthwhile merging elsewhere - whether in the Giles entry or in <i>Buffy</i> itself - and also that <a href="../../../b/u/f/Template%7EBuffyversenav_a1bf.html" title="Template:Buffyversenav">Template:buffyversenav</a> will need to be edited (unless the article redirects to <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Giles_69db.html" title="Rupert Giles">Rupert Giles</a> and a section on <i>Ripper</i> is created there, in which case it should be alright). <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 10:20, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> I don't think it sould be deleted as it is still a potential venture and is at least as important as a given book in the timeline is. and as to "either as a significant spinoff of something as notable as <i>Buffy</i>, or by a particularly notable creative team" it would be a significant spinoff if it were to go ahead and mutant enemy are a particularly notable team. In a couple of years after goners and wonda woman there is a good chance that this could still go ahead. I wouldn't delete it untill someone has made a statement that it will not go ahead, so until someone produces that evidence I think the article should stay.--Knavescurvy 13:00, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm unsure whther this would be a better idea than merging the Ripper article with the <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Giles_69db.html" title="Rupert Giles">Rupert Giles</a> article? I shall vote later after some discussion. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 13:00, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - It is purely speculative and once it has been confirmed as being a real series, an article about this can be set up.

<li><b>comment</b> - the article doesn't belong on the <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Giles_69db.html" title="Rupert Giles">Rupert Giles</a> page as it is to me more about the buffyverse than the character at the current time it can be seen on the buffyverse chronology timeline as a potential series that occurs after season 5 of angel and the web page clearly states how speculative it is at the moment which is not this year but there is intrest in doing it in a few years. the only other alternative that I would deam acceptable is to create a <b>Buffyverse undeveloped projects</b> page.--Knavescurvy 13:23, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I'm sorry that I am bothering you all again but I have just looked at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Deletion_policy</a> and as this is not a hoax not misleading and not unverified (everything that the article states is verified) not nonsence or vanity or even poorly written, In fact there isn't an actual problem other than that the article doesn't state how likely it is to happen which as that information is unavailable is not a problem with the article so unless someone actually states a proper reason as in the deletion policy this process is inconcistent. --Knavescurvy 13:37, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>userfy/delete</b>. The votes suggested "userfy," but I looked at User:Moranovision's edits. He/she has not edited here for 6 months, leading me to believe that the article wasn't simply a misplaced userpage. Since "userfy" includes removal from article space, that's what I'm doing. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyous%21_8a6f.html" title="User:Joyous!">Joyous!</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoyous%21_ed0e.html" title="User talk:Joyous!">Talk</a> 21:06, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hmmm... that seems quite an abrupt response and you also appear to have either misread or misunderstood what I wrote.

<dd><i>All articles must be held to encyclopaedic standards of verifiability.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I never said they shouldn't. In fact, if you re-read my argument, you will notice that this is the reason I voted delete.
<dl>
<dd><i>Countering systemic bias is about making sure we write about whatever is verifiable regardless of where it comes from, not relaxing standards.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Again, I never said anything about relaxing standards. My point was that reliable sources on topics related to Africa are much fewer in number and much harder to access than for similar topics in the USA. That we have to hold African articles to the same standards as other articles where sources are much more prevalent, regrettably results in fewer African articles being written. This is a bias induced by the system. However, the way to tackle the bias is not to lower standards, but instead to be aware of the bias and make even stronger efforts to try and identify sources than you would do for a similar article centred on a more economically developed region.
<dl>
<dd><i>After all, Africa does have the Internet, and it has plenty of newspapers.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Yes, but how many people have internet access as a proportion of the total African population? Much less than the proportion of internet users in Europe, for example. Again, how many different papers per head of population and how widely available are they outside their primary area of publication? In the UK, I can go to a library in my town and pick up a wide selection of newspapers that were recently published in the USA; on the other hand, the number of African newspapers available to me is relatively small.

<dd>OK, I admit that I should have phrased that comment in a better way, but it was something I snapped off shortly before leaving for work. My point was that I was acknowledging that if we somehow get a reliable source to back up the article then it <i>may</i> be worthy of retention. I didn't think it was appropriate to go into a lengthy diatribe about why this page is notable when it is not yet verified, so I left just a quick note of my opinion. I will remember that Essay for use in the future, though I hope I will explain it a bit more clearly to the person I am aiming it at - perhaps by saying something like; <i>You shouldn't use the notability of unrelated articles to justify the notability of another (see <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a>).</i></dd>
<dd>Well, this is the first time I have had to justify a vote of support to the person I am supporting. Quite an interesting turn of events.

<li><b>Keep</b> Just because it is not notable doesn't mean it should be deleted. What's wrong with having an article of a game that is not notable. I am a game maker and my games are not notable, but yet they are not up for deletion, I just had alot of rewriting and merging to do. Other people helped me rewrite. This article may currently be like a game manual, but it can be written to read like a professional encyclopedia article. One of my game's articles was unprofessional, but with the help of the community it is now. The same can be done with the DragonFable article. If needed the DragonFable community (players signed up on the Artix Entertainment Forums) probably wouldn't mind rewritting it. I would even help. How it is written is the problem not popularity/notability. This can be fixed.--VampireSlayer2 22:11, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> When I rewrote the article, I intended it to be a source of information. I am trying to get support for a rewrite that will make it look more professional and fix the article.

<li><b>What part of</b> "I got the message" didn’t everyone else get? I understand the pages can not stay here in their current form, but this is only making things worse since the recreation of any deleted material is an automatic speedy delete. Componding the problem is that I can't freeze the pages or otherwise indicate that they are not "live" for editing, and I can not simply blank the pages until I reach a WP:NOT friendly solution. I am to the point of simply giving up with the project, as ABSOLUTLY NO ONE seems to one to cut me any slack.

<li>I stated that back when the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Structures_of_the_Chinese_3282.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Structures of the Chinese">China strucutres page</a> can up for deletion. It was intend to convey that I had gotten the message regarding WP:NOT and these pages (by which I mean all of the structures pages) and that I would work on retooling them to make them more Wikipedia friendly. It is not that these pages can not be on wikipdia, its just that they can not be on wikipedia in their current form. Thats why I have been working to find a solution to the problem, but every time a page ends up on AFD it screws me that much more because the number of options I have grow that much smaller. The larger issue here is that RTS and TBS games rely on a collection of otherwise unremarkable units and strucutures for gameplay, and Wikipedia does not acknowlage this fact, so I am effectively waging a two front war to find that happy medium where the info present is WP:NOT friendly. Compounding the problem is that lots of people will vote delete for the info, but only a very limited number will suggest alternative outlets for it, and no on has of yet suggested a way that the info could be presented here safely. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 20:37, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

If anyone is interested, you can check out the versions here, but remeber that this page is "mine" in so far as a page on wikipedia can be "mine", and the schemes pesented are ment as brainstorms, nothing has yet been set in stone. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 22:39, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just pointing out that the link Tom gives - User:TomStar81/Definition Debate - has all the text of all the game guide articles he made, and so the requests he makes for 'give him a chance' are misplaced. How-to guides have no place, at all, on an encyclopaedia; it doesn't matter how you try and crowbar it in.

I am no expert on <b>Hindu Mythology</b> but from what I have studied and what I know, this is certainly not a hoax. Unless, offcourse, given the fact that, mythologies donot usually have verifiable "historical proof", they are categorized all as hoaxes. I am sure that is not the case. I have read the article on <a href="../../../v/r/i/Vritra.html" title="Vritra">Vritra</a> and though there are similarilites, it seems to be different is quite a many ways as well and I am not too sure if they are the same. They do seem to have quite a few differences. What I would suggest is that we do some research rather than simply deleting the article. it may take a few days to get to the root of this.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> There's a long, sad story here. The main author of the article, <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymouser_8295.html" title="User:Anonymouser">Anonymouser</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymouser_738f.html" title="User talk:Anonymouser">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anonymouser_d4fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anonymouser">contribs</a>), is believed to be a sockpuppet of Carl Hewitt, who is referenced in the article. Hewitt was a major figure in the logic-based end of artificial intelligence back in the 1970s. This is widely believed to be a dead end today, and Hewitt is one of the few people still trying to make it work. The general idea here is to develop "weak logics" which have more tolerance for ambiguity and contradiction than classic logic, which is very brittle. John McCarthy developed "circumscription" as an early effort in this direction, and there have been other variations on this theme. None of them are really all that useful. Bayesian inference seems to work better. What we're seeing here is something that, for now, seems to be a theoretical dead end. That happens in mathematics. The article does cite published papers, though, and I'm inclined to keep it in. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 18:09, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> The logic-based approach to AI has been revived the last few years in the forms of agents (similar to Hewitt's actors) and they may indeed have a future (my CS department is gambling on it) but this is of little significance. The article is based on two conference papers by Hewitt which do not seem to have been published in a peer-reviewed journal making this original research. (And even if they <i>were</i> published in a peer-reviewed journal there should be at least few other authors writing about or refering to Hewitt's direct logic to make this verifialbe and notable enough for inclusion.) —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R.

<li><b>Keep</b> The grounds originally cited for deletion are not valid. The article reports on a publication by a noted academic. The results of the publication have been presented in seminars at Stanford and SRI. So it is difficult to argue that it is not notable. The field is divided into camps that radically disagree with each other. Consequently the ultimate value of the research is a matter of great controversy. However, the problem addressed in the motivation section of the article is of the highest importance in computer science: What is the field going to do about the pervasive contradictions among documentation and code of large software systems (think Windows!)? Also there do not appear to be any glaring errors in the article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.254.59.254 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.254.59.254_cafd.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.254.59.254">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>As in my comment above, Carl Hewitt <i>may be</i> "a noted academic", but papers (2006a) and (2006b) are from conference proceedings, in which it appears <b>he</b> was invited, but the papers were <b>not</b> peer-reviewed. (And it's still fringe mathematics, rather than dead-end mathematics, even with the 20-year history. CS people, when trying to do mathematics, sometimes get confused.) If anything related to those papers is excised from the article, and there's still something there, I'd make it a reluctant keep. <b>Those papers are <i>invalid</i> as primary or secondary sources</b>, except as an indication of the opinions of the author. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 18:33, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So, it is original research - which has no place in a Wikipedia. As for your other points, the discussion shows that not even the basics of "Direct Logic" have been established (does it <i>explode</i> or not?). Anyway, if it is so relevant, Hewitt can surely publish it in a peer reviewed journal.

<li>Even if we did accept OR (which Wikipedia doesn't under any circumstance), Direct Logic is not "highly validated".

As far as it being a game manual that is also not a valid point, a chouette form of backgammon which is played socially, and the explanation tries to show what is it all about. You might also be able to debate weather any explanation of a game is a manual for it as well, well ofcourse you have history, important people, rules of the game but you will still have to give an idea of how to play the game in order to make it interesting for the user. As well as you have to assume that a person, whose looking for backgammon or chouettes on wikipedia, might want to learn what is the term as well as get a general idea of how backgammon or chouettes are played by reading rules and game forms of play. I hope I conveyed my thoughts in trying to explain why this article should be published in wikipedia and that the simple and short explanation on the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backgammon.html" title="Backgammon">backgammon</a> article is not enough for someone who is trying to really figure out what is the <b>chouette</b> is all about.</li>

<li><s><b>Transwiki and Edit</b>. Though this is a well-written and exhaustive article, it falls under "rules for playing the game" and should be sent to wikibooks.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. A wikibook about Backgammon is plain great. Not all too sure what you mean above though, that "also" got me confused. The purpose of my link was mainly to make sure you had a link to wikibooks, since you are new to the whole wikimedia thing, and to show where such a wikibook should be listed, though I have no idea what's the procedure on Wikibooks to do so. By the way, you can link to wikibooks directly, for instance "[[b:Backgammon|Backgammon book]]" which displays like a regular wikipedia link&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Backgammon" class="extiw" title="b:Backgammon">Backgammon book</a>.

<dd>Forgot to say: The tone of the article is a little too casual for wikipedia (I expect it's fine for wikibooks), in particular, addressing the reader with "you" is a no-no on wikipedia. Other than that, I think the content stripped of instructions is fine. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> <small><a href="../../../e/q/u/User_talk%7EEquendil_2b4e.html" title="User talk:Equendil"><i>Talk</i></a></small> 12:37, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Updates</b>. I now have corrected the issue of the tone that the article took and now it is explained in the third person which is more profesional then addressing the reader as "you" thanks again to <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> advise and comments. Looks to me that it is presented better then before by getting help from various wikipedians and working on their feedback.

<li><b>Information</b>. Hey Guys, I wanted to know when and if the box on the top of the article will be removed and who is allowed to remove it, that is if we agree that this is a good article to be kept here on wikipedia. I think that most of you agree that this article was changed to meet the requirements of wikipedia, as well as a <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Backgammon" class="extiw" title="b:Backgammon">Backgammon book</a> that had started on wikibooks. so I think all in all this will benefit readers wanting to know information on backgammon in the long run, especially with the link to the backgammon book thanks to <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a>, which will direct people to add and edit the backgammon book that I have started. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidoff_da85.html" title="User talk:Davidoff"><i>Talk</i></a> | <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidoff_eaea.html" title="User:Davidoff">Davidoff</a> 03:13, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are many articles about the South Park universe, little things or not. This is just one of them. This doesn't need to be deleted. 80.222.222.118 15:09, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article isn't totally pointless. Just because it was a small part of the movie doesn't mean it isn't worth noting.</p>
<p>This is one of the funniest moments in that movie...and is basically the understory for it as well. Who suggested to delete it anyways? Worth having on here for sure.</p>

<p>I'm contesting the proposed deletion of this Internet comic. The only reason for its deletion seems to be non-verifiability. It's real, people! As the talk page says, I think I can't provide a direct link, but just go to Google, type "paska ankka", and click on the links on the first page. If you're lucky even the first one might work. That's how <b>I</b> verified it before translating the article to English. The <a href="../../../../fi/p/a/s/Paska_Ankka_b41a.html" class="extiw" title="fi:Paska_Ankka">Finnish version</a> was nominated for deletion, for non-notability rather than non-verifiability, and kept. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 16:59, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've tried to source this, and it can't be sourced beyond primary sources, and I can't find enough information to even source this article. I don't dispute that it may be real, but that's not the point of Wikipedia, <b>I'm real</b>. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> policy demands "facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources". I can't source these, so I prodded the article as a method of removing unverifiable material. If someone can find a definitive verifiable source which contextualises this phrase in a manner in which an article can be written I'm happy to change my vote, but it isn't enough to say this stuff exists. The whole basis of wikipedia is that the three key policies are non-negotiable. Otherwise, can I please start adding information about my Sunday League Football team, they're real. I can link to them. Notability isn't the issue, it's being able to verify the statements made. This article includes a summary of a statement from the Finnish Aku Ankka (Donald Duck) comic book. If that can't be sourced it has to be removed since I can't quantify that it's not original research. Nothing in this article can be quantified apart from the fact that some people on the internet use the term to describe what they are doing. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a guide to the internet</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:11, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Paska Ankka is a real, fan-made, parody comic of Aku Ankka, consisting of a series of scanned Aku Ankka comics, with the dialogue changed to sex- and drug-related discussion, but with the artwork kept intact. That is all the original Finnish article, and the article I wrote in English, ever claimed it was. A series of scanned comics pages on the Internet. I would love to give you a direct link to the scanned comics but IANAL, so I am afraid to give a direct link to what I believe is illegal material. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 19:34, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't dispute your point. However, you are using the primary source as your basis for an article. On the English Wikipedia verifiability policy states that <i>If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic.</i> If there are no third party sources, it should be deleted. A link to an example of the instance is sadly not enough, given that Wikipedia is not a guide to the internet. We need to discuss and examine such occurrences in an encyclopedic manner, contextualising their impact on society and meaning to the world around them, and we can only do that by summarising third party sources. Wikipedia has no place for <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which at this moment this article is. I have no problem with helping to clean up this article and contextualising it for a wider audience, but at the moment no-one can provide such sources. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:44, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I never would have closed that as a keep. Some of the keep arguments are fairly ridiculous, "Wikipedia certainly needs more shit." The standards for writing an encyclopedia appear lower in Finland, although I'm aware I base that view on a small pool. The point of reliable sources and verifiability was never addressed.

<li>Thanks for your feedback, however, the focus of the listing is NOT for the corporatation, but rather for the term "casual courier." The term is widely used now in the shipping industry, and happens to be a registered trademark of the The Casual Courier, Inc. (that is the only reason why the corporation is listed in the entry). Furthermore, according the the Wiki policies, if a company has had a number of articles published about it from reputable news sources, then it has the right to be included on Wikipedia. Numerous articles have been independantly published about The Casual Courier, Inc. (which again, is NOT the focus of this entry) in Wired News, the front page of the Boston Herald Business section and a number of other publications available <a href="http://www.casualcourier.com/Content.Press.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.casualcourier.com/Content.Press.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>. So, on both grounds, the entry <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casual_courier.html" title="Casual courier">casual courier</a> should remain and the flagging removed please. Looking forward to your continued feedback. Thanks for taking the time to comment.</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b> and disambiguate. The article for the <b>term</b> "casual courier" should be separated from the article for the <b>company</b> called "Casual Courier", which would make this article seem a lot less like advertising. The term appears to be in casual (haha) use by other sources (with or without reference to the trademark) -- try a quick Google and you'll see that it occasionally <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22casual+courier%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22casual+courier%22" rel="nofollow">shows up</a> as usage unrelated to the company name itself (and more related to the concept discussed in the first part of the page). However, there's less than 4,500 hits total (including hits on the company name), so this may well be a neologism. The company is arguably notable&#160;: for example, Wired did a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/privacy/0,69833-0.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/privacy/0,69833-0.html" rel="nofollow">story on them</a>, which included discussion of their business model and security issues. On the other hand, I'd feel better about this article if it wasn't written by someone with the same name as the company's founder ("J(ack) Jacobs"). So, any volunteers to clean this one up bigtime?

<li>I appreciate all of your comments and feedback. We took into account all opinions above in the new revision of the entry just posted. Please note that we removed almost all references to the company, without relinquishing our legal rights to the term. In addtion, you'll notice we added a "see also" section that brings together other types of courier delivery, thereby contributing to the overall understanding and knowledge of readers who are genuinely interested in learning about the full spectrum of delivery options that exist in the world, both traditional AND innovative are now represented on Wikipedia! Please feel free offer further comments so that the final entry can be acceptable to all members and offer a quality contribution to Wikipedias extroidinary resource for valid information. --Jjacobs 20:36, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> — the inherent problem with this entry is pointed out by Arthur Rubin. With the phrase "casual courier" being the trademarked name of the company, the article is linked to the company. Especially with the title being "Casual Courier" versus "casual courier" (a concept), it is advertising and at this point, there is no article on the company — which might not make it as an article based on <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. (Even with "cleanup", the article reads completely like an ad.) —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) @ 23:47, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think we may need to pass this on to the lawyers, but it <i>appears</i> to me that the trademark is on "The" followed by the paper airplane followed by "Casual Courier", and may not be a trademark on the name without the symbol. It's still a problem, as they've added the paper airplane to the article.... — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 00:03, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a>. Only when this page is broken into separate articles can we determine whether "casual courier" (the concept) and "(The?) Casual Courier" (the company) are each nonnotable and encyclopedic in its own right. Currently, even with the "cleanup," the article does read like an advertisement. With luck, a good disambig and cleanup should take care of <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a>'s concerns, as the trademark will only be included in the article on the -company-. As far as I can tell, trademarks can be part of articles which unambiguously focus on particular companies (for example, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Parcel_Service_8d55.html" title="United Parcel Service">UPS</a> and <a href="../../../d/h/l/DHL_53c6.html" title="DHL">DHL</a>. However, <i>contra</i> Jjacobs's assertion, the article currently combines discussion of the "casual courier" concept and the "(The?) Casual Courier" company in a manner which is likely to confuse readers of Wikipedia. This is unacceptable -- if the article is not cleaned up, it should be <b>deleted</b> without prejudice. Best, <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocether_44df.html" title="User:Docether">Docether</a> 13:09, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>OK. We considered all of the above comments and made some MAJOR changes to the entry in order to seperate out the casual courier concept from the corporation, and thereby reduce confusion to readers. To begin with, we changed the page title from "Casual Courier" to "casual courier", and as a result made a deeper division between the concept and the company. We also added a completely new entry for the corporation <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Casual_Courier_6969.html" title="The Casual Courier">The Casual Courier</a>, Inc. which has a number of external links to notable news articles written about the company, and clearly identified the unique innovations introduced to the shipping industry by the company. We sincerely hope that the Wikipedia community will accept these changes. If you have further comments, please feel free to send them along and we will be happy to further edit the entry until it is fully acceptable to all. Thanks for your continued feedback.--Jjacobs 11:20, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: User Jjacobs has now said several times that they have taken the comments in consideration and changed the article accordingly: however, when I look at AirSitter (referenced from <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casual_Courier_e1e7.html" title="Casual Courier">Casual Courier</a>), it is an advertisement for the company: so is <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casual_Courier_e1e7.html" title="Casual Courier">Casual Courier</a>, "TCC", and of course <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Casual_Courier_6969.html" title="The Casual Courier">The Casual Courier</a>. This doesn't look to me like a honest try to make encyclopedic articles, but more like a large promo action. So I would suggest to just delete the lot. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:31, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree there is a large promotional advertising component here, but casual couriering itself is a large scale concept and is used around the world. I personally have had the oppurtunity to participate in schemes like this, though change of plans forced me to decline. The Casual Courier is a company that is being promoted at the moment I agree, but the concept and action of casual couriering is separate enough from the company that I think it should stay whatever the views on the company are. Just my thoughts. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 13:36, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but remove the advertising ... I also have some <b>comments</b> - "trademark" is not the same as "copyright". Anyone can put TM by anything they want. That isn't a prohibition against mentioning the word or term they trademarked. If I open a fast food chain called "Great Scott's Dining", I could sue someone who subsequently opened a restaurant called "Great Scott's Kitchen" in the same area where I'm doing business. I would not, however, have cause to stop <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Emmett_Brown_7d8f.html" title="Doctor Emmett Brown">anyone</a> from using the exclamation "Great Scott". Similarly, if "casual courier" is a commonly used term, (I don't know whether it is - but the article asserts it is, so I'm going from that), then (1) you can't stop people who were already using the term from continuing to do so and (2) you certainly can't stop an encyclopedia from writing about the concept. From g-hits, "casual courier" appears to be used beyond this company. A simple link to the company's website would suffice and maybe a note of disambiguation at the top of the page.

<li><b>Comment</b> This item has been listed for deleted for a week's time. However, during that time, it has not been appropriately cleaned up to disambiguate the term "casual courier" from the company "The Casual Courier" (even though its primary editor has posted to this discussion repeatedly). This article continues to read as advertising, which is not allowed on Wikipedia. Additionally, as <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> points out, the user creating this article has begun another series of related articles which read as out-and-out promotion and advertising. For the moment, I retain my <b>cleanup (and keep)</b> vote, but if this item survives AfD and is not cleaned up to adhere to Wikipedia guidelines, it should be relisted for deletion <i>with prejudice</i>, along with its related items. -- <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocether_44df.html" title="User:Docether">Docether</a> 15:50, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The main reasons I have created the new article entitled Memons is because, it seems that Mr. Siddiqui does not like to share certain view of others, some of the comment he made about Memons is not only bias but offensive. For example In culture and history section, he mentioned that <b>“they have retained many cultural traits from their pre-Islamic past”</b> He is also unnecessarily focusing on the Memons the they are belongs to a Sufi order which is not necessarily accurate He also removed one of my comment in section in both articles <b>Memons today</b> Memoni is falling into disuse and the younger generation is unlikely to learn it as their mother tongue for various reasons. <b>Development of inferiority complex about their heritage by many memon</b> Please refer to discussion section As a member of Memon community, I am well informed about this subject than Mr. Siddiqui. The article Memons is more comprehensive than Memon - and this article will continue to grow Also I have created at least 10 new articles related to very subject, and each new article, I have tried to provide link to both articles just to be fair. --<a href="../../../s/i/d/User%7ESiddique_Katiya_a8fe.html" title="User:Siddique Katiya">Siddique Katiya</a> 23:01, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I created the <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memon.html" title="Memon">Memon</a> article anonymously in 2004, using the IP Address 168.209.98.35. I tried to be as objective as possible when I created the <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memon.html" title="Memon">Memon</a> article, and tried to maintain that until I was rendered unable to edit on Wikipedia for technical reasons. A number of accuracy disputes, which were not resolved have been removed without adequate explanation, and the article still does not cite its sources to a satisfactory extent (the meaning of the word <i>Memon</i>, for example, which was disputed has now been stated as an absolute fact to be derived from <i>Momin</i> - a look at the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindhi_Memon_886e.html" title="Sindhi Memon">Sindhi Memon</a> article shows an alternative derivation theory also exists).</p>
<p>I also propose that the article <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memon_%28tribe%29.html" title="Memon (tribe)">Memon (tribe)</a> also be deleted and merged. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPark3r_cea4.html" title="User:Park3r">Park3r</a> 12:20, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>ahhh, here "jihad, sometimes spelled Jahad, Jehad or Djehad, (Arabic: جهاد‎ ǧihād) is an Islamic term, from the Arabic root ǧhd ("to exert utmost effort, to strive, struggle"), which connotes a wide range of meanings: anything from an inward spiritual struggle to attain perfect faith to a political or military struggle to further the Islamic cause. Individuals involved in the political or military forms of jihad are often labeled with the neologism "jihadist". The term "jihad" is often rendered in western languages and non-Islamic cultures as "holy war", but this "physical" struggle, which encompasses warfare, only makes up part of the broader meaning of the concept of jihad. The denotation is of a struggle, challenge, difficulty, or (frequently) opposed effort, made either in accomplishment or as resistance. A person who engages in any form of jihad can be called a mujahid (in plural: mujahadin) (Arabic: striver, struggler), a term even more often applied to groups who practice armed struggle in the name of Islam. He might engage in fighting as a military struggle for religious reasons, or for example, struggle to memorize the Qur'an." <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPure_inuyasha_cc57.html" title="User:Pure inuyasha">Pure inuyasha</a> 03:54, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Fastifex, if you want to write an article about a book which has the phrase, 'Jihad state' in it's title, then go ahead. I repeat, the term 'Jihad state' is <i><b>not</b></i> in popular use, and hence there should not be an article about it. The concept of <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a> is already adequately discussed. The term 'Jihad state' is not worth devoting an article to any more than the phrase 'Beckham Golden Balls' is (and that <b>is</b> a popular term&#160;!). <a href="../../../m/p/a/User%7EMpatel_da58.html" title="User:Mpatel">MP</a> <a href="../../../m/p/a/User_talk%7EMpatel_28b1.html" title="User talk:Mpatel">(talk)</a> 19:23, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>If we were to leave out subjects just because they aren't in popular use, we're not writing an encyclopaedia but a childish rag. Jihad states in the restricted sense (some anonymous reedit extended it dubiously, unsourced, and messed up the jihad use) are a major component of the history of West Africa, certainly more important then anything to do with sports or celebrities (which nevertheless deserve their place to). Resepectable websites on history and dynasties (with vast bibliographies) cerainly know about them and use the (almost self-explicatory) term for whicj I know no alternative in use.</dd>

<p>This was listed for deletion in 2004 with no consensus, and then rapidly re-listed for deletion but this was prematurely cancled since it was so far after the first call for deletion. The problem with this webpage is non notability. Besides that, if this person is notable, it is probably only because he is one of the most prolific spamdexers ever, with a gigantic amount of self linking domains in his name that for a long time dominated websearches on many topics. You can see his domains here:</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The article has been listed for deletion more than one time, and the result has always been a consensus in favour of keeping it. I am rather appalled that wikipedians are still insisting on having it removed from the encyclopedia. How often is this procedure supposed to take place? Also, please note that the accusation that this person is notable "only because he is one of the most prolific spamdexers ever" is simply preposterous. The work of Pearce has been mentioned on the mainstream media (e.g., <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i>), praised by respected academics (e.g., <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Chalmers_912b.html" title="David Chalmers">David Chalmers</a>), and widely discussed on the world wide web. A person is not unworthy of mention just because you haven’t heard of him. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Paul_8b76.html" title="User:Sir Paul">Sir Paul</a> 17:36, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that if it is not kept, it should be merged with the article on the hedonistic imperative.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keep - 1. on the grounds that Pearce is indeed notable: he co-founded the World Transhumanist Association, and his internet presence is highly significant in several areas for example psychopharmacology (I recommend some of his essays for my university students). 2. The charge of being a 'spamdexer' is unsubstantiated because untrue - the high rank which Pearce's work often gets in web searches (including Google - which is supposed by now to be largely immune from crude manipulation) should on the contrary be regarded as a measure of its influence.</li>

<p>So I take it that someone having his name changed to that of a cartoon character is enough criteria for an encyclopedia article to be written about him. Well in that case I think I'll go have my name changed to "Elmer Fudd" tomorrow so that pretty soon someone will be creating an article about me. Seriously now, this is a blatant violation of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVanity_6666.html" title="WP:Vanity">WP:Vanity</a> and how it has survived two previous deletion nominations I have no earthly idea.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This guy was a TV news story that became a significant enough internet meme to warrant his place here. I know Google ranking isn't a definitive test, but the WKYC news story and Prime's weblog turn up #2-3 on Google for 'Optimus Prime', this Wikipedia page specifically has recently been linked to by a high-traffic news site (as mentioned in the talk page) and turns up #5 on Google. And this is for a story that first broke in 2003. Wikipedia pages about notable 'unusual names' are explicitly allowed. If you go change your name to Elmer Fudd and manage a TV news story and significant internet publicity out of it, more power to ya. The only issue I had was with a disambiguation link pointing here which I removed (nobody is <i>confusing</i> this person with the cartoon character). radimvice 03:32, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, I have no POV against legal name-changing. Of course it is perfectly appropriate (and even mildly interesting) for Mr. Prime to have changed his name; I just don't think it's an encyclopedically notable event. Of course a vote for 'merge' implies that there should not be full biographical details of the real-life individual at the <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> article.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 20:34, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It hasn't always been self published. But even then, what's wrong with a self published comic being in Wiki? Lots of comics are self published and underground in nature. That doesn't mean there's no interest in them or that they're undeserving of a "wikiarticle." You have to look at it sort of like an underground band or cult film. I hope you'll reconsidered your stance on the Halloween Man article, because we've put alot of work into it. And hope to have the chance to continue to improve it. Plus the comic itself hasn't just been a self published venture. Though that's been apart of it's history, it's also been published by atleast two small publishers. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bubfan (<a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubfan_4195.html" title="User talk:Bubfan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubfan_3b9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubfan">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>What? I don't know a single person who searches that way. Look at the searches before you write me off why don't you? I'll bet over 99 percent of them relate to the comic Seems to me like you guys have already made up your minds. So why even bother with this discussion? Look I think the fact that there's sereval people debating against you proves that atleast worth a further look before you delete.

If you say so. How do I even know you guys aren't the same person? It's an act of trust now isn't it. If you really must now I'm at work otherwise I'd make a profile. And I came across this little debate quite by accident. But that's nether here nor there. You're dancing around the points I've made rather than simply clicking on the links. I doubt you'll find at all to confusing. It's just a list of sites. Make an informed opinion rather than an uninformed one.

<p>Is there ANY way to save this? - Russell H</p>
<p>Okay- so what exactly is the basis for wanting to delete this whole article? Because it doesn't hold enough interest between you and your group of friends? I really don't quite understand. Aeveryman 17:12, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Quite simply (and as has been made clear) because the subject isn't notable per Wikipedia standards. Just because something is interesting to a small group of people, that doesn't make it worth an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 18:15, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Oh- I get it now. I thought the point of the wikipedia was to be able to include a broader range of (legitimate) subjects that wouldn't be in a paper encyclopedia, since the internet is such a huge resource. I didn't realize it was just a digital form of your average, limited encyclopedia. I stand corrected. Aeveryman 19:24, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If by "broader range" you mean "any silly trash me and my friends think it's important" then, yeah, you're right. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 19:29, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Where is this "broader range"? A quick perusal over the official message forum shows that most threads are dead and the last posts were by the creater Drew <a href="http://futurius.net/plex/index.php?board=5.0" class="external autonumber" title="http://futurius.net/plex/index.php?board=5.0" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>. Obviously, someone on the yahoo group is trying to influence this vote <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/halloweenmanscreatureclub/message/2562?l=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/halloweenmanscreatureclub/message/2562?l=1" rel="nofollow">[58]</a> and yet still, all votes by legitimate editors vote deletion. There just isn't any notability here. That doesn't mean Drew isn't talented. It doesn't mean the comic isn't good. It simply means that at this juncture the subject isn't notable. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 21:43, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Legit editors? I thought anyone who signed up is a legit editor? Look just because someone on the yahoo group is being pushy, doesn't mean that's how everyone is going about it. Cleary you've pushed some peoples buttons though. Which means people do care more about this character then you originally suspected. Atleast grant us that. As far as the message forum goes, I think most indie comics would have a similar set-up. Really anything that's not DC or Marvel has to be pushed hard by it's creator. I don't get what you mean by "dead" though. There's topics going on in there from the last week or so. Honestly I think "everyman" makes some valid points. There's some stuff on here that's just as fringy as "Halloween Man." How about this, leave the article up for say...six months to a year. You might be surprised at what happens. I'll continue to improve the article myself. I'm sure the others here will as well. ~~ <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bubfan (<a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubfan_4195.html" title="User talk:Bubfan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubfan_3b9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubfan">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>As for the compromise option? A vastly reduced entry, for instance (3-4 paragrahps, a couple of external links and a single picture), with the option of expanding later? Or is it an all or nothing situation? --RussellH 20:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It isn't something that can really be compromised. Otherwise there would be hundreds of stubs that never became notable but people are still patiently waiting just in case they do.

While personally I think they should keep it. Anyone who is a fan of this comic should just work on the Comixpedia article. There's already more effort being put into that one that this version.

<p><b>Delete</b> - Notability is in question, but also the quality of the article at this point. Delete and re-write; it reads like a promotional website at this point, loaded with POV and non-informative trivia....</p>

<li><i>Solomon's main power is often described as the "power of the horror movie sequel."</i> citations or re-write; who says, and where?</li>
<li><i>More recently, a major villain in the form of the Phantom Hood has turned up to make Solomon's life hell.</i> Is the whole article written by a comic writer?</li>
<li>It reads like it's written by a fanboy; <i>Fans of the series often praise the comic's sly nods to pop culture as a strong postmodernist element.</i> or <i>Naysayers tend to note the physical similarties between Solomon and Jonah Hex.</i></li>

<p>Mr. Wilson is a 'notable' venture capitalist, at least in the context of New York City's somewhat parochial venture investing community. Along with Jerry Colonna, he represents the United States' main divergence, in the VC industry, from the (useful but tedious) orthodoxies of Silicon Valley and Route 128. While it's likely that NYC will remain focused on the arts, the decision-making industries (consulting, law firms, advertising, investment banking, etc), the existence of a viable VC community in New York is important to balance those industries' narrow focus on human-only capital; Mr. Wilson and Mr. Colonna are indispensable to that cultural diversification. Whether that role is sufficient to merit 'notable' status by Wikipedia standards, I don't know -- but the point is, their roles are a little different, and a little more important, than examples of mere financial success. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.19.87.147 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.19.87.147_8ba7.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.19.87.147">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Keep him in! Fred is seen as a leader in the online world. He has been one to spur and encourage innovation. His impact to the world has been seen through the ongoing work he does in guiding the web and internet businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fred has 40,000 visitors to his blog and provides both entertainment and insights to his community of readers.</p>
<p>To compare Fred to many of the currently ‘approved’ individuals in Wikipedia, he dwarfs many in his overall impact and contribution to the internet and the world’s economy.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p>Rick Griffin was a guy who made posters – he has a listing Ted Johnson- played was a back-up linebacker for the Patriots – he has a listing John Hanna – who designed a sailboat – he has a listing Issac Funk – He was a spelling formatter</p>
<p>I think the measurement system is out of whack. I don’t think these above listed people should be thrown out, but I do think Wiki today does not respect the business world and the contribution people have made to the country. What is the difference between starting a company and writing a book. Or funding a company and editing a book?</p>
<p>Now, I also think we need a place for personal bios on Wiki. There should be a Wikipedia that has everyone possible listed. Image the value in something like that. Now, that is social networking! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.94.82.54 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.94.82.54_d774.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.94.82.54">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> -- Fred's enough of a character in the VC /Web community today that he is prominent enough to be included in Wikipedia. I actually learned something from reading his entry and it was useful to me. I think Bugwit's standard of relevancy is OK, and we certainly shouldn't have pages for all 300 mm Americans or 7 bn people on the globe, but in this case, as an avid Wikipedian, unaffiliated with this person but familiar with his work, I feel he has sufficient prominence and relevance to be included in Wikipedia. I do not believe Bugwit and other commenters are sufficiently familiar with Fred Wilson to make an informed judgment, though their diligence in keeping WP vanity free is certainly appreciated. <a href="../../../m/c/e/User%7EMcenedella_e3d6.html" title="User:Mcenedella">Mcenedella</a> 00:33, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well I've had an account for years and have some editing and adding history. And I personally see no reason at all why Fred should not have a page. I think the arguments about whether he is of big enough stature or not ridiculous and not to the point of Wikipedia. He is referenced within a Wikipedia article, he is part of the story, he is background. An argument not to include him is an argument against completeness. Further, there is really no way to assess that anyone who is part of the story should not have a page. There are probably thousands of pages that have no reason to exist, but are not called to the attention of the editorial classes. I say this is a false discussion and we should let someone/anyone create a page for Fred and be done with it. Ivan007 13:29, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Do not delete</b> -- I think that Fred is worth keeping here, there's so much information on so many minor players here, and Fred is plainly not a minor player.

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a>, why does it matter whether posts are first edits? The top of the page clearly states that the outcome is "primarily determined by the quality of arguments". Whether a poster is someone who has edited on Wikipedia in the past, or whether this debate has spurred them to enter the community doesn't seem to have much bearing on the quality of their arguments. darby 22:10, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Valid concern, but I think it is mitigated in this case. He never solicited people to comment against deletion, either explicitly or implicitly. Given these circumstances, the quality of the discussion, and nature of his blog, I think it's safe to say that most of the new users are probably people who frequently use Wikipedia but have never felt strongly enough about anything to create an account, and are posting in good faith. darby 19:21, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Fred is one of the most savvy, insightful entrepreneurs in the business and I feel his blog is miles ahead of most other venture capitalists. He constantly writes about new innovations and technologies and is a must read for anyone who is interested in the emerging dynamics of the next generation of the Internet and of digital media. He's been early in catching the popularity of the tagging movement and of social networking (i.e. by investing in del.icio.us and posting frequently about sites like Flickr before they became big) and comes across as amiable and willing to share his ideas. Plus, 40,000 devoted viewers can't be wrong. Steve 204.64.223.35 14:44, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>True, there are some actors that aren't notable, recently we had a massive purging of ALOT of non-notable actors. But the reason for notability is sometimes judged upon coverage.

<li><b>Do NOT delete</b> -- Instead, add more information to the page so as to evolve it from a mere link list to an actual document containing information about the various netbooks. Otherwise, devoted fans might just conclude that they have to do one page for each of the netbooks in that way (that is, with a text about the specific netbook and a link), which is not really all that different from one large document containing the info, but not as usable as the current version. (Also note that the current version does indeed already attempt to follow this proposal to some extent and is thus different from the version that was originally deleted.)

<li><b>Comment on Comments</b> -- Why are the number of edits or articles contributors have created relevant to the discussion? Is this wikipedia's version of the pissing competition? "I have more edits than you, therefore respect mah authoritah!"? Everyone has to start somewhere, and many useful articles and edits made in wikipedia are the single act of a contributor. Of course, people's opinions being less valued due to their low number of contributions could be a cause of their not making further contributions, thus continuing the tradition of wikipedia's "truth" being determined simply by the most energetic contributors. Hanley Tucks
<ul>
<li>It's a metric that we use as a convenience instead of digging into logs to determine whether the account was created simply to add the impression of broader support from Wikipedia editors than actually exists. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 01:50, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>So, was it?&#160;:-S Furthermore, do you have anything to say about the arguments presented by my fifth edit in English-language wikipedia? DrTemp 08:12, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is that you, and others above, are arguing along the lines of "This is useful information" and "Better a list than a separate article on each website", neither of which I really dispute. But we have some basic criteria for including material in Wikipedia. If you follow the link <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you'll see that a collection of external links is one thing we exclude. The commentary on the links fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">our verifiability policy</a> and our <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research policy</a>. We shouldn't ever be the first place something is published. I suggest that the best solution here is that this work is moved offsite. Then, in our article about <a href="../../../g/u/r/GURPS_536d.html" title="GURPS">GURPS</a>, a sentence like "Fans have produced unofficial books" might appear, and use the list as a reference to that statement. That may be questionable from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> standpoint, if the list is just on somebody's website, but it is a lot better than Wikipedia editors choosing what fansites to list, writing brand new commentary on those websites, and presenting it as an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 18:53, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, let's delete this article, and then wonder why all those links will be introduced step by step into the main article, or each netbooks gets its own brief page, or countless other things that might be done to avoid repeated deletion. Would that be any better? Remember, Wikipedia is for the readers, not for the editors. DrTemp 20:57, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Individual articles on these websites would be deleted for failing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (or if they don't fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, they should have articles!). I agree with you that we write for our readers, but we write encyclopedic articles that are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> not <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> for our readers.

<dd>Agree with <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoodenBuddha_2fd4.html" title="User:WoodenBuddha">User:WoodenBuddha</a>. Why is deletion being proposed on articles which cite mainstream news sources documenting notability? Furthermore, I object to the fact that the AFDs were put up without <i>any</i> warning or suggestions on how to improve the articles, and that all the AFDs were put up simultaneously, which makes them very hard to defend at the same time. This is an abuse of the deletion process. Merging <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erik_von_Markovik_7108.html" title="Erik von Markovik">Erik von Markovik</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_Method_fa65.html" title="Mystery Method">Mystery Method</a> into <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a> makes zero sense, because all three are already long. <a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">User:Kchase02</a> claims that these pages are not notable, but provides no actual argument why this is the case. He claims that there is a slim likelihood that anyone will search for them, but if he had taken a brief glance at google, he would have found that:</dd>

I think it passes <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. There are two non-trivial sources cited that are independent of the company itself.

<dd>Thank you for continuing to dialogue, SecondSight. You seem to be referencing CORP criteria one, which for both companies and services references "multiple non-trivial published works". Loaded (UK) and The West Australian might qualify for a company, but I don't think that's helpful for a company (the article actually indicates it's a trademark) run by a single "seduction guru" (as he's called at <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a>).

As to WP-BIO, the only argument I could see is from the last criteria, with identical language about published works, but judging from the titles only, they don't help. Loaded's "I Can Make You A Stud!" possibly has <i>the person</i> as the "primary subject" (quoting from the WP-BIO), but "Some Secrets You Should Never Share" indicates nothing of the sort.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 02:29, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> GWO's argument seems to be about the seduction community as a whole - the seduction community is worth documenting, as other wikipedia pages have shown, therefore no matter how 'questionable' it is to GWO, it is notable enough to be documented. Gassyguy's argument that 'not every member/thing associated with a more notable entity needs a page', is fine, but precedent in wikipedia shows exactly that - there are 1000's of porn stars with independent pages on wikipedia, the majority of them stubs, but I see no attempt by users to delete these, as well as pages for individual band members of smaller bands, individual pages for a large majority of internet memes, etc. Badboy's products are becoming increasingly popular in the UK, as well as the US. I also agree with Secondsight, that 'the burden is on those proposing deletion to show that these sources are somehow inadequate'. So far I have not seen this.--Ooblyboo 17:47, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

That you felt it necessary to raise a (blatantly incorrect) fact about my registration as a response to a fair point damages your argument, not mine.

<dd>I agree that a lot of the porn articles on here are for nn people, as well as with other examples you offer to some degree, but I draw a different conclusion. I vote delete on everything that doesn't deserve to be here (in my opinion, of course) and hope it goes away. What you're suggesting is, because some of the stuff that isn't notable on its own survives deletion nominations, we should just give up and vote to keep all of it, and with that I cannot agree.

<li><b>Keep</b>, "a group of guys who do some programming" is a pretty dismissive descriptor of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demogroup.html" title="Demogroup">demogroups</a>. Usually notable demo folks go into the video game industry, and the article does assert the founders to be working in games right now. As for Google hits, since The Lost Boys are a historical entity (broken up in 1991), I don't believe the Google test is a good indicator of notability, still I could find a few old demos for TLB which means someone out there remembered them well enough to post info about them well after their breakup. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 00:49, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think an article with this title could exist, but it seems that this material is already covered in many other places. I don't think it should redirect to Homophobia, and I don't think Homophobia should redirect here. The current article is poorly written, very POV, and uncited. In its current form I see little worth keeping. If it were a well researched and cited article on opposition to homosexuality, it would not be found offensive by LGBT activists (or by fundamentalists). That is not the case now. As much as I personnally find the discussion about opposition to homosexuality to be offensive, I could imagine benefitting from reading a well written article that outlines the position in an NPOV way. This would require making statements that only cite the postions of others. Thus, there would be aritcles on both <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_homosexuality.html" title="Opposition to homosexuality">opposition to homosexuality</a> and they would reference each other as articles about two different points of view on the same or similar phenomena. This is similar to how there is the article <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> and an article on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supremacism.html" title="Supremacism">supremacism</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article needs a lot of work, but to call all opposition to homosexuality "homophobia" is overly simplistic. Since the root of homophobia is phobia or fear, it assumes that those who oppose homosexuality do it out of fear, as opposed to those who do it out of intellectual or religious argument, or out of a concern/love for those whom they feel are doing themselves a disservice or hurting themselves by continuing down that path. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidBailey_c503.html" title="User:DavidBailey">DavidBailey</a> 19:35, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> And this "concern/love" comes from you being <i>afraid</i> of what will happen to them if they "continue down that path", no? How is this any different?

This discussion has prompted me to further review Wikipedia and I found that "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> It was my misunderstanding to think that Wikipedia was an attempt to consolidate in one place what can be thought of as a factual clearinghouse, which would also include clarification of points that form a logical basis for factual understanding. What I have said is not original research, nor is it something made up in school one day, but part of a 51 years of personal experience and study, nor is it unverifiable except to those who would rather have an opinion than actually see what is indeed available for review. You are each obviously unfamiliar with Einstein's interest in the nature of reality and his involvement in things such as the book "Mental Radio". But I suppose that Einstein understood the weakness inherent in how people view the world which is what freed him to think so differently and go beyond all the best minds of his time and prevailing concepts of physics. That is precisely why he made the comment I quoted in my original article. I am new to Wikipedia and due to the nature of your comments, I find this environment isn’t conducive the sharing of meaningfully valid information, nor discussing with civility what is appropriately includable or where. I would have expected more intelligent comments in this discussion, like "please give more specific references to" with a reason as to what it is that you don't understand or which you feel needs clarification or referencing. I appreciate the comments of <a href="../../../l/s/j/User%7ELsjzl_df2e.html" title="User:Lsjzl">Lsjzl</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> who made meaningful comments that might have made for an enjoyable discussion. But that will be unnecessary because I'm not interested in affiliating myself with a system where the system’s own guidelines for discussion aren’t adhered to by people who lack maturity, mutual respect, and the ability to communicate meaningfully. Please leave this posting on display for the full 5 days so that I may share the kind of review that went into our discussion. If there is a moderator outside of the above respondents, I would appreciate your observations. Thank you, Duane Young 07:43, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> Not buying it. You don't get to ride Einstein to validate your own made-up philosophies, and I'm quite offended at the suggestion that we're "obviously unfamiliar" simply because we see this for what it is - unencyclopedic trash. If anything, Lsjzl and Ace of Sevens were even harder on you than I was, Ao7 calling it "[original research], if you can call it research". I'm personally sick of wannabe Hegels and Schopenhauers trying to pass their trendy mish-mash of tenets, then getting mad at the Wikipedia concept and calling us "communists" and whatnot when they get rightfully erased as unprofessional hodgepodge. This AfD process was created for a reason, and it's not for the vacuous pastime of critical debates on Postexistiphililennonarxism. We're trying to create an encyclopedia, not indulge in a jolly old bipartisan romp around the park. Do what you have to to get your article kept, but don't guise personal attacks in intelligent-sounding words again. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 08:46, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> None taken, don't worry, but understand that my previous comment was simply negating yours, and showing that he did indeed have "at least one google hit, or a hit on any search engine, or be mentioned by some sort of information," no more, no less. And what, may I ask, prompted the rant on wikipedia making someone great? Certainly it was not something to be inferred from my simple comments.Steveh1023 23:05, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> You're right it was a little bit of an unprokoed rant, you can post messages on my talk page btw just to keep this article short, of something that I've been noticing. My little term that I call a Wikidream, in which people will post what they wish to do or overexagerate what they have done. I feel like I'm crushing dreams. But that's aside the point.

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems that if this guy was "internationally renowned" and prestigious enough to warrant a Wikipedia definition, he would have maybe won some sort of award or gotten some other recognition.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Potter Police (who don't look notable enough to qualify for a Wikipedia article themselves) give their badge of honor to anyone who basically passes their standards. <a href="http://meetinghall.baselair.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://meetinghall.baselair.com" rel="nofollow">[81]</a> It's not like an award where only one wins, and there's nothing in their standards about "unique and orignal conent".

<li><b>Delete</b> Not a speedy candidate, but definitely a non-notable neologism. Less than 600 total Google hits (about 130 unique) for "castleroid".

<li><b>Merge</b> There's no reason to have two articles discussing the exact same thing, especially when the only key difference appears to be whether or not the game is a Castlevania game. Google shows more hits for Metroidvania, so I thing there should be a merger to that article. 151.151.73.170 14:45, 9 June 2006 (UTC) Just as a note, this vote was mine. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 23:15, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> They should be left distinct. The term castleroid is a description that should be left around much like Leet speak is kept as it's own topic. Pointers from catleroid to metroidvania and non-linear exploration should be considered (if not already there). But it's nice to have it separated from a particular game since it describes a lot of castlevania games (which is the implication of castleroid, a castlevania game that mimics metroid like play)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While I can agree with the point that a Castleroid differs from a Metroidvania in that a Castleroid is, by definition, a Castlevania game I'd like to hear your reasoning for keeping the article seperate? The only difference is the fact that one is a Castlevania game by definition while the other is not. Couldn't that be covered by a section in the proposed Metroidvania article without defining the same sort of genre twice? 151.151.21.104 15:02, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For the sake of "full disclosure" I should note that I'm the person who wrote the article <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroid-style_game.html" title="Metroid-style game">Metroid-style game</a> as a compromise after my attempts to make <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroidvania.html" title="Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> an article about "Metroid-style games" were reverted to a simple redirect to Castleroid. <a href="../../../l/u/v/User%7ELuvcraft_7624.html" title="User:Luvcraft">Luvcraft</a> 20:16, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>; ditto to the above, with a qualifier: <i>some</i> fans. "Metroidvania" is a widely-used and easily-understood bit of jargon for all games in this model (and was, indeed, created within the Castlevania fandom). For practical purposes, it makes the most sense as an umbrella entry. The term "Castleroid" is a specialized, rarely-used (and semantically inaccurate) description, that seems only noteworthy as an niche attempt to reverse a common term to suit a certain agenda, like "herstory" or what-have-you. If any of these three terms are encyclopedic, then that would be "Metroidvania", simply again on the basis of common use and therefore likelihood of a specific search.--71.139.19.107 22:04, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The poem is already on Wikisource, so transwiki-ing is obviously unnecessary.

I would like to see the copyright issues straightened out. <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublic_domain_57d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Public domain">Wikipedia:Public domain</a> states quite clearly that everything written prior to January 1, 1923 is in the public domain; if that page is incorrect, we need to know about it. (The rule of 70 years + life of author appears to have come into effect starting with publications in 1978, from what I can read of the copyright code.) In fact, the poem is already on WikiSource in its entirety, so apparently someone there believes it is not under copyright. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 07:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That WP Public Domain policy is wrong - copyrigth remains for 70 years after teh death of an author or composer. If someone wrote something in 1900 aged 10, then lived to see in their 100th birthday then died, Copyright wouldn't expire until 2060.

<dd>It is the only article I have come across where it has been a major issue (thankfully now corrected) - yes I will consider correcting the WP policy - the problem there comes from the complex nature of that article that doesn't make it clear that artistic works are different from, say, recordings.

<li><b>Comment</b> - having the article being #1 Google result for a search of the actual term is not much of an argument for keeping the article - if I made up a hoax article on "Give Confusing Manifestation Money Day" it would be number 1 in its search. More important would be things like - is it being covered in major media? Is there a chance of it getting included in some kind of official calendar? Does anyone notable publicly endorse it? If you can give strong positive answers to those, then you can put them in the article, and maybe make it saveable. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 13:27, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

The chance of it showing on a calander is completely objective too, and shouldnt really be considered as an against point. Many day-to-day calanders have many random, interesting or inane facts on them, all produced by major print companies, and a day like this would fit right into one of those forms. The calander I use is made by a major publisher, and it doesnt have Hanaka listed, or many other major holidays, nor does it have many minor holidays. <a href="../../../t/r/j/User%7ETrjn_9e48.html" title="User:Trjn">Trjn</a> 15:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Trjn, while I'm a pretty strong supporter of this new holiday, the pirate one is called <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_like_a_pirate_day.html" title="Talk like a pirate day">Talk like a pirate day</a> and not "speak like a pirate day". The former dwarfs the various permutations of Steak and Blowjob Day on Google Trends, likely due to the necessity among those promoting Steak and Blowjob Day in the mainstream media of referring to it as "Steak and _______ Day" where "_______" is some euphemism. To Confusing Manifestation, however, I would point out that this article is not a hoax; the holiday does exist and the Google search I previously mentioned <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=steak+and+a+bj+day&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=steak+and+a+bj+day&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[87]</a> shows many other hits including the 4-year-old "steakandbjday.com" domain, which comes in at #3. Given the subject matter it's not that surprising that people might feel it was an offhanded radio joke, but as also previously mentioned, some of us who don't live in New England or listen to that sort of radio show do celebrate it.

<dd>I disagree strongly with the above. While you are correct that this is not a vote, the whole point is to reach a consensus. Consensus means <i>general agreement or unanimity</i>. What better way to form consensus than to have people say they agree with the original proposition? Are you suggesting that if people agree completely with the nomination that they just don't add their voice at all? -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 12:56, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it is not a vote, then why would you want people to come into the talk and then vote and add nothing new? The decision should be heavily influenced by the argument within the topic itself, if someone wishes to counterargue any point then that is fantastic and is heavily encouraged. Voting, and 'reaching a consensus' is foolish, you cannot reach a consensus with only the parties who are interested to vote, or the odd person who stumbles across the VfD to vote. The only way to reach one would be to poll a large group outside the influence of Wikipedia after they read the article. The point of this is to see if the article is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, if it meets the standards or notability, not if people think it should be in or not. -<a href="../../../t/r/j/User%7ETrjn_9e48.html" title="User:Trjn">Trjn</a> 15:51, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's worth clarifying what <i>not voting</i> means. In a vote, there are strict rules about who is eligible to vote, and if you meet those eligibility requirements, your vote gets counted. Add up all the votes, and whichever side comes out with a bigger sum wins. With the system we have here, whoever closes the discussion has a lot of flexibility to decide which votes count and which don't (i.e. sockpuppets), and then apply some judgement as to whether consensus has been reached without being bound by some strict and exact numerical threshold. If twenty people write nothing more than <i>Delete per nom</i> and two people write long cogent essays on why the article should be keep, that's still a consensus to delete (assuming no sockpuppetry or the like). -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 21:36, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I just noticed that the nom itself contains what I consider to be an inaccurate statement, to wit, "A day made up by one radio guy is not notable." Well, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Professionals%27_Day_63aa.html" title="Administrative Professionals' Day">Administrative Professionals' Day</a> was made up by one advertising guy, and rather than try to get it deleted, people who disagree the holiday exists have put in a reference to it being a <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallmark_holiday.html" title="Hallmark holiday">Hallmark holiday</a>. Since a holiday that discourages the use of greeting cards can't be a Hallmark holiday, maybe the deleters would be better served by adding a section like "Some feel this holiday doesn't actually exist and was only meant as a joke." So far the arguments against notability are: (a) coined by one guy for self-promotion (countered by Sadie Hawkins Day and Administrative Professionals Day, each of which was coined by one guy), (b) not actually celebrated by anyone (a trap, really, because celebrating it apparently makes me ineligible to oppose its deletion according to one deleter), (c) intended as a joke (again, Sadie Hawkins Day was plainly meant as a joke originally, as is Talk like a Pirate Day.)
