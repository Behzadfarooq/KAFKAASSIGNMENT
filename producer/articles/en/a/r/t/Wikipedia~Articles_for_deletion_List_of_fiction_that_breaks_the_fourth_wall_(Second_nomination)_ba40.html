<p>Kept by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_fiction_that_breaks_the_fourth_wall_7982.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of fiction that breaks the fourth wall">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of fiction that breaks the fourth wall</a>. The topic of "breaking the fourth wall" is encyclopaedic, and discussed at <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>. Undoubtedly that topic is well served by including some examples. But... Is this list, which is made up of notable examples of drmatic irony intermingled with things that some editor thinks are significant examples of breaking the fourth wall, but in many cases lack a source to support the latter let alone the former, the way to achive that? At the last AfD A Man In Black suggested merging the truly notable examples (maybe those that are cited in standard texts as notable examples) into <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>; this would get rid of the unreferenced and in some cases blatantly promotional and/or original research, which would be fine, and that is an editorial decision. However, this is a biggish decision (the list has been around for a while) so I bring it here for more input. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:38, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as an indiscriminate list and directory seeking to capture every instance of a character's breaking the fourth wall or every instance that in the unsourced POV/OR opinion of a random editor appears to be breaking the fourth wall with no regard to the importance or unimportance of the breakage. Trivia magnet. <b>Oppose</b> merging any of the content into <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> as it will invite editors to post their own pet examples, leading to another mass of trivia which will throw that article completely out of balance.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Okay, I can see the point of some of the keep&#160;!votes in the prior AfD, in saying that having <i>some</i> examples of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> being broken is appropriate to the subject. However I feel that adequate examples are given over the course of that article, and creating an indiscriminate list of every time it happens is going way overboard. No need to keep, and no need to merge it back in to the parent article and just clutter it up. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:46, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia has recently started some kind of adversion to popular culture lists. I agree with the deletion of List of signature phrases and List of sets of unrelated songs with identical titles as their contents were, in fact, completely trivial and of no actual use. But this list serves a more useful purpose because of the many different ways the fourth wall can be broken. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 16:28, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - What the length of these lists shows is that this is an common technique. Indeed, in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_cartoon.html" title="Animated cartoon">animated cartoons</a> it is used <i>routinely</i>; for instance, in the sublist <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_animated_series_that_break_the_fourth_wall.html" title="List of animated series that break the fourth wall">List of animated series that break the fourth wall</a>, the entry for <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animaniacs.html" title="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a> says "Numerous characters break the fourth wall," which is true, because it happens in basically every show.

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_fiction_that_breaks_the_fourth_wall_7982.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of fiction that breaks the fourth wall">previous nomination for deletion</a> was made in November 2005. The article has been edited some 1470 times since then, which works out to over three changes a day. This article is a fancruft magnet, and indeed in the last RfD one of the participants indicated that as part of its intent. It's all <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> anyway, as evidenced by the total lack of any citations <i>stating</i> that what goes on in any of these works does in fact break the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>. It's just a lot of editors, on their own authority, saying that what goes on in such and such a show/film/game/whatever fits the definition. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 19:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't understand what you mean. It should be obvious that a character in fiction admitting he/she is in fiction constitutes breaking the fourth wall. Therefore, it is the same as citing that the act breaks the fourth wall. It does not cite the act actually happened, but for that, we would need to be able to cite every act in fiction, which would require us to reference the actual works, which are under copyright, and often very carefully guarded. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 20:00, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the article <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> <i>itself</i> lacks any citations, so a reasonable person (or a wikipedia attribution stickler) could object that it cannot be used as a basis for "obvious" identification of examples. I personally think the application of the term to video games is questionable, since by their nature they require interaction with the "audience". One might also ask whether interaction with the audience as if they were part of the fiction qualifies. The point is not that we can't say what happens in the film/etc., but that we can't be sure that a theater professional/critic would so identify it. And if it <i>is</i> so obvious, then it's hard to see why we should need what is turning into an exhaustive list. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 21:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In video games, there is a distinction between the game play and the game's plot. Of course in <i>Pac-Man</i> there is no plot to speak of, so therefore no fourth wall. But the situation is different in more complex games. The best examples are adventure games. What you are doing is moving a mouse cursor around and making an on-screen sprite travel to where you clicked. What you are pretending to do is saving a princess from an evil dragon, going undercover to foil a terrorist organisation's plot, or captaining a starship in an interstellar war. A notice popping up saying "Please insert disk 2" is not breaking the fourth wall. The beautiful princess asking "Weren't you the one who saved me in the last game? You looked much more pixellated then." is. In contrast to the good old days, when a 20-year-old could write a well-selling platformer in his bedroom in a week, nowadays when games have enough scriptwriting and real-life acting to be small movies, the element of the plot is even more important. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 17:54, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Maybe, maybe not, but in any case your argument here is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and about all does, juxtaposed with my doubts, is provide sufficient evidence that identification of video game interaction as fourth-wall-breakage isn't obvious. So now we need a citable reference which addresses the issue, rather than just piling examples into the list. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 19:00, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, <i>looks</i> like a useful list, but isn't, as it's unsourced despite previous deletion nomination, potentially boundless (depending on whose definition you use) and the encyclopaedic purpose would be better served by a very sort list of those examples deemed notable by scholarly sources. This is just a list of things which some editor, who may or may not have a good understanding of the base concept, wants to add to a list. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:37, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, but cleanup and prune</b> the list. I've already suggested guidelines on the Talk pages for determining <i>what</i> should be listed (agreeing that the fourth wall is a very common device and that alone is <i>not</i> discriminating enough for a good list article). Citing is always an issue, but not always a criterion for deletion (certainly not every article containing {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} or the like should be AFD'ed). I'm for pruning out all trivial examples from the list to leave just a manageable sum of <i>good</i> entries demonstrating <i>specific</i> instances of breaking the fourth wall, and if we can merely restrict the list to that (citing where possible) and monitor the itemcreep, then we should be able to <b>merge</b> the sublists back to the main list, and that is enough. --<i><a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStratadrake_113f.html" title="User:Stratadrake">Stratadrake</a> 02:44, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>

<li>Perhaps it will be possible to cite most of these as to whether the stated action occurs. I think it will be a lot harder to cite experts pointing each specific example as a case of breaking the fourth wall, and that's the kind of citation that is necessary. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 12:58, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Citing a secondary source is preferred, of course, but citing the primary source is an option so long as what is referenced or quoted is a clear and solid example and does not require further explanation or analysis (i.e. original research) to support it. --<i><a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStratadrake_113f.html" title="User:Stratadrake">Stratadrake</a> 23:35, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The list itself is encyclopaedic; as for there being too many non-notable entries... well, I'd say that if a book, (web)comic, movie or whatever is notable enough to deserve a Wikipedia article, then they're also notable enough to be included in this list (assuming that they actually do break the fourth wall, of course). -- <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchneelocke_ee99.html" title="User:Schneelocke">Schneelocke</a> 14:15, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>That's rather like saying that because car models are notable, it would be reasonable to have "List of automobiles with <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacPherson_strut_5502.html" title="MacPherson strut">MacPherson struts</a>". The thing is that MacPherson struts are exceedlingly common, to the point of ubiquity. The same thing seems to be true of breaking the fourth wall, at least if you believe these lists. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 14:34, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Trivial entries are a major issue with this sort of list. I've already pruned out a large number of examples like "something hits the 'screen' and bounces off during a video game". --<i><a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStratadrake_113f.html" title="User:Stratadrake">Stratadrake</a> 23:35, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>For once, I have to agree with A Man in Black. <b>Merge</b> the most notable incidents and either delete or put the others on the programs' main pages. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAVY_10_cfa4.html" title="User:WAVY 10">WAVY 10</a> 15:13, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Actually, that is a good idea, or similar pages, like with the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Rocket_%28anime%29_a58c.html#Team_Rocket_and_the_Fourth_Wall" title="Team Rocket (anime)">Team Rocket (anime)#Team Rocket and the Fourth Wall</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatty-chan_b884.html" title="User:Matty-chan">Matty-chan</a> 17:18, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. First, I don't see a rationale for why this should be deleted. The nominator seems to have an issue with quality of the article. Second, Otto471 argues indiscriminate list. Sorry, but this article has a solid basis for inclusion as breaking the fourth wall. Hardly indiscriminate in my book. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 00:07, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Arkyan's point is extremely sound: <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">Fourth wall</a> includes sufficient examples to explain the concept, and the development of breaking it, for readers. This article is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate</a>. Most of the examples, unlike the ones in Fourth wall, seem to have been picked entirely at random, and are unreferenced. So far as I can see, this list does not seem to fulfill any of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html#Purpose_of_lists" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">purposes of lists</a>, and as <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> says, "lists that are too general or too broad in scope have little value". This list has no encyclopedic value. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 21:33, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
