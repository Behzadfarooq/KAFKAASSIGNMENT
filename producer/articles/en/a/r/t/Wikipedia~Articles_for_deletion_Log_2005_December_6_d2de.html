<li>Nope, this is the right tree. &#160;:) I don't know if this is quite a speedy, but it sure is a <b>delete</b>. I've left polite word on the author's talk page.

<li><b>Delete</b> personal essay, far too long, ending with POV stuff on feminism that also doesn't belong in an article with this scope.

<li><b>Comment</b> There's a fair amount of language suggestive of notability (eg. mention of offices in two countries, talks of being "consistently ranked as one of the premium brand in German and European fashion", 38 year-old company), but nothing that really constitutes such a claim, and I note that the company doesn't have an article on de.wikipedia.

<li>No, they don't and who says they do? Just because an article doesn't "hurt anything" doesn't make it something that should be included on Wikipedia.

<li>No, you can't argue that for evey article on afd.

<ul>
<li>Yes, they are. Attack pages are a form of trolling; original research is, for good reason, against Wikipedia policy; hoax articles, by definition, are full of lies; ads, vanity pages for losers like me, and garbled gibberish tarnish Wikipedia when people do random article searches and find it. This article is not a troll page; it is not original research, all the information is from verifiable sources; it is not a hoax; it is not an ad for the games, a string of garbled gibberish, or a vanity page about the contributor, nor does it tarnish Wikipedia in any other way. Yes, it covers information that can be found in other articles, but here it brings it all together. True, few people will be looking for it, but you'd be surprised at some of the things people want to find out. By its very nature, Wikipedia has plenty of room for minor or obscure topics not covered in the Britannica...topics like this. If you are not interested in the topic, just don't read the article.

<dd>Fancruft means crappy blather articles written by hardcore fans of the subject with excessively detailed information (they also have names for sub-genres like gamecruft, bloggercruft, and even Simpsons-cruft). As this article is not especially crappily written and is not excessively detailed (it just has the simple info of which characters have died), it really isn't fancruft. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYeltensic42.618_b2d1.html" title="User:Yeltensic42.618">Yeltensic42.618</a> 00:25, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Also possible self-promotion. Tubarc Action has been marked copyvio, but since the website cited just re-posted the text of a Tubarc patent, I'm not sure if it really is copyvio, but should be deleted as part of this series--only one hit for the term, the patent re-post site. I marked Self-Recharging Marker and Self-Inking as copyvios from <a href="http://www.tubarc.com" class="external free" title="http://www.tubarc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tubarc.com</a> but they should probably be deleted as more tubarc promotion unless someone can figure out something appropriate for the titles (which are improperly capitalized, anyway).

<p>That is interesting since the usage of google gives a plethora of hits on "LEV SIX". I just did a search. You are talking about "pontius autopilate" when he is not known for that project, it was probably put in there in order to add detail. He recently distributed a single under that name that was played widely in the northeast on college and local radio stations. He is known for his solo work as, again, "LEV SIX". Go to google and type "lev six" and watch what happens. I have followed him for over 7 years. He may not be Britney Spears but you are totally wrong and totally inaccurate. Why is the fact that it has details that are not necessarily contained within mainstream media wrong? Please do research and edit what you see fit, but to delete him from recognition is completely wrong. He is a known figure amongst people who are in the know. Not everything in the world can be found in Oxford's library. If you knew anything about no wave or the field it refers to, there are countless magazines that are not filed away in the Library of Congress that have great repute amongst intellectuals, authors, and musicians. Please do the research and put aside your morality and religion before you jump on someone that has done a hell of a lot for DIY artists! PS it is funny that he mentioned vanity when the guy brags about "testing out of high school"....pffft. Get a clue. You have no integrity.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Advertising, essentially, and empty. It's a substub that says this is a particular radio show by (external link) an eschatological group; see links. Well, that looks like page rank boosting and advertising, while the informational content is zero. Since the article mentions three others in the campaign, I'm going to guess that each of those says that the figures/service produce "Politics and religion."

<li>Comment: Thanks for being reasonable about it. We certainly do want you to keep contributing, but I have to agree with the others that a university play that hasn't spread any yet is <i>at this point</i> insufficiently notable for encyclopedic coverage. If it does get a higher profile or longer running production, by all means present an article on it. Until then, consider copying over the article into your user page. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:36, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>After the ridiculous hoax article at "Jennifer Wall" was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jennifer_Wall_6775.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jennifer Wall">deleted</a>, its author recreated it, only this time instead of a famed serial killer, Ms Wall is now an international swimming superstar. Feel free to check his references; they're fake. He's also created Andrew Wall and Aaron Apollos, who AfDers with long memories will recall featured prominently in the original Jennifer Wall article as well. For those not following the A-League: these two fellows are <i>not</i> A-League players.

<p>I personally have never seen or heard of this 'subgenre' of metal ever before, in any publication, or from any person. I've been frequenting metal forums all across the internet for some time now and this article really doesn't seem to be a real term... Nevermind accurate. It may have been used in some publications by fans of alternative rock, but again, I've never seen it... And a genre of music created by fans of a different genre? This article definitely seems to be an attempt to change the definition of <a href="../../../n/u/-/Nu-metal.html" title="Nu-metal">nu-metal</a> to a metal subgenre without using the proper article... Possibly because they already tried? The best this page does to define the subgenre it's claiming to talk about is:</p>
<p>'As with most rock music genres, alternative metal has proved somewhat difficult to define. Some fans and musicians have firm ideas of genre and sub-genre, while others reject such notions as useless or limiting. Influence from many other genres is common in alternative metal.</p>
<p>The term is very loosely defined, but is usually used to describe artists playing a style of metal which is considered either unique or difficult to define.'</p>
<p>There are several problems with this definition, in my mind. First of all, the genre is called 'alternative metal', yet the author describes it as a rock music genre. I understand that metal came from rock music, but it has progressed in a very different direction and I don't see how 'alternative metal' can be a subgenre of rock (even though, with the bands listed, it is more accurate) while being called alternative metal. Would it not just be alternative rock?</p>
<p>Secondly, how on earth does that statement define a genre? All it says is it can't be defined. It seems that almost anything can be alternative metal, if you wanted. All it has to be is unique or difficult to define. <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opeth.html" title="Opeth">Opeth</a> has both melodic death and progressive metal elements... Does that make them alternative metal too? What about <a href="../../../d/e/s/Despised_Icon_90fd.html" title="Despised Icon">Despised Icon</a>? They draw from death metal and hardcore/metalcore. Me hitting a washtub and screaming would be considered unique and difficult to define too. Does that make them all alternative metal now? A *lot* of bands in metal that have nothing in common with each other could easily be lumped together under these vague guidelines. This article, to me, seems to be using <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_reasoning.html" title="Circular reasoning">circular reasoning</a>, using the bands to define the genre and then taking that genre and using it to define the bands, never really getting anywhere. I think because of this, this article is a serious candidate for deletion. If not deletion, this article needs to actually *define* a real subgenre of music (And decide which genre of music it belongs to. The author seems to want to claim it is a subgenre of metal, while calling it a subgenre of rock). Right now, it's wasted space no matter how you look at it. <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyon_ee15.html" title="User:Ilyon">Ilyon</a> 04:06, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I havent much to say, that everything Ilyon said is right. Most of the bands listed are also from varying forms of unrelated music, and have no connection to metal, or each other. This article is indeed wasted space, and seems to be more of an article made by someone who is trying to showcase their favourite bands, while borrowing from, and minorly rewording paragraphs from other articles. ~~Leyasu</dd>

<dd>This so called genre has no sources that support it. As case was made against it, anything according to its defination is Alternative Metal, and many of the bands listed have no connection to metal themselfs, and range from Alternative Rock to Nu Metal bands. This article comes across as a biased view of someone who wishes to create a genre to promote their favourite bands and therefore deserves to be deleted. ~~Leyasu</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. I'm pulling scads of Google hits on this. There a lots of names for genres generated all the time...

<dd>Again, I'd agree with this as a genre except that simply getting google hits doesn't make it a genre. I typed up four random letters: Qati. Something that is obviously not a word. Now, here's the google hits: Results 1 - 10 of about 11,700 for Qati. Obviously Qati must be a word, with that many hits, right? Even better, I then used the middle row of my keyboard only and just went from one side to the other getting the letters: 'asdfghjkl'. Hits? Results 1 - 10 of about 70,600 for ASDFGHJKL. How about a search similar to the one you performed. 'Contrasting Metal', got 1,820,000 hits. Random Metal gets over 13 million. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Random+Metal&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Random+Metal&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> I doubt 'contrasting metal' is a genre of music. You can find *anything* on a site like google and not all of those hits are going to actually link to anything about what they say in the description. My problem is still that there's no definition for this 'genre'. If you can pull up a site that defines this genre, it would be easier to argue for it to be kept. <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyon_ee15.html" title="User:Ilyon">Ilyon</a> 08:47, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with only using a website is that the genre isnt known well worldwide, has no defination as you previously said, and its major flar is that it borrows from other genres. It contradicts both Avant garde metal and nu metal. Rap Metal, also following the same problem as this article, has been nomintaed for merging into Nu Metal. This article, perhaps, would make for an equally good candidate for merging into Nu Metal if it doesnt warrent deletion. ~~Leyasu</dd>

<dd>Alright, looking at the All music site, I finally see something that actually references this as a genre of music. However... Read the article. It describes the 'scene' that the genre developed in and what it developed from... But it says absolutely nothing about what defines the genre. I couldn't even find anything suitable to quote as being vague. There just wasn't anything at all. If we keep this page, how are we to define it? It can't simply stay as it is. It's completely worthless from a encyclopedic view right now. I mean, what type of music is Alternative metal? The only definitions you can use is going by bands that are similar to those listed on the allmusic.com page. There's still no useable musical definition <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyon_ee15.html" title="User:Ilyon">Ilyon</a> 09:30, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Google books results show that the term is widely used in rock music literature</i> thats good. But without being derogtory, thats ROCK music, not METAL. Ive worked in the metal community for years, and its not a known term at all. When it is used, it splits hairs over Nu Metal bands that people do and dont like. Allmusic.com says it is a genre, thats great. I can give you about 5 metal archival sites that will openly tell you it doesnt exist. And without an actuall defination, its nothing more than a pet term, that hardcore fans of Nu Metal use to denote their favourite bands. Which is seemingly exactly what this article does. Either it needs to be deleted or merged into Nu Metal, their being no three productive ways about it. ~~Leyasu</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> as very obvious and commonly used term in widespread use. Whilst I know that there are today like 50,000 terms for styles of music, mainly because musicians are too afraid of being "boxed in" and want to be seen as "different" and "unique", the reality is that all of these ones exist, and we have to at least recognise the more common ones. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 10:46, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This isnt a common term IN the metal scene. This isnt even a genre of music. It has no defination, which by the RULES of Wikipedia, state that something cannot stay without a defination. Also, as a user previously mentioned, you can search anything almost on Google and find it. Lets search some made up genres, "Fried Metal" returns 1,590 results. Is it a new genre? No, i dont think so. "Savage Metal", it gets 720. "Scream Metal", gets a nice 4,160. Are any of these genres? No. They are all pet names for the favourite bands of people, to group bands of various genres together due to one very minor, and very undefining aspect to the bands music. This isnt a genre and doesnt warrant the article being kept. The best suggestion is to merge it with Nu Metal, and mention is as a name used sometimes for Nu Metal bands. Otherwise people are going to becontradicting several far more comprhensive, and defining genre articles. ~~Leyasu</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Alternative metal is a legitimate genre, mainly used to describe bands that are more metal than rock, but more rock than metal (to put it simply, anyway).

<dd>I personally find this comment insulting. Yes, I did look into it. Think about those articles you put up. The <i>Business Week</i> article is just an interview with a college student who's labelled an expert by the columnist because he even knows: "... The distinction between "black metal" and "death metal."" Hardly a huge accomplishment. Especially when the interviewee goes on to state that: "Black-metal bands, however, are really into satanism. There have been reports of them killing people, burning churches, and that sort of thing." Some Black Metal bands are into Satanism, definitely, but the only band I've ever heard of in regards to killing people or burning churches is Mayhem... And only one member... Varg Vikernes. It's hardly a genre-wide phenomenon. On top of that, the only mention of alternative metal in this article is one sentence: "Today, it's split between mainstream-friendly rap [metal] and alternative metal, and hard rock." This article isn't even worth putting up as an external link. <i>The New York Times</i> link isn't even an article. It's a movie titled Alternative Metal. Hardly informative. The Music.com article is the exact same article as the one on Allmusic.com, which I already talked about. I'll talk about it a little further now. Here's an excerpt from said article:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"At its outset, alternative metal was a style united by its nonconformist sensibility rather than any immediately classifiable sound. Heavy metal was at the core of the music, but the bands were too offbeat and their influences too eclectic to fit into the thrash underground, so their main audiences were mostly alternative fans who liked heavy guitar rock. However, after grunge helped make alternative metal more palatable to mass audiences, it became the most popular style of heavy metal in the '90s, particularly when more aggressive bands began standardizing its sound. That approach was a far cry from alternative metal's early days in the late '80s, when it represented the least categorizable heavy music around."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, again, it doesn't define anything. The only thing resembling a 'definition' that I've seen is the band lists themselves. That's <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_reasoning.html" title="Circular reasoning">circular reasoning</a>, as I already stated before. Secondly, is it just me, or is this history smacking incredibly of the history of <a href="../../../n/u/-/Nu-metal.html" title="Nu-metal">nu-metal</a>? I doubt I'm the only one noticing the similarities... Check the articles and compare them. Look at the bands list. I can see merging the articles (but since this one adds absolutely nothing to the other article, it's kind of pointless), or deleting this one. However, this article has absolutely no encyclopedic value. How can it be useful when it can't even define what it's trying to talk about. The article can't even give the correct genre.<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyon_ee15.html" title="User:Ilyon">Ilyon</a> 19:42, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Somebody please explain why this article should be kept when it contradicts the well known genre Nu Metal, and is essentially a pet name for it? I thought Wikipedia was supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a site for there to be 101 pet names of things.

<ul>
<li>If you think that Nu Metal is a contested name for the genre then by all means edit the article. Offer reputable citations for that point of view.

I dont oppose the term, i oppose it being used as something it isnt. As pet name for Nu Metal bands, it should therefore be merged into the Nu Metal catagory. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 17:02, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Let's see if I understand this: your argument seems to speak for a merge/redirect with the larger article at <a href="../../../n/u/_/Nu_Metal_23d7.html" title="Nu Metal">Nu Metal</a> because the distinction between the terms is poorly defined? That would be a valid argument. I'll keep my vote as it is for now and supply a few links for other editors to evaluate. <a href="http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1220" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1220" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <a href="http://www.silver-dragon-records.com/alternative_metal.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.silver-dragon-records.com/alternative_metal.htm" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="http://www.music.com/style/alternative_metal/1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.music.com/style/alternative_metal/1/" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, <a href="http://www.thetabworld.com/System_of_a_Down_biography.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thetabworld.com/System_of_a_Down_biography.html" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. It would seem that if the articles were merged then Nu Metal should become a part of Alternative Metal, since Alternative Metal is the older style.

<b>Merge</b> the two articles. Nu Metal is the far more known, and far more common name. Also, that article mostly says what it is. If Alternative Metal is then edited into that article, it would save a lot of rewriting and requests for a new Nu Metal article. Alternative Metal has still failed to be given a defination by anyone, as such, is just repeating what is commonly known as Nu Metal, and as such, this could be mainly solved simply by mentioning that Alternative Metal is another name for Nu Metal in the opening paragraph of the Nu Metal article, which is also nominated for having Rap Metal (which much like Alternative Metal) repeats what Nu Metal says in a disorganized, undescriptive manner. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 18:46, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To point out the various smears Dante has made against me: Vandalism of random articles, Use of sock puppets, Delibartly inciting revert wars, i was in one which Dante was told not to start with me), Accusations of being a troll, Accusation of no expertise, Accusation of being a child, Accusation of racism. So far all these have proven to of been me NOT doing them. Also, Dant's contributions page should be checked to find he has done nothing but attack me for the last monght, not making any helpfull edits, and has then only responded to things when i have moved on with argument and moved into the whole, general issue. Also notice how he is directly talking to me in the board, and claiming that anything i say about him is smearing, yet its ok for him to make untrue accusations about me without it being smearing. (Edit) Also ive made my case in this argument, and it has been heard. I ask for Dante's vote to be striken as its an obvious vote against me due to his obvious personal dislike of me. If the article is voted to stay i suggest the merger, as do others. That is my vote, and i am free to make it any way i wish. If i am outvoted, fair enough, but with that comes the obligation of those who voted against me to amend the article into something worthwhile of its creation, lest it would be nominated for deletion, again. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 01:09, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does leading a cult with 77 followers make someone notable? This man gets a few hundred Google hits. I scanned the first 100 and nearly all of them were bulletin board postings. Aside from his own organization's website and Wikipedia mirror sites, the world in general doesn't seem to be noticing. No press coverage, no books published.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Well, there has been at least a little bit of news coverage: <a href="http://www.religionnewsblog.com/archives/00001225.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religionnewsblog.com/archives/00001225.html" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. For comparison purposes, a sampling of articles from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_new_religious_movements.html" title="List of new religious movements">List of new religious movements</a> showed that those groups who membership numbers are cited in their articles generally have several hundred to several hundred thousand members, with most in the tens of thousands.

Of course, it's hard to say how many big a lot of the groups are when no numbers are cited in their articles. I'm not sure on this one, but perhaps we should consider renaming it <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_City_%28cult%29_8c4b.html" title="Strong City (cult)">Strong City (cult)</a>?

<li>The problem's not that Google's getting the words in the wrong order, but rather that it ignores punctuation, so the first hit is for a page containing the text "Linux <b>portal - Linux</b> at IBM, then a little further down we find "NETC <b>Portal - Linux</b> for Beginners", and so on.
<p>As for the hit count discrepancy: the "about 336,000 hits" is an estimate based on a quick scan of Google's index. According to some blogs I was reading a while back (so not the most reliable source), this is usually wildly inaccurate. The reason there's only 340 "unique" hits is that a lot of the reported hits will be for pages containing identical content, or similar pages on the same website. Google tries not to show you too many of those. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 14:45, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - We don't list every single bit of staff for newspapers, especially student newspapers, because they change every semester or more frequently. I should know - I edit one. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 11:48, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>My original intent in creating this was to make past staff listings subpages. For example, a listing of the staff from 2003-2004 would be located at The Sentinel (NIC)/Past staff/2003-2004. If Wikipedia does not use subpages, my apologies. The reason I liked the idea of subpages instead of keeping everything on the main Sentinel page is that having so many names on one page would be cumbersome. By linking to the subpages, interested people can go the exact staff they want to reference. I realize that many <b>who have no interest in the paper</b> find this irrelevant and non-notable (for those who are, it is a different story), but it isn't as if Wikipedia is short on space. Why not include everything for the sake of completeness?</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, I direct you to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sentinel_%28MHS%29_fe66.html" title="The Sentinel (MHS)">The Sentinel (MHS)</a>, where staff is listed. --<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgy_bf93.html" title="User:Argy">Argy</a> 20:28, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Which I just cleared out&#160;;) - The inherent problem with listing student newspaper staff is that it changes by the semester, if not by the week. The names of individual newspaper staff members, by and large, are not notable - I direct you to the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a> - which lists only the publisher and managing editor, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a> which lists only publishers, executive editors and a selection of current columnists.

<li>It's a hard call, but I have to say <b>Delete</b> as original research. There has been a lot of work done on and thought put into this article, but Wikipedia is not a place for original research.

<li><s><b>Comment.</b> The article says "It was once supposed to be the next game in the Command &amp; Conquer series, but has since been cancelled and the staff assigned to the project realocated to work on other projects." If this is true, the game does not and will not exist. Furthermore, on a user talk page, you stated that the game doesn't exist and the belief in its existence was based on an unauthorized e-mail sent by a now terminated employee (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Slavik81&amp;oldid=30547353" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Slavik81&amp;oldid=30547353" rel="nofollow">reference</a>). I don't believe it's beneficial to Wikipedia to keep articles about cancelled games whose very existence in the first place is arguably high level rumour at best. I would argue that any information about this rumoured game could be easily merged into the main <a href="../../../c/o/m/Command_%26_Conquer_2a63.html" title="Command &amp; Conquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a> article. If you really feel the article must be kept, I would argue it needs considerable expansion, which I'm not convinced can occur, given that all the information about the supposed game comes from, as far as I can tell, a single e-mail and rumourmongering by fans. As to why people are "out to get this article," since it was deleted once before with strong consensus, I think people would rather not see it come back. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 04:05, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><s><b>Comment.</b> No! To bring back my earlier point, this is popular among the C&amp;C community (for a quite a while, not just since the E-mail last December). This isn't just some crackpot Wikipedian making crap up. Searching for Red Alert 3 in a search engine will get you a lot of results from well known C&amp;C fansites (most which even have their own RA3 sections) such as <a href="http://search.sympatico.msn.ca/results.aspx?q=Red+Alert+3&amp;FORM=MSNH&amp;setlang=en-CA&amp;cp=65001" class="external text" title="http://search.sympatico.msn.ca/results.aspx?q=Red+Alert+3&amp;FORM=MSNH&amp;setlang=en-CA&amp;cp=65001" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><s>The point of an encyclopdia is to provide facts on various topics that may be of interest to the public; therefore since we can provide non-fans with the minimum of big-picture information they need to understand what's going on when they talk to a fan isn't it our responsibility to do so? Furthermore, the incesent attacks on this article all fail to take into account the fact that sources are being provided for this information.

<li><b>Delete</b> - After reading the comments by other users it appears that there is not a desire for this kind of article. Request speedy deletion on the grounds that the original author, being the only person to have edited the page, asks for its removal. I sincerely apologise for this misaction I have apparently taken in trying to improve the encyclopedia. I simply modeled my article out of others which appear under the same category. I still fail to understand how this article differs from others of the same nature - Next Door Nikki's inclusion, for example - and if someone can point me at an appropriate article to read up further on these issuses then I would appreciate it.AlexG2490 14:23, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>How on Earth does "developing a <i>category</i> of <i>authors</i> of pornography" translate into "writing <i>articles</i> about pornographic <i>models</i>"?
<p>Wikipedia isn't a directory of people. It's an encyclopaedia. We have <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. Heads of state, actors, politicians, musicians, and whatnot qualify for articles here because (simply) people other than they themselves go to the effort of publishing non-trivial works about them. Such people are the subjects of independent, third-party, magazine "in depth" articles, news coverage, biographies, books, documentaries, and so forth. On the other hand, for Holly Heartbreak there is, basically, nothing at all. This isn't surprising. She works in an industry where information about the models themselves is deliberately kept secret, and most blurbs and biographies are works of fiction.</p>
<p>The article cites no sources, and no <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> of actual biographical information about this person can be found (in amongst thousands of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlebombing.html" title="Googlebombing">Googlebombs</a>, advertisements, and "come-on" pages telling us things such as that she is "spunky and more than you can handle").

<p>Redundant, should not be a separate article. <b>Delete</b> all material and <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mallard.html" title="Mallard">Mallard</a>. No need for merge because (1) info on rape flight is already in Mallard (including, yes, homosexual necrophilia in ducks), (2) info in "Rape flight" article is wrong anyway, I think (despite name, rape flight does not occur when flying), (3) overly informal and speculative. N.B.: article of same name deleted Oct 31 by admin ABCD. Maybe this makes it a speedy? I'm too <a href="../../../n/0/0/N00b.html" title="N00b">n00b</a> to know, or to find earlier discussion. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:43, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is a tough one for me. It's a real term, and an interesting term, and could perceivably be sufficiently interesting to warrant an article in its own right. It is clear that the term could be greatly expanded beyond the sub stub that exists within the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mallard.html" title="Mallard">mallard</a> article, and indeed in mallard could be a link saying <i>"Main article: rape flight"</i>. There is certainly enough information about this phenomenon, which is unique to the mallard ducks that it could fill an entire article. I suppose it is a bit like the practice of <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praying_mantis.html" title="Praying mantis">praying mantises</a>, where the female bits and eats the head off the male during mating. It is sufficiently notable and interesting to warrant its own article. After all, while I personally couldn't care less about mallard ducks, I could be interested in learning about rape flight. I am sure that others feel the same. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 08:21, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As for the speedy question, an article is able to be nominated for speedy deletion if the content is basically the same as it was when deleted. As all other articles were deleted for being nonsense, whilst this one is an obvious fair attempt at creating a legitimate article, it does not fit the criteria for speedy deletion. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 08:23, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The information in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mallard.html" title="Mallard">Mallard</a> isn't a substub - that normally refers to a one- or two-sentence article, not a two-paragraph section with citations. And there's no point keeping the present article, which - while probably a good-faith attempt to write an article - is simply wrong, and does not describe the phenomenon in question. In the circumstances, the correct thing to do is to <b>redirect</b> this to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mallard.html" title="Mallard">Mallard</a> for now: people interested in rape flight as a phenomenon in itself will thus find the section discussing it there, and if, in the future, someone who knows a lot about the subject wishes to expand it to the point that it requires an article of its own - well, then they can de-merge it, can't they? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> (requires no delete); this is clearly a genuine subject as currently written, but since it is specific to the Mallard and is already mentioned in the Mallard article it seems to me pointless to have a fork.

<li>Does anyone know how to upload images? I think I figured out how, but I am not sure about licenses and don't want to get in to trouble. There's tons of photos of this guy.

It's a pretty massive achievement to win this. And it should be noted that he has won 9 US national titles and 4 world titles. The DMC title is the most important of the world titles. He won the DMC title twice. Twice out of 3 years. Still more to go though.

<p>This supposed genre isnt a recoginsed form of metal at all. It also conflicts with many of the other articles on metal genres. This article says things that can be read in varying articles, including Symphonic Metal, Black Metal and Progressive Metal. The bands listed are also a mish mash of other bands from other genres, much like other articles pertaining to metal that have been recently deleted. A search on google returned no coherent results as to why the article should be kept, and in years of working in the metal music scene, i have never heard of this genre outside of Wikipedia. This sounds, much alike Alternative Metal and Tech Metal, to be a made up genre by someone trying to group together, and promote, their favourite bands. ~~Leyasu</p>

Goth Metal, Black Metal, Thrash Metal, Nu Metal, Noise Metal, Heavy Metal, Death Metal, Doom Metal, Progressive Metal, Grindcore, and God knows what else.

<dd><i>Keep Another (continued) VFD case of those with no expertise on heavy metal</i> - This is blatantly at me. Dante has an ongoing war of futition with me over the article Gothic Metal, and is reverting many changes, minor and major to articles because of this. He previously vandalised the Symphonic Metal page because it didnt suit his claims made on that discussion, and his whole vote is due to his flame war against me. Thus i ask his vote to be stricken. Also, i am trying to put a project together, using Wikipedia. I can also post an article listing many, many common and well known Metal Band archives, and non of them refer to genres like 'Circus Metal', 'Avantgarde Metal' or 'Alternative Metal'.

<dd>Let me remind you Metal Archives is one site, that is accepted by only some people. Main problem i pick up with this, is what it says. It says, that anything that isnt black metal, is automatically Avantgarde metal. The second problem is, all of the bands listed, bar exception of maybe 3, are listed on other articles already. The last problem with this article, is that it seems anything can be Avantgarde metal, if they do even the smallest, slightest thing that a band before them hasnt. If this article is kept, it needs to define what the genre is a whole lot better. It says Avantgarde Metal uses things that other bands havent done before, thats fine. Such as what? Where did it come from? How do you distinguish an Avantgarde band from a Progressive band that uses a Xylophone? If this article is kept, someone needs to seriously edit it and make it a lot more definative, a lot less confusing and vague, and make sure it doesnt contradict most other articles in the process. This isnt me being bitchy or spitefull, this is me simply trying to make people act on keeping articles and improving them, not just jumping onto 'Keep' whenever the article is nominated for deletion, yet not be willing to improve it so it doesnt keep getting nominated. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 21:42, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>you make a good point Leyasu, I think the article does a decent job of trying to seperate progressive metal from avantgarde metal, but there are still problems with it, would I, or someone else, be allowed to just re-work this page when it's in this pending deletion status? I would definitely be willing to do that then, because I think it's a worthwhile page and I'm willing to work if it means keeping it. To be fair though, other sites, like <a href="http://www.metalstorm.ee" class="external free" title="http://www.metalstorm.ee" rel="nofollow">http://www.metalstorm.ee</a> for instance, also have a group of bands for the genre. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarpsmom_1ed3.html" title="User:Karpsmom">Karpsmom</a> 1:49, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Article relates to a concept which has no independent existance outside wikipedia.

To label CPGB(PCC), a group which I otherwise have very limited sympathy for, as "left stalinist" is of course little else than simple smearing.

Sadly, I think this one's got to go.</s> --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 10:57, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>As per the discussion below, I'm changing my vote to <b>keep, but add to cleanup or requests for expansion</b> so it can be expanded by someone knowledgeable in the subject. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 22:11, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It was a Hoax- In 1995. The first line of the article admits that it's not real. The problem with source material is that it's a part of Internet History (And trolling, admittedly), from 1995&#160;;) Frankly, I'm surprised ANY webpages mentioning it are still running. Considering the number of different groups that discussed it shows that it wasn't strictly an in-joke on one usnet group. comp.os.msdos.misc,alt.folklore.computers,comp.sys.mac.advocacy,comp.os.linux.development.system,rec.games.mud.misc,comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy,comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.sports,comp.os.linux.advocacy,comp.os.ms-windows.win95.setup,alt.fan.karl-malden.nose,comp.lang.c,alt.sports.hockey.nhl.wash-capitals,alt.winsock I don't agree that deletion is the right choice in this case. <a href="../../../e/1/v/User%7EE1ven_b920.html" title="User:E1ven">E1ven</a> 14:06, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> Even if it is notable, that doesn't change the fact that it doesn't work like other hoax pages that describe the hoax, its history, its perpetuators, and the like. The article at the moment is quite non-encyclopedic. If someone were to step up and agree to clean it up to bring it to the level of quality of the articles in <a href="../../../h/o/a/Category%7EHoaxes_f08a.html" title="Category:Hoaxes">Category:Hoaxes</a>, I'd say keep it, sure -- but I somehow don't think anyone's going to do that, given how little eyeballing the page has gotten so far.

<li>Agreed. I think it should be put on cleanup or requests for expansion now so it can get some further love, but I think it passes VfD muster for the time being. I've changed my vote above. I'm curious why someone put unreferenced on it, though... the external links <b>are</b> the sources, are they not? *boggles* I'm still not entirely convinced about its notability, but this article passes my personal <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html#Wikipedian_philosophy" title="User:FreelanceWizard">"researcher of something one level removed" test</a>, so I'm fine with it staying around. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 22:11, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete = I wrote this article a few weeks ago as part of my history of <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talkers</a>, but recent debates have determined that we should probably merge them all in to one. While this started off as a stub, I have been unable to source any information to make this anything beyond a sub stub. I have also determined, after discussion with others, that being the first ever talker with an 18+ age description is not suitably notable for its own article. Since I couldn't find a place for it in <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a> and didn't reference it in any of the other articles, I don't see how I can justify it.

<p>This page is much alike the Avant garde metal page. This page however, is completely POV and coining a term. Circus metal, is not a genre of metal known at all, except seemingly as a pet name on yahoo fan site. Also, why would this need a seperate article if its part of the supposed Avant garde metal genre? (which upon reading, lays claim to all the traits of progrssive metal, black metal and gothic metal, claiming to be all three exclusivly). There is no reason for this article, and like several other supposed metal genre articles on Wikipedia, comes across as pure POV, and Neoglism. A fan trying to promote a coined term and a list of their favourite bands. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 11:19, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is a easy fix- I suggest we merge this article with all the other <i>remastered track</i> articles, and make a page called <b>Megaman Zero Remastered tracks</b>. Simply a line-by-line retufution of all the releases in one article. Plus this page is in need of some <i>serious</i> wikifying...I gladly volenteer to bring it up to standard, with, of course some assistance form my partner-in-crime Wolf ODonnell.-<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">MegamanZero</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Put the info in the <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remastered_Tracks_Rockman_Zero_9617.html" title="Remastered Tracks Rockman Zero">RTRZ CDs</a> article. Either that or leave it where it is and ignore the pleas for the info's deletion. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf_ODonnell_36b5.html" title="User:Wolf ODonnell">Wolf ODonnell</a> 21:53, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Agreed. But the article is too large to merge, I say we leave it like it is; I've wikified it, so its up to standard now anyway.-<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">MegamanZero</a> 014 8,December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>In my opinion this guy is just another businessman and not a suficiently notable one to need an article. The page is an orphan and the company he founded doesn't have a Wikipedia article. The story about the boating accident hardly seems to have caused a media sensation apart from a quick mention in local papers - a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Jeff+Berwick%22+yacht&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Jeff+Berwick%22+yacht&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> returned 2 pages of links, of which <a href="http://www.latitude38.com/LectronicLat/2005/0605/Jun29/June29.html" class="external text" title="http://www.latitude38.com/LectronicLat/2005/0605/Jun29/June29.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> was the only place the incident was still mentioned.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> This comic exists, it is just currently not in print for the general public. It is still partially in production according to the creator(who I happen to know). The creator has told me that the comic needs a little more production time before more facts can be posted about it, so I have been told by him to explain that this page is not a fraud, and that it will be expanded in due time. I would also like to add that search engine will not net you much information about "The Ninja" as very few people know about it. The reason that a Wikipedia page was created for it was to begin a limited release of facts about the comic; sort of like a preview, in a sense. Therefore, this page should not be deleted as it will soon host more information than is currently on it. Thank you.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as too diffuse and POV. Makes no attempt to define influence or leadership, spans two millennia. If one applies Wikipedia guidelines of notability then every author of a book about Jesus that sold 5000 copies would qualify. Certainly there is room in Wikipedia for lists about Jesus. This isn't one of them, nor can it be. Most of the people here, I suspect, are already on related and better named lists. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 15:55, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Strong Keep</b></s>, <b>Keep</b> (and <b>Move</b>). This is an <i>extremely useful</i> list. It is a great source for the research question "Where on Wikipedia can I find out what important thinkers had to say about Jesus", and guide a user to the articles, where she can find out more about where to find these people's writings on Jesus. This seems (1) likely to be a <i>quite</i> common research need for college students etc., and (2) hella lot more worthwhile than research questions like "Where can I found out the names of all the monsters in the Dragonball Z movies", which type of info Wikipedia has aplenty.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>XYaAsehShalomX, it looks like most of these people were reaonsably significant thinkers. They all have Wikipedia articles, anyway.</dd>
<dd>KillerChihuahua, the title <i>is</i> offputting, and a bad title. So I recommend a <b>Move</b> to something like <i>List of Wikipedia biographies of people who wrote significantly about Jesus</i> or whatever. If the <i>title</i> was changed would that affect your vote?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Sheesh there is really a current going against all lists here, on the grounds that categorizing anyone as "important", "influential", or whatever is inherently POV. I really think that's getting overworked a bit. Reasonable people can generally agree about most of the entries in a list like that; the rest is details. The person using the list for research can decide if a given entry is not important, too. (Also, in this list, the person used a pretty solid criteria: people who have Wikipedia articles.) Somebody did some serious work here; it <i>looks</i> to be pretty fairly constructed. Why throw away someone's good, hard work??? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 18:05, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, that's a good point. I'm not sure I agree, though, because different people use different internal mechanism for finding information. It's like, if you're writing a hardware manual, and you reference Printer Failure under Printer, because that makes sense to you, but some people might look under Failure or Error, even if that's not how you think. But after looking up the lists and categories you pointed out, I see your point, and I'll remove the "Strong" from my keep, thanks for the info. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a></dd>

<dd>Well, (1) It's a list, not an article, so it doesn't need to explain what they thought; again, if <i>renamed</i>, the issue of "understood" won't come up 'cause that won't be in the name (2)I think everone on the list wrote about Jesus (of Nazareth) and had something useful and important or at least interesting to say, rather than just having <i>heard</i> of Jesus (of Nazareth). (3) as for the possible confusion, if the renamer thinks it necessary, they can use specify "Jesus of Nazareth" to avoid confusion with Jesus Alou etc. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a></dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per above. There are several issues with this article. The first is that there is no real information in it apart from a list of several items (some are leaders, some are authors, and two are books). While the topic does seem interesting, the article fails to explore it or even define it. Given the 2000 years of Christian history, a complete listing of what leaders thought about Jesus would be mind-numbingly long, it would be nice as an essay or paper, but sems far too broad for an encyclopedia article.

<p><b>Delete</b>. Article reads like an advertisement. Google search showed no references in first several pages to the company, except from the company's own website.-- <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 16:30, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Why delete?</b> We are in the process of trying to eliminate the the "advertisement" sounding reading from the article as well to comply with Wikipedia's rules. In fact we have already rewritten much of our original article in an attempt to provide for information about the company AEI and not necessarily its services. <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobalt2020_dd6e.html" title="User:Cobalt2020">Cobalt2020</a> 16:34, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I do appreciate that you have been trying to improve the article. However, Wikipedia has guidelines as to what notable companies <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">are</a>. Without the supporting outside sources, the company isn't notable enough to be included.

<p><b>Ahh,</b> now that is at least a more helpful response beyond the, "this article sounds like an ad" comments. In response to your question, No, at this point in time, AEI Web Design does not have any online, third-party reviews that we are aware of. We do have radio commercials running on FM stations in Georgia and we have sat down with Adroit Publications in the past and been interviewed by them about our services. In light of this though and after having read the Wikipedia guidelines for what noteable companies (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">are</a>), we agree that we do not meet them fully and understand if the motion to delete our article is upheld. <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobalt2020_dd6e.html" title="User:Cobalt2020">Cobalt2020</a> 16:59, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Even though this article may technically be accurate, it gives no sources. Plus, is it going to be easy to maintain. In a 5 years will the information still be accurate? For instance, 7 Up may eventually sell the line, or discontinue it altogether. If in 5 years the information is inaccurate, will anybody be willing to edit it?<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 04:08, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Unsure of the validity of this argument. If someone's willing to maintain the page by mentioning various flavours as they come out, etc., they won't have to work nearly as hard to do so if the product itself is discontinued. Also, although source information is important, it's not so critical if the article in question is rather non-controversial and about a commonly-available product. -<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 04:49, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At the risk of sounding argumentative, when I read Wikipedias guidelines about providing references, I didn't see any caveats about criticality. The article does contain information about the ingredients, without providing a source, which suggests that its more a commercial than a genuine encyclopedia article. I also doubt that anyone is going to want to waste time updating this article as new flavors come out. Is anyone really going to volunteer to maintain this article?<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 06:37, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not really understanding your point about its ingredients. Most of the soft drink articles mention the sweetener used, caffeine content, etc. Although the carbs content probably comes off of the product itself (I wrote the original article, by the way) the apple juice content is distinctive among mainstream North American sodas. This article seems fairly standard for a second-tier product stub. On the other hand, about references: I'm not saying the article couldn't be improved by references, but, as an estimate, I'd say at least 95% of the articles on Wikipedia do not have listed references. When the statements in an article are not controversial and easily verifyable, references should not neccesarily be required, and by no means should a lack of them warrant an article's deletion. -<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 06:50, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. The Wikimedia Help Desk received an e-mail from Amelia M. Samples similar to the content of the page.It said: This article was placed in reference to a shoutcast that I had set up. The show has been cancelled and this article was posted containing material that I didn't approve. The show no longer exists, will not exist in the future, please mark this page for deletion." Due to delays in the help desk, I didn't get to the e-mail until just now. Given that the show had a limited audience for its two shows and has now ended, there is no need for the article Well done to DJ Milla and Emi/Amelia for their honesty. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 07:53, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This list can never be accurate. Ethnicities are not yes/no things. You cannot say this person is an Indigenous person because somewhere down the line they had a relative who was Indigenous person. My great-grandfather emigrated to Canada from the Ukraine. Does that make me Ukrainian? If so, then I'm also Scottish, French and Irish. This list would be fine if it was about culture or religion (things people choose to take part in and can be referenced - or do we not need proof for the labelling we do?) but ethnicities are too blurry of a concept. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 00:14, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I don't understand the claim that it's unmaintainable. That's up to people who care about it. As for questions of "authenticity", if you're unsure, ask an Indian.

But of course there's no infringement involved, since nobody, but <b>nobody</b> could mistake Wikipedia for anything having to do with quality control. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:40, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The B1249 is a minor road from Willerby to Skipsea – see where it is on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=from%3A+skipsea+to%3A+willerby&amp;ll=54.074297,-0.339203&amp;spn=0.264088,0.611870&amp;f=d&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=from%3A+skipsea+to%3A+willerby&amp;ll=54.074297,-0.339203&amp;spn=0.264088,0.611870&amp;f=d&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Google Maps</a>. (Willerby is near the top of the page, in the middle, the road then runs South and then turns East in Driffield.)</p>
<p>The article was nominated for deletion once back in August <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_B1249_a4aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/B1249">here</a>, when there was no consensus to delete; someone else accidentally put is up for deletion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_B1249_road_2005-08-23_9f01.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/B1249 road/2005-08-23">a few days later</a> and quickly withdrew the nomination. The article hasn't grown much since, and there is not much to say about this road except that it is a minor road linking two Yorkshire villages.</p>
<p>Editors who are not from Britain might read the article on <a href="../../../b/_/r/B_road.html" title="B road">B roads</a>. In Britain, B-roads are collector roads that funnel traffic into larger arteries; unlike A-roads they are quite unimportant in the grander scheme of traffic infrastructure and the numbering is used for bookkeeping and local reference.</p>

<li>I see only four clear keeps. I see a <i>bunch</i> of comments with some version of "keep only if notable".

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't get what's interesting about this person beyond his existence. Standing and losing in an election isn't any claim to any fame, and founding a so-called church a few years ago whose article has already been deleted doesn't help either. Then there's the absurd behaviour of the subject that suggests the desire to retain this page stems from pretty hard-core vanity. All of the attempts at claiming fame in the article are notable only by being non-special, or presumably over-inflated. I don't see any verification, for example, that this person was <i>responsible</i> for the voting down of tax measures, merely that he campaigned about it a bit.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I believe The lepracy should not be deleted from wikipedia, on the grounds that The lepracy "has established a tradition or school in a particular genre". They have established the "Avant-garde-core" tradition of music within the whole experimental music genre, using folk, punk, noise, metal, blues, ambient, and jazz styles in varying combinations within a freeform/improv medium.

<li>It's not exactly a disambig page, and it's not exactly an article. Sadly <b>delete</b>.

<li>Note: vote updated to include merge option after considering <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>'s points on my talk page. The problem with covering webmasters is that, with only the rarest of exceptions, all information about them comes from themselves and their websites rrather than books, academic sources, or mainstream publications. Since this particular webmaster interviewed Rowling, I guess a certain amount of verifiable information exists. I trust that only the truly verifiable (and non-trivial) information will be merged when the time comes. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:58, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> Even if the website of this individual is noteworthy in some respects, this information seems better suited as a sub-section of the MuggleNet article. It just does not seem relevent to have an article on a webmaster, and on their site also. Why not combine the two? There are obviously numerous successful webmasters out there, it seems irrelevent to have an individual article devoted to each one as well as their website especially for a fansite.</li>

<li><b>Keep or merge</b>. Anyone who was <b>personally</b> invited by J.K. Rowling to interview her for the release of book 6 is quite notable in my opinion. The images are likely a copyright issue.

<p>The article contains a lot of material that seems to have been directly copied and pasted from the website or copied and modified only slightly. No other reference is cited except the webpage. A few editors have done some minor cleanup. The article was started in 2004, and with the exception of the few minor cleanups, no major work has been done. So it seems that perhaps in the future, there will be no attempts to check to make sure the facts in the article are still accurate<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 22:16, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The problem is that the article argues for a particular point of view, that the 8 problems you cite are the main problems. If you were to cite scholarly consensus for those 8 being the most important, fine. But it's only your own research that supports the idea. I invite you to read the Wikipedia policites we've mentioned here, particularly <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">Wikipedia:Cite your sources</a>, and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia: Verifiability</a>.

<p>Repeating what was posted by David Gerard, the original proponent of deletion for this page:"Somewhere between advocacy and advertising. No independent verifiability." This page has so far failed to prove that this is an actual, existing concept , or that it has any backing in either Greece or Serbia.The only time something relevant to this idea has surfaced was as a part of diplomatic maneuvering of Yugoslavia's Milosevic administration(as indicated in links #2 and #3).Both that administration and the state entity that it represented do not exist anymore.</p>
<p>The references used in an attempt to prove that this is an existing concept are, in order of presentation: 1:Quotes from people universally considered as radicals, without any references at all as to their veracity. 2:An internet poll (inherently unreliable)without any relevant data(source,oraganiser,polled population,duration,methodology).This poll could have easily be created by everyone with basic knowledge of MSpaint. 3:Vague references to famous people and " various organizations", again without a single reference or at least a name. 4:References to the Neobyzantine movement, which actually contradict the concept of a union between the two states.The second quote provided outlines a very vague concept of an "Orthodox Union" that does not relate at all to the matter discussed in this page.("magine one country - from Adriatic sea to Korea, and from Sinai desert to the North Sea.. With millions of churches all over.. With prosperity, wealth and peace,.. Faith strong as rocks in everyone") 5:Links to pages "in support of the union" which are nothing but mostly empty personal sites (site #1),news repositories (site #2), and an 8 thread forum where people argue about whether the opposing poster is gay or not.(site #3).</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to point out the repeated use of sockpuppetry and vote renaming used in the previous vote by users "Serbohellas", "Maninjar" and "Slav" and the anon 68.148.93.27.It is obvious that there are people who want this page in wikipedia, ignoring the community's consensus.If the previous vote had adequately screened its voters, this article would have been deleted. <a href="../../../j/s/o/User%7EJsone_ca26.html" title="User:Jsone">Jsone</a> 22:43, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Added reasoning for Deletion</b>.Exactly like this article's first AfD, this one has also been swamped with "keep" votes by one edit users who registered after the poll began.Now, we're supposed to assume good faith in wikipedia, so i'm not going to cry "sockpuppets"(again).However, I would urge the closing admin to exercise caution when counting this poll's votes.--<a href="../../../j/s/o/User%7EJsone_ca26.html" title="User:Jsone">Jsone</a> 02:12, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>Whether or not some of the information in this page is accurate or not(which we cannot know), there has not been any proof that this is an existing and notable movement.As I said in my nomination, a couple of private statements (which some people try to elevate to the status of an official proposal, even though it never reached this stage) by former national leaders are not a movement, or notable.No proof has so far surfaced that this exists as a political idea today outside a couple of pages in geocities.--<a href="../../../j/s/o/User%7EJsone_ca26.html" title="User:Jsone">Jsone</a> 02:23, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> "A couple of private statements by former national leaders are not a movement, or notable." Quite the contrary! Both times this was more than a mere "private statement". As Critias put it, they were events that received news coverage around the world. It also sparked a wave of nationalism from a number of radical groups and leaders, most notabley being obviously Karadzic. The reason that this issue is somewhat vaguely remembered is because of the other more prominent political events that happened throuhgout the Balkans during this time.<a href="../../../c/r/v/User%7ECrvena_zvezda_2b8a.html" title="User:Crvena zvezda">Crvena zvezda</a> 6:24, 13 December (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can assure you that the concept presented in this article is not an unheard-of, radical opinion. While it may be in its infancy, the idea of a Serbo-Greek Union is gaining popularity in Krusevac, Belgrade, and even Kragujevac. I know this because I have worked in Serbia and have heard conversations and discussions about this very topic. Deleting this article would undermine one of Wikipedia's crucial virtues - that is, direct relation to emerging public opinion at a far greater rate than any other encylopedia.Slacvo_Milos 10:35 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Strong Keep</b> -- I find it somewhat suspicious that certain individuals are trying to delete this article for a second time and personally attribute these attempts to an ideological antipathy to the idea of a Greek-Serbian confederation rather than a genuine concern regarding whether or not the movement for some sort of Greek-Serb political union actually exists. However, that's another issue entirely and not one I have any inclination to raise so I'll give the benefit of the doubt.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Concerning the issue of a Greek-Serbian movement towards political union, this is a historical event and, regardless of whether one opposes or agrees with it, for that reason alone it deserves a historical account. It is irrelevant to consider whether or not this is an "existing concept" or whether it currently has "any backing in either Greece or Serbia" (as one individual argued). Rather, one should consider if an effort to advance a Greek-Serbian confederation <i>ever</i> existed. After all, this entry exists to detail and chronicle the <i>history</i> of a Serbian-Greek Confederation rather than act as a dossier of current Greek-Serbian political organizations that espouse the idea. (In any case, that is my understanding.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, there is sufficient evidence to prove that there have been attempts to advance some sort of Greek-Serbian political union. The fact that the president of Yugoslavia called for such a confederation in 1992 (an event that received news coverage around the world) speaks for itself. Although one individual implies that the state entity (i.e. Yugoslavia) that proposed this does not exist anymore, the fact of the matter is that by 1992 Yugoslavia had long since become a Serbian-dominated state. Moreover, by 1992 the non-Serbian republics of Yugoslavia had all declared independence from the country. The fact that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia officially changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 doesn't mean that the former was not Serbian in its later years; if anything, it only strengthens this view. Also, the fact that the Radovan Karadzic, the former president of the Republic of Srpska, also supported this idea in 1994 is further evidence that support for a Greek-Serbian confederation existed in the '90s. Although one individual argues that Milosevic and Karadzic were "radicals", I don't understand what this has to do with anything (even if we accept this premise as true). The political philosophies of some of the proponents of the Greek-Serbian confederation don't diminish the historical reality of the movement in any way. (However, for historical purposes, they should be noted.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Aside from Serbian officials supporting a confederation with Greece, it should also be noted that Slav-Macedonian intellectuals and politicians also supported a confederation. In 2001, "Eleftherotypia" (a well-known Left-wing Greek newspaper) covered the issue of Slav-Macedonian support for a confederation. For example, former president Gligorov is quoted as saying, "This [idea] begun when Yugoslavia was beginning to fall apart, when intellectuals and politicians gathered in order to examine the perspectives that we had for our country. Our common position was that a confederation with Greece was the best solution". And Ante Popovski, regarded as the greatest novelist of his country, stated that he was "supporting the idea of a confederation with Greece" in an interview in the French newspaper "Liberasion" in 2001.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All of this said, I agree that the Serbian-Greek Confederation article does need revision. All of the "Neobyzantine" content should be removed as this has nothing to do with the historical chronicle of the movement for confederation. Once this is done, the issue of advocacy should be moot (at least for the most part). Any residual advocacy should be removed during a revision of the article. There should also be a greater effort to detail various historical aspects of movement of the Serbian-Greek confederation and less coverage regarding contemporary views of the proposed confederation. Finally, the article should be re-directed to "Serbian-Greek Confederation" instead of "Serbian-Greek Empire".

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> -- It should be noted that this account was only created so that this vote wouldn't be regarded as being "in bad faith". Normally I have contributed to the article as user 66.222.199.62.</p>
<p>The user Jsone has given his reasons for the second deletion of this article, and I hope to contest them. He was noted as saying: "Quotes from people universally considered as radicals, without any references at all as to their veracity." The fact that they were radicals in no way makes the suggestion that they were also liars. There are actual news sources (found in External Links) that verify what they stated as being true. I have little trouble finding more sites that plainly prove this; however, the information provided is nowhere as detailed as that which was presented in the links provided.</p>
<p>He then said: "An internet poll (inherently unreliable)without any relevant data(source,oraganiser,polled population,duration,methodology).This poll could have easily be created by everyone with basic knowledge of MSpaint".</p>
<p>First of all this couldn't be further from the truth. There is a link to the poll in question that can be found at:<a href="http://members2.boardhost.com/serbia-hellas/msg/2126.top" class="external free" title="http://members2.boardhost.com/serbia-hellas/msg/2126.top" rel="nofollow">http://members2.boardhost.com/serbia-hellas/msg/2126.top</a> (which was included in the "links section"). A quick visit to the site automatically takes cares of source (obviously the site), organizer (the administrator), and methodology(which could have been acquired by plain use of logic). In regards to population, the article specifically states " The poll targeted 316 people (as of October 29, 2005), who were generally of Serbian and Greek descent". This can be backed up by an analysis of the site traffic. As to it being "inherently unreliable", it is CLEARLY stated that the results may be in subject to error. The poll only existed to give a general outlook as to the opinion of the subject at hand.</p>
<p><br />
"References to the Neobyzantine movement, which actually contradict the concept of a union between the two states."</p>
<p>This is not true, considering that a Orthodox Union would in fact encourage the confederation between these nations. Where it does diverge from the original topic is that such a union would go beyond this and unite even more nations, that is why I also believe that it has no place here. If there are people who feel really strongly about it then perhaps it should have its own page. As of currently, I see no reason for this to be done.</p>
<p>"Links to pages "in support of the union" which are nothing but mostly empty personal sites (site #1),news repositories (site #2), and an 8 thread forum where people argue about whether the opposing poster is gay or not.(site #3)."</p>
<p>If news repositories cannot be considered as factually accurate sources then what can? Had this poster been more careful, he would certainly have noticed that this source was stored as an "External Link", and not, as he claims, a site in support of this union. As all proper news sources it held an unbiased POV that can be verified by a simple visit to the page in question.</p>
<p>The other websites(which Jsone oh so colourfully described) were placed in the section "Pro-Union" websites simply because of the fact that they WERE such!</p>
<p>I will now talk about why and how the article should be revised. Firstly all reference to the “neobyzantine” should be removed. I have somewhat already explained why I think so and don't see that any further explanation is neccessary. In addition, I ALSO believe that the article should be redirected to a more fitting title. Citias chose the designation "Serbian Greek Confederation", which I for one find highly suitable. More background information should also be included. So in conclusion, unrelated information should be removed, and already existing facts should be expanded upon. To be honest, I thought all of these revisions were necessary even back when I wrote what I did, however, I had assumed that it was already discussed and approved by the general community. I would certainly be willing to clean it up and expand on the main points. <a href="../../../d/u/m/User%7EDumanov_c1b1.html" title="User:Dumanov">Dumanov</a> 6:47 AM, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>(Which BY THEMSELVES prove that THIS IDEA has existed for, at the very least, the past decade.)</b>, I do wish to put to question his justification in claiming that the link in question does not promote unity between the nations. If one actually bothers to open the link, one will notice the&#160;:SERBIAN GREEK BROTHERHOOD TITLE, and perhaps if thats not enough, the following quote: "Promoting Greek-Serb friendship, brotherhood, and <b>unity</b>". If you should STILL find that to be ambigous in meaning, then a quick view of the gallery, which contains the exact same map of a joint Serbia and Greece as this featured article does, should be enough to put this issue to rest.Once again, The section that this link belonged to was titled <b>Pro-Union Sites</b> because of the fact that it is one. <a href="../../../d/u/m/User%7EDumanov_c1b1.html" title="User:Dumanov">Dumanov</a> 3:20 AM 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

The article spends vastly more time talking about the group itself than it does about what notable things the group has done or participated in, making me doubt there is much to be said.

<li>After a parade of now-deleted articles of Hong Kong high school students, we're now considering their club. Based on the article, it's just as (non)notable as their members for en.wikipedia.org. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 06:58, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I've left a comment with one wikipedian who seems to be heavily involved with the club. They claim to be active in Hong Kong politics and I've asked that they provide proof of this in the article (imo staging a few protests is not enough to be "active", protesting is the point of unions). Unless they can provide proof of how they have affected/changed policy or such, then I will vote to delete as well. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.alf_97b5.html" title="User:Dr.alf">dr.alf</a> 07:44, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I did receive a message from dr.alf, and I'm not sure if she/he was referring to me for saying "who seems to be heavily involved". I myself has never been involved in the union, and know none of its members.

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There's no clue those immature comments were from members of this organisation. The organisation is notable in the way that it was the first in Hong Kong that were created by secondary students, and was able to organise a relative large number of students to take part in the protests. They were covered by the media for their action. It's uncommon here for secondary students to turn out and speak up. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 16:03, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable student organization involving in many high-profile political demonstrations.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Considering the article has not been changed to show <b>why</b> the union is notable beyond it simply being a union, I think that it does not meet the notability requirements. I know that certain people have said that it has been involved in "high profile political demonstrations" and such, but the article does not show this. From what is in the article now, it only says that they organised one successful protest, and how successful (in changing policy or such) it was is unclear. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.alf_97b5.html" title="User:Dr.alf">dr.alf</a> 05:35, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why don't you do some research <i>yourself</i>, instead of saying that I have not edited the article (without even giving me time to go home first)? It takes hours just to do minor copyediting on this article, and I am supposed to be on Wikileave. With many references on Google having already expired or changed into paid content, perhaps you can help me find some non-expired English references. (Hint: HKSSU's site contain some valid references which are not even on Google, not even if I search in Google's Chinese site. Talk about "Google test" for notability; the "Google test" is invalid as a test for notability.)—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 08:23, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Yes, that's what I did in the last few hours. Many newspaper articles have either expired or turned into paid content. Google's cache helps, but isn't useful for multi-page articles. I think it's notable enough too, but unfortunately this is the English Wikipedia, some people think that if it cannot be found on the Web in the English language then it is automatically non-notable.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a>

<li>Have you tried the <b>Chinese name</b>. Of course you would find little about the body with the English name if the official language of the Union is Chinese.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> looks like encyclopedic material to me. Article would be greatly improved by demonstrating impact of CropSyst to address Mecanismo's concerns.

<li>After being told to check out the site by a friend I downloaded the actual game from 'The Sanga Team' website (which means the "game" does exist). Although of a bedroom-programmed standard the game and its story had quirky appeal and shows definite potential! After seeing that this page is to be removed, I am initially disappointed by the fact that a small bedroom programmer is being cut from what are infinite pages of knowledge (wikipedia). I also argue the fact that this doesn't exist and suggest that if this is the only reason for its deletion the original poster should check the newly added link (to the games website) and re-think his/her position...

<li>Ok, it's real, sorry about that (this is why you are supposed to include verifiable sources in articles), but is it notable? The site in question is scertainly not notable (124 hits last I checked acording to it's counter). So this is based on a indie comic? How many issues where published, where, by who, and that kind of things would be usefull, rather than making the article about this obscure game. We don't need more info on the characters, we need more info on why this deserve an article in the first place.

<li>The Boy Sanga is not "up and coming" its already here many people have just not realised it yet, and as for information regarding the team, this is from the mind of a dedicated man who’s many priorities otherwise leave him little time to update the site as it is believed to be needed. The team are well known amongst my own friends, they however already know much about the team and have played the game, due to their laziness see no reason to go on the website, how do we know this is not true of others. Furthermore the game information keeping this site provides inspiration and enthusiasm to all Indie programmers who can see the great fun to be had of creating their own games.Goonroy 16:35, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I guess it would, unless, as B.Wind suggests, someone wrote a preamble.
