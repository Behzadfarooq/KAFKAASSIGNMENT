<li><b>Delete</b>. This list is far too widespread and all-encompassing--it will bloat like there's no tomorrow. Also, it will turn into a POV battleground--how many days do you think we have until someone inserts the Iraq war or the founding of Israel? This topic is loosely encyclopedic <i>at best</i>--there's no call for it, and the numerous problems of this article will just undermine the whole effort. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 22:08, Apr 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Re: "bloat"</b> - Why should a large potential for expansion be a negative thing? If the list ever gets too long, it can be divided by subtopic. <b>Re: POV battleground</b> - The topic is definitely a magnet for controversy. But I maintain that "controversial" is no reason to disqualify an article. Otherwise we could justify deleting abortion and the Iraq War and stem cell research and scores of other useful articles. So far, the list seems to be devloping nicely.... there have been several attempts at stupid additions to the blunders list, but these have been quickly fixed. And I'm amazed and impressed that a non-biased section on blunders in politics has already been added to the article. Wikipedia repeatedly impresses with with it's ability to find NPOV on the most controversial of topics, even if it can be, at times, a long hard road getting there. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 17:12, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Now I'm really angry. There is no such thing as a "re-vote" on a VfD. If an article has changed, the right thing to do is simply to point out in a conspicuous comment that the article has been improved, and urge those who wish to change their votes do so. Given that the criterion for deletion is "rough consensus," the customary criterion is a 2/3 vote, and the acting sysop can exercise judgement, it is not at all hard to garner enough support to keep an improved article. It happens all the time. The VfD 5-day period is deliberately set long to to allow for this, and in practice the backlog these days is so long that even more time is available This "re-vote" is not much different from someone, without consensus, just deciding to delete all of the existing votes. It's easy enough to get an article kept. We don't need to add new policy to allow parliamentary maneuvering. If this "re-vote" is accepted as valid, count me as a "delete." (If, on the other hand, it is ignored and the previous, valid set of votes is considered, then my previous vote stands). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:43, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Bahahaha</b>. I mean, get rid of this thing. The original title was laughable at best; it reminded me of an old and unintentionally hilarious Batman comic. Seriously, the word 'boner' meaning blunder isn't encyclopedic. Maybe in the 70s, or in England. I don't know. The list in its current form isn't much better, anyway. There isn't any hope for it to be complete, and there'd be inherently conflicts over what's considered a blunder. Like when the Mongols invaded Japan and were wiped out by a typhoon, is that really a blunder or just bad timing? A blunder would infer that there was a mistake made in strategy, do unexpected events count? And what would constitute an unexpected event? Also, death to coddled pet articles. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickGriffin_42d3.html" title="User:RickGriffin">RickGriffin</a> 01:17, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>"The original title was laughable at best; it reminded me of an old and unintentionally hilarious Batman comic"</i>. The original title was actually <i>based</i> on that old and unintentionally funny Batman comic.&#160;:-) But, despite the silly title, even the first draft of the article was meant to be an encyclopedic, expandable stub. What's with the "death to coddled pet articles" attitide? That makes no sense. If you vote based on that then you are voting based on your opinion of the article's supporters and not on the article. That seems to be a form of personal attack rather then a legitimate reason to delete. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 23:01, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>"death to coddled pet articles"</i>, without wanting to get into the issues here (this is controversial enough and confusing enough as it is) are you aware of the keep/delete schools issues? <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 01:00, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I will gladly change my mind if someone gives a convincing reason to. No one has. I'm sorry if my state of being unconvinced bugs you. You are welcome to try to convince me.

<li>Or, you know, the subjects you didn't mention that were in my reply. What with all the Mongols and the invading of Japan. Above all that I'm just against lists that seem like they should be in a <i>DID YOU KNOW?!?!?!</i> book of some sort. Because also there has to be some cutoff limit about how 'great' a blunder would have to be before it's considered a great blunder. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickGriffin_42d3.html" title="User:RickGriffin">RickGriffin</a> 20:42, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The Mongols invading Japan and being taken out by a typhoon is a disaster, not a blunder. Is you look at the introdiction for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_disasters.html" title="List of military disasters">list of military disasters</a> it mentions bad weather as a possible cause of disaster. (It contributed to the French loss at Agincourt, among other battles.) On the introduction to the list of historical blunders page it indicates that, to be a blunder, something must have a bad result <i>and</i> be the result of bad decision making. The Mongal invasion could only be considered a blunder if they had a space-age, accurate typhoon prediction system and ignored it. The necessary technology did not exist, thus they had no reliable way of knowing that a typhoon would strike, thus it was not a blunder... but merely bad timing, as you suggested. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 20:56, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
