However, if RX-78 does get delete, it does prove that such action is valid. I apologize for the inconvience, but from our point of view, Star trek is as much cruff as Gundam. either both can coexist, or both can't. In fact, in Japan, more people know about Gundamthan Star Trek... you know, the whole worldview thing, so honestly, I am real pissed at Gundam being targeted simply because it's not "notable" in Western world. Once again, I hope that the Gundam articles will not get shot down left and right, else next time it's done here, it's no longer a WP:POINT, but by a precedent.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Leung_a0b3.html" title="User:George Leung">George Leung</a> 10:03, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I did <i><b>not</b></i>&#160;!vote to delete the whole specific gundam RX-whatever robot thingy article (I asked for one section to be deleted and another to be kept so long as its claims could be referenced properly) and there is no afd as far as I know regarding the main Gundam article which I have never commented on or edited. The burden of verifying the article rests on the content creators, not the commentators in AFD. I often run refs searches in afds but the provocative comments by certain Gundam Project editors in the AFD did not exactly encourage me to do so in this case. And notifying others that someone is abusing <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is not trolling. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 12:29, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
