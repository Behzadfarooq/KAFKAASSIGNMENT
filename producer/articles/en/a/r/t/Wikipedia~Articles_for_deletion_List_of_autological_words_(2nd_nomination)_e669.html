<li><b>Delete or Revise to subsume all trivial categories into general headings</b> (per Arvedui's suggestion). This list is meaningless, since hundreds of extremely trivial words can fit into this category. For example non-human is on the list. Infinite words can go in along those lines, all of them trivial, e.g. non-automotive, etc. It's almost as bad as having a list of rational numbers or words that start with S.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If the list is kept and revised, I think that the whole "depending on context" section should go; it's just as trivial (Sung-if sung) and doesn't really say much about the words themselves.<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 06:56, 1 November 2006 (UTC) revised <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 05:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>no. the "depending on context" section is good. in that context, they are then autological, they are valid examples. but i dont really see how "non-human" qualifies as a discription of a word. thats like saying "gill-less" is a description of a human. so then non-human also cannot be selfdescriptive. "Maybe limit to those for which the opposite could conceivably be true for a word", suggested by Lecontejohn should do, since only that is effectively discriptive--<a href="../../../l/y/g/User%7ELygophile_b1b0.html" title="User:Lygophile">Lygophile</a> 14:37, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But that's exactly what I mean--the plethora of valid but trivial examples is exactly what I think is the problem with this list. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 17:56, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The adjectives here are actually used to refer to words. "Non-human" and other trivial examples are not generally used to refer to words.

<dd>Non-human is currently an actual word on the list, as is inanimate. If you wanted to exclude the infinite trivial examples of that sort, that might make the list more interesting, but it would be hard to justify that, since they do conform to the definition of autological, despite being utterly trivial.<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 18:02, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I strongly disagree with the suggestion that the list as it stands is composed mainly of trivial examples, or that it will inevitably come to be dominated by them, despite the fact that virtually infinite trivial examples may exist. If you're concerned about the latter happening, then it would be enough to add a single-line entry to cover something like "all negative adjectives, such as non-purple, etc..." or perhaps add a short intro suggesting that people try to keep the entries "interesting". Currently the list is a concise, useful, effective and perfectly harmless demonstration of an obscure linguistic phenomenon, which is composed of far more interesting examples than not, and I think killing the article to save it from potential triviality is like killing a patient to save him from possibly catching the flu. --Arvedui 01:09, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong/Speedy Keep</b> per the previous VfD discussion. I don't see that anything has changed in the 8 months between then and now, and the result back then was overwhelmingly to Keep. Listcruft rationale was soundly rejected in that discussion as well. --Arvedui 00:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not that anything has changed; the problem with the earlier nomination is that it was nominated by someone who voted keep; therefore the case for deletion was never made to begin with. For what it's worth, I thought this was a useful list as well, until I realized how trivial the category <b>autological</b> was (basically all negative descriptions are autological, for a start). That is what I see as the important point, and it wasn't brought up at all in the previous discussion. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 20:48, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>With respect, you may be giving the act of nomination too much credit here... While the first nomination was made pre-emptively, it still resulted in a virtually unanimous vote to Keep, and I doubt it was the lack of a preamble calling the list pointless and trivial that determined that outcome--indeed many of the reasons people have voted Delete in this round were explicitly refuted in the last (listcruft, pointlessness, no-search, etc). Again, I grant that there are many trivial examples to be found, but it's easy enough (trivial, even!) to include them in general terms so as not to bog down the list as a whole while keeping the interesting part available for those who might want it. While this round of voting looks to me like No Concensus leaning towards Delete, I'm disappointed by how little weight is being given to the really overwhelming Keep vote granted earlier to what is essentially the identical list. --Arvedui 01:09, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, you may have a point about including them in general terms. That might actually be a good way to solve it. I'll change me vote. (Let just add, though, that it's not only negatives that are trivial. Practically the whole "depending on contexts" is, as well.) If you take out all the trivial examples, there isn't much left of the list... <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 05:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>definite Keep</b>, though probably it needs to be revised or mover to the wiktionaries apendices (as sugested when it was nominated for deletion before). its either an examples list, or a wiktionary thing. on the other hand, there are probably much more silly and trivial lists on wikipedia. and the risk of triviality on this page is no arguement, as that doesnt make the artical itself less desirable or encyclopedic.--<a href="../../../l/y/g/User%7ELygophile_b1b0.html" title="User:Lygophile">Lygophile</a> 14:23, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
