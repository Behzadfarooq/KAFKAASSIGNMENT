<p>One of many <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> clone sites. There is nothing particularly notable about this one. Was speedy deleted under A7, but its creator objected, and I felt that in the interest of fairness, we might as well open this up for debate: the fact that they specialize in Russian movies is something unique, enough to pass A7. But I still don't see notability to the level of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> here. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:37, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Even though it utilizes the same Netflix business model (with some deviation, like "express" service), it deliberately avoids the Netflix content, trying to position itself as a mutual exclusive company content wise.
<p>I am using both companies for my "movies" needs, just because of the unique RussArt.com content. For more then 6 million Russian speaking people in US, RussArt.com is really a one of the few threads which they can use to preserve their culture.</p>
<p>RussArt also provides with extensive info about movies/TV serials which help to make a decision what to order next.</p>
<p>I am actually looking for another site like RussArt.com, but dedicated to exclusevly French movies, since Netflix does not satisfy my demand on them either, but cannot find it just yet....</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> To me it is very offensive that a mass culture giant <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> dealing 90% in Hollywood production, shields honorable attempts to compete in cultural niches. Let's take a hypothetical site that, say, rents gay and lesbian movies. Well, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> does carry the Brokeback Mountain, so let's ban the site from everywhere because it's just another copycat. That's a poor approach, missing the points: (1) the gay and lesbian community is proud to have their own service, (2) there is much more for the visitors than just rentals - like gay and lesbian news, events, movie reviews from particular angle, etc.
<p>I vote for diversity - let's allow the Russian/Ukranian/Jewish/etc. American community to have their cinema portal RussArt.com, which also happens to rent DVDs like <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> does, - listed.</p>

<li>I'm not voting second time, I'm just offering more information. You guys might not read Russian and in such case it's hard for you to see what I see. I spent some time on this site and see that DVD rentals is just a small part of it. It offers public forum, where anyone can contribute content, post reviews and comments. It has online games, challenging knowledge on russisn cinema and actors. It has tons of news articles about movies and actors, including biographies and anecdotes. So I'd qualify it at least 50% as a cultural hub.

<li>Hi all. Ok, here is the thing. I'm Russian living in US for the past 10 years. I moved to US when I was 14. Even though, I speak, read and write almost perfectly in my native language, sometimes I come accross words that I never heard before. Believe it or not, when I search Google for the newly heard word, it often displays Wikepedia's page in the first few results. For the past month, it helped me learn 3 new words in my native language. Deleting this content would be a huge mistake.

<dd>Well, apparently you mean <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> not RussArt.com here, since RussArt.com does not carry a single Indian movie. So, your comment looks more then a strange one to me.--<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakhteiarov_a69a.html" title="User:Bakhteiarov">User:Bakhteiarov</a> 14:00, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that is what I said. I have rented literally hundreds of Indian movies from Netflix, thus I am inclined to doubt Helgrot's claim above that 90% of the movies that Netflix carries are Hollywood productions. It doesn't really have any bearing on this AfD discussion, it just struck me as being a strange and unlikely claim. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 14:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, so now you're saying that we should delete the <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollywood.html" title="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> article? What does that have to do with anything? If you want to try to get that deleted, go nominate it and see how it goes. What we are talking about here is RussArt.com, which doesn't meet our criteria for inclusion and should be deleted as such. As a matter of fact, it probably could have been speedied under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a> G11, which we have recently been directed by the Wikimedia Foundation to vigilantly enforce. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 15:20, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Yes, exactly. I (and billions other people) think <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollywood.html" title="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> is not notable. Existence of the article like <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollywood.html" title="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> emphasizes the fact that Wikipedia article admission process is far from perfect. And I would move <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollywood.html" title="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> article to indian Wikipedia.--66.189.88.27 20:24, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So do like I suggested and go nominate it for deletion. I would also suggest that you take a look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">our criteria for notability</a>. But what we are discussing here is RussArt.com. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 00:26, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Russian speaking people in US is a tiny slice of population (~ 2.6%), so social clubs and services for these people are barely notable in american society, meaning they just cannot be as notable as, say <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a>. Having said this, it is still 6-7 millions, which is a size of some European country. Notability notion, here, materializes a simplified democratic principle, - "the size does matter" and that the majority defines the ultimate truth, a.k.a. consensus. As related to RussArt.com article, - I am satisfied with the discussion and as long as "ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL" in the List of online DVD rental companies on Wikipedia, - we are in a concensus here&#160;:-). Thanks.</li>
