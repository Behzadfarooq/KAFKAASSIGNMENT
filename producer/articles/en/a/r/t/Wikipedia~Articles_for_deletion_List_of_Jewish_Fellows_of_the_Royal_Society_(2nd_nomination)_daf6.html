<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>.

That is fractionally below two-thirds, and I'm not persuaded that the keepers arguments (where they exist) are so much weaker than the deleters as to warrant lowering the baseline threshold. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 18:14, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Random lists of ethnicity and profession are equally non-notable in most cases. Pioneers in a previously closed field would be notable.

<li>Yes, if you look at the list it will tell you who the first Jewish fellow was. See how useful this list is?

<li><b>Delete</b>. List fails to establish the significance of being Jewish in this context. In fact the list is so long it renders itself non-notable by quantity.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Why do so many people want to delete lists of Jews? The fact that there are several such lists, many of which are frequently edited, shows that many in the Wiki community want them.

<ul>
<li>Have you missed today's AfDs for three or four lists of Roman Catholics? It's not lists of Jews people want deleted: it's lists that categorise people by religion. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:46, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I recall Wikipedians are disproportionately irreligious. I think the idea a religion actually is important to many people even in their choice of careers is almost frightening to some people. If you've noticed in cases when it's purely an ethnic group no one talks much of how "these lists divide people into groups and that's wrong." That said this seems too specific so I don't support it either. "List of Catholics" or "List of Greeks" in some Royal Society would also strike me as odd.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> What ticks me off is how the people on these votes always assume "antisemitic" intentions. People are deleting lists based on the fact that the lists are just plain over-reaching and redundant. If there was a list of Muslim Fellows of the Royal Society or list of Left-Handed Fellows of the Royal Society I'd vote for those too. It just happens that the Jew lists are most frequently the ones with over-reaching categorizations. As Haeleth stated above, a bunch of other religion-based lists are being deleted. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 18:08, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>you cannot equate these jewish lists with other religions as other religions are not also ethnicities or diasporas. Arniep 18:14, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>People who are members of the Royal Society ALL deserve to be there regardless of ethnicity etc.. IMHO to make a distinction along the lines of "jewish", "catholic", "afro-american" or whatever else is, if anything, to reinforce such divisions. In each case, it is more likely to encourage things like anti-semitism etc.. For me, the only mark that counts is that we are all people. In this case, all members of the RS. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 18:45, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's a glib defence to turn the argument round and claim that all people for retention are saying that all those for deletion are anti-semitic.

<li>Clearly the above voter is not familiar with the rules of a renomination for delete.

<dd>The discussion on this page isn't about anonymous IP voting like so many people assume - it's about the page itself - voting to keep a list just on the principle that it was an anon vote (which is allowed ANYWAY) does not take into account the real reasons why this list should be deleted and is frankly immature. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 04:13, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The reason this list probably wasn't deleted during the first try was because, like now, people took it too seriously and worried too much about "offending" others than actually analyzing the list. There has been a history of DELETE votes for these type of lists. See List of Jewish Members of the French Academy of Sciences, List of Jewish Members of the French Academy of Sciences. This is the only one left that was made for a nationality (Brits - in some way). As you showed us above, some voters just choose a hysterical "keep!!!!!!!!!1" without really looking at the reasons for deletion (of which there are numrous). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 04:35, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
