<p>am nominating his article fo deletion. The <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notabillity criteria</a> holds that "A topic is generally notable if it has been the subject of coverage that is independent of the subject, reliable, and attributable. The depth of coverage and quality of sources must be considered in determining the number of sources required and whether the coverage establishes notability."</p>
<p>As a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">quick google search</a> finds, the only entries relevant to the object of this topic are the persons own professional homepage, departmental homepage, and her publications. There is no record of notabillity or record to support the derivation of this article, ie, that she is credited with discovering APOBEC3G, other than that she's the primary author of the original paper. A <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">search of notable profiles</a> in Nature describes APOBEC3G as the most famous work of somebody called Michael Malim. There is however mention of Ann Sheehy as his post-doctoral fellow. On the above criteria, I think the article should be deleted as it is both factually wrong and does not satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notabillitycriteria</a> <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudewheresmywallet_f1a0.html" title="User:Dudewheresmywallet">Dudewheresmywallet</a> 11:56, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> She is only an assistant professor, and they are not always N unless the work is particularly N. With respect to that, "no record ... that she is credited with discovering APOBEC3G, other than that she's the primary author of the original paper" is a rather remarkable assertion. Post Doc advisors and their Associates often can reasonably claim joint credit. But she has published 10 papers in 5 years, all in the very highest quality journals, and with the highest ones having, respectively, 260, 165, and 90 times. I've added them. I think that's very high counts for this stage in the career, and reflects the notability of the discovery. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:14, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> I am not sure whether the promise of her career is a suitable ground or criteria to be entered into wikipedia. As DGG says, she is only an assistant proffessor. She is not notable in that she is not <i>famous</i>, either for APOBEC3G, or any other work. She maybe a very good proffessor and researcher, but I think you will find there are hundreds of Professors and researchers and scientists all over the world doing important work. They are not notable.</dd>
<dd>Re: <i>"no record ... that she is credited with discovering APOBEC3G, other than that she's the primary author of the original paper" is a rather remarkable assertion,"</i> I do not assert it, I have <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">provided a link</a> from the journal Nature which describes the work as the most famous achievement of a Michael Malim, and describes Sheehy as his Post-doctoral fellow. Per my knowledge, I would imagine that Sheehy was probably involved extensively in the ground work and (probably a lot of)intellectual input, but the thinking, designing, conducting, supervision, and interpreting the experiment was probably by done Malim. Primary authorship of a paper is merely indicative of the author having carried majority of the ground work.</dd>
<dd>Re: She has published 10 papers in 5 years in high quality journals. This is not ground for notabillity or fame. Again going back to above argument, there are a number of people doing high quality research who have found their work published in high quality journals this very month. It is the implications of the results, and their associations with the achievement of results. APOBEC3G is described by Nature and other search engines as such. However, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">we cannot decide</a> wether or not Sheehy should be credited with discovering APOBEC3G, and have to rely on external credible sources. Searching Google with "APOBEC3G, Ann Sheehy" gives <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=APOBEC3G%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=APOBEC3G%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">this result</a> among which the first is a citation of the original paper from her own homepage, and the rest are departmental homepages , wikipedia (or mirror website) entries, or subsequent publication citations. I have already provided a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">search of profiles</a> from Nature with "Nature profile, Ann Sheehy" as criteria. The result points to a profile of Michael Malim and not to one of Ann Sheehy. Lastly, I have done an additional search of "APOBEC3G, Michael Malim", the results are more comprehensive, in particular, there is a feature from News@Nature. Without taking away any credit from Sheehy for her work guys, I think she's not yet as famous as to deserve a Wikipedia article, nor is she credited as much for APOBEC3G as the article would have us believe.<a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudewheresmywallet_f1a0.html" title="User:Dudewheresmywallet">Dudewheresmywallet</a> 13:15, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Her Own professional Home page.</li>
<li>The Wikipedia entry on Ann Sheehy.</li>
<li>A number of scientific papers (original publications or reviews).</li>
<li>One <a href="http://www.iavireport.org/Issues/Issue9-2/GuardianOfTheGenome.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.iavireport.org/Issues/Issue9-2/GuardianOfTheGenome.asp" rel="nofollow">article from International aids vaccing intiative</a> that notes the potential importance of the <a href="../../../a/p/o/APOBEC3G_a61d.html" title="APOBEC3G">APOBEC3G</a> protein. It does however note Sheehy played an important part in identifying the protein, but also noted this was a prior ongoing work.</li>
<li>There are no other mention of notabillity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The points of contention are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>- She is not (at least not yet), (per above search results in Google, which only finds her own own pages, publications, and institution pages and is not mentioned in any biographical or news article, as opposed to a different individual with regards to the same discovery). She is therefore not notable. By all means, if this changes in the future, I will change my opinion. Regarding her work and notabillity: (per WP:BIO); it states that;</li>
</ul>
<p>"Creative professionals: scientists, academics, professors, authors, editors, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, artists, architects, engineers, and other creative professionals.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The person is regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by their peers or successors.</i>-The paper co-authored by Sheehy and others is cited, yes, Sheehy is not. No newspaper,online or journal article regarding Ann Sheehy has been located yet.</li>
<li><i>The person is known for originating a significant new concept, theory or technique.</i>- Closest it come to attributing the origination of the theory, concept, whatever you call it is <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=APOBEC3G+news+and+features&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=APOBEC3G+news+and+features&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">to a different person</a>.</li>
<li><i>The person has created a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, which has been the subject of an independent book or feature-length film, or of multiple independent periodical articles or reviews.</i>- Not sure of APOBEC3G yet falls into this category. In addition to the argument of the preceding point re:newpaper,journal and online articles, APOBEC3G does not yet seem that significant. Certainly not like <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a>, <a href="../../../m/r/i/MRI_7148.html" title="MRI">MRI</a>,<a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometry.html" title="Mass spectrometry">Mass spectrometry</a>,<a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine.html" title="Vaccine">Vaccine</a>. It does have the potential to, though.</li>
<li><i>The person's work either</i> (a) <i>has been displayed in a significant exhibition or as a monument</i> (b) <i>has won significant critical attention,</i> or (c) <i>is represented within the permanent collection of a significant gallery or museum of more than local significance.</i>- Again, it doesn't satisfy the first and last, and the middle is very tight to be fitted in. The original paper certainly has found quite a few citations, but it might peter out. Lastly, by calling it <i>her paper</i>, we're saying she did the work (the work that hasn't really become that noted yet, except for it's potential in HIV scientists), where as nowehere does it credit her (alone) (the HIV vaccine page does say, as I had said before, that she did to the ground work, and indicates that she was involved in intellectual input)."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. She is verifiable because she has authored some published papers. So has <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Yamashita%2C+Cytidine+deaminase&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Yamashita%2C+Cytidine+deaminase&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Masahiro Yamashita</a>,<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Haxton%2C+W.+C.+Neutrino&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Haxton%2C+W.+C.+Neutrino&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">W.C Haxton</a>,<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ostrovsky%2C+L.+wave&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ostrovsky%2C+L.+wave&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">L Ostrovsky</a>(I could go on) , and you will find numerous <i>citations</i> for them.</li>
<li>Re:<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, of course they are reliable because they're journal articles. Doesn't mean it is encyclopaedically notable. Eg, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ajay+Nahata&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ajay+Nahata&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Ajay Nahata</a> has had a publication in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7135/index.html#lt" class="external text" title="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7135/index.html#lt" rel="nofollow">the current issue of Nature (p157)</a>, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Karen+Arndt%2C+Ubiquitin%2C+Cell+2005&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Karen+Arndt%2C+Ubiquitin%2C+Cell+2005&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Karen Ardt</a> has had quite afew notable publications, including in <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Karen+Arndt%2C+Ubiquitin%2C+citation&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Karen+Arndt%2C+Ubiquitin%2C+citation&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow"><i>"The Cell"</i>, <i>"Molecular Cell Biology"</i>, <i>" Molecular Biology of the Cell"</i>, <i>"Genetics"</i></a> working in <a href="../../../u/b/i/Ubiquitination.html" title="Ubiquitination">Ubiquitination</a> and in fungi, and she's pretty well known in her field.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line is I think <a href="../../../a/p/o/APOBEC3G_a61d.html" title="APOBEC3G">APOBEC3G</a> qualifies as notable within the WP:Science category and does deserve an article.

We ought to judge her notability based on other academics in the biological sciences. The fact is that, in that field, there are few (if any) academics who have published major papers on their own (the cost of biological research is highly prohibitive to such a venture).
