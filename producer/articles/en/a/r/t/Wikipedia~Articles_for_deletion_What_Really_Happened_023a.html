I am putting this article up for deletion because the article does not establish notability or cite verifiable reliable sources in order to do so.

<ul>
<li>You treat Alexa rank as though it is a statistically-representative sampling of the population at large, where the % of WRH readers who have Alexa installed is approximately the same as the % of the general population on the WWW who has Alexa installed. Alexa counts page rank only via those people who install the Alexa toolbar. The Alexa toolbar is spyware (as fully described in the <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/help/terms.html" class="external text" title="http://pages.alexa.com/help/terms.html" rel="nofollow">terms of use</a>: "COLLECTS AND STORES INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEB PAGES YOU VIEW, THE DATA YOU ENTER IN ONLINE FORMS AND SEARCH FIELDS, AND, WITH VERSIONS 5.0 AND HIGHER, THE PRODUCTS YOU PURCHASE ONLINE WHILE USING THE TOOLBAR SERVICE" [capitalization due to Alexa, not me]). WRH is a website whose primary purpose is to disseminate evidence of how various powerbases are acting in ways that are contrary to the individual liberties that were supposedly protected by the founding fathers via the U.S. Constitution. The typical WRH reader is a person who (I claim) is inclined to entertain the possibility that some government agencies and some corporations are acting badly. Wouldn't such a person be concerned about an Alexa terms-of-use agreement that in plain language announces that the Alexa toolbar collects information about their every activity on the Internet, where a (possibly foreign) government could tap into that collected information? I claim that the typical WRH reader would not install Alexa because the East-German-STASI-like possibility of current or near-future abuse of that collected information by FBI, by NSA, by the military, by foreign governments, and by corporations with which Alexa has contractual relationships far outweighs any perceived benefit of Alexa to the individual. Thus, Michael Rivero considers the Alexa page rankings for WRH to be skewed to under-representing how many hits that WRH has per unit time.<a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/FAQ/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://whatreallyhappened.com/FAQ/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Think about it. If a person were to believe the news-reports published every day on WRH of abuses of power, then wouldn't that person be fearful of abuse of the vast collection of personal information that Alexa harvests to the point that the Alexa toolbar would not be installed on that person's computer at all? Alexa page rank for WRH would be counting only A) those careless regular WRH readers who did not read the Draconian Alexa terms of use and B) those casual interlopers who are not the regular WRH readers and C) those who became regular WRH readers after their first several visits with the Alexa toolbar installed and then decided to de-install Alexa for abuse-of-power concerns. —<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptikos_6dff.html" title="User:Optikos">optikos</a> 14:51, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and <b>Clean up</b> User:Twinpinesmall This article is in dire need of constant policing by Wikipedia members, so as to ensure a <b>neutral</b> point of view, and no political leanings. If this article were to be deleted, just because a few immature people cannot stand to see any information on those they disagree with; it would COMPLETELY defeat Wikipedia's entire purpose and raison d'etre. The problem is not this article, but rather the misguided belief many Americans have; that there should be one set of morals, ethics, and laws for people with a "<b>D</b>" after their names, and another for those with an "<b>R</b>". As long as ANY article is unique in its subject, does not make unsubstantiated claims, and is not one-sided, then it must DEFINITELY be kept, as part of the world's one true wealth: knowledge.Pine 20:15, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep and clean up</b> This site is notable, whether one agrees or disagrees with it. It is popular enough, and has been around since the Clinton administration, when it was created shortly after Vince Foster's death. The fact that its popularity has only increased since the Bush administration makes it a notable website. However, it needs definite clean-up, expansion, citing of sources, and as many viewpoints (pro, con, and inbetween) fairly presented as possible before it will be a decent article. Right now, it is currently a partial mess. --<a href="../../../c/g/a/User%7ECGally81_599d.html" title="User:CGally81">CGally81</a> 01:22, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge to Michael Rivero for now</b>. After doing some in-depth LexisNexis and NewsLibrary.com stuff, I was unable to find a single reliable source which discusses WhatReallyHappened, as you would expect for a blog this popular. However, there is no doubt that Rivero is a notable conspiracy theorist. Information about his blog could be included there. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 03:25, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> One of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>'s criteria is awards garnered. Here are the awards that WRH has earned over the years: <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/FAQ/awards.htm" class="external free" title="http://whatreallyhappened.com/FAQ/awards.htm" rel="nofollow">http://whatreallyhappened.com/FAQ/awards.htm</a> with links to awarding organizations. Also if WRH is an article that becomes deleted, then perhaps <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">slashdot</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthout.html" title="Truthout">truthout</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drudge_Report_b304.html" title="Drudge Report">Drudge Report</a> should be deleted as well. Which awards has Slashdot or Truthout or DrudgeReport earned that are more substantial than WRH? (Please do list them below. Nobel? Pulitzer?) As a daily reader of both WRH and DrudgeReport, I find that the view supported by WRH is one of fact-finding by commonfolk American citizens trying to practice democracy the best that they know how, whereas I consider DrudgeReport a propaganda machine that serves well to figure out which emotional froth <i>du jour</i> that we sheeple are to be worked up to. Thus I find it offensive to hear labels of "conspiracy theorist" lobbed against WRH, when what WRH is attempting to do is expose facts and evidence that do not fit with the prevailing conventional wisdom. I hold WRH up (as do the awards) as brave patriotic activist democracy in action by the little guy. I hold up Wikipedia as much the same. Also WRH is congruent to Michael Rivero as much as Drudge Report is congruent to Matt Drudge. Without their mouthpiece blog, Rivero or Drudge is a nobody. The only reason that Alex Jones interviews Michael Rivero is because of the WRH blog. Alex Jones doesn't interview Rivero for Rivero's technical business conducted in Hawaii. Furthermore, Rivero's WRH-centered interviews by Alex Jones syndication itself qualifies as "multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself". This AfD fits with my overall sense that a growing number of Wikipedians are interested in destroying Wikipedia content more than they are interested in writing new content. Rather than debating how to write a good WRH article, we are debating how best to destroy it. I find it very telling that <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisonplanet.com.html" title="Prisonplanet.com">Prisonplanet.com</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Rense_351f.html" title="Jeff Rense">Jeff Rense</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infowars.com.html" title="Infowars.com">Infowars.com</a>, and What Really Happened are all the same political movement and all up for deletion at the same time.

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh please. The "awards" WRH has won is as non-notable as the site itself. May you please cite these Alex Jones interviews that you refer to? And even on the assumption that this is notable, how is this "multiple non-trivial published works"? Please don't bring other articles into this; we are voting on the merits of THIS article only, unless these other articles are precedent for keep or delete. We are not interested in destroying more content than we are creating as a policy; we are interested in deleting that which doesn't fit into wiki, that is all. "Rather than debating how to write a good WRH article, we are debating how best to destroy it." Why yes, yes we are.

<dd>Regarding other AfDs of the same ilk, it is obvious to me that there is a campaign afoot to censor on Wikipedia the political movement and nonMSM journalism that WRH &amp; Michael Rivero, Rense.com &amp; Jeff Rense, and PrisonPlant.com &amp; Alex Jones represent. A multiple-AfD campaign of sweeping censorship of an entire political movement and of an entire branch of nonMSM journalism is very much worth exposing and very much is a matter worthy of debate on <i>each</i> of that political movement's AfDs. Re:"Oh please." So where is the list of awards the DrudgeReport has earned that I requested? Any Nobel or Pulitzer or Peabody in Drudge's list? So far WRH has entered numerous awards into this discussion whereas DrudgeReport has a big fat zero awards presented here for comparison. —<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptikos_6dff.html" title="User:Optikos">optikos</a> 05:08, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - there's something wrong with that newsmax article which claims to be from 1997. Even according to Rivero's site archive <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, whatreallyhappened.com was not formed until early 1999. It previously was his personal site, "Rancho Runamukka", which evolved from prior personal ISP websites. My assumption is that the 1997 newsmax article linked to Rivero's personal site, and then someone edited the newsmax article to replace the dead link with the newer whatreallyhappened.com. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 17:18, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

As far as the supposed anti-Israel bias, I notice we have articles on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Rense_351f.html" title="Jeff Rense">Rense.com</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisonplanet.com.html" title="Prisonplanet.com">Prisonplanet.com</a> and the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drudge_Report_b304.html" title="Drudge Report">Drudge Report</a>, which have been known to engage in a little "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">Elders of Zion</a>" nonsense themselves from time to time.

<li><b>Keep/Cleanup</b> - Reading the arguments here, it looks like the site does have some notability, if nothing else than for its longivity, but also becuase it's cited elsewhere with a certain amount of regularity. On the other hand, the article as it stands is pretty ugly, and in need of help. But we don't delete articles because they aren't good, we improve them.

<p>Strothra, you got to be kidding. Ever experienced what happens if anybody dares to submit anything on Wikipedia that is only remotely critical of Israel or Zionism? Within a matter of minutes, the entry is plastered with 'Neutrality disputed' and 'Article is up for deletion', with dozens of oh so neutral 'editors' - I call them censors - attacking the article as anything from 'non-noteworthy' to 'anti-Semitic'.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Does it really matter that they posted a story about this "challenge" of a wiki article written by a WRH reader, not Rivero himself? This challenge on the osama video article re-write is baseless. Look at the articles being used to verify the Osama video piece. 95% of them are BBC Telegraph or Guardian articles. There are two articles from informationclearinghouse, which is nothing more than an RSS feed site anyway. Look through the data in the links given and let it speak for itself. Whoever wrote the original article did a shoddy job to say the least. Mabey on hotly contested issues, that are heavily debated you should allow dueling articles on them and let the readers decide which proves their case better based on the evidence presented? Have headers on "hot issues" that link to the opposing article that way until somthing is laid to rest in the majority of wiki users minds the debate is preserved. I think thats the true beauty you guys have as an online encyclopedia that is open source to the public it could allow an up-to-date preservation of current debates. Do what you know is right in the intrest of free exchange of information.</li>

<li><b>REMOVE</b>: It is clear that WhatReallyHappened.com doesn't belong on Wikipedia and that its content does conflict with the editorial policy of Wikipedia. If Wikipedia is to maintain consistency then references to substantial resources presenting alternative *conspiracy* versions of history should be banned. If you keep the article on WhatReallyHappened then you are inviting an edit war as people try to edit out the necessary bias from the official article that equates criticism of Israel with anti-semitism. It is better for all that Wikipedia stand firm on its principles. REMOVE the site!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs to be improved, but 1) the subject doesn't seem to be any less WP:WEB than <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_Page_in_the_Universe_9fcb.html" title="The Best Page in the Universe">The Best Page in the Universe</a> or other similar pages and 2) if WP is whittled to just popular, common subjects, it becomes much less useful. 67.20.67.252 06:24, 1 June 2006 (UTC)proberts</li>
</ul>
<p>KEEP: While it may not meet the criteria, neither does Drudge Report. My understanding of Wikipedia is as an information source, and the article, while it could be improved, does provide information defining the site.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> To my mind, deleting WRH from WP smacks of censorship. I'm not a newbie to WP or Wikia and I'm worried by the attitude of some of those writing above. WRH is a very popular site among all sorts of people, its shortcomings notwithstanding. Although Rivero has strong opinions, some of which sail close to the wind, he's far from being a nutter and he provides one of the best news digests out there. But that's not really relevant, is it. The site is significant, period. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.195.204.146 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.195.204.146_6b48.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.195.204.146">contribs</a>) 23:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I can't see anything about this page that would warrant deletion. I view WRH at least twice I day. Even though I disagree with Rivero's comments on several issues, I still regard it as one of the best ways to find interesting new information on the Web.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>!, Who will benefit most from the deletion? I read WRH nearly everyday, it doesn't mean I agree with everything in it, I don't see the any anti-semitism. The word "anti" is being thrown about too much, if you don't suport Bush, you are 'anti American' whatever that means, and critisize Isreali policys and intelligence gathering tactics - you are branded the mis-nomer that is 'anti-semite', looks like censorship to me. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 194.73.102.82 (<a href="../../../1/9/4/User_talk%7E194.73.102.82.html" title="User talk:194.73.102.82">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.73.102.82_8878.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.73.102.82">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If I enter whatreallyhappened in google, I get a return of about 284'000 pages which mostly link to the site. Seems important enough to be listed.

<li><b>Keep</b> Whenever administrators elect to censor the popular types of expression, it always backfires. It may take a bit of time, but it will happen.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> dear administrators and 'wikipedians': somewhere on this wiki it says "[d]isagreements should be resolved through <i>consensual discussion</i>, rather than through tightly sticking to rules and procedures", yet it seems equally important for you to stress above that "the deletion process is designed to determine the consensus of opinion of <b>Wikipedia editors</b>". thanks for pretending that the opinions of the general public users actually matter.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Whatreallyhappened.com is the most well known website of its kind. World wide.

<li><b>Keep</b>, All Rivero does is provide links to credible wire service, magazine, and newspaper articles available elsewhere on web, and he occasionally comments underneath the date given for the article, which is his right under the First Amendment. The charges of anti-semitism are ridiculous. Who is making this charge? Identify yourself. Is this why Rivero's site is up for deletion? I suspect it is. [If you really want to ward off anti-semitism, spend your time making sure the US does not attack Iran and cause WWIII. That will produce anti-semitism at the Joe Six-Pack level the likes of which we will have never seen in this country. Abdicating our judgment, foreign policy, and treasury for the express nationalistic needs of a foreign nation to the detriment of our own is constitutional slaughter, and when that produces the senseless death of American soldiers as a result, as it most assuredly will, American citizens will react in their own interest. You aint seen xenophobia yet. And there is no fundamentalist Christian fantasy that could possibly override it...and while you're at it working to stop WWIII, why dont you ask the US govt to give the $6 BILLION oil reserve for Israel -- $3 BILLION in 2002 prices -- back to the US taxpayers who paid for it.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't understand the problem with WRH. It's a great source for news, especially in this day and age with a monopoly on mainstream media. If it is a supposed anti-semite related problem, I don't see it it all. I clearly see anti-zionist, but that is obviously different from anti-semitism.<br />
I mean, for real, I live in Brooklyn with a plenty of orthodox Jews, I could line up a thousand of them who are anti-zionist. Does that mean these orthodox Jews are anti-semite? I don't think so. Afterall, these orthodox Jews heed and worship G*d and gain inspiration and insight from the Torah. The Zionist worship a piece of soil, which just so happens to sit in the middle of what a number of religons consider their Holy Land. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.203.149.18 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.203.149.18_8340.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.203.149.18">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

The site is an enormous resourse that I am gratefull for. Over the last 2 YEARS (that I've been reading WRH), the Editor has been true to an unwritten editorial ethos of fairness, exposure and education. The site is obviously and consistently guided by these principles. There is an often colourful "introductory comment" aside many of the link pages. While these comments are often passionate, I while have never seen any tainted by unreasoned vitriol, bitterness, blind promotion, etc. I salute this fine resource and recommend it - especially to those who are only familiar with the standard, sanitized press that so typifies the media. I cannot imagine any reason why Wiki should delete the reference, short of arbitratry censorship or possibly even pressure from quarters that may not like exposure of many unpretty things....

<li><b>Keep this entry and Improve.</b>; If this entry is deleted, then many readers, like myself, will understand that censorship is driving this. I have no connection to the WRH website. I'm a long-time reader of Wikipedia and What Really Happened. I believe What Really Happened is an excellent alternative news source and not some "conspiracy theory" site as some obviously non-readers of the site have claimed here. And even if one considers it as a conspiracy-theory site as their reason for removal, then that isn't a good enough excuse. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF WIKIPEDIA IS TO BE INFORMATIVE. Entry deletions should not be based on whether an entry is "important," "relevant," or "notable" because those categorizations are subjectively and arbitrarily determined by the person who's searching for information at any given moment. If you're going to have superfluous entries on cartoons, anime and local politicians that I wouldn't necessarily include in ANY wiki, let alone encyclopedia, then there should be no problem with keeping WRH's entry. Nor does the WP:WEB notability does apply, because even USER's PERSONAL INFO are included as Wiki. Nor should Wikipedia acquiesce to those who want to press for censorship of an entry based on reasons of political, religious, or governmental affiliation. If you disagree with info posted on the entry -- isn't that what the edit function for? Those who press for WRH's deletion are doing so based on censorship reasons -- just as what happend with Rachel Corrie's play in New York City. If someone doesn't like WRH, then don't read it - and that goes for the site's entry on Wikipedia too. All voices and sources of news need to be heard and maintained -- not just those "sanctioned" by the elitists. And in addition, WRH's entry does not violate Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View, No Original Research or Veribility policies. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah_smiling_again_dfad.html" title="User:Sarah smiling again">Sarah smiling again</a> 13:43, 31 May 2006 (UTC)USA 10:32, 30 May 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah_smiling_again_dfad.html" title="User:Sarah smiling again">Sarah smiling again</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarah_smiling_again_f05e.html" title="User talk:Sarah smiling again">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sarah_smiling_again_a119.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sarah smiling again">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> WRH is a popular, active, and controversial website. Just by virtue of that, it is worth being included. For all the people that consider the site to be anti-semitic, they should especially want to keep the article, since people who get referred to WRH can look it up on Wikipedia and at least be aware of the allegations and controversy surrounding it. I don't think there's anything wrong with the article the way it is - whether or not Rivero is anti-semitic is a matter of opinion, but that the allegations have been made is a matter of fact. It just needs to be clearly stated that they are allegations. With the explosion in alternative news websites, It would seem that it would be important for Wikipedia to have information on them of this nature, so people can at least be aware of what biases the website may have, especially when the sites have a large audience. For instance, I have read WRH occasionally for a while, and I never knew that Rivero was a Republican, or that the site was that old. That said, I don't see the point for a second article about Rivero, since he is only notable for WRH. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenatorpjt_9c7d.html" title="User:Senatorpjt">Senatorpjt</a> 14:15, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Though I think that sometimes Rivero has exaggerated ideas, I feel that I can winnow the articles myself, without the good graces of a self-appointed censor, I've noticed that any article in Wikipedia tending to reflect negatively on Jews or Israel, whether the article is true or false, may be vandalized by cyber hitmen, and this seems to be the case here.

<li>KEEP. WRH has been a minor phenomena in the web sphere. A good resource for daily news of the the evil empire's activities. I don't see any bias accept towards logically correct moral positions, hence Israel's inclusion based on their own stated goal of a race-based society and the effects it causes. From a wiki point of view, even if one disagrees with MR's viewpoints (he does not editorialise all that much), WRH has been pivotal in forming one of the sources for anti-war, anti-neo-con movement.

<li><b>Keep</b>, This site exposed "extraordinary rendition" long before the mainstream media even knew it was happening. In fact, WRH is often months ahead of stories which eventually get accepted by the main stream media. Rivero is an intelligent man who does a good job separating wide eyed conspiracy nonsense from legitimate matters of public concern. I do, indeed, have concerns about the stridency of his anti-Israel stance. Rivero states that being against the policies of Isreal is not the same as anti-semitism. I think he is correct about that. However, the site attracts anti-semites and that does indeed bother me. Nonetheless if Wikipedia supports freedom of speech they shouldn't even consider deleting WRH. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.84.0.183 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.84.0.183_0f5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.84.0.183">contribs</a>).</small></li>

If Wikipedia is going to start deleting articles that they don't agree with, like so many books burned by the Nazis, then I hope sites like WRH will continue to reveal the hypocrisy of this supposed source of information.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Wikipedia editors are really pathetic. Why is anti-semitism or anti-Israelism such a big deal to them? What about anti-Catholicism? How come they don't throw out entries that are anti-Catholic? Why are the Jews so sacrosanct? What makes them more special than everybody else? I read WhatReallyHappened.com every day to get the pure unadulterated no-holds barred no-punches-pulled truth and honest realistic commentary. Now I am a traditional Roman Catholic of the Mel Gibson type, and Mike Rivero being an atheist he is also anti-Catholic. Nevertheless, I would believe Mike Rivero in the area of politics and economics and military etc. (everything except religion) before I would believe in anything John Paul II said or Benedict Ratzinger says or any of the crooked child-molesting cardinals, bishops and priests. And furthermore, the fact is that WhatReallyHappened exists and does not depend on Wikipedia for its existence, so whether or not Wikipedia deletes the entry on WhatReallyHappened is nothing more than pure childishness on the part of Wikipedia editors. Since Wikipedia purports to be an online encyclopeia, it should contain information about everything that exists. I am Catholic and I despise Jews and I am anti-semitic (so there! put that in yer pipe and smoke it!) but I wouldn't think of using that as a justification for calling for the deletion of all Wikipedia entries on the ADL or B'nai B'rith or Kabala or Chabad or Israel et al. In fact, I am anti- a lot of things and pro- a lot of other things as well. None of that though should be used as justification to trample on my right to speak freely, nor on the right of the people to be able to obtain information on those subjects. Wikipedia editors should drop political correctness as a guideline for what is contained in Wikipedia and simply write about what is there from an unslanted unbiased viewpoint. Perhaps the entry on Wikipedia itself should say "Wikipedia is an anti-anti-semitic discriminatory encyclopedia that seeks to further the Jewish and/or pro-Jewish agenda and censor any information which is not flattering to Jews or in keeping with that agenda. You can see that in trying to defend and promote one particular special interest group, you are not only setting yourself against everyone else, but you are doing a diservice to all the people (including Jews) who have a right to information and seek that information in Wikipedia, and finally you are doing a disservice to yourself by besmirching your name with the sins of censorship and bigotry masquerading as justice.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The reason this entry is up for deletion is that WRH has dared to feature articles critical of Israel. The reputation of wikipedia is increasingly under threat here.<br />
While WRH and others are being attacked Islamaphobic hate sites listed on wikipedia get promoted and protected - see the resurrection of the Harry's Place entry to see proof of that. There is blog that routinely demonises Islam and Muslims yet it gets reposted after it was rightly deleted. Why the hypocrisy wikipedia?<br />
But you know what after reading some of the arrogance frorm your registered users above towards those who come here to support WRH I think I am changing my mind.<br />
Who cares what wikipedia lists.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> The usual 'non-notability' fig leaf that the bunch of Zionist agents who have infiltrated Wikipedia normally uses to hide their blatant censureship doesn't do the trick here. WhatReallyHappened.com has a Google Page Rank of 7/10 and an Alexa Page Rank of the site is 9504. Its readership goes into the thousands every day.

<li><i>Keep</i> Some have argued that their reason for WRH's deletion is that Wikipedia IS NOT a compendium for pop culture. But, this argument is a flawed one -- especially since there are plenty of pop culture-related references that Wikipedia already includes, and there have been no calls for the removal of these entries. I'll cite several examples. For example, Wikipedia has an entry for Cartoon Network's &lt;a href="<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy</a>"&gt;The Grim Adventures of Bill and Mandy&lt;/a&gt; and Nickolodeon's &lt;a href=""&gt;Fairly Odd Parents&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not against ANY pop culture reference being included in Wikipedia, since it's helpful in finding out more about certain shows I enjoy. My argument is that if you're going to include those seemingly superfluous entries, then I can't really see how you can use that a substantive argument for the deletion of WRH's entry. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah_smiling_again_dfad.html" title="User:Sarah smiling again">Sarah smiling again</a> 13:43, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>DELETE* I thought this was an encyclopedia? What is WRH doing in an online encyclopedia anyway? WRH is simply a website. It's not a historical event or movement. I go there pretty much daily to skim through the posted articles, but it's nothing extraordinary. WRH in itself is not significant. I don't think Rivero creates content, he simply "mines" it from others. I am somewhat disturbed by the worldwide Jewish conspiracy nonsense. I don't support Israel myself, but some of the postings are not simply anti-Israel they ARE anti-semitic. Also WRH has a strong racist anti-immigrant taint. Some of the stuff is good investigative journalism, however, much of it veers off into loony tunes conspiracy theorist fantasy land. Kind of like Alex Jones - ignorant redneck anti-guvmint, anti-Jewish, anti-immigrant crap. Where were all of you WRH fanatics when people like me were protesting against US involvement in Central America in the early 80's? Where were you during the anti-apartheid protests of the mid and late 80's? What were you doing during the protests against the first Gulf War? No wonder you're freaked out! If you were semi-literate and politically conscious you would have read years ago about the shadowy and immoral acts of our government and military.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I have been visiting the site for over a year and its strong criticism of Israel cannot be misconstrued as antisemitism; in fact I consider it foolhardy to do so. WRH is at times unpleasantly rightwing and libertarian but does exhibit quite a bit of stuff which is going wrong in the world. --<a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDagonweb_421a.html" title="User:Dagonweb">Dagonweb</a> 15:15, 1 June 2006 (CET)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As stated many times already, WhatReallyHappened is mainly a news reference site, an encyclopedia itself of VERIFIABLE news stories that, in most cases, you WILL NOT SEE in the mainstream media. Any, and all, claims for deletion of its entry are completely ridiculous, for hundreds of reasons stated above and even more unstated. The only thing its deletion will do is make me SERIOUSLY QUESTION WIKIPEDIA'S CREDIBILITY AND UNBIASED OPINION ABOUT ANYTHING in the future. I'll say it again: how can you delete a website than is composed almost soley of LINKS TO VERIFIABLE NEWS ARTICLES. Give me a break.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well it seems this has become just another yuppie site. If you dont contribute to the site you dont count. Some people do just use wik to look things up, isnt that the main objective of the site. To GIVE OUT information, NOT hold it in. We already have enough sites that do that. I wonder Who is pushing for this article to be deleted. Calling the policies of Isreal wrong is not anti-semitism. That is tantamount to saying critisising the policies of the CRIPS and BLOODS, is racist towards all blacks. This doesnt not justyify taking it down. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.141.119.224 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.141.119.224_09e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.141.119.224">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - Clearly notable. Meets and supports all criteria. A mere "conspiracy cruft" reply doesn't hold water for deletion. The site provides valid and verifiable information with unpopular views that some are threatened by. You can argue it's accuracy but hardly justify it's deletion. Robotonic 05:09, 1 June 2006</li>

<p>STRONG KEEP - Rivero has said many times that Zundel, Irving, etc. must be onto something, why else would powerful people be so desperate to silence them? Apparently Rivero is also onto something 66.108.7.46 01:32, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> WRH is a fantastic resource of LINKS to numerous information sources, international and alternative news organizations. Sure, some may link to or hold views that are cautionary, however, there is no agenda, nor any sort of push of a belief system. WRH is no more slanted than the Drudge Report. I personally have not read any stories in regards to content that would justify removal of WRH from wikipedia. The whole concept of wikipedia is to let EVERYONE have an editorial voice, it is up to the reader to weigh the information, and then make up their own mind regarding it's merit. Please do not allow a handful of editors to make this decision for millions of potential readers. I value wikipedia and WRH equally, and if forced to make a choice between them, would side with WRH, since they DO NOT discriminate thought content. I feel that some wikipedia editors and/or readers should not have deletion powers, but that a warning or recommendation of impartiality may be more appropriate in this case. WRH falls into the same category, and is surfed just as often by myself as the Drudge Report, David Icke, Rense, yahoo, google and MSN news. Sure, I'm a liberal, but I'll learn. Just let me have ALL available information. I'm a grown man, and it would pain me to lose the OPTION of seeing different points of view. Perhaps we should ban the works of Mark Twain, I hear he has a character named N****r Jim. He sounds like someone we should ban from libraries entirely. (insert sarcastic laugh here). Deletion of content is the same as book burning in my opinion.</li>

<li><b>strong keep</b>: First of all, I don't know why the article was tagged for deletion. A little idea of why it was tagged would go a lot further than 'quick, act now' sort of stuff.&#160;:-) And also, just because I didn't edit the article doesn't mean I should have less of a say, I think. I may, for example, refer to the article and otherwise be interested in it. So that's another point. All of that said, I see no reason why this article should be deleted. The site does exist. There has to be some form of rationale on why this article is tagged to be deleted... it's getting rather silly, I think. Until someone can demonstrate an idea as to why it was initially tagged for deletion, I will retain my stance of strong keep. It does seem a bit strange from the outside looking in. Keep it, and in future give reasons so we can make more informed decisions - please. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaranRampersad_d7aa.html" title="User:TaranRampersad">TaranRampersad</a> 06:02, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>In reviewing <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, I do not see a basis for this article to be deleted or even to be tagged for deletion. And I am chilled at the flagrant disregard shown in such tags for deletion. This is larger than just one article, it has come to the attention of the general public. By the present process, it seems that there is no penalty for tagging things for deletion without substantiation, and is in itself questionable. With regard to this page, I retain my opinion of keeping it - in fact, I reinforce it. We don't allow arbitrary people with lit matches into libraries, and I take issue with the equivalent happening with the Wikipedia. Sure, we have stuff that needs to be deleted in the Wikipedia, but the appropriate process was not followed for this and deleting it out of turn demonstrates that the process itself is unimportant. That's my read. Open to intelligent discussion. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaranRampersad_d7aa.html" title="User:TaranRampersad">TaranRampersad</a> 17:13, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> And, you should clean up the part about anti-Semitism. Rivero's argument is similar to <a href="../../../n/e/t/Neturei_Karta_f0d9.html" title="Neturei Karta">Neturei Karta</a>. If He's guilty of it, then you should also consider deletion of Neturei Karta. Rivero's site is sourced at every turn. All the articles he posts that are of his opinions are highly referenced by multiple sources.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and <b>Clean Up</b> The What Really Happened article describes a very well-known website with many hits. If there are problems with the article itself they can be fixed -- and I agree that the article needs some work. However, what exactly will deleting the article from Wikipedia accomplish? Just because some people don't like WRH for one reason or another -- whatever the reason -- does not justify VfD's. Although WRH has some original work, it mostly contains citations and links to topics in the mainstream and alternative media that are of interest to a great many people. There are 1000s and 1000s of worse-written articles in Wikipedia, which raises the question, "Why this particular VfD at this time?" <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarpol_de4c.html" title="User:Earpol">Earpol</a> 07:42, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
