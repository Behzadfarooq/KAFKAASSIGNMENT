It's the unverified, uncited by a third party, initial block of text that I have the significant problem with.

<li><b>Comment</b>.This article is not a recreation of deleted material. No record exists of the deleted article so there is no proof to support this assertion. All calls for deletion of this article must direct criticism solely towards the content of the article. I believe this is only fair. Also, questioning the notability of artistic output is subjective and the above comment that "anyone... can do that" is not only false but constitutes an unfair attack. Again, one can look to the press release for Bapudi Films' "Rise and Fall of Irvine Meadow West" for a verifiable and reliable source. Another source is the OC Register, a major newspaper in Southern California, which discussed a screening held at the University of California. See <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/atoz/article_1173712.php" class="external free" title="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/atoz/article_1173712.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/atoz/article_1173712.php</a></li>

<dd><i>Also, questioning the notability of artistic output is subjective and the above comment that "anyone... can do that" is not only false but constitutes an unfair attack.</i> Nothing unfair or subjective about that. Anyone can make a film or some music. What makes it notable is if <i>other people</i> recognise it as such. For example, by giving the artist a major award, or by buying a million copies. As for the article in the paper, well local papers are full of inconsequential local stories. <a href="../../../j/l/l/User%7EJll_a192.html" title="User:Jll">Jll</a> 21:07, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Jll, wow, that has to be one of <i>the</i> most ignorant things I have ever read. Art can't be notable unless it gets an award or sells millions of copies? The Mona Lisa didn't win a single award, I guess thats crap. Sex pistols barely sold anything in their heyday, I assume they posed no notable mark in musical history. Did you know Kurosawa never won an Oscar? I guess he was just another hack with a camera, right? Anyone can make a film or <i>some music</i>? Have you ever tried? Ever filmed something for more than 30 minutes with a crew? Ever composed an entire album?. I'd like to see you come up with a <a href="http://bapudi.com/cinema.php" class="external text" title="http://bapudi.com/cinema.php" rel="nofollow">handful of movies</a>, much less <a href="http://www.bapudi.com/music.php" class="external text" title="http://www.bapudi.com/music.php" rel="nofollow">multiple albums</a>. Its not easy, and for you to belittle ANY artistic work is moronic and small minded. <i>local papers are full of inconsequential local stories.</i> Uhm, excuse me, WHAT? First of all the OC Register has a circulation of over 350,000, so its not just some local paper. Second, what <i>you</i> might find inconsequential may be life changing for others (did you even bother to read the news article?). You already made up your mind about this article, and that within itself should disbar you from paritipating in this process. -Japhar8181
<ul>
<li>Please don't call me moronic and small-minded - it is against Wikipedia policy to make <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attacks</a>. I cited two examples (that's why I wrote <i>for example</i>) of things that indicate that Wikipedia should have an article on the artist concerned - I could have provided a much longer list - e.g. a piece of work known to many people (Mona Lisa), having heavily influenced many other figures in their professions and built up a large following (Sex Pistols and Akira Kurosawa). But I don't see any evidence that these apply to Bapudi either. If you have such evidence then present it. If it is credible then I will certainly reverse my opinion. Should the criteria for a Wikipedia article be that someone has simply managed to make a film or an album? There must be tens or hundreds of thousands of people who have done this. The Orange County Register is a local paper serving Orange County. The story appears to be inconsequential because there don't seem to be any follow up stories, and the national or international press didn't pick it up either. <a href="../../../j/l/l/User%7EJll_a192.html" title="User:Jll">Jll</a> 22:46, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have continuallly clarified this article so that it will considered acceptable. Bapudi is the name used to identify creative works not limited to a particular media, it is inherently inter-disciplinary.

<dd>The notability guidelines are a way for an average Wikipedian to determine if an article's subject is or isn't appropriate to have an article about. The notability guidelines for biographies, companies, etc. are to prevent every interested party, no matter how tiny, from deciding to create an article about themselves. Without notability guidelines in place, the encyclopedia would be overflowing with articles about garage bands, <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">things that people made up in school one day</a>, etc. The verifiability guidelines also go a long way in helping in this respect. It's important to remember that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and should thus be held to strong encyclopedic standards. It's not paper, either, but that just means that the signal-to-noise ratio can climb to unsurpassed levels, as is evidenced by the new pages watch. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 12:35, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The inconsistency lies in your inability to explain what Bapudi is. It's a name used to identify "creative works not limited to a particular media". It's all well and good that you call art "bapudi", but remember that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, one which has demands of verifiability (I note that you have removed all third-party verifiable sources from the page) and notability. Wikipedia documents notable phenomena, it is not here to help promote non-notable or made-up phenomena, such as a movement/artist/organization that was created from an ancient text which has not been translated. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 18:13, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can speak to the issue of the grant from the California Council for the Humanities (NOT the State of California, as someone erroneously stated -- has anyone actually followed and read the link??). I produced the film in question, and wrote the grant proposal. The receiver for the grant was Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, as Bapudi is not a non-profit organization (501c.3) and thus cannot receive grant funds. However, the film was produced under the aegis of Bapudi. I would be happy to provide a copy of the film, as well as copies of any relevant grant paperwork to prove that this is the case. The California Council for the Humanities is a major organization, and I believe their support of a film that bears the Bapudi name should be sufficient to establish notability. The film has also been mentioned in the Orange County Register, rated 32 in a list of the top 100 daily newspapers. I cannot speak on the history of this wikipedia entry, as I have not been following it closely, but as the entry stands now, it is accurate and correct. As I peruse the article history, I come to believe that some of the vitriol directed toward this entry is due to the flippant tone in which the original article was written.

<li><b>Comment</b>.The fact Bapudi is not explicitly mentioned on the California Council for the Humanities (CCH) webpage is an error of omission. The CCH entry for the film simply makes no mention of the production organization behind the film. However, the webpage www.trailerparkfilm.com clearly establishes that the film is produced under Bapudi's aegis (see the links near the bottom of the page). I can use the grant paperwork to prove that the film was in fact awarded a grant. Thus, although the word "Bapudi" is not mentioned on the California Council for the Humanities webpage, the link between the two organizations is factual and verifiable. Some effort should be made on the part of Wikipedia admins to verify this information with me before considering deletion.Styliztic 06:05, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. That Bapudi has been funded or credited by the CCH is not necessarily the issue at question here. The issue is that there has been no evidence presented that Bapudi has notability sufficient to guarantee it a place in the encyclopedia, which neither your, nor the other above keep votes bothers to address. One instance of an example that might mark an organization as notable (according to our <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">guidelines</a> is being the subject of multiple nontrivial organizations, or being part of mainstream cultural thought, or having a major effect on the intellectual world in which it resides, none of which any evidence has been presented that Bapudi has done. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 12:41, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>.I believe the fact that we have been funded by the CCH does make us notable. The notability guidelines make it clear that notability is not the same as fame, but is more related to importance. I believe that being credited and funded by a major humanities granting organization (CCH is part of the NEA) qualifies us as important and therefore notable. The notability guidelines also state that notability is not a rigid wikipedia criterion, but a guideline, and that the concept is "somewhat contentious." Therefore, I must contend that Bapudi is notable because of its association with other notable organizations. I'll write more on this later, I don't have time at the moment. Just let me make it clear that I AM addressing the issue of notability -- our position as an artist with an NEA grant makes us notable.Styliztic 19:58, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>.I missed Japhar's last comment. I was wrong, notability is not a wikipedia guideline. Thank you for the correction, Japhar. This strengthens Bapudi's case for legitimacy within Wikipedia, unless we are to be deleted on the basis of an essay. We are a legitimate entity which has been recognized by an affiliate of the NEA. We exist for positive aesthetic and social reasons. What does our entry in the Wikipedia harm? Is there some danger that people looking up Bapudius, and accidentally finding Bapudi? Is the four kilobytes of data that our entry comprises going to fill Wikipedia's servers? This notability complaint sounds like an easy excuse for erasing an aesthetic which certain people find distasteful.Styliztic 05:35, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

Topics concerning the deletion of valid content, the lack of subjective criteria, and the benefits of even obscure content are especially important. I understand the urge to prevent pollution.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Kuzaar's last post says, "....the voters who have expressed a desire to keep the article have provided no verifiable evidence that it, as an aesthetic, exists." Kuzaar, please explain to me how Bapudi could receive a grant from an affiliate of the NEA if it doesn't exist? I can submit clear and convincing evidence to prove that a) Bapudi has produced a film called "The Rise and Fall of Irvine Meadows West" and that b) the California Council for the Humanities awarded that film a $5000 grant. Additionally I can prove that Art Center College of Design, one of the most prestigious design schools in the world (www.artcenter.edu) granted the film an additional $5000. Ask me, and I will submit our grant paperwork for review. So I ask again: Kuzaar, by what logic can you claim Bapudi's nonexistence? If you can submit a reasoned argument by which you show that a non-existent organization can receive a grant from the CCH, I will withdraw from this argument immediately and accept the deletion of this entry with humility. Otherwise, I do not believe you are participating in the consensus-building process in good faith. You are not participating in an exchange of ideas; you are merely stating the same nonsensical argument over and over: that Bapudi does not exist. A reasonable argument for deletion would be that our association with the CCH is not enough to establish our notability; the argument that Bapudi does not exist is unreasonable, as there is clear and convincing evidence that it does. Even if you were to argue that a CCH grant is insufficient to establish notability, deletion is hardly a lead pipe cinch. Bapudi's entry meets the three Wikipedia standards for inclusion: it is verifiable (the physical existence of the film and its grants), it is not independent research (or in fact research at all), and the entry is written with a neutral point of view. I would like to point out to all administrators that, on the basis of Wikipedia's rules and guidelines, there is NOT a consensus about the removal of this article. The article's critics have failed to show that the article violates Wikipedia's rules, and have not directly addressed our claim that recognition from an NEA affiliate is sufficient to establish notability.Styliztic 02:48, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have yet to see a verifiable source that names Bapudi the recipient of any grant. On looking at each and every one of the links provided in the article, Bapudi is only mentioned in two, and that is as a musical artist. You have persistently failed to provide any evidence for Bapudi's existence (except possibly as a music artist?), much less notability within its field. Further, the sock/meatpuppet flood that has persistently plagued this AFD as evidenced by each of the users that have voted keep (I point out that you yourself have less than 10 edits, all to this AFD) is outstandingly suspicious. I remind you that Articles for Deletion are not a vote, but a discussion in which Wikipedia editors attempt to decide what should be done about a marginal article. Lastly, I want to bring up one more point. You have insisted multiple times that the film, a recipient of a grant, is associated with Bapudi. I have yet to see any evidence of that, either. If you can link me to some third-party, verifiable information regarding my concerns, and if the flood of newly-registered users cools down a bit, I would feel less strongly about the deletion of this article. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 03:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> First off, I welcome user Netwait. Howdy to ya. I hope you become a contributive editor of Wikipedia. Secondly, what happened to the "famed bapudian canon" that this article was originally created off of as a source? Incidentially, what is the name of that local community college that's being worked with? Who's the contact there? You know, when I first voted, I thought this article was a farce, a joke worthy of speedy deletion. But, I saw efforts being made to change it. It's not even the same article, really. It's changed meanings and interpretations several times. And now... I still think that something is fishy. First edits being made here, of all places? It's odd. I've been trying to avoid thinking sockpuppet all this time, trying to assume good faith, but, this just doesn't sit right with me. I'd like to take this opportunity to cite UrbanDictionary.com. "Bapudi is the crystallized consciousness of Hegelian Mind, embodied through the creative excretions of an underground collective with operatives all over the United States. Privately funded, Bapudi represents one of the last schools of independent thought and action not yet assimilated into True Being. Inchoate and ever-flowing, Bapudi will knock your boots off. Bapudi.com is the official homepage to Bapudi activities, gatherings, and happenings this side of the Peiking Delta." The Wikipedia page links to Bapudi.com. While this is not authoritative, conclusive, or really reputable, it in my mind contributes to the many flaws that make this faceitious house of cards topple. My original vote stands and that's my final answer. Thank you. <a href="../../../j/j/j/User%7EJJJJust_79de.html" title="User:JJJJust">JJJJust</a> 03:26, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

He has deliberatly misinterpreted wikipedia by saying that notability is a guideline, when in fact it is neither a guideline or a policy (he has yet to apoglogize for his error). He has used personal offences against us (please see the <i>The Way of Bapudi</i> incident). And now he claims that Bapudi is <i>pitiful</i>?

For many, editing the AFD to talk about how Bapudi's article should be kept is their first action, which is something I nearly always regard as suspicious. That disinterested third party editors somehow gain knowledge of Wikipedia's regulations and processes, and come to talk about it in this AFD, of all places, is not only suspect but an almost irreparable blow to my attempts to assume good faith in this AFD. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 16:27, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

The CCH webpage clearly lists "The Rise and Fall of Irvine Meadows West" as a grant recipient (<a href="http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm</a>) and lists my name as the project director. The film's website (www.trailerparkfilm.com) has clear reference to Bapudi Films (see the bottom of the page). At least look at the sources we present! If you refuse to even consider the sources or our arguments, how can you claim to be participating in the AfD process in good faith? For the record, your issues with the article are unsubstantiated. The article clearly explains the nature of the subject: "Bapudi is an identity given to creative works that have included filmmaking and electronic music." It also makes no unverifiable claims, and it has several clear third-party sources. Read it!Styliztic 16:41, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>JJJust, did you check out my contacts at Saddleback College and Art Center? You asked for the information, at least be courteous enough to investigate it.Styliztic 16:41, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are the sources you have cited readily available to a third-party interested editor? Is there any way via public record that an editor can verify your claims? I'm looking for a link or something I can immediately see that correlates what you claim to reality. Bapudi is not credited with anything verifiable on that website, only a link saying "Powered by Bapudi.com". The hardcopy of the film is not public record, and does not meep <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Further, about your accusations of an ad-hom attack: I have not made an ad hominem attack, but rather pointed out to the closing admin that he/she might discount the opinions of those editors, being that they may be accounts registered just to stuff the ballot at this AFD, as the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Styliztic_7cbf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Styliztic">evidence</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Godelfin_34a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Godelfin">provided</a> by their <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Japhar8181_9851.html" title="Special:Contributions/Japhar8181">contributions</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Netwait_36ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Netwait">will show</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>:One more thing -- no one is using anyone else to proxy a vote. The fact that a number of people support Bapudi's inclusion in Wikipedia is not a trick or a sham. Is it unusual that we know each other? Would you be suspicious if six different researchers in a narrow scientific field knew each other? Of course not. Again, I believe the focus should be on the facts and the arguments we present (which you have ignored).Styliztic 16:55, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have not ignored your arguments. I have stated several times now, as in my above note, that the sources you have provided do not directly deal with or explain the article's subject, and in many cases do not meet Wikipedia's guidelines on verifiability. And even if you are six people who know eachother, a number of those people appear to have registered accounts just for the purposes of upsetting the process, and that is a fact that should not be overlooked. Again, if you would like to address the questions I have raised, one at a time, on the talk page of this AFD, I would reconsider my position. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 16:58, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response</b>: Kuzaar, I will answer your questions one by one. 1) "What are you referring to when you say Bapudi" Bapudi is an organization that produces music and films. It states this in the entry. 2) "What verifiable evidence that you have that Bapudi exists?" Our film has been awarded a grant by the CCH. Here is the web URL: <a href="http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm</a>. The CCH website does not mention Bapudi Films, but I have emailed them to ammend our entry. It does mention my name (Robert McLendon), and I am the director and manager of Bapudi Films. If you wish, we can put a big banner of the film's website that says "Produced by Bapudi Films". Would that clear things up for you? 3) The Search Engine Test page says: "Q. What is the minimum number of matches you should see if a term is not made up? (3? 27? 81?) A. Perhaps a few hundred, but this depends on several things:" We have more than a few hundred. Also, the page makes it clear that the search engine test is subjective, and that entries with as few as 15 hits have been accepted, and that, "some claim that this undermines the validity of the Google test in its entirety. The Google test has always been and very likely always will remain an extremely inconsistent tool, which does not measure notability. It is not and should never be considered definitive." 4) I can't speak to the nonsense that had been on the page. I didn't post the original entry, nor ask for it to be posted. I only came into this when I learned that the entry made mention of my film and my production company. As far as being credited on a film, I CAN SEND YOU A COPY OF THE FILM. It is a 40 minute documentary, with hundreds of cuts. I can show your our Adobe Premiere files. You let me know what you would consider evidence that my film isn't "woven from whole cloth" and I'll be happy to submit it.Styliztic 17:11, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now that I have specifically responded to your questions, will you take this discussion a bit more seriously, and stop accusing me of bad faith? This process has become bizaare and Kafkaesque.Styliztic 17:11, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize if the AFD process is any more protracted than it has to be. Ordinarily it is closed after five days, but there is currently a backlog. Here is my response, as copied from the talk section, to the above users: In light of the new clarity that your answers have brought to the situation, your organization does not pass inclusion guidelines as set out in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (regarding the musical aspect of Bapudi, or the <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> proposed guideline. The reason I've asked the above questions is to divine precisely where the article's subject would fit in, and in view of the newly revealed information, it doesn't appear appropriate in this light, either. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 18:04, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
