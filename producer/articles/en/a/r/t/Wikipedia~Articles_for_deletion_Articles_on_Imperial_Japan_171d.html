<p>It looks like someone took an old book on Imperial Japan and split it into a large number of article. All of them of the same quality and use: it sems that all of them cover data for past time. While pieces of them may be salvageable into corresponding articles with proper titles, in this form they are inadmissible in main article space. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:25, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>:My problem with <b>Userfy</b>ing them is that then they end up in the widely ignored userspace. There is enough work here that it needs to be someplace where people can stumble upon them and work at cleaning them up (which is what I did). We need the strength in numbers, because it's hard work. It would take me a long time (if ever) if they were just in my user space (or anyone elses).

<li>As I stated below on a similar comment, this makes little sense to me because (a) Charles Matthews is not contributing the foundation articles and (b) this is a general bibliography on the topic which makes no particular connection with any of the articles. I'm asking about the sources that User:Wlad k or IP number 200.46.X.Y or whatever he chooses to call himself is using. By this logic, I could write anything at all in these articles, and because Charles Matthews has a bibliography in his userspace, it would be considered sourced information. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 02:00, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Userfy</b>. You should take these to a user subpage as a workspace for cleanup. Because these are so difficult to read, they're too raw to be articles. Otherwise, I think you'll spend all your time fighting off VfDs. Userfying them will let you develop them, and post them back as new articles when they've had a basic cleanup. That doesn't mean you have to wait until they're fully done, but they should at least be a short overview of a topic. You could then post the remaining raw data onto the article's talk page to allow for collaboration without exposing the severely broken english in main article pages. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 03:59, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<li>Could I ask for clarification&#160;? As a realtively new user, is it <b>policy</b> that articles which do not meet certain qquality standards, but on which work is being done, be deleted completely until they reach such standards, rather than marking them with requests for assistance, and allowing organic development of the entries&#160;? --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 07:05, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Precedent says <b>no</b> that isn't a policy. Wikipedia is a work in progress and thus contains thousands of articles of a visibly sub-par nature. However as Wikipedia slowly matures, and its editor base changes, the average amount of patience that the user base has with such articles has diminished. "Modify in user-space" is becoming a more common and acceptable suggestion" but I think everyone continues to agree that we don't won't to lose material. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 13:41, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Userfy</b> all of them and work on them until there is a correct English version of this that makes sense.

<li><b>Keep, clean up</b> of course. Anything that is not worth keeping in its cleaned-up state is naturally subject to being deleted. I can't understand why people say 'delete' before those who would be interested in cleaning up, rationalising and editing the material have their change. By the way, the author is a prolific contributor, with a track record of digging up much useful research from contemporary sources. <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_of_Japan_%28additional_economic_and_financial_data%29_03e2.html" title="Empire of Japan (additional economic and financial data)">Empire of Japan (additional economic and financial data)</a> has already been substantially cleaned up.

<li><b>Temporary keep</b>: keep for now, but relist the lot here in a month's time, at which time any articles not cleaned up should be deleted. Since the current contents of many of these articles are baffling, this current vote's decision should not bind any future vote: the articles may be deletable on other grounds, once they've been tidied. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a> 15:40, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete or Userfy</b> unless more information about the source of this information can be obtained. I have two general problems with these articles. One is that much of the material is so garbled, I don't see how it can be reliably cleaned up. Sure, you can take some wild guesses at what the editor meant, but basically the original has been run through a distortion filter. How can this information be dependable? The second concerns the original sources. Especially in a case such as this, the source should be cited for verifiability. Somehow "This is what I think someone who doesn't speak English was trying to relate from uncited sources that cannot be checked" does not seem to be a dependable standard. For example:</li>
</ul>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Is there a serious suggestion that that the population of this province was 25 billion, or if the number does not refer to population, to what does it refer? Keep in mind, all this data is coming from (an) uncited source(s). --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 17:22, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Here is the <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_Imperial_Japan_bibliography_9f50.html" title="User:Charles Matthews/Imperial Japan bibliography">bibliography</a> that Charles Matthews has.

<li>I don't quite understand this comment, because Charles Matthews is not the person submitting the garbled articles. This is a general all-purpose bibliography on Imperial Japan. It does not tell us where the contributor's many specific facts and figures came from. I think making something verifiable and identifying the source of data requires a bit more precision than a general purpose bibliography in userspace that is not specifically connected to any of the articles. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 01:46, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, and resubmit if they're in English. My day job is checking English translations done by Japanese <i>engineers</i>, and nothing I've seen on the job has been as bad as these.

<li><b>Userfy / Move to temporary space</b> I have worked on a few of these articles and have two strong concerns.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>With the original text in Japanese and the contributor being a spanish speaker we are looking at three translation steps here: Japanese → Spanish → broken English → English. When working on the broken English I've been worried that I have been at risk of changing the original information. Quite honestly, I concluded that the integrity of the information was getting compromised as a result of the multiple translation steps.</li>
<li>The contributor is highly prolific. A look at <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_Imperial_Japan_4045.html" title="User:Charles Matthews/Imperial Japan">User:Charles_Matthews/Imperial_Japan</a> reveals several dozen articles and content seems to be added daily. The sheer volume of fixing them combined with the risks of information loss/distortion suggest that the issue of problematic articles from this source will persist and likely grow unless the Wikipedia community comes up with a way to actively manage it. I don't think we should delete this information, but we should quarantine it for further work. If we do nothing, I fear we'll be back here in a month having the same conversation but with an even longer list of articles. Even worse, I fear we'll end up with a bunch of articles that have been cleaned up from broken English but are full of inaccuracies because none of the translation can be confirmed.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Too many problems; complete rewrite needed, lack of sources plus inability to learn sources due to contributor anonymity and poor language skills, potentially copyvio, inability to determine copyvio status. If people want to, <i>they could be userfied and merged but the source and copyvio questions remain very pertinent, with no likely resolution</i> <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirectorstratton_89f7.html" title="User:Directorstratton">DirectorStratton</a> 02:20, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is nothing wrong with tagging such as <i>stubs</i>, <i>clean</i>. Suspecting a copyright problem is not proof one has occured. Futhermore, if these are <b>translations</b>, copyrights devolve to the translator, iirc, which makes Copyvio moot.
<ul>
<li>I should be able to attend to some cleansing as I continue working through Russo-Japanese War related artys, whereon, I have no less than eight references spanning six decades, about half of which treat some of these topics (Based on a quick peek at the Vfd nominees). I'm not sure why some Artys seem imcomprehensible -- apparently those voters lack contextual knowledge, and should perhaps exercise more discretion. Several of the articles are especially bad in that they are period focused (circa WW-II ands aftermath) without refering to prior or subsequent (to current days) history, but that merely confirms their status as a stub needing expansion.</li>
<li>Timeframe of five days might be suitable to a student's life, assuming one was prone to ignore classwork and Wiki full time, which I hope seldom happens. So expecting such <b>ultra-rapid</b> clean up by contributors that are also provinding family members would pretty much kill off a lot of slow developing wiki-improvements, as we do have lives outside Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Spelling Mistakes was mentioned above, to which I need to add two comments. 1) <i>Correct Spelling</i> is an abstract ideal. Language drift has altered <i>correct</i> usages a lot in my 50 years, and so too have meanings changed. Take the term <i><b>Wicked</b></i>, use of a phrase like "She's Wicked" refered more to 'being bad, only worse and evil to boot' than today's usage (not to mention the uses of the word <i>Bad</i> these days). One problem with my work on the Russo-Japanese war, is that there are five different languages involved: Russian, Chinese, Brittish, Japanese, and American. Then again, one author noted that there were no less than eight different <i>English</i> renderings of a single Russian Admirals name; bad spellings (and typos) in sum, will be corrected. Ususally inside 45 minutes if MY Experience is a reliable measure! <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fabartus</a> 00:43, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hey, just because someone doesn't have perfect English doesn't mean you have to ignore what they wrote. But these articles <i>have</i> to be cleaned up.
