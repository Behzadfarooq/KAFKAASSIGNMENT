<p>In this case, "award winning" is not a synonym for "dubious notability." It simply means what it says: award winning. I won the extremely prestigious Mensa Select award for Quadrature as can be verified by visiting <a href="http://mindgames.us.mensa.org/participant/past_winners.php" class="external free" title="http://mindgames.us.mensa.org/participant/past_winners.php" rel="nofollow">http://mindgames.us.mensa.org/participant/past_winners.php</a> and selecting the year 1993. I also recently won the 2006 Parents' Choice award, as can be verified by visiting <a href="http://www.parents-choice.org/get_direct_level.cfm?cat=c_gam&amp;award=AW&amp;awdyr=2006&amp;awdse=a&amp;product_code=p_toy" class="external free" title="http://www.parents-choice.org/get_direct_level.cfm?cat=c_gam&amp;award=AW&amp;awdyr=2006&amp;awdse=a&amp;product_code=p_toy" rel="nofollow">http://www.parents-choice.org/get_direct_level.cfm?cat=c_gam&amp;award=AW&amp;awdyr=2006&amp;awdse=a&amp;product_code=p_toy</a>. These are only two of the awards I've won for game inventing over the years. Every statement in the Mark Steere article can be verified. All of my games were programmed for online play by Aaron Dalton, proprietor of Super Duper Games as can be verified at <a href="http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=about" class="external free" title="http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=about" rel="nofollow">http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=about</a> where all of my games are listed as well as <a href="http://wiki.superdupergames.org/" class="external free" title="http://wiki.superdupergames.org/" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.superdupergames.org/</a> in "The Players” section under Mark Steere. A number of other programmers have also elected to program my games over the years of their own volition and at their own expense including Richard Rognlie of Gamerz.net, and Mark Okun of SetupGroup.com. All of their work can be easily located and verified. Innumerable articles, commentaries, and reviews on my games have been written in a number of languages including English, German, and Italian. The slightest investigative effort will produce prodigious evidence that I am in fact a world renowned game inventor.</p>
<p>Nothing in the Mark Steere article promotes my notoriety. Every sentence in the article is a simple statement of a well known fact. There are hundreds of relevant links relating to “Mark Steere” and all of my games in every search engine. There are no links in the Mark Steere article whatsoever. Every effort was made on the part of Pearl McPurry, the author of the Mark Steere article, to comply with the standards of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I understand the detractors’ desire to protect the integrity of Wikipedia. But in my case I am clearly notable (with regard to game inventing), verifiable, and non-self promoting. If the Mark Steere article does actually violate any of the Wikipedia standards, please let me know, and I will make an immediate correction. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MarkSteere (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSteere_3e33.html" title="User talk:MarkSteere">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MarkSteere_c547.html" title="Special:Contributions/MarkSteere">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>All of the sources cited in the Mark Steere article as well as here in the deletion article are credible, neutral, and independent. I have read the entire Vain article very carefully and cannot find any indication of even the slightest infraction of any Wikipedia policies therein. Likewise the Mark Steere article satisfies the very first listed requirement in the Bio/Notability article - “a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.” I am also a “published author, [who has] received multiple independent reviews of or awards for [my] work.”</p>
<p>There have been two citings of “Bio” and three citings of “Vain” by four enthusiastic members of the Wikipedia police club, yet none of them offers specific suggestions of how the Mark Steere article violates either the Bio or the Vain policies. A very thorough review of both the Bio and Vain policies only confirms that the Mark Steere article goes beyond the call of duty in complying with both.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> can you source the statement "published author, [who has] received multiple independent reviews of or awards for [my] work..."? You make a stronger case if you provide evidence. Also, what exactly in the article constitutes "a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field..."? The awards from Mensa and Parent's Choice? Beyond that, calling editors who have rendered opinions you disagree with "four enthusiastic members of the Wikipedia police club" is rather un-<a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and personally speaking it doesn't really make me want to go out of my way to reconsider my opinion.

<li><b>A Comment from Europe</b> Mark Steere is a very important game inventor. The reviews of his games at BoardGameGeek were viewed hundred, if not thousands of times, thus mirroring his reputation in the gaming community. Most of his games can be played online. I would, however, recommend to make the article a little bit more neutral (the photo should be much smaller) and to add some information such as his date of birth, his profession, links &amp; references and so on. BTW, I'm not a "sockpuppet", but Ralf Gering, the author of many articles published in the Canadian Abstract Games Magazine.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Rebuttal</b> First, thank you Ralf for your kind support. Isotope23, by “Wikipedia police” I was referring to the knee jerk group pounce on the latest biographical article, accompanied by rallying cries of “Vain” and “Bio.” Sure, I’d be happy to provide sources. But don’t you think that as the wielder of accusations that you bear some responsibility for citing specific instances of exactly *how* the rules were violated? Don’t you think you should research your own allegations and provide some sort of foundation? I combed the Vain and Bio articles three times in search of any remote basis for your rejection of the Mark Steere article and found absolutely nothing. On the contrary, the more I studied the articles the more they tended to justify and even call for such articles as the Mark Steere article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sources: Rule sheets for all of my games, authored by me, are published on BoardGameGeek.com, the definitive resource for board games. All submissions to Board Game Geek go through an approval process and are published at the discretion of the proprietors. Here is a link: <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/designer/2321" class="external free" title="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/designer/2321" rel="nofollow">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/designer/2321</a>. Here are a couple of reviews for you: First a link to an Italian magazine with a description and review of my game Byte which appears in the last section: <a href="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/boardgamevariant/fda/FdA30.pdf" class="external free" title="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/boardgamevariant/fda/FdA30.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/boardgamevariant/fda/FdA30.pdf</a>. Here is a recent review of my game Cephalopod: <a href="http://www.thedicetower.com/thedicetower/index.php?page=Cephalopod" class="external free" title="http://www.thedicetower.com/thedicetower/index.php?page=Cephalopod" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedicetower.com/thedicetower/index.php?page=Cephalopod</a>. Another article you might find interesting is a description of my game Tanbo, published here on Wikipedia by Steve Bordelon in June 2003: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanbo" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanbo" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanbo</a>. I have no connection with Steve Bordelon and in fact had never heard of him before seeing his Wikipedia article on Tanbo. I think this goes to the “widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record” since I invented Tanbo back in 1993. Besides Mensa and Parents’ Choice I also received the Games Magazine Games 100 award for Quadrature in 1993.</p>
<p>This is all just the tip of the iceberg. I can provide many more game review sources, if called upon to do so. My games have earned a huge amount of recognition in the games community over the years. I have unequivocally met the Wikipedia requirement of being a “published author, [who has] received multiple independent reviews of or awards for [my] work.” Many times over.</p>
<p>Now back to your part, Isotope23. Show me where the Mark Steere article falls short of *any* of the Wikipedia standards.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> first off, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> &amp; <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> are guidelines, not rules. I can only speak for myself, but authoring rules sheets doesn't really meet my definition of "published author", though you are free to disagree. The other guideline you referenced from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> "a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field..." is very open to interpretation. I'm not trying to be personally offensive to you, but I don't see anything that meets that definition. None of your games have been around long enough to have achieved the status of "enduring historical record" in my opinion. Concerning <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>... I've struck that above because the guideline I meant to reference was <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, citing <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> was a mistake on my part. Regardless, the only real claim I see towards <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is if "author" is carried over to the authorship of the game as a whole. I can't think of any similar case off the top of my head, then again I've never seen a board game creator article here before. I'm still mulling over if that meets the author definition.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 23:01, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Authorship</b> Authorship here refers to my authoring the original rule sheets. The games were invented. The rules were authored. Tanbo never won any awards but it is my most famous game now, 13 years after I invented it. If you ask any connoisseur of abstract games about Tanbo, he will definitely be familiar with it and will most likely have played it a couple of times. I don't see how Tanbo could be viewed as not being "a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field...". There are many much more famous game designers than me. Their work is instantly lauded upon release. Then, in many cases, a few months later you see the complaints about the aimless gameplay and the increasing frequency of draws. These games won't be around forever. Tanbo will.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> based on your statements above I don't see you meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> because I do not consider you to meet the criteria as an author based on the authorship of rules sheet. As for Tanbo, trying to construe the future status of the game as meeting "...part of the enduring historical record in their specific field..." violates the Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. It is too early to say if it has historical importance. I still favor a userfy over a simple delete because it allows you to retain the information on your userpage in case you meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> at some point in the future.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:14, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>I'm not construing.</b> The field of modern abstract game invention has barely existed until recently. There was Reversi a couple hundred years ago, and there were Hex and Y in the 1950's. The field has only become highly active in the past couple of decades to the point where there are now hundreds if not thousands of abstract games. The vast majority of them are unheard of and never played. For a game like Tanbo to steadily grow in popularity with virtually no promotion over a period of 13 years indicates an outstanding game with endurance. I don't know what your criteria for endurance is, but I personally don't know of any abstract games older than 55 years with known inventors. Part of Tanbo's success, and what I believe will be continued success, is due to its use of generic equipment: a Go board and Go stones. Every game store has Go sets. It's the most popular game in China and Japan. As long as the very simple concept of Tanbo continues to spread by word of mouth, and as long as Go sets are available, Tanbo will be played.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I would urge Mr Steere to moderate his responses to the issues raised here, and refrain from <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> on Calton or any other editor. Nobody would object if Mr Steere were to exhibit his achievements on his user page, as Calton does on his. The issue is whether or not his achievements are sufficiently notable to entitle him to an article in the main namespace. I myself am an award-winning engineer (British Aerospace Engineering Excellence Award, 1989), but I would not for one second regard that, of itself, sufficient to make me notable according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Having won a MENSA award is indeed something to be proud of, but, in my opinion and in the opinion of others here, it's not enough to establish notability. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 15:06, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Great,</b> another "me too." Wikipedia has a *huge* number of members. I'm sure the Mark Steere article was not the first to trigger a run on list of mostly negative, "me toos." If you think the article should be deleted, state your case. Inane references to "Bio" and "Vain" don't constitute arguments. I seriously doubt if the powers that be are even remotely impressed by the addition of one more zero foundation "me too."</li>

<li><b>Thank you.</b> Sorry about the prickliness. I don't have a real sugary personality, and I generally make my feelings known - positive or negative. This whole thing was started by someone in whose mind "award winning" equates to "non-notability." I found that obnoxious. Even less impressive was the migratory herd of bleating metooers. (I don't fault them for their difference of opinion, but *make your case*). I understand that my games are well known while I am not. But isn't that the point of encyclopedias? If you want to know the history of peanut butter, you look it up in Wikipedia, and you find that it has a long and varied history, having nothing to do with George Washington Carver.</li>

<li><b>How long</b> does it generally take for the real editors to get around to reviewing the article in question? This is all growing rather tiresome. To be honest, I no longer care if the article makes the cut. It won't have a significant impact on my life either way.</li>
<li><b>Observations.</b> I've learned a few things about Wikipedia through this "Articles for deletion" process. There is a subset of the community that monitors and attempts to weed out articles of questionable importance. Even though it's directed at me in this case, I view this process as a good thing. It keeps Wikipedia from being overrun with junk which would make it difficult to access the useful information. I also like the group response against personal attacks. It tends to squelch the escalation of counter attacks and flame wars which can essentially sabotage a forum. What I don't like about the process is that it seems to foster a small percentage of "bad apples" who are so horribly inadequate that they've made a career out of hunting down and attempting to minimize the accomplishments of others. There's probably a word for them here, like "wikitaliban" or something. I don't know what can be done about them. Maybe place a limit on how frequently one can recommend articles for deletion.</li>
