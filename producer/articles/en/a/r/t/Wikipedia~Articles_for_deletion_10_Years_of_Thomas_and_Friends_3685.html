<p>There's really something excessive when it takes me ten minutes to copy-and-paste all of the titles. Essentially, those articles are only "(Name) is a (media) release in (country)." and one or two short lists that are absolutely meaningless to the lay reader. No hope whatsoever for expansion. This situation can be summarized up to an apt "Who cares?" <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 13:21, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But these are videos of several episodes each, some of which overlap with other videos. All or most of these programs were originally shown on TV. These seem to be the US releases as well, so they're not even the classic British episodes but US "translations".

<dd>When I said it was duplicating material, that was an argument for deletion (after checking that all relevant information has been merged). This sort of material is far better as one big list, than lots of mini-lists.

<li>Care to show how they can be reasonably expanded? Will we be getting "development" sections or anyhting of the sort? Or are you simply stating as such, then letting this garbage rot while you do nothing to actually help? Really, if you're going "this can be expanded!", then do it instead of wandering around and just voting keep because it's easier to. Prove I'm wrong. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 12:50, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With that sort of attitude about it, it makes me less compelled to, for sure. But there's no episode information other than the title yet, no sales figures or chart information. I don't know where to look for much of that, and I try to keep from editing articles on subjects I'm unfamilar with, as is the case with Thomas. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But certain enough to consider those articles as expandable and of worth, of course. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 14:33, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Without a doubt. I don't know jack about math proofs either, but I know they're important, too. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:52, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Did you just suggest mathematical proofs are equivalent in importance to Thomas the Tank Engine video tape episode listings? These articles aren't expandable. What can you say about them that's distinct from articles about the episodes? You'd be reduced to describing the video packaging. Unless these were major major video successes, sales figures are very unlikely to be obtainable - this kind of data would be banal and unencyclopedic as well, even if you had detailed data (oh look, this video with episodes X,Y,Z sold better in the US market in 2001 than this video with episodes Y,Z,A,B did in 2003) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:56, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm saying I know roughly the same amount about mathematical proofs as I do Thomas the Tank Engine. These articles are certainly expandible, so your argument in that case is unknown. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:00, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You still haven't indicated a way to meaningfully expand those articles. I don't consider "I dunno, but I'm still voting keep!" a valid argument. Where are the editors to expand these if you're not going to do it? Why aren't they part of this discussion? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 04:26, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then I'm not sure what else I can tell you. If you're not reading what I'm posting, I can't say much else. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 10:44, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you have no actual argument, then? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 11:00, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure I understand this suggestion.
