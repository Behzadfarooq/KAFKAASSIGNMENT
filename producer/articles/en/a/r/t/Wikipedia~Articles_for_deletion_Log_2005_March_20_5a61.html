<li>There is one semi-official mention of the team, buried deep in a profile of the St Clair County district by the local Economic Development Alliance, which merely states the team was an indoor soccer team.

<li>I believe consensus holds that Australian grass is pretty much similar to grass anywhere else. Would you care to explain what your point is with this and other veiled statements of discontent you have made over the past week? It's not that I feel particularly attacked by what you say, it's just that I'm entirely unsure what you are trying to accomplish. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 21:28, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Grass is an important plant, and Australia is a large region. If you want to restrict wikipedia that much, you will have to do it by force of numbers, not by persuasion. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:00, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, and the combination of two important topics is not in and of itself important. This has nothing to do with restricting WikiPedia, it has to do with <i>common sense</i>. I dare you to write an interesting article about Milk in Spain, Oaks in Russia and/or Sidewalks on Cyprus that isn't redundant with either or both of the parent articles. I would not <i>a priori</i> oppose any of them but it seems obvious that, if created, they would quickly be removed for being <i>unable</i> to have meaningful content. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:20, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree. I'm a Finn myself, and rather proud of my country, and houses sure are useful things, but I still don't see anything particularly encyclopedic in this article. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 10:33, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>OK wikipedia can never hope to tell me how much milk is produced in Spain, by what kinds of animals and what particular varieties of cow, sheep etc, how much is processed into cheese and yogurt, how much is imported/exported, how much is pasteurised and when, what companies distribute it, how it is packaged and marketed, how much is drunk by children and adults, and if they drink it at breakfast or with other meals, whether it is typically added to tea, coffee, or other popular drinks, whether they prefer full-cream or skimmed milk, etc, the history of all these things, and their current trends... But maybe one day a more useful open encyclopedia will come along, and whatever information WP has managed to retain can be transferred into that. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:38, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly, because such detailed statistics as you're talking about would be compiled in a primary source, and thus belong in WikiSource. And parts of it, such as whether milk is added to tea, would be original research if anyone had bothered to do it. You're welcome to prove me wrong - just write the article. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 13:39, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a statistics bureau. I'm sure statistics about milk production in Spain, or grass in Australia, is useful information to a lot of people, but <b>it does not belong in an encyclopedia</b>. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 13:47, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>That's true, but I still have to agree with <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">User:Radiant!</a>. There's nothing encyclopedic about grass in Australia, milk in Spain, or houses in Finland that isn't encyclopedic about grass, milk or houses in general. Would you want hundreds of articles saying "Grass in eastern Katajanokka is pretty much the same as grass everywhere else in Helsinki" and nothing else? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 10:36, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your definition of 'encyclopedic' is obviously very different from mine. Of course if you make the focus small enough there isn't much difference from one place to another, but there are very important and specific differences between milk in Spain and milk in the rest of Europe, to say nothing of grass in Australia and in the rest of the world. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 03:01, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<p>While I believe that this was a good faith contribution, I believe that it is original research. I am not aware of this "spectrum" as a recognized set of classes in urban planning, demographic analysis or cartography. I'm willing to be proven wrong but the article is also, unfortunately, incorrect. The correct distinction between a village and a hamlet is whether or not it has a church. Likewise, the technical difference between a town and a city is whether or not it has a cathedral. (I did not correct the article because that would have reduced it to a mere list of dictionary definitions.) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 05:33, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as mentioned by previous two voters. In some USA states, a "town" is formally a minor civil division: counties are divided into towns, and a town may contain zero, one, or several villages or other census places. In other states, "town" is informally equivalent to "village". In neither case are the old British church/cathedral definitions valid. The edit history of the article's poster raises suspicion of verifiability, and VfD voters have already demonstrated that there is not a single international standard for such things. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 21:13, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, they lifted it from here, they mirror Wikipedia (see the backlink to us at the bottom of their page?). Yes, I'm sure. There are no listings for a Cunard barony in <i>The Complete Peerage</i> or in Burke's <i>Peerage and Baronetage</i>. It seems clear that the article results from someone confusing "baronet" for "baron". A Google search for "Baron Cunard" shows about 10 hits, all of them the result of Wikipedia's misinformation. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 10:50, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, see it now. You are saying that Samuel Cunard was a baronet, not a baron. Aside from the baronet/baron confusion, is the rest of the info in the article correct? Could the article be salvaged by changing references to "Baron" to "Baronet" and changing the title to something like "Cunard Baronetage"? --<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithfarm_eede.html" title="User:Smithfarm">Smithfarm</a> 11:41, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, only the notable ones. The Cunard Baronetcy could be argued to be notable because of Samuel Cunard. Now, the Wikipedia article on Samuel Canard says he is the 1st Baronet in the line. But the article doesn't say who the others were, which would whet my curiosity if I saw it. Seems like this improperly named "Baron Cunard" article is providing that information. So, <b>possible merge</b> to Samuel Cunard? --<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithfarm_eede.html" title="User:Smithfarm">Smithfarm</a>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, any baronetcy <i>could</i> be argued to be notable, though it's hard to think of one that is. This one isn't. His son was the 2nd and last Bt. There's nothing to merge here.

<dd>OK, I'm suggesting on the relevant talk page that we strike the words <b>1st Baronet</b> from the title to the Samuel Cunard article, as he is not notable for his <b>Baronet</b>-ness, much less for the fact that he is the <b>1st</b> of these insignificant creatures.

<li>I'd like to start a dialogue about this, but it seems unlikely to me that anyone would be open-minded enough for it to go anywhere. Radiant! has also voted for a number of articles related to rap music to be deleted and I don't think I could ever change his mind about this one. Your argument is that this page is "pointless". But the deaths of these rappers were all fairly big events. <a href="../../../c/p/s/User%7ECPS_4612.html" title="User:CPS">CPS</a> 08:41, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>7 deletes so far to 1 keep.

Loco José). Even though I doubt you know anything about these topics, you voted to delete all of them. I am not arguing with the other people voting to delete this, only you. I think it's obvious to anyone who is paying attention that you are biased against articles related to rap music. But since there are <i>so many</i> votes against this page, maybe your vote being discounted won't hurt afterall? <a href="../../../c/p/s/User%7ECPS_4612.html" title="User:CPS">CPS</a> 09:36, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well I guess your plea is better than simply blanking/removing/censoring other people's votes you dont agree with which you have a previous record of doing btw.

</li>
<li>CPS, if - as you say - you are arguing with no one else here, only with Megan, I suggest you do it either on her talk page or on your own. Comments of this nature are of no use to other voters and make VfD even larger than it already is. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">Vlad</font><font color="#989ACC">M</font><font color="#0000C0">V</font></a> <font color="#6F078D">٭</font> <sup><a href="../../../v/m/v/User_talk%7EVmv_5a55.html" title="User talk:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">talk</font></a></sup> 19:48, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>You are welcome to keep track of votes, but you seem to have forgotten the First Law of Statistics (namely, that if you put enough numbers together, eventually some relation will seem to appear that is in fact a random deviation). The point is, neither Megan nor myself are biased against any particular kind of music. Rather, we have some (not necessarily identical) ideas on what is encyclopedic and what isn't. That is POV and subject to vote, and that's exactly what VfD is for. So asking for our votes to be discounted is uncalled for (and equally invalid as the argument that <i>your</i> vote should be discounted because you are biased <i>in favor</i> of this kind of music).</li>
<li>Read the Notability and Music Requirements for details on why some artists get deleted even if some people like them. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 13:31, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>If CPS's definition of being "open minded" includes censoring free speech (deleting comments and blanking pages), discriminating on the grounds of political belief (ie. Libertarianism), and the right to vote (deleting votes from VfD) then all power to him. Too bad he hasn't argued anything in favour of actually keeping the article, now there's a thought. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 22:03, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<p>Allegedly a Japanese painter/small-time actor born "Saito Kagoshima" who moved to the US and changed his name. I have looked, and can find no evidence -- zip zero nada -- that this person exists. No Google hits (Web, News, Groups, or Images -- strange for a painter) and no listings on IMDB, under "Damon Saito Mattinson", "Saito Kagoshima" or his alleged great-great-grandfather "Yamamoto Kagoshima" -- and the external link leads to a freewebs text page with no live links, images, or evidence of the subject's existence. And why do both "Saito Kagoshima" and "Yamamoto Kagoshima" have two Japanese surnames and no given names?

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: I'm the creator of this article and this certainly <i>isn't</i> a hoax. I created the article because there is nearly no information about Saito on the internet and I don't have the time or money to create my own webpage; Wikipedia is quick and easy. Although I can't find any "proof" on the Internet, you could probably find Saito if you look in <i>any</i> respectable art-history book (usually under his American name, unless the book is focusing on Japanese painters). I also managed to obtain one of Saito's (less valuable) paintings when I was younger, and this is what inspired my love for him and his art -- Saito arguably impacted worldwide art style; you can't find many similar styles in today's art (long, abstract shadows coupled with slightly varied dark colours; in particular a very dark crimson and black). I ask that you please reconsider your votes, until at least asking an art scholar or some other knowledgeable person; or at least a trip to your local library.

<ul>
<li>Prove it. You haven't provided a single verifiable source, just a bunch of handwaving. There is nearly no information about Saito on the Internet? There's absolutely NONE, unbelievable for someone who "arguably impacted worldwide art style". No notices of gallery shows or auctions, no reviews, no obits, no biographies, no essays on his style, no examples of his work, no mention on IMDB, nothing. And, as I confirmed with a Japanese co-worker just now, neither his name or that of his alleged father make sense, since they're both made up of two surnames.</li>
<li>Provide an external source. Give me a book title (study or collection, preferably with an ISBN), magazine reference, gallery or museum displaying his work, art scholar who studies his work, title of a movie he appeared in, SOMETHING. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:32, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Observation: It would be easier to keep it than to merge it. First, I think the current stub has potential to be expanded by people like Kappa who have a clue. Second, the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electoral_system.html" title="Australian electoral system">Australian electoral system</a> article doesn't have a Donkey Vote section. Third, even the current stub has info that is not duplicated in the big article.

<li><b>keep</b> i think we should definitely keep this link. i have vastly improved my knowledge of the wonderfully varied world of Islam and Muslim peoples after reading some excellent thought-provoking material on his websites. We need to encourage more of this type of stuff from these youngsters at a time when many are being driven into despair and hatred of our culture through the actions of our very own war-mongering politicians. His articles are a breath of fresh air. i also thoroughly recommend everyone to sample some of the audio links on his site. the 'Nasheeds' songs he has contained therein are certainly unique and really put one's body under strain when trying to move to them. If this is traditional Islamic culture then i want more of this! Well done to Wikipedia for allowing entries like this to exist. They have certainly changed my life for the better and i will forever be indebted to Mr. Saleel for my improved understanding and music collection!--Aloo Paratha 11:37, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>One "trend" I see here is that only you and a bunch of sockpuppets want to keep this article, and everyone else voting sees that it is not notable. The second "trend" I see is that you have looked at my contributions, and then deliberately voted the opposite way I voted on all recent VfDs (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/CYNF&amp;diff=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/CYNF&amp;diff=0" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>), along with reverting my recent edits or reversions (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11466679" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11466679" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>). The final "trend" I see is for you to support vanity articles relating to Muslims, making all sorts of claims about notability which you refuse to back up with evidence; for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Ibraheem_mohammed&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=9293268" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Ibraheem_mohammed&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=9293268" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - There are no sockpuppets AFAIK. I made an appeal on Sunniforum for people to vote to keep the article (with the idea that many people on sunniforum were long time wikipedia users as well) because I truly believe that Saleel is a notable person. Instead of the vetern wikipedians voting as I expected, lots of people decided to register and make their first edit on the vote page. At the most there may be one sockpuppet, otherwise the rest of them are all different members of Sunniforum. <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHussaynKhariq_b8c1.html" title="User:HussaynKhariq">HussaynKhariq</a> 23:55, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

An online search of the Boston Globe from 1980 to the present turns up only a single hit, a September 4, 1999 real-estate-section profile of Foxboro. The article proper does not actually mention the Sage School. The school is only touched in a "Foxborough at a glance" sidebar, where it is simply listed: "Public schools: one high school, one middle school, and three elementary schools. Other schools: Southeastern Regional Vocational Technical School, private charter school, Sage School." The Boston Herald mentions it twice: in an obituary, and in an article on the Hearld's Black History Month writing and drawing contest in which a Sage School student was a runner-up in the 6th-8th grade division. On this evidence I say that the Sage School does not even have regional notability in the Boston area.

<li>If your rationale for your opinion is that "this is an encyclopedia," then why is it that other things that are called "encyclopedias" do not include such material?

There is a case to be made for that and people make it from time to time, but it is <i>not</i> current policy.

There is a second daughter who is also just a minor. Abdullah was believed to have been a suicide bomber, until he surfaced for an interview for the documentary "Son of al Queda". He is rumoured to have been captured last fall, and held in one of the clandestine, CIA interrogation centers. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 22:55, 2005 Mar 24 (UTC)</dd>

These "extreme points of" articles are articles <i>about the geography of</i> the particular country/continent, and belong in the "Geography of" articles along with all of the <i>other</i> geographical data.

<li>Delete. It's an Ad. Not notable company in Portugal. The Madeira Tecnopolo (technology centre of Madeira Island) is notable in Portugal, but that company no.
