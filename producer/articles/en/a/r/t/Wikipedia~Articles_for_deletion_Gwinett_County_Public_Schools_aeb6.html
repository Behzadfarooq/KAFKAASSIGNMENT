<li>I think creating stubs are very irresponsible. If you can expand, why don't you do it in the first place? You'll save everyone at the VfD lots of trouble. You can always wait until you have enough information before you start a write-up. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:25, July 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>You could save everyone the trouble by not nominating reasonable stubs for deletion. By now it should be obvious that school articles automatically survive VfD. Pburka 17:13, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"By now it should be obvious that school articles automatically survive VfD." <b>Comment</b>. There obviously isn't any consensus with school articles - they must be dealt with case by case. So how is nominating a one-line stub article for deletion unreasonable? And no, I don't stick around VfD the whole day long like inclusionists. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 17:59, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'll explain it, and you won't find it inexplicable. Creating one-line stubs <i>is</i> irresponsible, given that stubs give little or no information about the subject itself and is much more liable to be deleted. Especially when the creator clearly can improve on it, is just pure lazy, and would need a nudge or two to do so. Some stubs stick around like ugly ducklings for years without anyone capable of doing anything to it. Not that one doesn't want to, we can't because schools are inherently local-based. Creators start them then abandons them, going on to create hundreds and thousands of stubs and sub-stubs. I would call that irresponsible. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 17:59, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Additional comments</b>. Changed everything I wrote from "stub" to "substub". A stub is defined as 3 to 10 sentences in <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Wikipedia:Stub</a>. This (an original one-liner) doesn't even qualify. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 18:07, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"The location and name of a school district, the name of one of its schools, and the location of its website is perfectly adequate, giving as it does all the resources needed to expand the article." I find it very amusing indeed. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:21, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Don't you think "falsely claim" and "this were true" is something of an oxymoron? How can I "falsely claim" something that were true? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:21, July 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The phrase "even if this were true" extends the argument without negating it. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 17:00, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please don't equivocate. Is it true or not that some stubs lie for years without anyone extending them? So how is this "claim" false? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 21:52, July 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not equivocating. On the contrary, I am clarifying, for you, the structure of the argument which you misread as an oxymoron. It is not oxymoronic. When someone says "Even if gas was free I'd still ride my bike" he or she is not denying the cost of gas, but expanding the argument to preclude debate about points that don't matter. In this case, Tony is saying that he doesn't believe your statement about stubs, but that particular disagreement has no bearing on his opinion in this vote, so convincing him about how long stubs lie around won't change his mind. I agree with Tony that the length of time a stub lies around is immaterial, so I don't really have an interest in researching your claim. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 22:12, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I misunderstand you, I apologize. But he accusing me of "falsely claiming" something is charging me with distorting a fact than an opinion. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 22:27, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Um, I quote, "This usually means 3 to 10 short sentences."

If you didn't create this substub, I apologize, but there's no need to claim I created falsehood. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:21, July 28, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Anyone who can read <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Wikipedia:Stub</a> can see that I did <i>not</i> misquote. I challenge anyone not to find that sentence in the article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 21:32, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"falsely describe" and "even if it was" is an oxymoron. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:21, July 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The phrase "even if it was" extends the argument without negating it. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 17:00, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm interested in whether or not the article was an original one-liner. If it was, how am I extending a falsehood? Kindly refrain from misunderstanding me. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 21:40, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I quote, again, from the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubstub_c0ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Substub">Wikipedia:substub</a> article, "Substubs are usually created by people just because they can, then they leave without looking back." I would call that "abandon". Of course Wikipedians have a responsibility towards what they write in the article; they are expected to provide accurate information and act in responsible manner without trolling etc. I agree with the word "rights", not the word "responsibilities". Please don't deliberately misunderstand me - I don't have time for that. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:21, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If I may, I would like to call for apologies for claiming 1) I propagate falsehood; and 2) that I take some vendetta deletions against inclusionists. I find such "inclusionist" attitude irksome to the utmost. Get a grip, this is my first school deletion article in more than half a year. I also find it repugnant that I'm classed as a deletionist just because I put an original one-liner on for deletion. For goodness sake, please don't bring in political alliances into Wikipedia. I'm neither a "inclusionist" nor a "deletionist". <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:21, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Indeed. An institution with a budget of $1.2 billion, the largest employer in Gwinnett County, with over 23 000 employees, and responsible for the education of close to 150 000 children in 99 schools holds the interest of many a taxpayer in Gwinett County and the interest of the nation in improving the education of the 1 in 5 citizens of Gwinett County who are currently under their educational care. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 01:34, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please then post them somewhere where people know of them. At least one recently-made admin has been admonished, by school inclusionists, for a speedy delete. And then there's the "please don't bite newcomers rule". If there is <i>really</i> a change in Wikipedians' perception of school articles, why don't you simply solicit for a vote, then make it a <i>de jure</i> rule? School inclusionists have been known to sit around VfD waiting to snap, voting against any school articles, so I don't think it demonstrates that the community view at large has changed, rather, that "school inclusionists" simply made a more cohesive effort at obliterating school VfD. A <i>much better</i> idea will be to improve the standard of school articles.</li>
<li>And for goodness sake please don't bite people who vote against schools. This is getting disgustingly political. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 21:40, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As an outside party I should point out that <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a> is <i>ideally</i> (not always) undertaken both under consensus by the voters <i>and</i> by an outside party, or failing that someone from that person's side of the camp. This was not the case here. Myself, I might have paraphrased some of these comments (rather than completely deleting), but it's not like they're any bloodier than the other harsh words school Vfds seem to collect. As it is this unfortunate altercation seems to have driven poor Tony away (he's systematically deleted his comments).

THIS is what I want from the article. Yes. When a school has an article, add its name and a link to the list. If it doesn't, DON'T.

I'm all for including stubs of notable schools, and for merging non-notable ones into lists together, but listing school names does not strike me as very useful to the reader; as it is they could easily overlook that one lonely link way in the middle of the page and think the page was devoid of links. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 01:31, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
