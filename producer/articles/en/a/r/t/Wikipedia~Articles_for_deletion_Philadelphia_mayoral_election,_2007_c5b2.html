<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Cleanup</b>. Some NPOV problems as the article stands now.

<li>Just as <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> is not a valid argument to keep an article, <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> doesn't work to get rid of one either. All but the smallest elections will trivially meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> with multiple coverage in independent sources.

<dl>
<dd>I will agree with you, Neier, that this election probably <i>will</i> (future tense) receive notable published coverage from independent sources. However, <i>this</i> article fails to provide any of those sources, and in fact looks to be mainly speculation as to the possible future results of the race. My suggestion is delete unless seriously cleaned up, and then if and when better information is actually available consider recreating it down the line with proper sourcing. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 00:03, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And, that's where we disagree. A bad article should not be deleted. A bad article should be improved, per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">WP:DEL</a>. It seems to me lately, that AFD is being misused for many articles of this type. We aren't here to find articles in need of cleanup; but, to find articles which don't meet the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requirements of Wikipedia. Even if the article is reduced to "The city of Philadelphia will hold mayoral elections on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">11-06</a>." with a reference link to <a href="http://www.thenextmayor.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.thenextmayor.com/" rel="nofollow">the Philadelphia Daily News page</a>, it would pass <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 02:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(And, a second link, for "multiple" references: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/01/23/cq_2168.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/01/23/cq_2168.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/01/23/cq_2168.html</a> ) <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 02:51, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, if the article was reduced to "The city of Philadelphia will hold mayoral elections on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">11-06</a>", that would <i>not</i> meet WP:N, because the information being relayed through the article is quite trivial in nature. To count as a source for WP:N, it must be a <i>non-trivial</i> treatment of the subject. So just listing the date of the election would not count.</dd>
<dd>As far as AFD only being allowed to delete articles that aren't "notable", that is likewise incorrect. Articles that fail to meet policies such as verifiability and original research can certainly be deleted as well. As a <i>courtesy</i>, we normally give articles with insufficient references a chance to improve before deleting them. But articles with no references at all and which aren't likely to receive proper referencing can definitely be deleted. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:50, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> per Neier; Philadelphia is a sufficiently important city that its mayoral race is notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Philly is the 5th largest city by pop in US, and 2nd on East coast. Definitely meets notability and verifiability requirements. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshdboz_c913.html" title="User:Joshdboz">Joshdboz</a> 16:12, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I beg to differ on meeting verifiability requirements as there is virtually no verification provided in the article. In fact, the article attempts to analyze an election that won't occur for a number of months using information of questionable value and sourcing. "Definitely" doesn't meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> criteria as currently written. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 00:00, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If this was "<a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomah%2C_Wisconsin_b63a.html" title="Tomah, Wisconsin">Tomah</a> Mayoral Election, 2007" I'd agree with the nom, but as the US's 5th largest city Philadelphia's race is notable enough.

<li><s><b>Delete unless references provided for verification and to remove bias/OR</b></s> This article has a couple of serious problems. First, it has almost no references within the article aside from "www.thenextmayor.com". The article <i>must</i> provide independent, reliable published sources. Secondly, the article appears to be partly Original Research and possibly slightly biased. For example, the very first sentence says that "the real race (and the next mayor of Philly) will be with the Democratic Party primary which will be held on 2007-05-15," which sounds very suspiciously like a biased political analysis of an election that is still many months away. Finally, it talks about "polls" of questionable value that attempt to predict the result of a future event with no attempt at verification, which breaks <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL</a>. So while I agree in principle that in general articles about mayoral elections <i>might</i> be ok if properly done, this article isn't even close to being properly done and should be deleted unless these issues are addressed. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. I want to make clear one detail most of the keep comments seem to be overlooking. Even if you assume the election will probably <i>eventually</i> be notable and receive good independent news coverage, those facts must be demonstrated <i>within the article</i>. It is ultimately up to the authors of the article to provide verification of information, demonstrate lack of bias and verification of notability. The article as currently written fails quite badly on all three items, and should therefore be deleted unless seriously improved. Then, if a better article can be written in a couple of months around primary time, when newspapers are dealing with it on a more detailed basis, recreate the article using correcting referencing, etc. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 00:07, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree that this belongs on Wikinews. We should wait to write articles about elections until after the election is over.

<p><b>delete</b> Every city in the US has mayoral elections every four years or so. To include them all on wikipedia strikes me as extraordinarily silly unless the race has some sort of unique feature or reason for having great encyclopedic merit. Yes Philidelphia is a big city, but there are also lots of big cities in the US, and to include minor political races (face it mayors are the LOWEST elected executive position in the US) If we include this, we also set the precident for including every single congress race (state and federal), county executive, and state offical in the US, a few thousand articles a year for articles of limited merit about which reletively little beyond the obvious can be said without resorting to OR. 129.89.68.218 01:50, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, Andrew, that's definitely a step in the right direction. Based on the cleanup and the fact that the article is starting to include some good references about the upcoming election, I struck out my previous recommendation and am willing to change it to <b>Keep but requires more clean up</b>. Specific things that ought to be cleaned up are linking actual remaining facts in the article to specific references using ref tags (ie footnotes) and the article could probably stand to incorporate some of the published analysis of what are expected to be key political factors in the election. However, those are stylistic concerns, not afd ones, so that sort of thing would be better handled in the article itself and its talk page, not this afd thread. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>minor political races</i>? It is mistaken to equate the mayor of a metropolis with the mayor of a village. Big city mayors have long been recognized as prominent powerful political players.
