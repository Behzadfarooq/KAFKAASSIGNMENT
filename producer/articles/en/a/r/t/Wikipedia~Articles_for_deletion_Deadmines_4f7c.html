<dd>The term 'instance' means nothing to me, sorry. Not a Warcraft player. I see both groups of articles as essentially articles on game locations/maps/whatever. Delete the whole lot, or keep the whole lot. There is no need for haphazard application of standards.

<dd>Instance essentially means "level" or whatever. As for the application of standards, I don't know of any other way to go through this other than on a case-to-case basis. If you have any ideas on a broader application of standards, I'd love hear them. A single AFD for all maps/levels/instances listed on Wikipedia would be a massive and confusing ordeal imo. Drop me a message if you have any ideas on such things unless they're specifically related to this AFD. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 16:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If I cared enough about it, I would propose purging all game map articles from WP wholesale.

<li>Why not have an article for each level of SMB3, in principle?

<li>Quick comment here, a better analogy than having articles for each level of SMB3 would be having articles for each boss of SMB3. I know it seems like I'm nitpicking, but I just think it's important to clarify this for the non-WoW players. An instance is more of a special area where the major bosses of WoW are encountered.

<li>I am not stating whether these are notable or not. My reasons for deletion are given above, you may address those if you wish. Things can be of interest to a large community but still be unencyclopedic, such as recipes, game guides, and such. Those things are "all notable to the substantial number of people", but are certainly not encyclopedic. The main purposes of these articles seems to be to provide information on "bosses", what items they drop, level recommendations, listing mission objectives, etc, which definitely falls under a game-guide, which WP is specifically not. Several of them even have "Strategy" sections, which is quite blatantly unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 16:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I should have placed my argument for notability as a response to the first Delete vote; sorry. After reviewing a majority of the articles in greater detail, I agree that their main purpose as they now stand is to be a game guide. However, most have some background story-line information that should be merged with another article or should be expanded to warrant its own article. Game guide material (essentially the Instance section of each article) should be removed. -- Super Aardvark 17:17, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article specifically, though of course the redirects as well. I removed the redundant article listings above. How does my reason for deletion not hold?

<li>Keep: Your main arguement to delete these articles is, one they are not notable (that has been refuted by Super Aardvark), two they are unencyclopedic (how many other things on wikapedia are unencyclopedic?) and three, that it is more of a game guide, (this has also been refuted by stating that there is lots of pertinent background information on the pages too that coincides with the helpful hints.) Pretty much the only thing the guy who wrote this did wrong was go above and beyond. Now you want to delete ALL these articles because someone (who doesnt play WoW) thinks they are unencyclopedic.

<li><s><b>Keep:</b></s> Just to let everyone know, instances are not a "level" in the game. They are specific "dungeons-type areas" that are completely unique to your group. For example, when you enter an instance, it is completely empty except for you and your group (and of course the bad guys). This is to prevent people from attempting an instance and having all of the "mobs" cleared already. Instances are a HUGE part of WoW and are not there simply for level advancement, but the instances coincide with the history and the story of the game. For example, a lot of the instances are where you and your group/raid can relive some of the stories and legends that many of the players read about on the pages of Wik. It would just be a shame to see them go. WoWPlayer<a href="../../../1/3/1/User%7E131.7.251.200.html" title="User:131.7.251.200">131.7.251.200</a> 19:04, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There are so many articles nominated here that I'm not sure which way to vote, because I'd have to lump them all in one decision. A page like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maraudon.html" title="Maraudon">Maraudon</a> is primarily game-guide material, while an article like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scarlet_Monastery_4e0e.html" title="The Scarlet Monastery">The Scarlet Monastery</a> isn't. Similarly, if you trimmed out most of the Instance info from articles like <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackrock_Spire_71e1.html" title="Blackrock Spire">Blackrock Spire</a>, it would be worth keeping, or at least trimming down and merging into a list article. To delete them all would surely be overzealous, but not to edit these at all would be ill-advised.
<p>But I suppose that point is moot if you don't believe any of it should be here at all. This AfD's primary reasons for deletion are that it is a gameguide and that they have no references. For the game guide claim, I would argue that these are fictional elements in a notable video game, notable in regards to the game's design as well as to the greater Warcraft universe - not necessarily a gameguide. Inherently, <i>some</i> instancing and gameplay information should be there. For references, the game itself can be cited as a primary source, as well as other how-to guides, FAQs, and reviews as secondary sources, if it goes that far. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 22:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I came to this site looking for meaningful information about what Molten Core is, which I found in the article about the instance. I would have been very surprised not to find an article on the subject in an encyclopedia as big as WP, as I have come to rely on it for information on a great many subjects. Some of the instance articles could perhaps use a cleanup to make them more like information and less like a guide, but as they are now I don't see it being a great problem. Merging all the instance articles won't be possible without removing a vast amount of information, or making an enourmous article. I also join the poster further up, in saying that the person suggesting this deletion seems strongly biased against World of Warcraft for some reason, as evidenced by him mockingly mentioning "sweet loot for your raid" (which seems to be a quote from nowhere in the Deadmines article).

<li><b>Comment</b>: Your primary argument seems to be that these articles deserve to be included in WP merely because WP is "big" and has articles on a "great many subjects". However, WP aims to be a <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopedia</a>, which is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">not</a> necessarily the same as being big and having many articles. The argument for inclusion of an article must involve the properties of the article itself, rather than the properties of WP. As far as opinions go, I disagree with the expectation that one should find detailed articles on game maps in a general encyclopedia. I have no objection to pointing interested people to more specialised resources out there (which can be wiki-based even!), but we don't ourselves have to be such a resource. However, I would recommend people who have strong opinions on this matter (i.e., people who have voted strongly for or against in this AfD) to try and draw up some notability criteria for video game information. In this instance a little bit of instruction creep is preferable to a deluge of AfDs if it will establish clear consensus standards. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 22:01, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I find the idea alone of deleting valueable information from Wikipedia disturbing. Even if it were a game guide (which in my opinion it is not) why delete it? Many people visit this page exactly for the information given here. The reason I visit WikiPedia is not because I expect only encyclopedia material; it is because I expect to find NPV information on a subject which is written and reviewed by a group of people that figured it was worth the effort to put it out here. Sure, there are areas in the article that aren't very encyclopia 'worthy' (I have my own ideas on HOW to approach a fight) but if that would be a reason to delete an article, WP would be a very different place. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.171.224.124 (<a href="../../../1/2/2E/User_talk%7E12.171.224.124.html" title="User talk:12.171.224.124">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.171.224.124_d888.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.171.224.124">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>You, like many other new users posting here, should <i>really</i> learn some basic Wikipedia policies before posting comments here. You have come here in search of unencyclopedic content. Until that picture in the upper left hand corner says "Wikipedia: The Free Place-to-Add-Whatever-You-Like", this is still an encyclopedia, regardless of what you would prefer it to be. Though this may not be your point exactly, the argument alone for keeping this information because it does not exist elsewhere should ring warning bells of original research and lack of verifiability. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 04:50, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just something I've noticed since the AFD started is articles such as these seem to get worse over time. Judging by article histories and even just the activity on them in the past few days, most content is filled out by IP users with no interest in Wikipedia's policies of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:OR. Unlike other articles, these unreferenced level guides seem to get worse over time, rather than improve. During my time cleaning up/watching "List of Weapons in Halo 2", I found this to be the case as well, so this phenomenon is certainly not limited to any particular game. While this is not a reason for deletion by any means, it seems relevant to those who feel these articles can and will be cleaned up over time. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 03:57, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - but excise game-guide content. The background information and "lore" regarding the instances are appropriate for WP, at least so long as detailed information about many other fictional worlds remains. SS451 04:35, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Same reasons as mentioned above, their existence is justified, just replace the junk with more factual content. The Cruel Barb comment, for example, can be changed to mention that Thottbot doesn't report the existence of any other one-handed weapons acquirable at level 19 with a higher damage-per-second rating. There are TONS of factual, verifiable, and citable information tidbits like that you can grab off of index sites like WoW Guru, Thottbot, and Allakhazam. <a href="../../../r/i/o/User%7ERiotgear_cdd9.html" title="User:Riotgear">Riotgear</a> 06:22, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, I offer the following arguements: (1) These articles represent real knowledge about a long standing fantasy universe. This fantasy universe has been worked on for more than a decade by one of the most successful game companies in the world today <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blizzard.html" title="Blizzard">Blizzard</a> and it seems likely that this information will be of interest for many years to come. The information about the WoW instances is directly comparable to detailed information currently in the Wikipedia about such unreal locations as <a href="../../../l/%C3%B3/r/L%C3%B3rien.html" title="Lórien">Lórien</a> and many other fictional locations such as: <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html" title="Westeros">Westeros</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_quadrants_%28Star_Trek%29_6812.html" title="Galactic quadrants (Star Trek)">Galactic quadrants (Star Trek)</a>, etc.). (2) These articles are not game guides in that they do not provide detailed maps showing the locations of monsters or detailed strategies for defeating said monsters. Instead they by-and-large fit the idea of an encyclopdia entry so that when someone says to you "Have you ever heard of the Motlen Core in WoW?" you can say "No... but give me 5 minutes on Wikipedia and I'll have some idea what you are talking about". (3) Any attempt at merging would result in an article which was too large as there are a great many instances in WoW and more are added as the game continues. (4) There are a number of works of fiction that have been published set in the "Warcraft Universe". If all these instance articles are deleted because they describe (some) things only found in the game WoW, what logic would justify keeping the other articles in Wikipedia which describe places that also don't exist except in works of popular fiction? Should the Wikipedia be biased against unreal game locations vs. unreal published fictional locations? Note also that there are plans (which may come to nothing) to release a big-budget movie set in the World of Warcraft universe. I'm not willing to ague which article about which minor feature of a minor game should be deleted but WoW is (a) the most popular game in the world for a year now (b) part of an established fictional landscape which exists beyond WoW and into other fields of art. Wikipedia clearly has room for articles which describe fictional locations. WoW's fictional locations are, in my opinion, important enough to maintain their existance in the Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/g/l/User%7ECglassey_8e74.html" title="User:Cglassey">Cglassey</a> 20:58, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> these pages due to their extreme notability and encyclopedic use. The history and background information of these locations are fit to be on Wikipedia, but any so-called "strategy guides" should be sent to WoWWiki. Also instead of "game guide" section here could be short descriptions of the instance itself such as the names of the bosses found within and what kind of creatures inhabit this instance/location. Not to mention the ideas that people who wish to delete are suggesting could result in a somewhat worse situation than that which you sought to prevent. <a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETacitus666_5d9c.html" title="User:Tacitus666">Tacitus666</a> 22:35, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

This is an open encyclopedia and Wikipedia has been for a long time, well known as the place to get your offbeat, net-culture information, several people recently have been attempting to remove that and it needs to stop. So noting, people who are not a part of the communities, nor experienced in the information they are trying to dictate as notable, non-notable, encyclopedic, or non-encyclopedic really shouldn't be considered the authorities on what is and is not fact. These pages contain valuable information that is in fact, quite a notable contribution to the current days culture, at least in the realm of gaming (considering nearly 7 million active subscribers to the game). Deleting this would be ignoring such a strong sentiment and completely against the purpose of an active content, online encyclopedia. Seraphna 15:37, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I can't speak for everyone, but I have not said I "don't like it." I do feel, that while it shouldn't be "here" (as in wikipedia), it is definitely worthy of being "there" (as in another gaming wiki). Personal POV about WP content: if WP becomes a majority of articles about new bands, non-notable school, StarTrek, computer games and weaselly company ad-spam, then people will go elsewhere. All those things can be online, and maybe one solution is to have WP become the #REDIRECT jumping off point to other topic's wikis.&#160;-- <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDolomite_0b0c.html" title="User:MrDolomite">MrDolomite</a> | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDolomite_8f87.html" title="User talk:MrDolomite">Talk</a> 01:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
