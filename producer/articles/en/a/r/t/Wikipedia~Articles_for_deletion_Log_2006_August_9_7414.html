<li><b>Keep</b> Major news story at the time, and Levy's report had a significant impact on child care practices. This doesn't fail the google test, you just have to filter out other uses of the term - try googling "pindown staffordshire". Also, as it was significant enough to warrant a public inquiry, what do mean when you say its "not very notable"? <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 22:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Rename and keep</b> - This list is quite informative. I have wikilinked two people to their respective bios. There are many more people on the list who are quite notable (eg.

I am sure that most redlinks will be converted to blue as wikipedia gets more popular in India. The list needs to be moved to List of National Institutes of Technology alumni per mikka. There is some sense in having a list of alumni of all NITs at one place instead of spreading them to around 20 NITs in India.

The club gets 13 Google results (something is really odd with the Google results...it's showing 55,000 results, but only 13 when all are displayed) and Yahoo gives 26.

It is about an aspiring comic who is a college student with a blog (not linked) and a Facebook profile (not unlike millions of college and high school students). There are no sources backing up the claims in the article that the subject is "a potential comedic-genius" by Dead Frog, and "vulgar, disgusting, and unequivacally repulsive" by Red America,a conservative internet blogsite and forum." - the links only go to each site's respective homepage. And as for his other claims to fame, "Winning the Nickelodeon Super Toy Run in 1993" isn't related to the career of an aspiring humorist, and "Being verbally threatened by MLB All-Star Pitcher Scott Kazmir in 2004" is amusing but not notable unless it was the subject of a major news controversy (again, no sources).

<li><b>Keep.</b> Although I have yet to hear of Fein, considering that I know Scott Kazmir attended Cypress Falls High School in NW Houston, and this guy is from Langham Creek High School in NW Houston, I'd say this page just needs some facts or sites that can back it up. Everything else, besides the Dead-Frog (never heard of it) and Red America portion, that should simply be deleted until there are some direct links that can support the claim.</li>

<p>To be honest, the members of Last Comic Standing are "up and coming" comics, and we seem to not be able to get enough. More than contributions to comedy, we get their entire life story. I consider this not-half bad, although there do need to be some changes made. - Bacardi6868 3:59, 9 Aug 2006</p>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. I tried to find a way to save this, I really did, but the notability is not there, even after the cleanup. The references are weak, and nothing in the text of the article in any way asserts its notability. The closest I could find was "In 1990 the Christ Church congregation was the third largest in Sydney". Not only is this not notable, but the stat is unreferenced and 16 years old. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 02:09, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And I totally understand why you think it isn't notable. However, the fact that the article is written poorly is totally seperate to the fact that the church is notable. Just because we have a bad article on Wikipedia does not make the church any more or less notable. Personally, I'm working on Patriot Act articles, which are even <i>more</i> notable, otherwise I'd do something about it. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 14:51, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Had something in the article as it was originally written given evidence to its notability, it would have been tagged with one of the cleanup tags rather than afd. As there was no assertion of notability originally, it was flagged as non-notable and tagged for deletion. This ensuing debate is a process by which such issues are worked out -- and final determination is made by an admin after sufficient debate has passed. There is an improvement tag that can be used to tag an article as "under improvement", (I forget the tag), but I'd assert that articles should either first be developed as a User Subpage until they are adequate enough to enter the article section, or are tagged by the author as needing expansion. My very humble opinion anyway. --<a href="../../../c/p/a/User%7ECPAScott_7db1.html" title="User:CPAScott">CPAScott</a> 17:01, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>On notability: it gets mentioned (&gt;15 times over the last 20 years, I can only go back to 1987) in the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) a bit (usually as "<i>Rev Dr John Woodhouse, Rector of Christ Church, St Ives, who will...</i>" etc), but it also has had a couple of articles discussing the history and congregation figures in the SMH (they are now references in the article). There isn't much, if anything, in other big newspapers. In 1990 it was the third largest congregation in Sydney. There was a book published in 1990 (~126 pages, see the <i>Further reading</i> section in the aritcle), I think the church itself published it, but it is available at some academic libraries.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>, <b>Speedy keep</b>, the fact that for now there is little information which was translated to English wikipedia for this person in particular, doesn't meant that the article has to be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>: "unique" Google hits are a fallacy, and have no bearing on the importance of a given topic.

<p>A company or corporation is notable if it meets <b>any one</b> of the following criteria: 1. The company or corporation has been the subject of <b>multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself</b>. This criterion <i><b>excludes</b></i>: o Media re-prints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company. o Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories. This criterion <i><b>includes</b></i> published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.</p>
<p>Now, with that being said, if you look at the article Norman Technologies, you will see that the Charlotte Business Journal has written about Norman Technologies on two different occasions. You will also see that the company is unique in two different ways -- it's the ONLY American I.T. consultancy engaged solely in international financial transaction initiatives; and it is the ONLY non-bank representative on an important committee of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Chamber_of_Commerce_3c55.html" title="International Chamber of Commerce">International Chamber of Commerce</a>, which is an organization that has been around since 1919. If you intend to delete perfectly acceptable articles such as this, then where is the action on articles such as: <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intrada.html" title="Intrada">Intrada</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Coney_I-Lander_e8c5.html" title="Coney I-Lander">Coney I-Lander</a>, Force Fed Records, and Kiessling, to cite just a few? Remember, the "Wikipedia exists to bring knowledge to everyone". So, ask yourself, Delete-advocates, why are you going after this particular article with such vigor? Is it because you know more about restaurants and record labels than you know about international transaction software (which is responsible for processing billions of dollars of trade every day)? I guess it's not notable if you don't understand it. -- <a href="../../../m/y/w/User%7EMyWikiBiz_056a.html" title="User:MyWikiBiz">MyWikiBiz</a> 13:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comments</b> (1) Many companies are featured in a local business section or paper. Articles from non-local sources would have more weight. (2) Unique is not the same thing as notable. Is a company your size that works in international trade somehow more notable than one of the same size that works domestically? Sorry, don't see it. (3) There are a lot of articles here that don't belong.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not yet prepared to weigh in on the discussion, but it should be observed that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is only a guideline, such that it doesn't necessarily command the consensus of the community and in any event is not dispositive relative to any AfD and should not be adduced as categorically controlling. Whilst essays, guidelines, and policies that represent the deliberative consensus of the community writ large exist, every editor uses, of course, his/her own judgment—at least to some extent—in interpreting <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a>, especially <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and pronouncing as to the encyclopedic nature of a given subject, in order, inter al., that such pronouncements might be synthesized toward a propitious encyclopedic outcome. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:07, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "only a guideline" argument doesn't hold water. Several of our notability "guidelines" have seen steady and almost universal use for years, now. They all, in one form or another, embody the <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a>. A few years ago, this discussion would have had editors giving their <i>personal opinions</i> of how "famous" or "well-known" or "important" the company is, or centring the discussion around the author of the article. Now, as a direct consequence of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, you'll notice that editors have gone looking for books, news articles, and the like (i.e. <i>sources</i>), and are basing their rationales upon the extent and nature of those sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:31, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I employ <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> in evaluating AfDs, but many do not, and there is surely no compulsion that they do so. Remember, there are some who think notability ought not to be a consideration in any AfD discussion (with which propisition I disagree quite strongly), and we do not summarily discount their participation here. The role of AfD is to synthesize the views of many editors apropos of the encyclopedic nature of a given subject, such that the criteria used by editors might be conflated toward the production of a consensus, irrespective of guidelines that reflect the views of most editors. I find <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and its progeny to follow directly from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, such that the former ought, IMHO, to be tagged as <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLICY_ce11.html" title="WP:POLICY">policy</a>, in order that some frequently-repeated AfD discussions should be avoided, but in the absence of such tagging, it's not reasonable to dismiss cursorily any argument that relies on an uncommon interpretation of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or on criteria wholly different from those of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:03, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Really, and why is that? First, the company is not notable (that they paid money to someone to write an article for them to improve their exposure simply means that they paid money to someone to write an article for them), it certainly does not reflect on their notability. Also, as noted in the nom, the article reads like an advert. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 14:15, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - One reason the article reads like an advert is that its "importance" was questioned. In order to communicate the importance of a company, one often looks to superlatives such as "the biggest", or "the only". Personally, I thought that the fact the company lists among its clients such notable institutions as Barclays, BB&amp;T, PNC Bank, SunTrust, and Wachovia, would serve as enough indication that the company is important. Would each of these gigantic banks be comfortable working with an unimportant, non-notable vendor? Seems coincidental or lucky for Norman Technologies, if that were the case. Either that, or they lied on their website about their client roster. Take a look at the first few paragraphs of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Microsystems_c3ed.html" title="Sun Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>. Doesn't read like an advertisement, because you "assume" that you know Sun to be notable and not needing to defend its importance. On the other hand, read the first six sentences of <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_916a.html" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>. It very much reads like an advertisement. Just so we understand, is it okay for an article to read like an advertisement only if it is a delicious drink that many Wikipedians enjoy, but that articles about drab businesses in the information and financial transaction software implementation category may not read as an advert? -- <a href="../../../m/y/w/User%7EMyWikiBiz_056a.html" title="User:MyWikiBiz">MyWikiBiz</a> 19:50, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's a good little synopsis of an IT firm, and it explains two interesting things about them, particularly their representation to the international chamber of commerce. I honestly don't care if it *is* advertising in some vague twisted sense. It's extremely likely that some day someone will want to know more something about this company before they do business with them, and they're going to look for that information on the web. And guess what, if this article survives, Wikipedia will actually be able to inform them! Fancy that, Wikipedia informing someone who needs factual, unbiased information!

<li><b>Keep</b>. WP:CORP explicitly says that "This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations." The newspaper coverage does not fall into the prohibited category, so policy says to keep this.

<li><b>Delete</b>, this article does not meet notability requirements, and this is a bad precedent to allow people to be paid to write articles, meaning they have a vested interest in creating the article and making sure it's kept.

<li>If there is an issue of credibility for <i>any</i> reason then the solution is to insist on trustable sources (ie the verifyability <b>POLICY</b>) which this article lacks for its elements of noteability. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 03:20, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The newspaper coverage is from a local-business paper, which as far as I'm concerned puts it on a par with college papers and only a step above press releases as far as its ranking on the reliability scale.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Gingo100 and the five pillars. I wonder when I see someone arguing against any well written article whether the person(s) have some pov agenda of their own outside the main mission of this project being a repository for knowledge and quick reference.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;At the least an article like this gives wikipedia visibility due to web searching —a good thing for the other million plus articles—believe it or not there are still a great majority of people out there who have never heard of any wiki including wikipedia.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;As to notablility, any concern that as in the relatively brief history of this company that can grow a new enterprise to 26 employees in such a short time is undergoing explosive growth. By rough rule of thumb assuming unskilled labor that indicates annual sales of well over three million and since they're IT and professionals (taking into account benefits, retirement, medical and such derivative overhead costs needed to maintain a company) we can safely posit well over five million per annum, even in the cheaper labor market of the south US. That they are privately held and capitalized (!) vice being a public corporation is far more to their credit and notability by some significant exponential factor than some market funded enterprise. Try <i>your business plan</i> on the local bank and see how easy it is to get loans and lines of credit to spread out operations costs. Not!!!<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;Ask your local mayor if he'd like a company like that on his tax base. Huh! We're not discusing your local retailer with three-quarters of it's employees in a part-time/non-benefits hiring category.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;Not every product can be easily described or packaged, especially when corportate confidentiality and overall security become major peices—ask your local Law firm or CPA for a list of services for examples—but don't doubt that such intangibles are important or necessary to many if not all service businesses.

<p>The album in question was always entitled "Body Count", even prior to the deletion of "Cop Killer." A glance at a 1992 Billboard magazine would easily settle the point, but I don't have one handy. Also, a <a href="http://music.search.ebay.com/cop-killer_Music_W0QQfkrZ1QQfromZR8QQsacatZ11233" class="external text" title="http://music.search.ebay.com/cop-killer_Music_W0QQfkrZ1QQfromZR8QQsacatZ11233" rel="nofollow">search on ebay</a> for the song "Cop Killer" yields only hits for the CD entitled <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_Count_%28album%29_16b8.html" title="Body Count (album)">Body Count</a> This is easily verifiable and should not be a dispute except for an anonymous user who continues to revert the deletion proposal.<a href="../../../d/j/a/User%7EDJac75_637e.html" title="User:DJac75">St. Jimmy</a> 04:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom (i.e. nom is entirely historically correct). Even if this were true, a more appropriate place to put the information would be in the article about the album as it later became as that's the one that's been around longer, surely. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 06:53, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as nom is entirely correct. Sorry 80.134.154.192, but I bought the album the day it came out and my version (with <i>Cop Killer</i> on it) is called <i>Body Count</i>... There was no discernable difference between the original version of the <i>Body Count</i> album with <i>Cop Killer</i> and the version without beyond the obvious change in the tracks (and the cover art)... title of album did not change though. From looking at the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Talk%7EBody_Count_%28album%29_d44b.html" title="Talk:Body Count (album)">Talk:Body Count (album)</a>, 80.134.154.192 needs to read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:47, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Per the nom's original statement (good research btw! I'd nom you for a barnstar for that one!). I also picked up that album for a birthday present from a friend, and Isotope23 is entirely correct on both counts (album and that the anon needs to be a bit more <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">Civil</a> --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 17:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per all above, there is no record of the eponymous album ever being released under the name "Cop Killer." Nom is certainly correct. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 18:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This appears to be a case of an album that has the name "Body Count" but is referred to by some fans as "Cop Killer". If that's the case, then rather than deleting this, we should <b>redirect</b> it to the official title of the album. (Normally disambiguated names are not useful redirects, but examples like "(album)", "(film)", and "(song)" are common enough on Wikipedia that it is plausible that people will use titles like this as search terms. And redirects are cheaper than disputes.) — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Redirect is appropriate, regardless of whether the anon is correct (He's not. Note, in particular, that Amazon has no used CD listing for <i>Cop Killer</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Unlike lists of non-fictional people, lists of fictional people are far easier to be encylopedic. While for example a list of real-life eccentrics (deleted recently) isn't encyclopedic due to there not being reliable sources declaring particular people as "eccentric", in fiction eccentric characters are usually *intended* to be so. The same applies to spoiled brats in this case: thus such a list is verifiable. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 13:31, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> it's not necessarily easy to source as it's a list that could be open to interpretation and as it's a character trait rather than a physical feature it's going to have inherent subjectivity.

<dd>Nevertheless, what constitutes a "spoiled brat" is strictly, irrevocably, nothing but a matter of opinion. I think <i>most</i> kids in America are spoiled brats, but obviously, their parents would disagree with that assessment. (Would you consider all the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugrats.html" title="Rugrats">Rugrats</a> kids to be spoiled brats?

It has nothing to do with the value of the list or how interesting it is... If it is not sourced it should go and I suspect that editors would be hard pressed to find sources that backup the contention that most of the included characters on this list "speak rarely".--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>...or List of characters who speak a lot&#160;:-) I perfectly agree. And even if someone can prove that the character speaks "rarely" there still is a problem with criteria for inclusion, because there are infinetly many silent characters.

In this case, three books by the subject are listed on Amazon, one ranking somewhere about 2.4 millionth in sales, the other two reaching 800K or so.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure how "going on a national tour" in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is usually interpreted; it certainly wasn't their tour, they were opening for a segment (Canada) of a longer tour by a major act. I've seen plenty of opening acts who were just hired to fill some space and not detract from the main act. <a href="http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2006/01/22/1406150.html" class="external text" title="http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2006/01/22/1406150.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a review of the Duff show in London, Ontario, with all of 3 lines at the bottom on Hello Operator, one of which came from one of the band members being local. <a href="http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/story.html?id=29b8b3bf-5711-4ff3-98cd-b41ce7a53ed5&amp;k=50850" class="external text" title="http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/story.html?id=29b8b3bf-5711-4ff3-98cd-b41ce7a53ed5&amp;k=50850" rel="nofollow">This review</a> mentions the fact that they opened the Calgary show, but otherwise ignores them. As for multiple appearances in media... well, the Hilary Duff tour press release got covered a few places, yeah. But if you look down the list of sites you get googling, say, "hello operator fan" - there is just no buzz about these guys. And they were supposed to have an album out 'in the spring', and it hasn't appeared. They are a MySpace band.... --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 16:06, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>There was discussion at WP:MUSIC regarding that, and nothing came of it in terms of forcing interpretation to headlining shows. Even without the touring, however, they reach the multiple media mentions guideline for WP:MUSIC, as I've demonstrated above. Buzz is irrelevant, it's about finding verifiable information to assert the nobility in this case. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:11, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. As it can be seen below, the debate was not primarily focused on the noteworthiness of the subject of the article but a lot of the keep recommendations were " <i>per Rebecca</i> ", and indeed, JzG also implied that he would have suggested a delete under more peaceful circumstances. For the record CSD G4 does not hold, as you can see by reading the restored deleted versions from October 2005 that at that stage the subject was only a university leader, but now she is a nationwide leader of NUS - G4 applies to things recreated with similar (or worse) content than when it was previously deleted. Perhaps a proper debate at a later time when we are all focussed on content would be prudent. Feel free to inquire about my decision.

<li><b>Comment</b> The AfD'd article was substantially different. It was deleted without prejudice, as I understand it. Also, the article does make an assertion of notability; "vandalism" isn't a reason to delete an article and what you allege wasn't vandalism anyway. The prod tag says, "<b>You may remove this message if you</b> improve the article, or if you otherwise <b>object to deletion of the article for any reason</b>." The person who removed the prod provided references on the talk page. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 08:06, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>This makes no sense, as there is absolutely no way the (relatively strict) G4 criteria can be attached to this article. An attack article was created in October 2005 about Jackson, who was then president of the student union at the University of Sydney. It was, entirely justifiably, deleted. In the meantime, Jackson has become president of the National Union of Students, which has put her on the national stage, and a neutral, verifiable article has been written about her. This is not a situation covered in any way, shape or form, by G4. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 09:01, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not confused. I [edit: could probably] agree that the office is notable. The subject is not notable, not yet, anyway. Those two are quite distinct, just like separate legal identity of a company and its members. My reference to the relative importance of the NUS is that Australian student politics is a subset of (&gt;)Australian politics&gt;Australian people&gt;Australia&gt;Southern Hemisphere&gt;the world, and it's important to keep that in perspective. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a></li>

<li>There's no specific "Paedophilia Act" or anything like it in the 1983 table of statutes. Might be a name given popularly to parts of another Act - perhaps Mental Health Act 1983 - but can't find any evidence for it, and that act doesn't appear to cover paedophilia. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 09:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not Notable. He has won an awful lot of academic awards, but as far as I can verify online he has had one short play produced, as part of a set of four, in an Off-Broadway theater (Playwright's Horizons) in 1995; and he had a (presumably) short play or piece published in an anthology published in 1996. (I wasn't able to find the other groups or venues he lists, although one of them might be a children's theatre group in NYC.) And he has made some short web films, one of which <i>almost</i> won a film award given out by the NYU film department. Maybe I am being a little harsh, but I don't think this guy merits an article at this point. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 09:49, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Oppose</s> Keep</b>. Practically every software genre has both "List of" and "Comparison of" pages; this page combines both. It follows the same style as the others, and is totally in keeping with existing Wikipedia practice. Most of the links may currently be external, but I suggest that this is because the subject of fax software is relatively undeveloped in Wikipedia, and many of them will be turned into internal links as time goes by. Of course, some of those links may be unnecessary; maybe the list could be pruned a bit. If this page is deemed to be violating the policy quoted, then so are hundreds of other long-standing pages which as far as I can see are very active and have never been proposed for deletion. I contributed most of the content on that page. <a href="../../../r/w/x/User%7ERwxrwxrwx_2df2.html" title="User:Rwxrwxrwx">Rwxrwxrwx</a> 12:14, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Reality show contestants are not notable unless they go on to do something notable on their own.She has. Taylor's preformed at the world famous Grand Ole Opry with Riders In The Sky.Isn't just being on the show doing something notable?She made it by herself.No one just said well your a cute little girl you made it.She's been on TV on a hit show .Finalist.For a millon bucks.I agree with everyonelse about why this article should be kept."Reality show contestants are not notable unless they go on to do something notable on their own"would have to then apply for all AGT aticles for finalists to be deleted.Which should not happen just because you don't like Taylor Ware. <a href="../../../w/e/7/User%7EWe7888_cef9.html" title="User:We7888">we7888</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree with the above comment. Furthermore, what is the rationale for deleting this artice? What is wrong with it, or why is it inappropriate? If the article has been nominated for deletion simply because someone doesn't like Taylor Ware or doesn't like the creator of the article (which happens to be me), that's a lame excuse. Have the courage to tell us why the article should be deleted. If the article violates any of Wikipedia's policies or standards, please state what they are so that they can be corrected if possible. Otherwise, if this article deserves deletion, I think it will be followed by a flood of nominations for other articles to be deleted, articles that need to be on Wikipedia. By the way, I have no personal connection with Taylor. I simply wrote the article because I thought it was needed. I've contributed to articles about other AGT finalists and to other articles in general. I haven't written anything negative about any of them. I did remove a few non-NPOV comments, and if anyone sees any non-NPOV comments in Taylor Ware's article, by all means modify them. I do suspect that my removal of non-NPOV material from other contestants' articles is what prompted someone to nominate the Taylor Ware article for deletion. If that's true, my only response is: grow up. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWard3001_c2d6.html" title="User:Ward3001">Ward3001</a> 23:31, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - To the person who said the article doesn't have enough information: That's why it's called a "stub" until more information can be obtained. AGT finalists are not allowed to communicate with the media (including Wikipedia or its contributors) until the competition is complete. The info in the article is the main info that is publicly available. To my knowledge there are no photos of her available that are not copyrighted. More information will certainly be added as it becomes available. Until then, the "not enough information" argument isn't sufficient grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWard3001_c2d6.html" title="User:Ward3001">Ward3001</a> 18:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Well I kind of agree with the person who says this aritcle doesn't have enough information, but I think it should stay here. Over time, as she gets more popular, more information will be added. If Wikipedia gives this article a chance, this could be a good article. I also agree with the above comment. Since she is under the age of majority, there is limited information that we can post online. I think this article deserves a chance. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa123123123_8f07.html" title="User:Theresa123123123">theresa123123123</a> 23:56, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello Wikipedia folks. It's Paul Wright(computer scientist) here. The original URL (Paul Wright) is better now with a list of additional notable Paul Wrights. More the better :) If you want to delete this new page as well you are welcome to do so, the information contained within it is freely available elsewhere and easily googlable so it will not make much difference to myself or your readers either way. Not sure why the people that are doing this are not identifiable though? Please note that I have identified myself, including at the original creation of the article. It also seems strange for the anonymous initiator of this deletion to first add a link to my CV and then list the page for deletion immediately afterwards? Anyway, all the data in the article is correct and verifiable and passed the various tests including notability 6 months ago when it was created and accepted then; so I am happy with it, but if you would like to delete it please go ahead. Best wishes and keep up the good work but please encourage users to identify themselves so that the community can become more credible. Cheers, Paul Wright.</li>

<p><b>Leave</b> As an active professor she holds some interest to students who might wish to take her class and want to know more about her. A wikipedia search would aid them in that. She was the former Town Moderator of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_London_55ad.html" title="New London">New London</a> for a number of years. I'm not sure to what extent local government officials are permitted to be on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Hilary Cleveland made both national and local news when she spoke strongly against Bush and supported Howard Dean in the primary (her late husband <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Colgate_Cleveland_3467.html" title="James Colgate Cleveland">James Colgate Cleveland</a> was a Republican Congressman and the family were (perhaps still are) friends with the elder President Bush). She later became the head of the GOP Women for Kerry steering commitee #REDIRECT [<a href="http://www.pww.org/article/view/5779/1/232/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pww.org/article/view/5779/1/232/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>] though she only had brief involvement with the campaign. She is by no means an active Republican lobbyist. Featured in Newsweek, Boston Globe, among other publications: <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/bush/articles/2004/09/12/a_telling_shift_in_allegiance?mode=PF" class="external free" title="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/bush/articles/2004/09/12/a_telling_shift_in_allegiance?mode=PF" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/bush/articles/2004/09/12/a_telling_shift_in_allegiance?mode=PF</a> <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3339604/" class="external free" title="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3339604/" rel="nofollow">http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3339604/</a></p>

<dd>In light of new information and revision to the bio with references, it does appear that I missed something: Whilst I don't think she would qualify as notable by being a professor, nor by being anti-bush republican again is not particularly notable. However her active involvement with Stern and Kerry, especially as head of GOP for women probably swings it for me. I would now move to stay the execution. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 01:36, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I imagine few if any of these bands and people have colours in their names; they'd have names of colours in their names. Unless they use symbols like the Artist formerly known as Prince. And a "List of bands and singers with names of colours in their names" strikes me as indiscriminate. Some of these are unrelated to the colour- if a band called itself Evergreen Terrace, I'd suspect it will be because of the Simpsons and not because they like the colour green. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 16:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> with the current, much better title given by Dab, Ethnic classification of the Scythians, this article (or one like it) could be vastly expanded and made useful. Sections on all the vast classical references to Scythians out there could be included in one encompassing article - not just the "Iranian" and "Turkic" / "Altaic" classification sections, but all of the others out there over the years.

<li><b>Speedy and Strong Delete</b> Major POV issue which violages NOR. The article makes it seem it is western conspiracy to consider Scythians as Iranians and it is all based on ethno-nationalistic polemics. On the other hand the Iranianness of Scythians has been uniformly and unanimously accepted with the exception of nationalist Turkicist psuedo-scholars, like the writer of this article for at least the last 50 years and over the prior 100 years, many authorities have accepted it as well. In his site, the author of this article considers Sumerian, Elamite, Soghdians... and thousands of other non-Turkic groups as Turkic. The validity of the quotes also are selective and the author has already damaged the ossetian article by claiming it is a non-Iranian language, flatly denying scholarship. He was also caught misquoting a genetic study. So this article should be deleted as it constitutes NOR and has no backing from Academia. For example one out of the many wrong claims: 1) <i>Ossetian is an agglutinating type language with phonetics, morphology, lexicon, semantics and syntax of the Kartvelian-Adygian languages (Abaev, V.I. "Ossetian...").</i> . That is totally wrong and this was proven in the Ossetic language page that this user just makes up stuff. See for example the section of the book here from a very distinguished Hungarian Iranologist (do a google search on his name if you do not believe me): <a href="http://www.kroraina.com/sarm/jh/jh3_2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kroraina.com/sarm/jh/jh3_2.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. Note this author of the article claims Ossetian is not an Iranian language! This is totally false and this should make this article invalid within itself. Scythians are unanimously considered Iranian<a href="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/scyth1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/scyth1.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> (Cambridge History of Iran, Volume II). Note the polemics of pan-turkist circles in claiming Sumerian, Elamite, Urartian, Soghdian, Hittite, Hurrian and thousands of other languages as Turkic has a long history in the republic of Turkey, but such theories are not mainstream and the authors article comes from here: <a href="http://www.turkicworld.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.turkicworld.org/" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. . That is why this article should be deleted. So it is clear this is a non-academic article. There is not a single well known scholar in the field of Scythian studies who has published numerous articles (in peer reviewed journals) who has denied the Iranian heritage of Scythians. Here are some other wrong claims in the article: <i>Not Az-eri, whose endoethnonym is Azeri, and not Balkars, one of whose endoethnonyms is As</i>. Actually Azari is Adhari and Adhari comes Adharibaijan Middle Persian AtoorPatekaan (which is used in this way in Armenian as well). Azarbaijan due to its numerous firetemples was called Azarbaijan (gaurdian of the fire) and not the term "Azari" has nothing to do with the word "As". Wikipedia is a not place for polemics. An author who does not know the etymology of Adhari somehow wants to link this term to "As". There are much more wrong claims. The author of this unreliable wikipedia entery ignores Abaev who himself clearly states Ossetian and Alans are Iranians: <a href="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/pdfarticles/v1_articles/alans&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/logs/pdfdownload.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/pdfarticles/v1_articles/alans&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/logs/pdfdownload.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. Yet the author has the audacity to misquote Abaev when Abaevs opinion is clear from the article above. Abaev says the name "Alan" is a cognate with Iran and Aryan. Abaev says that Alanian may be reconstructed from Ossetian (after excluding the borrowed words of Ossetian from Caucasian and Turkic languages)(pg 803, above source). Its all there in the above entery written by Abaev himself! The Iranian evidence for Scythians is overwhelming and Britannica 2006 has no doubt it either nor do all these references: <a href="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/scyth29.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/scyth29.htm" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. For example the following book which is 500 pages: Zgusta, L.: Die griechischen Personennamen griechischer Städte der nördlichen Schwarzmeerküste. Die ethnischen Verhältnisse, namentlich das Verhältnis der Skythen und Sarmaten, im Lichte der Namenforschung, Prague 1955 , has done a detailed etymology on each of the Scythian words. Here is more information on this author: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladislav_Zgusta" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladislav_Zgusta" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. Or see Peter Golden's book on the Turkic people. Here is another example of faulty etymology from the writer of this article: <i>The same straightforward etymology was offered for the ethnonyms named by the classical sources: Ashkuza/Ishkuza is As-guzes, a transparent ethnonym for As tribes, where "guz" is Türkic "tribe</i>. Actually the Assyrian Ashkuza has nothing to do with Az-guzes! And also there is no tribe name guz but actually is Ghuz. There has never been a tribe called As-Oghuz or As-Ghuz. Just by the above example, we can see the writer of this article does not know his etymology. Wikipedia is a not place for polemical opinions. Serious academics who have written numerous peer-reviewed journals should not be ignored for the sake of the creatre of the following website: <a href="http://www.turkicworld.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.turkicworld.org/" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>! (Just take a look at the website of the user who wrote this article and pretty soon every ancient people in history will become Turks because unacademic and falsified information is allowed to creep into Wikipedia). Now compare this to the academic work written by professor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Szemer%C3%A9nyi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Szemer%C3%A9nyi" rel="nofollow">Oswald Szemerényi</a> available here:<a href="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/fouroldiranianethnicnames.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/fouroldiranianethnicnames.pdf" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Indeed the book here: [Four old Iranian names Scythian-Skuda-Sogdian-Saka <a href="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/fouroldiranianethnicnames.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/fouroldiranianethnicnames.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/fouroldiranianethnicnames.pdf</a>] shows the difference between real scholarsip and psuedo-scholarship based on psuedo-linguistics. The author forgets that the names of Scythians have easily recognized Iranian etymology. Saka Haumavarga - The Saka bearinng the Hauma - Hauma is the sacred drink of the Zoroastrians and ancient Areyan Hindus of India. Saka TigraKhauda - The Saka with the pointed hats. "Khauda" for example is middle Persian (Pahlavi) "Khaud" and present day "Khood" or "Kolah-Khood" in modern Farsi (Helmet). Saka Paradraya - The Saka from beyond the sea. Para is Indo-European (and it's subset Iranian) for "beyond" (there in no such root in Turkish or indeed any Altaic languages that I know of). Certain dialects in Khorassan still seem to use the word "para" in that context. "Draya" is sea (Persian "Darya" - which is also a word loaned into modern Turkish as "Derya"). Either the author of the entery scytho-Iranian theory(actually it is not a theory and it is not a Western conspiracy) should be a major Professor with major cited publications from a major Western University (which he is not) or else his politically motivated article should be completely removed because it violates Wikipedia's NOR and all of its facts are really psuedo-scholarship non-academic theories. Also Wikipedia should not be a democracy and should reflect academic opinions of the relavent scholars in the field and not ethno-nationalists. Almost every single line of this entery article is without a reference. Here is another false quote: <i>Instead, the Indo-Iranian tribes are documented as agricultural, sedentary, grain-consuming, never mastering long-distance horse husbandry</i>, which is again false, for example the <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mittani.html" title="Mittani">Mittani</a> whom we have the oldest Indo-Iranian manuscripts were excellent horse trainers for fighting wars. (see the wikipedia article on Mittani or Encyclopedia Britannica).</li>

<dd>Note I wanted to mention that the user Codex Sinaiticus did some research and found a quote which also contradicts this nationalistic psuedo-scholarship POV of article. Indeed the article claimed Zosimus considered the Huns(who might have been party altaic) to be Scythians. But the user Codex Sinaiticus found the actual quote which writes: <i>While these affairs were so conducted, a barbarous nation, which till then had remained unknown, suddenly made its appearance, attacking the Scythians beyond the Ister. These were the Huns. It is doubtful whether they were Scythians, who lived under regal government, or the people whom Herodotus states to reside near the Ister, and describes as a weak people with flat noses, or whether they came into Europe from Asia.</i>. <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus04_book4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus04_book4.htm" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>.

<dd>Finally there is the <b>admittance</b> of the writer of the entery himself from his own webpage: <i>The following discourse addresses the reasons for the current <b>universal acceptance</b> by the scientific community of the preposition that the Scythians were unambiguously Indo-European, and specifically Iranian speaking, and the methods to reach this conclusion.</i> <a href="http://s155239215.onlinehome.us/turkic/27_Scythians/Ethnic%20Affiliation%20Scythians%20En.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://s155239215.onlinehome.us/turkic/27_Scythians/Ethnic%20Affiliation%20Scythians%20En.htm" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> and due to discredit all these scholars, the author comes up with the falsified polemics! As you can see the authors work here is to challenge the universal acceptance of a fact. He needs to do this in Academic journals which are seriously peer reviewed and not in Wikipeda and once Britannica 2006 and thousands of other books and journal articles are changed, then his theory can be accepted. So this is clearly OR , POV, ..and violates WIKIPEDIA's NOR policy.</dd>

<dd>I have shown enough weak links in the current article. But here is more. What you wrote is wrong because you do not provide the sources. Huns themselves were a mixed group:<a href="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v12f6/v12f6008.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v12f6/v12f6008.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, so even if your quote is right (where are the standard English edition references to Procopius for example), it does not make Scythians-&gt;Huns-&gt;Turks. Or who says Cimmerians were related to Utigurs and of course by word playing you are going to some how assign Utigurs to Uyghurs. Give me a break. Show me a single Western Academician with in the last 20 years that has written peer-reviewed journal article that supports such a claim. I would read some serious books on Scythians. As per Iranian noticeboard, I would not support any proposal that does not have academic backing. Here we have "Universal" academic backing on a subject matter. Cimmerians by the way were not Turks either (Britannica). The current article is about conspiracy theory in claiming that western scholars falsified the scytho-Iranian theory. As Richard Frye the eminent Harvard Professor puts it: <i>In the fifth century a forrnidable new enemy appeared in the north-east as successor to the Kushans, a new wave of invaders from Central Asia called the Hephthalites. They are connected with the new order on the steppes of Central Asia which can be characterised best as the rise of the Altaic-speaking peoples or the Hunnic movement. Just as the first millennium BC in Central Asia was considered by classical authors as the period of Scythian dominance in the steppes, so the first half of the first millennium AD is the time of the Huns, while the second half and later is the period of the Turks and the Mongols. Of course the term 'Scythian' continued to be used by classical authors for various steppe peoples well into the Christian era just as the Ottomans were designated 'Huns' by several Byzantine authors. None the less the various terms 'Scythian, Hun and Turk' were general designations of the steppe peoples in Western sources including the Near East, though the Chinese had other names. Obviously not all peoples who lived in, or came from Central Asia into the Near East or eastern Europe in the first half of the first millennium AD were Huns, and the fact that Western and Near Eastern sources call a tribe Hunnic really only means that they came from the steppes of Central Asia, a vast area. The word 'Hun' has caused scholars great trouble as have other problems of Hunnic history, but this is not the place to discuss such questions as, for example, the iclentity of the Hsiung-nu of Chinese sources with various 'Huns' of Western, Near Eastern or Indian sources.</i> <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/fryeheri.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/fryeheri.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> In many Persian manuscipts the Ottoman empire is designated by "Rome" so are you going to try to prove that the Romans were Ottomans?

<dd>Verifiable? So far I have shown a good amount of false sources in this article. Secondly the former confusion about Scythians has been put succintly by Professor Richard Frye of Harvard University and I quote again: <i>In the fifth century a forrnidable new enemy appeared in the north-east as successor to the Kushans, a new wave of invaders from Central Asia called the Hephthalites. They are connected with the new order on the steppes of Central Asia which can be characterised best as the rise of the Altaic-speaking peoples or the Hunnic movement. Just as the first millennium BC in Central Asia was considered by classical authors as the period of Scythian dominance in the steppes, so the first half of the first millennium AD is the time of the Huns, while the second half and later is the period of the Turks and the Mongols.

This is a scholarly source. In many Persian manuscipts the Ottoman empire is designated by "Rome" so are you going to try to prove that the Romans were Ottomans? All foreigners in persian and middle eastern languages (British, French, Spanish, Italians..) were called "Farang" (from Frankish German tribe). What you are trying to argue about is a totally different issue. The fact of the matter is that there is a universal acceptance that Scythians are Iranians. But we can mention in the Scythian article (and not this conspiracy theory article) what Professor. Frye has referred to. But this has nothing to do with the issue at hand. Else one can work backward and say since Huns (a mixed group btw) were called Scythians, then Huns are Iranians and make up theories. The issue at hand is an article POV here challenging the current <b>universal scholarly opinion</b> (admitted by the author of the article) on the Iranian background of Scythians. The article has many false quotes and etymologies and I just showed a few. So there is two different issues here and there is no reason to convolute them. I have no quarrels with ancient designations and we can bring the quote by Professor. Frye to show that various different groups and even the Ottoman empire was called Scythian at one time just like middle easterners called all europeans as Franks. But that has nothing to do with the original Scythians and other weired theories of the author above who claims Ossetian is not an Iranian language although Abaev has clearly stated it is. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 04:44, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What you say here is not related to the current argument here . Also note how ancient authors even differentiated between Huns and Alans(scythians). <a href="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v12f6/v12f6008.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v12f6/v12f6008.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> and I quote again here for sake of clarity: <i>Important, however, is the fact that Ptolemy and Ammianus both located the Huns in the neighborhood of the Iranian-Sarmatian Alans, and that the land of the Alans between the Sea of Azov and the Caucasus was still considered by Byzantine historiography as the country of origin of the Huns (Priscus, frag. 1; Procopius, Bella 4.5; Agathias, 5.11). The Alans are known to have been the first victims of the sudden expansion of the Huns between 370 and 375 C.E., and to have been forced by the latter to participate in subsequent military expeditions (Amm. Marc., 31.3.1).</i> . And note my quotes are verified from a verifiable source and note picking and choosing is not keeping a unbiased POV. We can have a section on the main Scythian page about former affiliations of Scythians and mention Altaic, Slavic, Uralic and Germanic. But the current argument is about how there is a big conspiracy theory and how according to the author of the article: <i>the universal acceptance</i> of current scholarship is false and is a conspiracy. So that is the issue at hand. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 04:53, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hope you are right. But if there wasn't observant users scrutinizing some of these articles, who knows what would happen or what is happening. Not to speak of myself, but for at least 6 months, some user who was in copy right violation had disfigured the Medes article and claimed that the Hungarian Magyars are related to Magians and had claimed Sumerian,Dravidian,Elamite .. are all Hungarian. Note such an embarrasing error in Wikipedia for 6 months without anyone noticing it was very unfortunate. More unfortunate though was the insistence of someone that the false information (which was also in copy right violation) should not be removed! I can tell you that in some pan-Turkist countries, they have written books with bogus materials in order to claim Sumerians, Medes, Elamites, Hurrians, Scythians, Urartuians, Hittites,Greeks. For example in one book, Homer is called Omer and Hellen of Troy is related to Turks since Toroy and Tork sound close. Or please take a look here: <a href="http://www.compmore.net/~tntr/cide.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.compmore.net/~tntr/cide.html" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. The material on this article is bogus like those books/article, but very few people actually might check the sources. That is why it becomes very important to actually have academic backed articles in some of the enteries(and these are mainly historical articles since with political articles everyone can pretty much have an opinion) so that nationalistic POV does not creep in. I can tell anything which the creator of this wikipedia article will write, will have a non-neutral POV. Is it then my job to track every single sentence down? I hope not since that is very time consuming. In the Ossetic language page, he is denying that <a href="../../../o/s/s/Ossetic.html" title="Ossetic">Ossetic</a> is classified as an Iranian language! (See the talk page). And unfortunately another user instead of siding with the truth puts a <i>dispute tag</i>, while there is absolutely no dispute that Ossetic is classified linguistically as an Iranian language. It is like me going to the entery of George Washington and claiming that he was Chinese and if someone doesn't like it, then I will put a dispute tag!

<p>Ofcourse the first thing you encounter here (<a href="http://www.turkicworld.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.turkicworld.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.turkicworld.org/</a>) is the "grey wolf" background, which is an obvious reference to the pan-turkist ideology of the site.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of what else you can see on this page:</p>
<p>Famous TURKS in history:</p>
<p>Biruni (perian scientist) Changiz khan (mongol general) Farabi (persian scientist) Abu muslim Khorasani (Persian General) Khwarizmi (Persian mathematician) Avicinna or Ibne Sina (Persian physician) Qublai Khan (Mongol Ruler)</p>

<p>Here is an other jewel of knowledge (I quote):</p>
<p>"In the Iranian Zend-Avesta narrations which can be found in detail in the Islamic sources and in the Israely origin Torah narratives the name "Turk" was searched at Noah's grandson (son of Yafes) Turk..."</p>
<p>(Ofcourse the author needs to explain where in Avesta is there any talk about the semitic myths of Noah etc...)</p>
<p>Articles like this are and have been part of a concerted effort by pan-turkist ideologists to romantisize the origin of turks, through association of ancient heroic or civilized people with turks. Note that in the article in question, the english word "Turk" is consistently spelled "Türk" as per spelling in Turkish, which suggest a very national-romantic approach to history. Nothing from this site has a place in a serious encyclopedia and therefore we really should remove this nonsense from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArash_the_Bowman_bde7.html" title="User:Arash the Bowman">Arash the Bowman</a> 09:40, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reason this article exists is to promote the ideas of the aforementioned websit. (the author of the wikipedia article is a contributor to that website). The article about Scythians should be enough. Therefore there is no reason to fix this article. Fixing it will require a major rewriting any way, which I do not think is necessary, since any useful information can be put into the Scythia article. best wishes <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArash_the_Bowman_bde7.html" title="User:Arash the Bowman">Arash the Bowman</a> 10:30, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>Comment</b> Thanks to all that contributed specially user Dab. I definitely welcome the name change although I recommend <i>former ethnic classification of Scythians</i> instead of <i>ethnic classification of Scythians</i>. Personally I do not think any aspect of this article can be salvaged although historical identification of Scythians with Germans, Turks, Slavs, Uralic people could be mentioned succintly in the Scythian article (with appropriate sources). I believe there was a Russian book two hundreds years ago by the title "Yes we are Scythians". Anyways found another error and faslification in the current article. Procopius in no way identifies the Huns as Scythians. <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/18*.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/18*.html" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. He just mentions various steppes people. Please read the third paragraph. I am wondering how many errors do we have to find before some other users stop the distortion and disfigurement of Wikipedia for their nationalistic POV. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 13:36, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, Ali... As you can see I am a stickler for getting to the bottom of things and finding the true story, whatever it is...! As for the Procopius claim, note that the claim here is actually that he identified the "<b>Utigurs</b>" with the "<b>Cimmerians</b>", which seems more probable that he said this. All he seems to say about "Scythians" and "Huns", is that Attila's army had absorbed and incorporated a large Scythian fighting force into his own ranks, which is basically what the other historians agree. (E.g. <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Wars/Book_III" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Wars/Book_III" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> - "<i>Attila, who had invaded the Roman domain with a great army of Massagetae and the other Scythians...</i>") You are right in that a distinction between the Huns and Scythians nations seems to be maintained, or as in Zosimus, left open. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 16:00, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That is good. I am also at getting to bottom of the truth. That is why each statement in the original article which is non-factual needs to be removed. Zosmus actually distinguishes more than leaving it open. I still favor a strong delete and believe that historical identification of Scythians with other groups(Slavs, Germans,Turks..) needs to be put in a small succint section. All nonsense stuff in this article about conspiracy theories needs to be thrown out. So basically we need a small section in the main scythian article to just summarize this issue, and of course the universal opinion which is the final opinion in my view (since all sources have now been exhausted), is that Scythians were Iranic Indo-European people. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 23:10, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that the debate takes place already shows that there is a need to address the subject, its history, its concepts, its pros and cons. The abcence of such subject in the Wikipedia was glaring, which drew me to full in the void in the first place. The notion that all seven Scythian languages were Iranian/Ossetian/Northern Iranian/Eastern Iranian is laughable and unsustainable other than by policing means. These means were employed by former USSR and its Easterm European sattelites. As soon as the enforcement apparatus faded, facts and opinions started to flourish, and need to be sorted out, which is not the Wikipedia task, and may take half a century or more. But for Wikipedia to pretend that the subject does not exist is ridiculous, totally contrary to its objectives, and again, usustainable. The German version quotes Tanshu stating that Alans were one of four Hun's tribes, and a leading one. The English version, policed by enthusiastic watchdogs, does not have it. So, they have to stretch their policing effort into German, Finnish etc. versions, or to nuke the Tabshu itself to suppress the flow of ideas. And it is unsustainable, because no one can suppress the Tanshu.</dd>

<dd>And while we are discussing this subject, we should think about other information we want to suppress. Shall we suppress the genetical data on Scythians? Shall we suppress the observation of Cavalli-Sforza? Shall we supress the studies of Karvellian and Nakh languages that view Ossetian as a dialect of their languages? Where are we to stop at suppressing? Is the partizan watchdog agency a proper tool to define the limits of suppression?</dd>

<dd>Actually Wikipedia is not a debate place and it is up to the actual scholarly community and not nationalist groups to discuss history and they have done so over the past 200 years and it is firmly established that Scythians are Iranians. Your competing view falls in the realm of original research and so it is not for Wikipedia. I already showed numerous examples of you using false etymology. As per all seven Scythian dialect being Iranian, you might want to check Kurdish which has 50 dialects/variants. The rest of the political stuff about USSR is irrelavent since Western scholarship as independently reached the same convincing conclusions and as I said there is no conspiracy theory. Also you have totally picked and choosed statements from Abaev (assuming your quotes where valid) to reach a conclusion he did not reach. I will quote Abaev here: <i>Ossetic is the spoken and literary language of the Ossetes, a people living in the central part of the Caucasus and constituting the basic population of the North-Ossetic ASSR, which belongs to the Russian Federation, and of the South-Ossetic Autonomous Oblast [Region] which belongs to the Georgian Republic. Ossetic is genetically related to the Iranian group of the Indo-European family of languages. From deep antiquity (since the 7th-8th centuries B. C), the languages of the Iranian group were distributed in a vast territory including present-day Iran (Persia), Central Asia, and Southern Russia. Ossetic is the sole survivor of the northeastern branch of Iranian languages known as Scythian. The Scythian group included numerous tribes in Central Asia and Southern Russia, known in ancient sources as Scythians, Massageti, Sakas, Sarmatians, Alans, Roksolans, etc. In close relationship with these tribes were the Khorezmians and the Sogdians. At the beginning of our era, one of the Scytho-Sarmatian tribes, the Alans, advanced to the Northern Caucasian Mountains and mixed with the local Caucasian elements, thus giving rise to the Ossetic nationality. In the course of centuries-long propinquity to and intercourse with Caucasian languages, Ossetic became similar to them in some features, particularly in phonetics and lexicon. However, it retained its grammatical structure and basic lexical stock; its relationship with the Iranian family, despite considerable individual traits, does not arouse any doubt. Among the languages of the Soviet Union belonging to the Iranian family are also Tajik, Kurdish, Tat, Talysh, Yagnobi, and Shugni. Among those beyond the border are Persian, Pashto, Balochi, and others. Ossetic is divided into two main dialects: the eastern, called Iron, and the Western, called Digor. The overwhelming majority of Ossetes speak the Iron dialect, and the literary language is based on it. The creator of the Ossetic literary language is the national poet Kosta Xetagurov (1859-1906)</i><a href="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/languages/ossetian/ossetian.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azargoshnasp.net/languages/ossetian/ossetian.htm" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. As Per Alans, <i>The Alans are known to have been the first victims of the sudden expansion of the Huns between 370 and 375 C.E., and to have been forced by the latter to participate in subsequent military expeditions (Amm. Marc., 31.3.1)</i><a href="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v12f6/v12f6008.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v12f6/v12f6008.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. As per phenotype, original Turks were mongloid (like Yakuts today) and Scythians are clearly Caucasoid. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 23:02, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00032/cah-00032.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00032/cah-00032.html" rel="nofollow">University of Texas</a> site has some info on Volumatix, but I can't quite figure out what it is or how to cite it. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 22:16, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>These are the archives of the Soap Creek Saloon, a venue in Austin. Business records, photos, posters, that sort of thing. It appears that Volumatix is one of the bands who appeared at that venue. The page is a listing of the contents of the archive and how it is organized, and what subjects are contained in each box, though there is no way of knowing what specific material or how much they have under each subject. My guess is that judging from the number of different bands listed for each box, the amount of individual material on each band is fairly small, perhaps just a poster or some business paperwork. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 22:23, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Allmusic entry may be a source of notability, but lack of Allmusic entry is NOT a reason for deletion. Did you look at those 73 ghits? What did they say? Anything about the hits indicate notability or non-notability? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 18:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is a reason to delete if there is no evidence of notability provided. The google hits were record sales stores, myspace, message boards, etc. Nothing to indictate notability. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, those hits were playlists on radio stations, sites for venues the band played, and record auctions where their work is fetching high prices. Does THAT speak to you? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 18:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm a <i>graduate student</i> and even I don't consider $10-$15 a high price for a record. Which is what all the eBay ones are selling for <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:59, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not really, sorry. See <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. We can't write encyclopedia articles based on playlists and record auctions. Who is this band? Why are they important? Who did they influence? These questions aren't answered by playlists and auctions. I'm not crusading to keep them out, but if someone can't come up with a single reliable, encyclopedia worthy source about this band, they shouldn't be in Wikipedia. It's not like American rock bands are some obscure topic that has only been examined by a handful of people. Come up with one mention in <i>Rolling Stone</i>, one mention in a Rough Guide, something significant from some source, then we'll talk. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 19:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, I'm not going to try to sway anyone any which way, but I just want this post to establish my position. To be honest, I'm shocked and repulsed by Koavf's behavior towards me. He tagged this article for speedy deletion, which it clearly is not. From <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD A7</a>, "An article about a real person, group of people, band, or club that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject (can be speedily deleted). If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to AfD instead." The reason for speedy deletion is so that you can eliminate blantant crap that is just pure nonsense or doesn't make an attempt to make the subject notable. Koavf thinks that not meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is suddenly a reason for speedy deletion, the reason that this isn't true is because it's very difficult and completely agaisnt consensus (which Wikipedia is founded upon) to just delete something since it doesn't appear to be "notable." Speedy Deletions are meant for something that everyone can agree without reservation that it's terrible and not even remotely encylopedic. This article <b>does</b> stress the importance of the subjet and attempts to show how it meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. To be honest, I'm leaning towards a week keep based upon the context of the article and the new links that were revealed. Also, using allmusic.com, shouldn't be our one stop source for music, like Amazon being our one stop source for literature. It appears the attempt of meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, is in the touring, opening acts, and record label. But, back to my original point: This article was not speedible and if you want to see more on this issue please see the article's talk page. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 00:04, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and add sources. Just because a 20-years-defunct band has little internet prescence doesn't mean we need to give up on it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 11:02, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This has nothing to do with the lack of internet presence and everything to do with the lack of any sources at all. If there are sources to add, then add them. We shouldn't create articles and then hope there is information to back them up somewhere down the line. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 16:44, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page needs to be deleted for various reasons. Here is the list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Page is NPOV...quite frankly written by ardent and zealous supports</li>
<li>Page is Un-encyclopdedic...some of the article is just unintelligable ramblings</li>
<li>Article is a combination of two completely seperate articles...Zapatista EZLN and Emiliano Zapata</li>
<li>Article is a cut and past from better wikipedia articles (see below)</li>
<li>Article is well written and sourced when and encyclopdedic on these pages

<p>This page needs to be deleted and a disamb page created for those two or three articles above. This page is a cut and past, way way below wiki standards and better articles already exist. I would create the page myself but I dont know how yet. Thank You. Disagreement? Oh BTW, I dont think this page should be saved or worked on.

<li><b>Keep</b> (for now) - I'm not opposed to other outcomes (merge, disambiguify, etc) being discussed, and I'm not even opposed to an eventual redirect. But I suggest that editors interested in the subject work to reach a consensus on what that outcome would be, preferably on the article's talk page. In fact, make a note of this on the talk page of the other articles mentioned above, and see what consensus other editors reach on this one. But it's way to early in this discussion process to be suggesting deletion. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 18:35, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please stop asking me to edit the page. I began to do that and to create other pages for this article when I noticed that this article is a collection of "stubs" from better article. It is a cut and paste article and stub duplicates of better articles. The word zapatista should be used as a redirect for Emiliano Zapatista and the EZLN. If I knew how to do that I would. The very best way to edit this article would be to cut and past the two excellent articles, that I have already mentioned, into this article. Then to split the article in two. This article is a duplicate. Editing wont change that.

<p>Here is the solution......turn this page into a disamb. page. If we do that then it doesnt need to be deleted (just blanked). Please, I am a new contributor and I am just looking for the best solution to what I see as a horrible oversight/problem that exists on wikipedia. Asking me to edit the page over and over again is rude. Remember I am a new user and dont know all the rules. I really wish that you would read the pages (I know quite a bit about this subject) and tell me how editing could possibly be a solution. When people search for zapatista they are looking for one of the two pages I listed above. All we need it a redirect/disambig. page. However, I dont know how to create one.

<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b>; The user above has no clue about this brand and probably doesn't smoke. Just because he doesn't know this brand does not make it insignificant. In fact it's one of Canada's oldest brands of cigarettes and is available at nearly ever tobacco store and kiosk in Toronto (where I live part of the year) and Oregon (where I live the rest of the year). It's so notable that the Government of Canada has Export A in their historical Database! Here is the text from the Government of Canada's archives;</li>
</ul>
<p>RJR-Macdonald Inc. Since Before Confederation… In 1858, six years after moving to Montreal as oil commission merchants, William C. Macdonald and his older brother Augustine launched McDonald Brothers and Co. Tobacco Manufacturers. Initially the company imported tobacco from Kentucky and manufactured chewing and smoking tobacco plugs. The business prospered and in 1866 underwent a name change to W.C. McDonald Tobacco Merchants and Manufacturers. That same year the brothers initiated a heart-shaped logo and coined the phrase “tobacco with a heart” – a trademark that lasted more than a century.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>RJR-Macdonald has carried on manufacturing in the Ontario Street, Montreal, building since 1876.</p>
<p>Many changes took place in the business. Augustine eventually left the company giving William full control. By 1876 expansion was necessary and the company moved its manufacturing facilities to Ontario Street East in Montreal, where the original building is still used today. The present buildings house both research and manufacturing facilities under the name RJR-Macdonald Inc.</p>
<p>With the growing financial success of the business, William became an integral part of the financial establishment of Montreal and the nation. Named a director of the Bank of Montreal, he established himself as a leading philanthropist, ultimately pouring millions of dollars into health and educational causes, particularly McGill University. Besides funding both a student and science building, he quietly provided numerous scholarships and endowed a number of chairs, one of them filled by Ernest Rutherford, famed pioneer of atomic research and future Nobel laureate.</p>
<p>For his generous support of various health and education causes he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1898. At that time he changed the spelling of his thriving tobacco company name from McDonald to Macdonald. As Sir William, he continued to support rural education, providing funding for colleges in agriculture and household sciences in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. He also provided funding for the consolidation of Vancouver and Victoria colleges into the McGill University College of British Columbia, which later became the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p><br />
The process of manufacturing tobacco products has evolved to present-day high-tech, state-of-the-art equipment. RJR-Macdonald Inc. produces more than 15 billion units annually for domestics and worldwide distribution.</p>
<p>Upon his death in 1917, Macdonald, a bachelor, left the company to the Stewart brothers who had started their careers with the company as clerks. Walter Stewart became president and under his management, the company extended production to cut pipe tobacco and the first “roll your own” finecuts. In 1922, cigarette production was added, cigarettes being sold in packages of 10s, 20s, and 50s. In 1928 Export cigarettes were introduced. First known as British Consol Export, the cigarette package became distinctive in 1935 with the addition of a Scottish lassie wearing a Macdonald of Sleat tartan kilt. Created by Canadian artist Rex Woods, the Lassie has remained a company symbol ever since.</p>
<p>During World War II, the company provided cigarettes to Canadian troops overseas. By 1945 fifty percent of the Canadian forces smoked Export cigarettes. This helped the company maintain a dominant share of the domestic market during the first postwar decade. Under Walter’s son David M. Stewart, the company diversified into cigar making during the ’60s.</p>
<p>The Stewarts retained ownership of the Macdonald Tobacco company until 1974 when it was bought by R.J. Reynolds Industries of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Four years later the name was changed to RJR-Macdonald Inc. to take advantage of the growing recognition of R.J. Reynolds as a major multinational corporation that was made even more so with the merger of R.J. Reynolds and the Nabisco Corporation of New York in 1985.</p>
<p>As a subsidiary of R.J. Reynolds International, RJR-Macdonald, now headquartered in Toronto, has the capability of drawing on the financial, technological and research resources of its international parent. It continues to produce a full range of Canadian cigarette brands, fine cut tobaccos, cigars, and cigarette papers. Most of its Canadian products are produced from Virginia flue-cured tobacco grown in southwestern Ontario. It also imports and distributes several well-known American brands which are manufactured by its sister company R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.</p>
<p>The plant in Montreal has seen many changes, undergoing a major program of modernization and renovation during the ’80s. With state-of-the-art equipment, the plant is capable of producing more than 15 billion units annually, and has a reputation for producing high quality products, some of which are produced for and distributed by RJR affiliates in other parts of the world, such as Japan, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Operating in Canada for more than 138 years, RJR-Macdonald has been associated with many special causes and sporting events. For years it has provided financial assistance and marketing expertise to help promote sports such as downhill and freestyle skiing, curling, windsurfing, hockey, fishing, and recently hydroplane boating and golf. While sponsorship of such programs may be curtailed in the future by government legislation, the company remains committed to providing assistance to cultural, recreational, educational, and humanitarian institutions for as long as it can. It is also proud of its role as an equal opportunity employer, its long-standing record of good management-employee relations and its identity as a successful company with roots clearly and firmly established in Canada. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtobacco_3b80.html" title="User:Mrtobacco">Mrtobacco</a> (<a href="../../../m/r/t/User_talk%7EMrtobacco_4ae0.html" title="User talk:Mrtobacco">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mrtobacco_5fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mrtobacco">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Name brands of cigarettes are important elements of popular culture. Many, many works of literature make specific reference to them, and the distinction between brands is often a particular mark of character. personality and/or social aspirations. A person smoking, say, unfiltered Lucky Strikes has a different cultural connontation than someone smoking, oh, menthol Virginia Slims. Such distinctions are on the wane, as the rate of smoking declines, which is a strong case for WP documenting these brands, <a href="../../../e/x/p/Export_A_c737.html" title="Export A">Export A</a> included. One hundred years from now, the only way to understand just what an "Export A" was may well be by consulting WP.

<li>While I see your point, I beg to differ. The article is useful and interesting, as it allows for the user to discover more about a mod they may potentially want to try without having to wade through the website (I know this from personal experience) and it does no harm to keep the article here.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> The article doesn't establish any inherent notability, and all of the external links are to sites which directly advertise the game. However, the article itself doesn't read like an ad, and "Plan of Attack"+"Half-Life 2" gets 250,000 Google hits and about 420 unique hits (although many of these are just sites that allow you to download the mod, or are message board posts). The previous AfD in no way established the game's significance, so I certainly can't allow a lot of Google hits to counterbalance an apparent lack of notability. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:33, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's a maxim that is far too often abused as a synonym for "I don't like this article.". None of the 7 items on that list apply to this article. It isn't a memorial, a FAQ, or a travel guide, for example. And <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_counties_in_New_York_02cf.html" title="List of counties in New York">List of counties in New York</a> is also a list of areas marked on a map, as is <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realms_of_Arda_59ab.html" title="Realms of Arda">Realms of Arda</a>, so that is not a rationale for deleting an article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Except <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_counties_in_New_York_02cf.html" title="List of counties in New York">List of counties in New York</a> are the real verifiable names of actual counties, all of which have information on them. This article is about an image with made up names and no further information beyond the names themselves. Surprisingly the <a href="http://routeduvin.typepad.com/photos/newyorker/46980_l.html" class="external text" title="http://routeduvin.typepad.com/photos/newyorker/46980_l.html" rel="nofollow">image itself</a> isn't shown in the page, presumably for copyright reasons. Ultimately, this is an article about a painting, without the painting. Also missing is the meaning behind the image or more accurately, the reason the image was created in the first place. The image was actually used in a much <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_named_ethnic_enclaves_in_North_American_cities&amp;oldid=63640526" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_named_ethnic_enclaves_in_North_American_cities&amp;oldid=63640526" rel="nofollow">more appropriate article here</a> (top right) but was deleted because of copyright issues. I don't see how you can have this article without the image. I'd like to see sources for what the meanings of each section are too. To my knowledge, the image was created without explanation, presumably leaving it to the viewer's interpretation as to the meaning behind each name. That would mean any definitions are purely speculative and unverifiable. It does seem to be a notable image though... Apparently you can buy it as a nice shower curtain. I think "List of covers of the New Yorker" might be a more appropriate place for it but again, without the actual images because of copyright issues, you don't have much. <b>Reluctant Delete</b> as it's a nice image and it gives you a little bit of perspective about <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>. Unfortunately, without a comprehensive verifiable list of reasonings behind the place names, I don't see the article becoming much more than a bit of an inside joke for New Yorkers. All your left with is an image and an image on its own doesn't make an article. I'd vote for keep if we could:
<ol>
<li>Get a verified explanation from the authors outlining their reason for creating the image.</li>
<li>Get a verified list (again, from the authors) about how they came up with each location's name and what each name means.</li>
<li>Include much more information verifying the images notability. Why is it an important image? What does it tell you about New York? What was the impact of the image on those who saw it (All from verified articles found in notable publications)?</li>
<li>Get a copy of the image in the article.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Without all of those, you don't have much and at this point in time, I don't see how you could get any of them. You need more information like this in the article: <a href="http://www.keepmedia.com/pubs/Folio/2002/02/01/139391" class="external text" title="http://www.keepmedia.com/pubs/Folio/2002/02/01/139391" rel="nofollow">The New Yorker Uncovers An Unexpected Profit Center</a> <a href="../../../y/a/y/User%7EYay_unto_the_Chicken_3d1a.html" title="User:Yay unto the Chicken">Yay unto the Chicken</a> 08:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You don't see how we could get more information <i>and then point to an article from which we can get more information</i>? That is self-contradictory. Why do you think that we should delete a stub article when you yourself have given at least one way in which it can be expanded? We don't delete stubs that are capable of being expanded.
<p>We used to have a copy of the image, by the way. Ironically, it was deleted because it was <i>inappropriate</i> to the article that it was used in, and this article, where it would have qualified as fair use, didn't exist at the time. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem is the article I pointed to isn't enough. You still need information on the actual image itself and from what I've been able to gather, there isn't any. "New Yorkistan is an image that made the New Yorker lots of money" is information better placed in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a> article rather than a new article. At the moment, all the information about the image I can find seems to say that it'd be better mentioned under a "Notable Covers" section in The New Yorker article (something I encourage you to do if this page is deleted). If you can find items 1 - 4 I outlined above, then it would warrant a separate article. My point is that that information simply doesn't seem to exist, which is unfortunate. My primary concern is that we're still lacking definitions for most of the names. Some of the definitions that are there are based purely on speculation occuring on a message board or someone's blog. <a href="../../../y/a/y/User%7EYay_unto_the_Chicken_3d1a.html" title="User:Yay unto the Chicken">Yay unto the Chicken</a> 06:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>My point is that that information simply doesn't seem to exist, which is unfortunate.</i> — The article itself says otherwise. Please actually read it. <i>My primary concern is that we're still lacking definitions for most of the names.</i> — We don't delete articles for being incomplete. Please read our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. <i>it'd be better mentioned under a "Notable Covers" section in The New Yorker article</i> — You have just argued that the article should be merged. Merger requires that the article be kept. <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_ec58.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge">Article merger</a> is not deletion and does not involve deletion at any stage. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:57, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The current article can be summed up into a one (at most two) paragraph summary which would be better placed in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a> article. Other much more notable magazines covers do not have their own articles though in some cases, their titles exist as redirects to the magazine they appeared on. I apologise if technically, I should have said "summarise into a paragraph and add into New Yorker" instead of "delete". The only purpose that would seem to warrant an article is a full and complete list of all the names on the map with explanations but if we look at the list, of the 64 total names, only 25 have definitions. 39 remain unexplained. Of those that do have definitions, their meaning is sorely lacking. <i>Gribinez:</i> The Hudson River. "gribinez" is Yiddish for "cut-up chicken parts". And? What do "cut-up chicken parts" have to do with the Hudson river? Find me a source which explains why this meaning was given to the Hudson River. <i>Khaffeine:</i> A reference to coffee. Really? But why was this part of the map named after coffee? There are a lot of coffee stores there? It was just a funny name? Then there are other names. <i>Central Parkistan:</i> This is Central Park in Manhattan. Really? Again, so? Why was it called "Central Parkistan"? If the only reason is because "well, they added -istan on the end 'cause it sounded funny", do we really need that defined? Likewise <i>Al Quarantine</i> "it's a jail". That too seems fairly self-explanatory as a funny. As you can see, most of the definitions can be summarised with the sentence "because it sounded funny". We don't need an entire article for that. Half of the definitions that do exist were also taken from non-reputable sources. If you remove those, you are left with a succinct paragraph of information which is better placed in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a> article. I can see that "If a page is very short and cannot or should not be expanded terribly much, it often makes sense to merge it with a page on a broader topic.", so I change my previous delete to <b>Merge</b> with the current article becoming a redirect. <a href="../../../y/a/y/User%7EYay_unto_the_Chicken_3d1a.html" title="User:Yay unto the Chicken">Yay unto the Chicken</a> 04:37, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article is copiously referenced, and neither original research nor unverifiable. The argument that it is stub that is incapable of expansion shot itself in the foot. Many different people, independent of the <i>New Yorker</i>, including the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>Lilith</i>, have considered the illustration notable enough to have published works of their own about it. (As the article says, at least one organization ranks it in the top 40 magazine cover illustrations of the past 40 years.) Per the <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a>, it is therefore notable. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:58, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Arguably it has a place within the Wiki entry for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a> magazine, but having sold 750 copies is still a looong way from making it notable, and so what if it was a limited edition?

<li>You have just made a subjective judgement.

Being the subject of independently written full-length articles in two newspapers and an article in a journal (as well as all of the people who have written about it all over the World Wide Web, hypothesising their explanations for the various placenames) makes the subject notable. That something is not<i>able</i> is demonstrated by it having been not<i>ed</i>, many times over and by quite a few people. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:57, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I dispute that this is discussed "all over the web". With particular regard to my searches for a number of the names, I continually turn up only 6 or 7 pages at most and in most cases, it's the same 6 or 7 pages. Particularly the one New York Times article, a particular blog post and a thread on google answers. Most searches for "New Yorkistan" itself (without looking for place names) turn up many pages with only the image itself, with a note typically along the lines of how funny it is. <a href="../../../y/a/y/User%7EYay_unto_the_Chicken_3d1a.html" title="User:Yay unto the Chicken">Yay unto the Chicken</a> 04:46, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>We should <b>keep</b> this article. It clearly is notable to The American Society of Magazine Editors who gave it an award. I'm not sure how this could be a copy vio as nothing appears to have been copied. And what is unencyclopediac about it? The Mona Lisa is encyclopediac and it's "only a picture" as well, the only difference is the medium in which the artwork appears. Is magazine art any less worthy of an article than any other art? It's a work of satire that was popular enough for it to be re-sold as home decoration (posters/lithographs). <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 02:06, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Per Uncle G. More explicitly, the cover has had multiple independent articles written about it in other sources such as the New York Times, so notability is easy. Also, the causes for the names have been discussed in said articles in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> sources, so they aren't an issue either. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:07, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Again, I only wish to point out that having this article here will help to inform the public community of what, to them, could be a potentially fun mod to try. By having information and links available, they can see for themselves if it sounds like something they would like to try.

<li>Sorry for being crude, but when the hell did I say that it was anything even remotely related to spam? When did I even say any of that? What I said was that it is a useful article among the PC gamer community. If you don't play PC games, then I understand your reluctance, but believe me when I say it will save many a gamer a migraine trying to find reliable info on the mod.

<li>Non-gamers may find that this is a "waste of space", but the fact remains that it is, in fact, a practical way for gamers to read up on one of the most notable zombie mods among the gaming community. It is not notable among the mainstream, but it is among the PC gaming community, and spreading the word on things you DON'T KNOW ABOUT is the entire point of an ENCYCLOPEDIA. Or did you forget that this was, in fact, an encyclopedia and not a big list of things people already know about? You're perpetuating the myth that all wikipedia users care about is mainstream information that everyone knows already, and that none of us care about the littler things that maybe, just maybe, few people outside of its main circle know about. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChef_Brian_25af.html" title="User:Chef Brian">Chef Brian</a> 19:49, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, "spreading the word" is NOT the point of an encyclopedia. Spreading the word is the point of advertising sites, news sites, and community sites. The point of an encyclopedia is to provide reliable information about important subjects. I'm not judging whether this is important or not, but I do question the reliability of the information: per policy, we cannot accept articles that are not backed up by reliable sources. And this one isn't; indeed, there <i>is</i> no reliable information available on this mod yet, because it <i>hasn't been released yet</i>. We <i>cannot</i> simply take the mod's authors' word for it that the mod will even ever exist: Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a crystal ball! Therefore, this article simply cannot be kept at present. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Next, I am a very avid PC gamer (I had HL2 the day it came out. I own 9 working computers and get 5-6 hours of PC time in after I get home from work) and have heard about this mod via gaming boards. Please stop making assumtions on other people.

<li><i>this [is], in fact, an encyclopedia and not a big list of things people already know about</i> — Actually, per our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy, that is a rough approximation of what we are attempting to create here, and what a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> encyclopaedia is.
<p><i>You're perpetuating the myth that all wikipedia users care about is mainstream information</i> — No, they aren't. But you are propounding the fallacy that "mainstream" and "already documented outside of Wikipedia" are equivalent.</p>
<p>The assertions here are that this article is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. The <i>only</i> way to counter those arguments is to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>, filling up the References section of this article (which is currently empty) and demonstrating that it is possible to verify the article and that knowledge of the subject has been through a process of publication, fact checking, and peer review, and has already become a part of the corpus of human knowledge. All of the other arguments that you are making are irrelevant. Continue to argue along those lines, instead of citing sources, and you will not save the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I also have to admit that I get curious when someone claims that Google hit counts are invalid because of flaws in the search engine. The <a href="../../../g/t/_/WP%7EGT_7ea5.html" title="WP:GT">Google Test</a> is an established, largely reliable tool for AfD discussions and, when coupled with other arguments for or against deletion, its use in these discussions in quite valid. Granted, in this case the subject only gets 868 <i>unique</i> hits out of 30+ million, but that's not really a small amount for unique hits--hell, a Google search for "Google" only yields 553 unique Ghits. Couple this with the news accounts, and we've got an obvious keeper here. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 07:42, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> More scraps of info: according to rosters at si.com and elsewhere, he appears to have been first a Left Tackle, later a Left Guard, in the years 2002-2004. The listings as a rusher, I would theorize, probably came from plays where they lined him up as a fullback in order to block. Other than rosters, I don't see any discussion of him, so I have no idea how much he played. I don't see any sign he was a particularly notable player. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 22:52, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is no other system called the SWoRD system other than this one in the software categories. The reason we put it as the SWoRD system in Wikipedia is because sword is a general term that already is used.

News on him currently circulating suggest he has landed a role in a major Hollywood film alongside A-list stars.

<dd>Uniforms (costumes) in star trek universe developed over time along with rank insignias.</dd>
<dd>The change is visible on the show itself so original research is not an issue. There was significant change in uniforms with first two movies and later in tng. Even branch colors changed. The uniforms of the 29th century stafleet (as portrayed on voyager) were nothing like the ones used on the TNG enterprise.. yada yada yada...</dd>

<dd>Actually, original research <i>is</i> an issue. As things stand, the only sources cited by this article are simple galleries on a web site of pictures of Starfleet uniforms (not even actual screenshots from the shows, note), sans any descriptive text at all and sans anything that supports statements such as "Skirts were authorized for women, however, these were optional and uncommon." made by this article. This article should cite far better sources, to indicate that this isn't a novel synthesis and analysis of pictures of Starfleet uniforms.

<dd>Hmmm.... Uniforms' colors and shapes are visible on the show. Picard does wear red unlike Kirk who wore yellow. In TNG yellow is the engineering &amp; security divisions color. Skirts appeared very rarely on non TOS era series such as TNG or even on Voyager. Actual screenshots are visible throughout wikipedias character articles. I am not certain how to present screenshot info on the article since just in TNG there are like four different uniforms... (duty, dress, etc...)

Yes the Uniforms' colors and shapes are visible on the show (and in the galleries you've linked)... but by creating an article describing these uniforms based on the pictures, you are performing an act of original research and is explicitly refered to in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy <i>"Pictures are generally used for illustration and do not propose unpublished ideas or arguments..."</i>).

<dd>Article does need better citation (just like all articles), I am not arguing about that. But original research means that I and other contributor(s) are making it all up which isn't the case. Furhermore tha article has only been around for like a day so I do not think it is prudent to expect proper citation.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, Again, I think you misunderstand the concept of original research as it relates to Wikipedia. Original research does not mean "made up". It means that contributors have crafted an article that is not based on external sources... it is in fact based on their <i>own research</i> into a topic. If you can find an external website that describes these uniforms in detail, this would be a perfectly acceptible article, but as it stands, basing these descriptions off of images or viewing the show is expressly prohibited by the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> policy. Furthermore, I don't agree with your contention that we cannont expect proper citation because the article has only been around for a day. The article should have never been created <i>without</i> proper citation. I speak only for myself here, but I'm not a fan of the concept of letting an article sit out in the main space unsourced while we let the creators try to find sources that they should have been using to create the article. That is what we have sandboxes for.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:27, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> I didn't order anyone off Wikipedia, and "incivil" isn't a word; at least not in English. I suggested that you can take this information to a more appropriate venue - Memory Alpha. Don't take it personally, and don't act like this is some fight between you and me. Do you honestly not understand the difference between US military ranks and Starfleet Uniforms? Are you telling me they're equally encyclopedic? I don't even know what "the creators of the who have said that 'sex appeal' on TOS was an important factor" is supposed to mean.

<dd>Of course there are differences between starfleet ranks and US naval ranks however they are fundementaly simmilar. The starfleet ranks were derived from the US mil ranks which I believe were derived from british ranks. Notability is a binary concept on wikipedia. Something is either encyclopedic or it isnt.

<dd>The approach to costumes on TOS and TNG were significantly different. Picard was bald for instance. "sex apeal" returned with seven of nine and later t'pol. This is only one of the interesting issues that shaped star trek costumes on different serries which can be covered on this article.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, now we are getting somewhere. I'm not familiar with these books offhand, but if they contain an actual discription of the uniforms, that would be a source, they could be referenced in a bibliography (meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), and this article would no longer be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. I suggest adding these sources to the article (and any others you are aware of), using reference tags to show which uniform descriptions are based on sources as opposed to original research... when I get a chance this weekend I will look into those you've listed. I'm not concerned with the quality of the article (it can always be tagged for cleanup) just that it meets the big 2 policies of verification and no original research.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:42, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>morwen I am sorry but almost all of the books are considered semi-cannon including that one. Often certain "facts" about the series conflict in such books such as in rank insignias.

<dd>No it isn't. The TV show is the primary source. Not everything that appears on a show is avalible in written media as copyrights for one prohibit it. Orriginal requires a work to be published, the TV shows are published. And in the case of Star Trek it was published internationaly. This is ridiclous. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 17:19, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You obviously have no experience in academia. Original research is the creation of a secondary source from primary sources. Primary sources include letters, journals, newspapers, and television shows. Orignial research is what forms the basis for the majority of mongraphs and journal articles and the like on a variety of topics. An encyclopedia article, on the other hand, is drawn primarily from secondary sources. There is nothing wrong, to be sure, with using primary sources to further inform an existing article, but the basis of that article should be information that has already been synthezised in a secondary source. This article comes entirely from watching the television show and reporting what the article creator observed. It is factual and verifiable, but it is still an original work of scholarship that therefore violates policy. When someone writes a book or journal article or research paper on Star Trek uniforms, then it will fulfill the requirement of no original research. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 18:08, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The uniforms of Star Trek characters do not meet Wikipedia's notability criteria. Star Trek does; that's not what I'm disputing. Sources showing the uniforms aren't sufficient to establish it. The question here is: "What is significantly notable about the costumes used in Star Trek?" Changing color and design over a period of decades is no big deal. What sets this apart from costuming in other productions?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Aksi_great and also the fact that the link indicates that the mayoralty is very coveted, as can be seen from the fact that large political parties like the BJP organise the candidate for it. And if the city council does get to do what Doctorbruno says, like water and land reform, builiding bridges, then surely ruling over 5 million people doing this kind of stuff is even more notable than most backbench, junior MPs in the Indian Parliament who are entilted to their article? <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 02:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Accusing the authors of this article of <i>created as flammable article by authors</i> is not assuming good faith. I did not create this article as flammable article. It was a process of creating individual State terrorism articles by country to better organize <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a>. No one claimed when I created <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism_in_Syria_709d.html" title="State terrorism in Syria">State terrorism in Syria</a> of creating a flammable article but when it is about the US, hell breaks loose and I become a biased author.

<dd>I counted one reputable source. Look, there are plenty of things the US government sponsored at various points, it shouldn't be hard to find reliable sources for quotes. I see two problems: 1) some of the incidents mentioned would not sourced to my satisfaction if I were to convince myself that they happened at all, and 2) other incidents that surely happened are supported only weakly. The best change for this article is a complete rewrite. Failing that, half the sections should be deleted, twice as many added, and sources should be used for everything. If you'd like to salvage the article, why don't you do it now -- it it's done well I'll change my vote, and others may also do so.

<dd>If you're talking about merging - I think this article's title is preferable to the ambiguous and vague "American Terrorism". This article's title conforms with a standard wording used for other article's on other nation's. Anyway, the article content deals with terrorist acts carried out by the US government, rather than 'America' as a whole, which to me sounds like a racial slur. I equally would not like to see an article on "Irish Terrorism" or "Jewish Terrorism", however, well sourced NPOV content under the heading "State terrorism by the Republic of Ireland" or "State terrorism by Israel" would be acceptable.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 15:26, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This AFD is not on my intent, it is on the subject matter. I did not hide why I created this article like others, if you are going quote me them quote me fully. This is what I said in the reason for creating this article <i>Per discussion on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a> I have been peeling off by country each so called incident to make it easy for us to edit the main page. So far I have created State terrorism in Syria and Sri Lanka, looks like the consensus on both will be to keep them, hence this explosive article which is nothing but a copy of what was already there in List of State terrorism by country. My eventual aim I to have an article by every country in the world and categories under state terrorism to categorize all different incidents, ......

<dd><b>Comment</b> Nothing POV about this title, or State terrorism by Canada, State terrorism by Sweden, State terrorism by Ukraine, State terrorism by Japan, State terrorism by Israel, or State terrorism by India. The "domestic" viewpoint--that is, the 'home' view of the government or local media of that nation--has no role in determining what is considered state terrorism, really. Would domestic Canadian media or government in 99% of cases even refer to it's actions as state terrorism? Or any other nation? Of course not. To call the US article POV and unsalvageable is simply patriotic bluster. I love America, I live here, but if a sanctioned United Nations court said something we did for example is terrorism, guess what? It's terrorism. Editorial/domestic POV has no place in the content or name of an article. Facts are facts--whether they are locally disliked facts are irrelevant, I'm unhappy to admit. The article needs to stay, as do the others from the original forking based on this. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 22:20, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> From Bookmasters.com <b>Edward Herman</b>, Professor Emeritus Whalen School of the University of Pennsylvania:<i>In his State Terrorism and the United States, Frederick Gareau shows that, contrary to the war on terror imagery of a United States hostile to terrorism and dedicated to its elimination and to democracy-building, this country has regularly supported state terrorists (and dictators) who serve U.S. economic and political interests. Using as his evidentiary base the truth commission reports that have followed the ouster of terror regimes in El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile, Argentina and South Africa, along with a varied array of sources for Indonesia, Israel, Iraq (until August 1990), and Nicaragua, he makes his case for vital U.S. support for these regimes compellingly and soberly. Gareau stresses throughout how little the U.S. public is permitted to hear about what its government has done, which provides a cover for actions the public might well disapprove, and he ends with an appeal for a much needed truth commission for the United States itself. This book is a valuable addition to the literature on terrorism.</i>Frederick Gareau himself is full tenured professor at Florida State University and holds a PhD from Amrican University. 216.95.23.6 13:52, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Just a note to all, please review article as it exists today--the sources listed I believe are somewhat different than when this AfD was filed. At best I can personally see just copyediting and structure/form issues of the article now, but it does meet all WP policies (upon which the AfD should be based).

<dd>User:Karwynn, Amen to that. I agree. I have lost several article to POV warriors. I made a list in my archive. I also agree this article should be renamed, to a less POV term, and a less AfD prone title. This is something I will address after this AfD is behind us. User:Seabhcan, this article does have POV, and it needs to be edited by competent conservatives to give it balance. The <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladio.html" title="Gladio">Gladio</a> section is suspect, and may not even belong in the article, so is my Naom Chomsky quote. (I thought it was an excellent point, and I did not want to be accused of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> so I was forced to add the lightning of controvery, <a href="../../../n/a/o/Naom_Chomsky_28ef.html" title="Naom Chomsky">Naom Chomsky</a>, who I attempt to not quote directly or at all, if at all possible.)

<dd>I'm not saying its perfect, but it drives me crazy when voters cite 'POV' without explaining what they are refering to. As for the Gladio section, I believe it is the clearest and best documented example in the article. Counter examples are certainly needed, and infact, the Gladio example is probably the best place because although it certainly did exist, there is a case to be made that it was necessary at the time to defend against the greater evil of a soviet invasion.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 22:40, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I apologize for the delay. I would say an "accusations of" or "allegations of" in the title would do a lot of good, as in <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_war_crimes_against_U.S._officials_176b.html" title="Allegations of war crimes against U.S. officials">Allegations of war crimes against U.S. officials</a>. Additionally, there is little or no refutations of several of these claims. It doesn't represent all sides. <b>But these are problems that should be worked out, not used as an excuse to delete.</b> I say merge because the two articles seem almost identical.

<dd>You make good points. Yes, such a name change would be fine by me, if we also rename the other articles on syria, etc. I also agree that the opposing view. I'll try and find sources for them. I think the merge is fine, but I think this article title, or a variation, is better than the vague and slightly insulting "American terrorism". <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 22:40, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agreed, about the refutations part. Re: <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_war_crimes_against_U.S._officials_176b.html" title="Allegations of war crimes against U.S. officials">Allegations of war crimes against U.S. officials</a> <b>First</b> I do not like the word "allegations" because it is a <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">WP:Weasel Word</a>, and I have actively attempted to delete this personally despised word from wikipedia, along with "claims" etc. "Claims" and "alleged" is a common word of POV warriors, in an attempt to lessen the statments of those who disagree with their own POV. <b>Second</b> we are not discussing war crimes per say, but terrorism, as the dictionary and the US government define it. I simply don't know what word we can replace with "terrorism". I think an alternative to a name change may be a long introduction like <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_empire.html" title="American empire">American empire</a>. But the word "terrorism" is so politically charged, like the word "imperialism" the word "(terrorism) is more often the name of the emotion that reacts to a series of events than a definition of the events themselves. Where colonization finds analysts and analogies, imperialism must contend with crusaders for and against." <b>Is there a less emotional term we can use for terrorism?</b> Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 22:19, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Then it has to be somehing els that makes it legitimit to be in Wikipedia, could it be the fact that it actually exists and that a encyclopedia should (as far as im concerned) keep articels about facts.

<p>autobiography; many parts unverifiable or false; non-notable if false claims removed. Author removed prod and responded that claims were true, but has failed (so far) to verify important content. The subject appears to be a young man in the Jacksonville, Florida area who was verifiably a member of a local soil conservation district board, where he was <a href="http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=657" class="external text" title="http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=657" rel="nofollow">accused of misusing funds.</a> He later launched a campaign for City Council, abandoned that, and ran for state legislature unsuccessfully. He is a member of a local environmental advisory board, an appointive position. Various claims in the article are difficult or impossible to verify; as far as I can tell, there is no show named "Splat" on Nickelodeon, now or in the recent past. <a href="http://wat.midco.net/jvipond/gameshow/1shot_hosts.html" class="external text" title="http://wat.midco.net/jvipond/gameshow/1shot_hosts.html" rel="nofollow">One random not-very-reliable-looking list online</a> claims it was a one-shot game show (with Rahman as host), which is very different from the claim in the article. A local Jacksonville source lists an appearance by Rahman and that he is the host of <i>Splat</i> - but why only one such online source, and in his home town? The "Telly Award" appears to be somewhat of a scam; you pay to enter, you pay for the statues - here is the page listing <i>Build Your Future</i> as a winner, and notice that the long list is only <i>some</i> of the winners starting with the letter 's', for 2005! I don't think there is an ABC series named "Sheena!" He is not listed among the cast members of "Full Time Felon", even among the minor cast members. Etc. Etc. I have been unable to verify the claim about the listing in Ebony; various local media have different stories: in some, the claim is that he was named one of Jacksonville's upcoming black leaders; in others one of <i>Florida's</i> upcoming black leaders; and in some 'one of 30 upcoming black leaders'. And so on.... Sorry for the long entry, but there are a lot of claims, and the article seems to be a complex mixture of exaggeration, truth, and probable lies. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 20:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

The "random not-very-reliable-looking list" is not a list of game shows that produced only one episode, but a list of game show hosts who only hosted one game show. (Example: <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louie_Anderson_c959.html" title="Louie Anderson">Louie Anderson</a>, who is on the list, has hosted <i>Family Feud</i> and no other game shows, but he hosted <i>Family Feud</i> for several years.)

<li>The business week link mentions only that he plays online, something 200,000 people will do today. Two years before his cheating incident he just happened to be mentioned in the article, not because he was "somebody". Being caught cheating in poker is something that will happen to a few dozen people today. Being public about being caught does not suddenly make this run of the mill activity notable. If it did, the article should be one sentence about his cheating, with a reference to where he allegedly admits it. Not one other aspect of this person merits mention in an article. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 21:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Some people don't seem to realize just how big a story this was in the poker world. Justin was widely regarded as one of the best online poker plays in the world, and so his getting outed for cheating was a major event. It was published in many poker news sources, and garnered one of the largest threads ever in <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Plus_Two_Publishing_7626.html" title="Two Plus Two Publishing">Two_Plus_Two_Publishing</a>'s forums. It might not have been notable to most Wikipedians, but it certainly was notable to poker. If there are problems with vandalism and sources, fix them, but not with {{subst:afd}}. Quill E. Coyote 09:03, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Calling it a big story is a major exaggeration. Sure, the teenagers on some forums obsessed over it, but the reality is that it was just common cheating. Regardless of how big or little that incident was though, he has no <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> compliant notability. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 09:10, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Have you read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>? It mentions notability several times, but I don't see where it suggests Justin isn't notable enough to have a Wikipedia article. The first mention says that we can use an article's subject as a source. All this means is that we can use Justin's website for information on his notable cheating and success at poker. The second mention talks about using public records such as court filings as sources, and since none are used in this article, I don't see how that relates. The third says that we must show restraint in what sources we use and what information we publish about non-public figures. We meet that standard, and whether or not Justin is a public figure is questionable, since he has attempted to create and market the 'Zeejustin' brand. The third mention talks about dates of birth, but we don't include Justin's birthdate, even though it's fairly well known. The fourth talks about malicious editing. I'm not familiar enough with this article's history to know if it's been edited maliciously, but if there was, there are better ways to deal with it than deleting the article. The fourth mention talks about using critics as sources, but I don't think we used any for this article. What is there in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> that suggests we shouldn't have an article about Justin?</li>

<p>This is a dual nomination; both this article and <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Freeman_06bf.html" title="Mike Freeman">Mike Freeman</a> appear to be about the same person.

I doubt if British porn directors merits a page, especially if it's all about one person setting out to publicise jhis own activities. Hwever, a category might (and I just say "might") be justified. "Truth or dare" scores 1.2 million ghits, mostly for being a party game or a Madonna film. No sign of the alleged movie directed by him per Google. As to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeman.html" title="Freeman">Mike Freeman</a>, it seems like quite a common name, but only 170,000 Ghits. quite a few for sportswriter, doctor, and actor in 1968 movie 'The Killing of Sister George', but none for this particular one. Being named "erotic film director of the year 1982 by Tuppy Owens the radical sex worker" does not make him notable per <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>. Nor does being imprisoned under the Obscene publications act, I'm afraid. However, according to a search in <a href="http://www.bgafd.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.bgafd.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">BGAFD</a>, he has made tens of movies, but 'Truth or dare' is not credited to him.

<dd>How students have misconceptions about chemistry is a significant part of research in chemical education, a field of study that has grown significantly in the last few years. The article can be verified by reference to this published research like any article on any kind of research. Why do you think it is a problem? Indeed I was partly wrong above. The article does have references to articles including to two in the Journal of Chemical Education. That journal often has articles about research on the misconceptions that chemistry students have.--<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 12:00, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No worries. Could I make the point that this article should not be like "Misconceptions about HIV" or similar. It should be discussing the large body of educational research that studies the ways students have misconceptions about the material they are taught that gets in the way of them learning.

<li><b>Comment from Author</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I appreciate everyone's comments. I am a pre-service teacher completing an assignment for my Science Methods in Education class. Originally, I did not include my references (this was a mistake that I quickly corrected). As for the chart, it is my own summary of work from several sources. Granted, the visual quality is poor becuase I saved it from a MS Word document as a GIF (couldn't think think of a better way, but I really wanted to preserve the style which nicely contrasts accepted and alternative conceptions in chemistry) If I have read the OR Wiki correctly then it does not fit as Original Research. The purpose of this articles was to add to the limited base of knowledge available to the general public and hopefully other teachers. Suggestions are welcome, thanks&#160;!!!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Encyclopedic topic, and it has actual reliable sources, which is more that can be said about most articles on AfD. Needs cleanup, obviously. My suggestion: drop the chart and use the text as part of the article, so that people can edit it. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 19:51, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>&#160;: On reviewing this article, I have come to the conclusion that it should be considered to be Original Research.</p>
<p>A Wikipedia article on crime in a certain country and/or a certain period should base itself on criminology studies, or news articles giving an overview about crime. In this case, press articles on individual crimes must be considered primary sources, that should be analysed and synthesised, and upon which conclusions should be drawn. This analysis, this synthesis, these conclusions are original research. Wikipedia is no place for that. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucVerhelst_3fe1.html" title="User:LucVerhelst">LucVerhelst</a> 21:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> ME - This article is about me. Much of it is, admittedly and candidly, too personal, from my publisher's web site, tracing back to my own organization's site, up on the nef for more than ten years. The Bibliography is something I wrote for the information of Wikipediareaders. It is entirely factual. For the record, a casual scan of Google or Amazon.com will show that I am a rather well-known and controversial author on occultism, UFOs and similar subjects. I have repeatedly asked associates to clean the piece up technically (I do not have the skill) and to revise it to include critical material from various points of view. It is not a "vanity" piece by any standard of self-promotion in any sense, though I am gratified that there is an entry about me, I think *an* entry is merited, and I myself am much in favor of including some critical study as well as a healthy clean-up. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllengreenfield_d05b.html" title="User:Allengreenfield">Allengreenfield</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllengreenfield_c98e.html" title="User talk:Allengreenfield">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Allengreenfield_9c06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Allengreenfield">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>It seems I mistaked the article's discussion page for this one. I take mild offense at the fact that you would insinuate I deleted comments from here or that my removal of the page was vandalism as it's obvious by the discussion page at PSentry that I was attempting to discuss the issue at hand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PSentry is somewhat notable in the Corporate and specifically the Corporate Security sectors as being a more indepth piece of security software, both in network blocking and in logging capabilities than Websense. Just because it doesn't show up in a "google" doesn't mean it isn't notable. Due to the nature of this product, it was marketed directly to my CMO, and he passed it down the line to me. I get the suspicion that this is how it's generally used and thus its web presence is de-emphasized as you've seen in your google results. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdealistic_cynic_6fa4.html" title="User:Idealistic cynic">Idealistic cynic</a> 17:56, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Ah, a second note, sorry about that. I've now fully read up on the policy, I had yet to learn that AfD's should stay up for 5 days or that they had their own specific discussion pages. I apologize for removing it, but as the saying goes, don't attribute to malice what could more easily be attributed to ignorance. Well, that's not the saying, but it makes me seem a little better&#160;;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't really see this piece of software as being any less notable than say...<a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28anime%29.html" title="Bleach (anime)">Bleach_(anime)</a> or any number of other articles here on wikipedia. It applies to a very specific subset and Wikipedia is known for covering even the most trivial details extensively. If there's any doubt there, check the almost complete episode guide with detailed description for every single episode of the Simpsons, Family Guy, or Futurama among others.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This doesn't appear to be that much different than those examples, or many of the hundreds of other examples here on Wikipedia. I can tell you if this page had been around when my CMO asked me about "some PSentry product" it'd have made things a hell of a lot easier for me as a network manager and for anyone involved in the corresponding meeting where we discussed our filtering solutions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I don't really see non-notability mentioned on the articles for deletion, but as I said in my previous post this isn't the type of software that's even heavily known about. It doesn't produce websense pages, it just produces blank pages and logs large amounts of content. Hope that helps. -- <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdealistic_cynic_6fa4.html" title="User:Idealistic cynic">Idealistic cynic</a> 18:16, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just used the standard "don't remove AfD tags" template, and the wording is not always ideal. I meant no offense by it.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia has guidelines on the notability of software at <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, though I should emphasise that these are currently <i>proposed</i> guidelines only, not yet official policy. The alarm bell with this article was rung by how it started off reading strongly as an advertisement and was created by a user new to Wikipedia, which is often a sign of someone signing up with the sole purpose of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">promoting</a> their own/their company's product/service. The article has been improved since, as stated the my opening rationale, but I decided to go ahead with an AfD to obtain the community's opinion.</dd>
<dd>As an IT professional myself I am familiar with a number of internet content filtering packages intended for corporate networks. The "Google test" is not <i>the</i> definitive test of notability in all areas, but in IT-related subjects it has proven itself a useful guide at the very least. Googling for <i>Censornet</i> (another corporate filter) returns 281,000 hits, <i>Surfcontrol</i> (another) over 1.5million, and <i>Websense</i> (yet another) over 4million, while <i>PSentry</i> returns 1,170 (with a number of obviously unrelated pages on programming in the first page of results).</dd>
<dd>Putting ascertaining the notability aside, the other problem with the article, I feel, is in finding third-party <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> of the facts therein (the all-important "multiple non-trivial published works"); a critically important factor in any Wikipedia article regardless of the subject. There is a stronger case for keeping the article if third-party reviews of this product can be found and cited (by which I mean an independent critical review - the paragraph on CNet is just the publisher's blurb). ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 19:26, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't really believe that there's too strong of a case for deleting the article wholly, in all honesty. I think the sources could use a bit of work, but we've got a category specifically made to deal with that particular problem. By mention of the google test, I meant to say that google isn't always an adequate test for notability within some domains. I work for a Fortune 500 company where software like this is often promoted and this particular package isn't exactly unheard of around here. Granted, this is a US Company and this is a US Product so that could explain why you've yet to read or hear too much about it being in the UK.</dd>

<dd>I think your concerns about spam and marketing were originally valid, and I have had to deal with a slight bit of vandalism in that regards already, but I don't believe the page itself is without merits. In addition, if it's a marketing move it may not be a particular good one as the types of people that can purchase contracts like these don't exactly look at Wikipedia for their product decisions. I've added the page to my watchlist just incase to ensure that no further vandals can get at the page, but it could have been a misinformed user as well. It's difficult to know exactly how to label someone when all you have from them are direct edits with no context.</dd>

<dd>To sum up this long winded response: It's my personal opinion that we should mark the page with "verify sources" and let it go from there. The page certainly contains at least a bit of merit, and we should be wary of making the barrier of entry for new pages to even exist too high. Otherwise, we may stand to lose what could be beneficial contributors over small issues that could be dealt with before deletion was ever required. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdealistic_cynic_6fa4.html" title="User:Idealistic cynic">Idealistic cynic</a> 19:45, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's been a week exacctly since this article was put into AfD. Matticus and I have both discussed the merits and flaws of the article and come to the consensus that it should be kept but with a sources needed tag. No other contributors have really chipped in and the article appears to have stabilized across edits.</p>
<p>I'll still be keeping it on my watchlist for the next couple of months just to ensure there isn't any future vandalism or marketing hype. Thanks. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdealistic_cynic_6fa4.html" title="User:Idealistic cynic">Idealistic cynic</a> 02:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - You are right. There was no consensus on the last afd. I apologize for my error. General criteria for speedy deletion #4 provide for recreated deleted article. Whatever happened last time, this article still has to follow Wikipedia criteria of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. It's hard to do that without adding outside links to multiple independent sources. It's very important for Wikipedia articles to meet these to be a credible source, as it aims to be.

<li><b>Sources were Edited out Unknowingly</b> We did have sources from the beginning, but during the first few minutes of inputting the article, Justin deleted the text. This was biased and unprofessional. We didn't knkow about it until later, and immediately worked to restructure the araticle. But, you are absolutely correct that the sources ought to be in from the beginning. I am trying to fix that now. Regarding podcasts, one source is a podcast by R.U. Sirius who is well-known author. Podcasts are valuable current-day methods for interviewing. But if you are unaware of cyberculture and lastest technologies then it would seem strange. If you like, I can defend podcasts are a viable source for journalism and research. <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvantguarde_935a.html" title="User:Avantguarde">Avantguarde</a>

<li><b>check the history</b> I can't see any references in the history. I do, however, see references there now, so I shall change my vote.

<li>Please do not delete this article. My name is Carlos Duran and I am the marketing director for the GSFE. This article was created by a member of our exchange. I do not know how to directly contact you, but if you can contact me at carlosd@allsportsmarket.com and provide instructions I will supply academic articles on the GSFE from doctorate members of the UCLA economics department along with documentation from US Lobbying and legal firms as to the function and purpose of the GSFE.
<p>I can also provide various media reports on the GSFE/ASM platform including one from the NYSE floor in Wall Street, this report was aired on Channel 11 WPIX in NY,NY.</p>
<p>I am asking that you provide a way that I can supply this documentation for your review. It seems that the person(s) who have been accusing us of fraudulent activities and erasing the entry to put up a libelous script are set with malignant intent. It is our belief that this person(s) were found to be violating exchange trade policy and are now resorting to a vengful response.</p>
<p>Please give us a fair chance to show Wikipedia what the GSFE is. My email is Carlosd@allsportsmarket.com</p>

<p><i>That is funny. I wonder what my real boyfriend would say to that. Now, with regard to my "agenda" or my "libelous" comments (I can only speak for myself), everyone is able to read what I posted in the article disputed here. In contrast to you, I included a few external references. I have many more, and I can also scan offline evidence and post it for everyone to see if that's what you want. The only "agenda" that could be attributed to me is the decision that I am not going to tolerate any longer how you scam people again and again (you know as much as I do that ASM / GSFE is not your first fraudulent business). For plenty of years, I have been enjoying Wikipedia as a user and felt too much respect for the work of others to even try to write my own articles on whatever subject. I know that there are tons of talented Wikipedia users out there who can do much better than I could. But now that you openly decided to abuse Wikipedia for one of your (in-)famous marketing campaigns, I had to step in and so had others. I did not come here first and post "libelous" stuff. YOUR team started the whole thing without checking first what Wikipedia is all about. I will be totally fine if the ultimate decision will be to remove everything. Stuff like that simply DOES NOT belong on Wikipedia (some of the other users here please correct me if I am wrong. As I said, I'm more a reader here, not a writer).</i> waiwiki80 21:38, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Regardless of whether or not the article passes WP:CORP and/or WP:WEB, and regardless of whether the two latest recommendations of deletion are indeed "out to get you", as is claimed, as a general rule, articles should not be written by people associated with the article's subject. Since it very much appears that users on your site were offered incentives for creating and contributing to this article, I strongly doubt whether this article can remain neutral should it survive AfD. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">theProject</a> 18:20, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It is true we offered an incentive to any trader who provided an accurate entry into Wikipedia. At the time I was not familiar with all the Wikipedia requirements that I have now become familiar with. This was not done as a marketing stunt; it was done because I am not technically inclined and we all love Wikipedia so I thought it only fair to offer something of appreciation for someone who took the time to create the entry. I can guarantee that ASM/GSFE will work with Wikipedia to provide a neutral and accurate article and keep it that way. I would like to point out that because of the growing trader base on our exchange it is difficult to say that no one associated with our exchange will contribute. Both GSFE and Wikipedia are part of a global community. I also think this unfair because, as an example, I would think that patrons of McDonalds contribute to the McDonalds entry as I am sure those who fly on planes contribute to the entries regarding Boeing. However if we can not reach a harmonious agreement as to the GSFE/ASM entry we simply ask that no entry be allowed in regard to our exchange, most specifically those that are libelous and unsubstantiated. I would also offer to put any Wikipedia administrator in contact with both our US Government Affairs contact and our legal firm in Virginia.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I would like to present the following media archive with two separate T.V. news stories covering ASM/GSFE. Please let me know if these meet the requirements of WP:Corp. Thank you.

<p>And in the hope of further shedding light on what the GSFE is I offer the below link to a paper written by Dr. Alper Ozgit (PhD UCLA Economics). Here Dr. Alper writes on what is ASM/GSFE; along with its purpose and place among financial markets and its social and economic functions.</p>

<p>OK, your objections are logical and article will be probably kept. But as a Czech citizen I can assure you that the last sentence in the article was total nonsense (I have already removed it) and the whole article is intentionally written to look professionaly while in fact it is a bad joke. "The symbol isn't included in Unicode" sentence is just ridiculous. This is not a real accepted symbol - it's just a simplified drawing of cunt (this word is most similar to piča) used mostly by teenagers. Also, correct title of article should be piča (píča is used only by minority of Czechs). I have nothing against vulgarisms and I use them too. I just nominated this article for deletion because I was afraid it could be taken seriously by English readers while in fact it is rubbish.--Jakub Jindra 22:02, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
