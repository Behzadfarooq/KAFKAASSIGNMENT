<li><b>Delete</b> this one, but something based on a single freedom ranking and clearly identified as such would be acceptable. The most worrisome aspect of this article for me is how it "combines" two rankings. Plus, as others have said, declaring that such-and-such country is "free" is inherently POV.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Original research and POV as presented. It is original research because the article editors have arbitrarily chosen the measures of freedom to include, and decided what the cutoff scores on each measure should be for inclusion in the list of 'free' countries. If someone wants to write a Measures of freedom article (or better, include it as a section in the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom.html" title="Freedom">Freedom</a> article itself) then write <i>about</i> these metrics; don't process them further. It's also worth noting that full data for two of the three metrics (the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Index_of_Economic_Freedom_94d2.html" title="Index of Economic Freedom">Index of Economic Freedom</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reporters_Without_Borders_f790.html" title="Reporters Without Borders">Worldwide Press Freedom Index</a> are already included in Wikipedia. The third (<i>Freedom in the World</i>) is linked from the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_House_082a.html" title="Freedom House">Freedom House</a> article. The article as it stands leaves you wondering about the countries left off the list—were they excluded due to a lack of social freedom, economic freedom, press freedom...or all of the above? Why is <i>mostly free</i> an acceptable level of economic freedom? Deciding that a specific threshold on these metrics is 'free' is irredeemably POV. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 17:17, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>And this article explains how <i>very different</i> they are. Lets see: 1. they have different names, 2. the plots are not identical; they battle evil in two slightly different ways, 3. digimon speak a real language (most notable difference listed), 4. their individual names are a bit different, 5. they evolve in slightly different ways, 6. they are not identical in every way, 7. digimon are sometimes scarier. Wow. Yes, when something rips off a popular idea, they don't copy it 100%. We get the idea. I suppose we'll be seeing difference pages for "Go-bots and Transformers", "7-Up and Sierra Mist", "Lord of the Rings and Sword of Shannara", "According to Jim and King of Queens", ad nauseam.

<li>Differences between X and Y are not generally encyclopedic. If one is clearly a derivative of the other, and there is a large chance of mistaking one for the other, some non-obvious differences may be considered for listing under that article.

<ul>
<li>I think we're revolving around the same arguments here. IMHO, the role of Wikipedia is not to make this obvious through an individual article, even to someone who hasn't seen the shows. Users should be perfectly able to read the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digimon.html" title="Digimon">Digimon</a> pages and draw the differences themselves. If there's any risk of confusion, one could simply add a <i>"Not to be confused with ..."</i> line on the top of the main article. The point of the irony above was this: if we establish a precedent for such separate articles, what would stop us from creating them <i>ad nauseum</i>, for instance, for every sequel of every movie? There are obvious plot, casting, production differences between "Alien", "Aliens" and "Alien<sup>3</sup>", not to mention blatant stylistic differences due to the fact that each had a different director; and their names are so similar someone who hasn't seen any of the movies could easily get confused. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv">vlad_mv</a> 14:57, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think the users would thank you for making them wade through a 37k page when a summary of the differences was already available somewhere else. Differences between items in a series like Alien could and should be discussed in the main article of that series. Why should someone who's interested in the development of that series have to 5 read separate articles with repeated information? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:42, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see your point, but that's a different claim: namely, that the Alien Series should have a separate article, because all movies taken together do form a notable unity. For the sake of concision, I'll leave that discussion aside for the moment. But I'll grant that: if we all agreed that such a page should exist, I'd be the first to approve discussion of the differences between the movies there. Now, coming back to the issue: are we prepared to say that Pokémon and Digimon form a coherent and notable unity? I would say no, at least not in the same way as the Alien Series obviously does. And if the answer is no, the comparison page should be ruled out. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv">vlad_mv</a> 00:02, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>A work and it's ripoff(s) work form a unity. Even if they aren't a ripoff, they are two things of the same kind, like Judaism and Christianity, which we have an [[<a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparing_and_contrasting_Judaism_and_Christianity_1202.html" title="Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity">article</a> comparing. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 09:17, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact the two things are "of the same kind" is not sufficient to say that they form a unity. Oranges and apples are of the same kind and do not form such unity - which means, if we allow a Comparison of apples and oranges page, we might as well have to allow a Comparison of cuccumber and squash, Comparison of parsley and chives, etc. Neither do Blanche DuBois and Scarlet O'Hara, for that matter. The list of counterexamples could go on indefinetly. The fact that it is a ripoff (if it indeed is) is not sufficient either. IMHO, the comparison with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparing_and_contrasting_Judaism_and_Christianity_1202.html" title="Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity">Judaism and Christianity</a> seems to show clearly why we shouldn't allow this one, and not the opposite. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv">vlad_mv</a> 10:04, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Apples and oranges do not form a unity by themselves, but they belong to the unity <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruit.html" title="Fruit">fruit</a> and do not resemble each other very much within that realm. Apples and pears resemble each other quite a lot, and I'm disappointed to see nothing discussing the difference between them in <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pome.html" title="Pome">pome</a>. Similarly <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gourd.html" title="Gourd">gourd</a> should discuss differences between melons, squashes and cucumbers. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:06, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have fixed the article considerably since it was proposed as a candidate for deletion. Regarding Reene's prior comments, the forum is the main forum, so it is a valuble external link and not just an advertisement. Please see <a href="http://s7.invisionfree.com/Antineopian/index.php?showtopic=298" class="external text" title="http://s7.invisionfree.com/Antineopian/index.php?showtopic=298" rel="nofollow">the post Reene made on the forum</a> and you can determine yourself which post has more POV. --<a href="../../../t/e/z/User%7ETezeti_fecf.html" title="User:Tezeti">Tezeti</a> 16:47, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, No-More-Neopets.tk is owned by Mae_Noelle and the forum is basically owned by a group of Administrators. I agree that maybe the geocities link should not have been there, so I removed it. However, I believe this article is written in a neutral manner and contributes information to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/e/z/User%7ETezeti_fecf.html" title="User:Tezeti">Tezeti</a> 16:47, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would not make self-promotion pages on Wikipedia, since it is an online encyclopedia and not a forum or blog. This is a group of people, of which there were over 100 of at one point, and I am simply stating their beliefs and history of the movement. --<a href="../../../t/e/z/User%7ETezeti_fecf.html" title="User:Tezeti">Tezeti</a> 16:47, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I know of at least 10 other Antineopian sites, however I chose to include the most viewed ones in this entry, which excludes my own web page. --<a href="../../../t/e/z/User%7ETezeti_fecf.html" title="User:Tezeti">Tezeti</a> 16:47, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Thanks for explaining this all, but this whole movement still doesn't seem very notable to me. You say there were over 100 people at one point, which indicates that the movement was never that large to begin with, and is already on its decline. Checking the Antineopian forum, I find 26 members only. That's not much for an internet forum.<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 21:00, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The membership is not declining, the reason that the membership has been reduced is that the original forum has been shut down for unknown reasons. Therefore, many of the members could not find this new one. The forum was started about one month ago and already has 26 members. I know of over 10 websites made by different users that are dedicated solely to Anti-Neopets. --<a href="../../../t/e/z/User%7ETezeti_fecf.html" title="User:Tezeti">Tezeti</a> 21:41, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Which indicates a whole 10 people are pissed off enough about being frozen to create a hate website and rant about how much Neopets sucks, the claims they make varying in veracity and some of them being outright false and slanderous. Even then, 100 members is not a lot when you consider how many users use Neopets. I could whip up 10 good looking anti-Tezeti websites in under a day (and wouldn't need to use free web hosts like Geocities to do it, as most/all of these so-called anti-neopets websites do). So could we then add the Anti-Tezeti article to the 'pedia? (note that I'm being facetious.)</li>

<li>Those aren't "negative votes", people are merely pointing out the history of the user. The number of edits they have made is very relevant to the voting process, as it is standard procedure here to allow the tallying administrator to discount the votes of new users if in his/her judgment these users appeared on Wikipedia merely to influence a particular vote and do nothing else.

<li>Actually, I didn't find one link that linked to a file inside of torrentmind. Torrentmind is only a forum, nothing else. If you are going to delete this, you might as well delete filesoup as well. It's only a forum. What could be changed in order to avoid deletion?
<ul>
<li>FYI: The above question was asked by the author of the article, Burgerpardis. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 05:46, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Good point, we might indeed delete filesoup as well. See below. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 12:39, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- Burgerpardis, why did you copy images from that web sites navigation bar and paste them directly into the article's body text? <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 05:46, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, First of all there is no direct link to the actual site. Second, where do we draw the line of what websites we should cover? Obviously their notability (or lack thereof) counts. How large should a community be before they deserve honorable mention? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> 12:19, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good question, actually. Let's see... websites (or forums) for bands, games, stores etc do not deserve a separate article, but should be listed under the article for that band, game, store, etc (and of course only if said b/g/s/etc deserves an article in the first place). Pure web <i>services</i> are only notable if known to the world outside the internet (e.g. eBay, Amazon, Google). The same would apply to pure chat or talk forums/boards (and they generally <i>aren't</i> known to anyone except their members). Even if a website is notable, a list of members or admins is not. This is of course IMHO. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 12:45, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And that means that Torrentmind should be <b>deleted</b> and that a link to the forum could be added to the main <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bittorrent.html" title="Bittorrent">Bittorrent</a> article if said forum is indeed notable among BT'ers. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 12:45, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would support moving this and the Filesoup article under the bittorrent article. I could edit the bittorrent one to include some community forums for Bittorrent technical help, which is what these sites really are about. Burgerpardis

<li>It makes no sense that suprnova.org has an entry, and filesoup can't. As said before, filesoup was founded before suprnova was even a thought. Burgerpardis
<ul>
<li>fixed, only one vote.

<li>Excellent point, Suprnova is now also nominated for deletion.

<li>We delete them in the order in which they were found, because that is the most convenient way of going around things.

<li><b>Delete</b> If a school is notable, and you have information establishing this, put that information into an article about the school. If you don't have information that establishes the notability of the school, you have no business listing it in this so-called "article". Moreover, whether a school is notable is an opinion. A list is not the place to express opinions, since the format is not consistent with presenting arguments and facts in support of the competing views. Since lists are binary and cannot both include the school and not include it at the same time, one point of view inevitably wins and the others lose. People with intermediate views cannot have their opinion represented at all. Such a list therefore is inconsistent with NPOV by its very nature. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:12, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just because they are integral to their communities does not make it notable on a world-wide level. Libraries are used in education, and are integral to their communities. Do we need an entry for every single library in every small little communitiy? I say no, only the large, significant ones.

<ul>
<li>I wouldn't use size as a criteria for grade schools. Rather it should have something that distinguishes it from the pack. Like offering a program that few other schools do. Or being the first school to reach some acheivement. Or being the top rated school on some prestigious list. Or it should be famous via the media (i.e. Columbine HS).<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 02:45, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This came up for deletion about 5 weeks ago (the discussion is on the talk page). It was deemed original research but several people said give it time and see if the original writer (FGVozza) integrates it into the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Argentina_b5df.html" title="Economy of Argentina">Economy of Argentina</a> article or somewhere else. Well it hasn't been touched. I gave it a better title, but other than that, it's the same page that came up to a vote a month ago. I say it's time to delete it. it's still original research. If someone can integrate it somewhere else, now's the time. Otherwise, I think it's time to delete this one. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 07:48, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I really do not understand what the fuss is about here. The article as written is factual, extremely interesting, and covers the last fifteen years of Argentine currency and monetary policy most effectively. In addition, it is presented in a very NPOV fashion, and both the pros and cons of the various stages of policy implementation are discussed. It has clearly been written after careful review of published information (see the bibliography), and I fail to see how one could write an intelligent article on this subject in any other way. You are saying it is "original research". I disagree. The "original research" articles that I see coming up on VfD are all pursuing a new line of thought, a theory, or a favorite hobby-horse, and are appropriately deleted as unencyclopedic. This is entirely different. I also find the "style editing" tag attached to the article inappropriate. Yes, the format could be improved, with better sub-heads, links to other articles and so on, but I personally find the style very apt, and it covers the subject better than the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Argentina_b5df.html" title="Economy of Argentina">Economy of Argentina</a> article does. I would not be surprised to read such an article in a published encyclopedia. As to the naming of the piece, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_Currency_Board_34fa.html" title="Argentine Currency Board">Argentine Currency Board</a> is perhaps not bad. I suppose it should be called Argentine exchange rate management 1991-2002, but Argentine Convertibility Plan might do the trick. <b>KEEP</b> <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 19:52, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Well it does qualify as original research. If you go to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a>, it clearly states that Wikipedia houses articles, not essays. Essays are considered original research. And this is an essay. It does cite sources, but it is not in the accepted Wikipedia format. The headers are essay headers, not headers in the headline style that Wikipedia uses. And the user has been given ample opportunity to change the article so it fits the Wikipedia format. Whether or not it is well written is not really the point. And it creates redundancy, especially since nothing even links to this page, so it's essentially an orphan. Not even the Economy of Argentina page links to this. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 22:11, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I disagree with your assessment of original research, and so does <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a>. You have chosen to take one single word -- "essay" -- from that page. The rest of it would clearly define this article as <b>not</b> original research. Look at the checklist under the heading "What is research and what is not" -- not one single point there would categorise it as original research. Not one. Would you rather an article cut and paste from a few web sites and change a few words to avoid copyvios? The subject of this article is complex -- there is no right and wrong, so the only way to write it is to visit source material and construct a balanced summary of it. That is NOT original research. The actual writing of it, and the structure, wikification, etc. clearly needs attention, but those are not reasons to delete it. I have undertaken a significant rewrite, improved the layout, added links, and so on. I would ask you all to please take a thorough look, revisit <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a> and reassess your votes. If there is a consensus to keep this, I will undertake, also, to establish category links and links from other wikipedia articles. Upon further reflection, I agree that the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_Currency_Board_34fa.html" title="Argentine Currency Board">Argentine Currency Board</a> title is best. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 13:39, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not "original research" as per that definition at all. Bad format of good content is not a reason to delete in itself - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 13:43, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> that the article is not <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original reserach</a>. It currently has more the style of an essay than of a Wikipedia encyclopedia article, but that can be rectified quite easily by editing. The Wikipedia stricture against original research is to prevent people from introducing original ideas, discoveries, etc into the Wikipedia that have not been vetted by peer review and/or public discussion. Encyclopedias are compilations of received knowledge, not journals for the announcement of new discoveries and original findings. But, of course, the injunction against <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> is not a prohibition of doing any research; indeed, Wikipedia articles are supposed to be summaries and syntheses of published, mainly secondary, sources, and these are presumably produced by research. Indeed, another Wikipedia injunction is to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">cite your souces</a>, which this article does quite well. All that said, even if the article were entirely original research, that would not be grounds for its deletion. Sometimes cleaning up would reduce an article to a sub-stub, and many VfD voters (including me) vote to delete sub-stubs; but in general VfD votes are not about content but about topics. A topic might be so bound up with its original research content that it should be deleted; but an article that was entirely original research on a valid topic can be rewritten and generally should not be deleted. The topic of this article certainly merits an article in the Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:10, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Disclaimer: I put this on VfD last time.<br />
It might worth some mention concerning the popularity of DDR (i.e. The DDR phenomenon). However, I think the internet fandom section is not very well written; it does not look encycloprdic.<br />
A note to Poiuytman: (A follow up to last discussion) I used to be a mod of a DDR board, so I know quite a few thing about the DDR culture, but I currently do not have time to modify that section yet. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESYSS_Mouse_58d6.html" title="User:SYSS Mouse">SYSS Mouse</a> 03:57, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge &amp; Redirect</b>. I think that the Internet Fandom blurb in DDR is adequate for now. It may be worth exploring writing a full fledged article, but none of us who care (such as SYSS and me) have had the chance to expand it. Since the Internet Fandom section isn't necessarily encyclopedic, I'd recommend improving that section and possibly creating a dedicated article in the future if it's warranted. Full disclosure: As I mentioned in the original VfD, I am an administrator of DDR Freak. And no, I did not submit the original article. I was as surprised as anybody to see it.

<li><b>Save</b>, ok, granted that this page may not be considered necessary by some people, but it was not intended to be an essay. I acknowledge that it may have been poorly titled (in fact I realized that myself shortly after creating the article). About lack of good research, given that thorough research on the part of one man would mean examining nearly every anime made in the last decade, which is the whole point of having other people edit and expand what I've started. Also, "the 'running with toast' scene" is the only name I have for that at the present (again, other people can edit this). Now, maybe this is fancruft, and for that I will concede that this should probably be merged with <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_8beb.html" title="Neon Genesis Evangelion">the main Eva page</a>, however, I do believe that some kind of list is needed somewhere (for Eva fans, Literary/Movie/Television critics, and pop-culture students alike) to refer to on matters of parodies and tributes to Evangelion.

<p>My white brother, let me say this only once. For hundreds of years, the black man's votes didn't count. This is nothing new. Oh no, there is no new thing under the sun, just as Solomon wrote in Ecclesiastes when the man was holding him down because he was black. See, he knew that there was nothing new about racism, nothing new about hate - but that didn't stop him from raising his voice and saying that there's a time for the brother man to speak out. There's nothing new about racism, but that didn't stop Malcom X or Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks or Jesse Jackson or Louis Farakon or Al Sharpton. And I'm not about to let it stop me from speaking up for my rights as a person, either. So you can say all you want that votes from the black man don't count. But let me tell you something, brother. Jesus was a black man, and its a black man who'll be your judge at the Judgement Seat. Then we'll see whether or not votes from the black man are counted, then we'll see. In the meanwhile, I'm gonna keep on speaking up when I see articles on my heritage being deleted for no other reason other than their race. I thank you all for reading this and pray that you'll make the right decision and let this article stand. Oh, let it stand, brothers, like Shadrach, Mesech, and Abednigo in the sea of fire - let it stand and be unharmed!</p>

<p>May I say that I feel where you're at, my FInal Fantasy playing sister. I feel where you're at, and I say Amen! Just this morning, I posted on the community forum, asking my brothers and sisters for help against the waves of racism that appear to be sweeping this site, and the man took my message down. But that didn't keep my message from reaching your ears, sister! That didn't keep my message from reaching your ears! For its not my message that speaks against racism, its the message of Jesus! See, you can hold the black man down now by deleting his messages all you want, but there is one black man's message you can't hold down! Yes, my sister, that black man from the hood of Nazareth spoke mighty words that can never be clicked away by the white man's keyboard. Let me just say, that nobody will be hitting "backspace" at the judgement seat, sister, nobody will be hitting "backspace" and deleting the words of the Book of Life. So that's why I still have hope, that in spite of all of this vile persecution, my article will be lead into the promised land.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless better sources provided. Probably personal essay/original research. The apparent sources are very flawed. The first link, which contains a typo, becomes <a href="http://members.aol.com/jmtsgibbs/infothry.htm" class="external free" title="http://members.aol.com/jmtsgibbs/infothry.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/jmtsgibbs/infothry.htm</a> when the typo is corrected. Although <i>the contributor</i> gives this link the title "Quantum Conservation of Information Theory," the actual page is entitled "Quantum Information Theory." Neither it nor any of the six pages it links to mention any "law of conservation of information;" in fact, they do not contain the word "conservation" anywhere. It is disturbing that this link does not actually reference the topic it is said to reference. The second reference is to <a href="http://www.oridream.com" class="external free" title="http://www.oridream.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.oridream.com</a> which does not appear to have any significant English-language content.

<li>I think this is alluding to the objection some have over "American" referring solely to the United States and not to the Americas as a whole. But there are no commonly accepted substitutes; United Statish just sounds silly, and other terms like USian and Yankee are questionable in an encyclopedia. Best just to stick with "American", which refers to just the U.S. for the vast majority of speakers of all varieties of English. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 10:04, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, I was only referring to the words "United Statish" which do sound silly. I just happened to quote the entire sentence. I do know that some people do object to have "America" refer solely to the USA. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 20:12, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

We already have an article for <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_skunk.html" title="Pet skunk">pet skunk</a> for pretty much the same reason.

<li>You do notice that nixie says that he/she has <b>already</b> merged the pet raccoon information into the raccoon article? So now we have two articles with the same information.
