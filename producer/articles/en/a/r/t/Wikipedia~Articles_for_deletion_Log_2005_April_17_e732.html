<li><b>Delete</b> Yes, it's a real term. But Wikipedia is not a dictionary. Before you can make a term into an enclopedia entry, you have to say something about it that goes beyond a simple definition. The anonymous author of this article tried to do that, but didn't manage to get beyond some vague generalities. Perhaps we should process it for improvement rather than deletion, but I don't see anybody taking ownership of it for that purpose. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 20:07, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree that it's a stub --- it's too vague and subjective. There's nothing here for anybody to expand upon.

<li>I like the idea of merging with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a>, but I'm not sure it could be done smoothly.

<li>I disagree. Pet theory isn't about theories as such. It's about the psychology of people who have a personal stake in particular theory. Maybe you could make a case for merging Pet theory with one of the <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity.html" title="Objectivity">Objectivity</a> articles, but even that's a bit of a stretch. There's a better fit in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions_1b25.html" title="The Structure of Scientific Revolutions">ideas of Thomas Kuhn</a>, but since the ideas don't seem to be consciously based on Kuhn, you can't merge it in there, either. ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 18:25, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I apologies for rambling on, but writing the previous paragraph made me realize that Pet theory breaks another Wikipedia rule: <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">No original research</a>. The author is making wholly original observations about the psychology of inobjectivy.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a phenomenon more than a definition. Potential for expansion to explain such things as researchers who include content in lectures that they never submit for peer review in publication form, colloquial usage of the term in the press and online, and how the term has perjorative impact when applied to any proposal. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 02:09, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Perfectly good wiki material. I can think of a few examples where some scientist's pet theory made a notable episode in the history of science.

<li>The problem with breaking out sections from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">List of political epithets</a> is, the articles encourage the ranters and loonies and bigots to carve out their own little POV forks.

<li>implements totalitarianism</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Let me review these points one at a time:</dd>
<dd>(1) "exalts nation and sometimes race above the individual": The Jewish nation is exalted above others only in the fanatical imagination of Jew-haters who incorrectly assume that the claim of "chosen-ness" indicates a claim of <i>superiority</i>. Such a claim has never been made by any Jewish scholar (and Jewhaters everywhere, despite their ignorance and unmitigated stupidity, will immediately admit the preponderance of <i>scholars</i> among Jews...), nor is there anything in mainstream Jewish literature to indicate that the notion of chosen-ness has anything to do with national or "racial" superiority. Second point in this vein, only non-Jews would ever be so ignorant or foolish (or almost inconceivably idiotic) as to assert that there is anything even remotely "racial" about being Jewish.</dd>
<dd>(2) "uses violence and modern techniques of propaganda and censorship to forcibly suppress political opposition": While this may be characteristic of the current government of Israel, its forcible suppression of political opposition by "violen[t] and modern techniques of propaganda and censorship" is employed <i><b>exclusively against Jews who oppose its policies</b></i>. For the naysayers in the crowd, let me make clear: Fascism suppresses discontent from <i>within</i>. Oppression of the putative Palestian "national" dissent is irrelevant in this context, and takes on the same status (perhaps, although only in the grossest misinterpretation of international law) as Kurdish dissent in Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Iran. ... I can't help noticing however, that there are no articles on Syrian fascism, Turkish fascism, Iraqi fascism, Armenian fascism, Azerbaijani fascism or Iranian fascism--articles for which, <i>in every case</i>, there is much greater encyclopedic foundation. This leads me to the almost inescapable conclusion that whoever created this article holds Israel and Jews to impossibly higher moral and legal standards than those to which they hold Christians and Muslims, indeed, that they are trying to prey upon an obscene sort of lexical intellectual dishonesty in order to spread their own personal views and hatred against Jews beyond the limited scope to which they are presently privy.</dd>
<dd>(3) "engages in severe economic and social regimentation": Nothing about Jews as a whole, nor about Judaism as a religion, lifestyle or worldview, nor even about Jewish predominance in Israel (which I assume is the source of the major gripe of the miniminded person who created this article) can even remotely be described as fomenting, supporting or promoting "severe economic and social regimentation". Judaism as a religion tirelessly condemns social stratification, on whatever basis. Israel is the only country that is even remotely democratic (with the marginal exception of Turkey) in not only the Middle East, but throughout what the Muslims like to think of nostalgically (and through the perpetuation of historical ignorance) as "darussalam". In any case, the perception among so many Jewhaters that Jews are "rich" and that it's as a result of "Jewish greed", let me spell it out for you: YOU ARE WRONG. While perhaps prominent Jews are rich, or while more rich people are Jews than non-Jews, the vast majority of Jews are, like me, POVERTY STRICKEN, depending on the charity of the so-called "rich Jews" to get by from day to day. Also, if you study charitable donations, you'll find that Jews are far more generous in their donations, as a proportion of the population, than non-Jews, not only to Jewish charities, but (sometimes to the gross detriment of Jewish-oriented charitable organizations) to non-Jewish charities. Let me be as POV about this as possible: YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.</dd>
<dd>(4) "engages in corporatism": The only portions of the Jewish population with any power to do so that could ever be accused of "engaging in corporatism" are the socialists who founded the kibutzim...and the extent of their interests in engaging in such corporatism were limited to their individual kibutzim. That said, a number of Jews, some of them quite noteworthy or even <i>famous</i>, have <i>wished</i> to do such things on a grand scale...but they have done so not as <i><b>Jews</b></i>, but as <i><b>socialists</b></i> who happened to be Jews. With such a tenuous relationship, I fail to see how the article can stand on supposed merits all its own without the existence of articles on Sinofascism, Russofascism, Germofascism, Francofascism, Norgefascism, Danofascism, Svecofascism, Spanofascism, Italofascism, Wallacofascism, Bulgarofascism, Magyarifascism, Czechofascism, and any number of other -fascisms.</dd>
<dd>(5)"implements totalitarianism": This is almost ludicrous. Anyone who knows <i>anything</i> about the situation in Israel, beyond the unceasing propaganda spewed by CNN and the ISM and their ilk, knows that the only totalitarianism implemented by Jews, is in Israel, and there, it is implemented <i>against Jews</i>. This is, of course, the <i>one</i> point on which Judeofascism has a leg to stand as a legitimate term...but ironically, the people who like to fondle the term like a starving kitten in need of attention think it means <i>totalitarianism against non-Jews</i>...which is the exact <i><b>opposite</b></i> of what is required to give the term "Judeofascism" any legitimate currency. Small minds, of course, are wont to latch onto any small crust of legitimacy, no matter how moldy, in this case, their arguements are truly rotten—displaying in full view that their actual agenda is Jewhatred, not any legitimate gripe against Jews...and in so doing, they undermine every <i>legitimate</i> criticism of Israel and Israeli policy wrt the so-called "Palestinians".</dd>

<li>Yes Earl. I didn't say that it made it non-notable (I'm not sure that anything can be made non-notable anyway, rather it is non-notable due to a lack of anything to make it notable). I just said that it didn't make it notable on the basis of population. That is why I asked if there was anything else that might make it notable. Also, I would suggest that high population could in itself make a location notable (although a location with a high population would almost certainly have something else to make it notable).

There is a big difference between a term with 62,500 hits and one with 153 hits.

</ul>
<p>This article got split out of the list of political epithets because because the section gradually grew in size to the scope of an article. The term islamofascism may have once been an epithet, but over time it has evolved into a word describing the concept of violent totalitiarian islamism. As a notable word/concept it deserves its own comprehensive and NPOV article. If the final decision is to redirect, I urge that it not be protected, because Islamofascism will once again grow big enough and notable enough to be split out, again. Sealing the redirect will prevent <b>tender love and organic growth</b><br />

I'd suggest a redirect for this also if there were an appropriate topic to redirect to, but what would it be? <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fundamentalism.html" title="Islamic fundamentalism">Islamic fundamentalism</a>? Problematic, as that could be used to describe those who simply ascribe non-politically to deeply held religous beliefs. The term <i>is</i> in use in popular culture, <i>and</i> has a meaning unique from any article to which it might be redirected, therefore I must vote <b>keep</b>, but with the admonishment that the article should acknowledge that this is an inherently POV term invented by persons with beliefs that are probably generally hostile to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 03:17, 2005 Apr 17 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>The reason this article was taken out of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">list of political epithets</a> was that its entry had grown out much longer than the typical single paragraph list entry. As is the article is about four paragraphs long with an extensive list of outbound links. As is the article needs some serious work to make it more encyclopedic, but thats what <b>tender love and organic growth are for.</b> <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 03:54, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Agreed, redirect</b>. An article on fascistic tendencies in both Islam and Judaism cannot have such a title so long as its use —among politicans, scholars, judges, journalists, etc.— remains limited as an epithet. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 03:41, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>So, where is this evidence? Note that if they depict it as <b>"</b>Islamofascism<b>"</b>, than that denotes it being an epithet rather than a construct. <i>E.g.</i> "Christopher Hitchens, for example, describes Islamic extremism as “Islamofascism” and strongly favored Operation Iraqi Freedom."

<li>I understand why you might think that Islamofascism is a mere pejorative epithet; The term itself has a pejorative connotation. However it is a very common concept in <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservative.html" title="Neoconservative">neoconservative</a> circles, and since neoconservativsm is a notable political ideology, it's common concepts are also notable.

This article, the one on <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeofascism.html" title="Judeofascism">Judeofascism</a>, and any other of the same kind, are simply ill-disguised attacks on racial or religious groups; they invent a term and a concept to go with it, and then use it to smear those groups. The claim by Meelar that it should be kept because some right-wing writers have written about 'Islamic totalitarianism' fails if only because it confuses totalitarianism with fascism. Klonimus' contention that the notion is encyclopædic because it's used in U.S. neo-conservative circles is equally unconvincing. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:43, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree. Sorry, I did the same thing as Islamist, because I misread the page, not realizing it was on VfD. Islamofascism should do whatever Slogan 'Islamofascism' does, and since it's a redirect, it should be a redirect too. If this is not made into a redirect, it should at the very least be moved to Slogan 'Islamofascism' instead of its current localtion. <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LDan</a> 23:20, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>redirect</b> to an article named something along the lines of Islamic Theocratic Intolerance. I am on the border here. There is an obscene amount of historical evidence to give legitimacy to this term, <i>c.f.</i> the definitions of "fascism" at <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a>. Through <i>every</i> period of history since the historical (a term I use in an attempt at compromising deference to the Muslims who insist that Islam goes back to the creation of the World) inception of Islam, <i>i.e.</i>, the time of the Prophet, pbuh, <i>every</i> characteristic of fascism has, at one time or another, characterized the <i>majority</i> interpretation of the Prophet's teachings. That said, however, in <i>every</i> Muslim realm where shari`a has not held political supremacy, the same characteristics have been, without a single exception of which I'm aware, <i><b>absent</b></i> from Muslim rule. So, the <i>facts</i> seem to me to indicate that there exists Islamofascism on the theocratic level, but not on the Islamosecular level, and so it seems to me that the term Islamofascism is too all-encompassing. It makes it sound as though all Muslims are fascists, which is simply not the case. From what I am preached by my Muslim friends, the teachings of the Prophet, pbuh, are also non-Fascist. I don't think the Wikipedia should play the role of inventing or supporting politically or emotionally charged appellations. It is my observation, that the term Islamofascism is used primarily by right-wing pro-Israel American Christians (NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT, to quote <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Seinfeld_0ee4.html" title="Jerry Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>) more than by anyone else, to describe the exact phenomenon which I'm describing...but that doesn't mean that the term is exact or definitive. That point should be made VERY CLEAR in the prélude to the article as renamed according to my proposal. I hope people will consider my input carefully, and change their votes accordingly if they agree. We can take up a vote on an appropriate name afterwards, if need be. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 08:47, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd like to clarify my "redirect" vote. It is not a genuine "redirect", it is a <b>keep</b>, but <b>rename</b>. "Islamofascism" should be a redirect to something, I don't know what, perhaps Intolerance in Islam, as it is a subject about which voluminous amounts have been written. My opposition is to using what is really an epithet as the name for an article, especially when it denigrates people by association.

<blockquote>
<p>Far too many people on the Left are inclined to make excuses for Islamic fundamentalism. They accept its misogyny so long as it doesn’t target Western women. They accept its fascism so long as it is anti-American fascism. We now have a Stop the War coalition led by Islamic fascists and Marxist-Leninists, and much of the Left is silent about it. Acknowledging the horrors of Islamic fundamentalism would sully their consciences, which they want to keep clean for the battle against America ... Much of the Stop the War coalition now actually supports a fascist resistance movement and ignores their Iraqi comrades entirely. You have to look back to the Hitler-Stalin pact for a historical parallel. The concept of fascism is being lost. It’s something you hear about on the history channels. But Islamic fascism is still fascism ... <b>Islamofascism</b> has been ripping through the Arab world, often supported by America, and it should be the Left’s worst nightmare. <a href="http://hurryupharry.bloghouse.net/archives/2004/03/30/nick_cohen_vs_the_awl.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://hurryupharry.bloghouse.net/archives/2004/03/30/nick_cohen_vs_the_awl.php" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:14, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> Last time I checked, the article discussed the usage of the term and separated it clearly from those who the term is used against. Since this term is used a lot these days, it deserves a discussion on its usage, origins etc. It is however most important that we make sure that this article doesn't deviate from that. If links to religious or political ideologies are needed, it should be stated clearly that "islamofascism" is a term usually (mis)used against those. If there are people who would object to the mere existence of the article, well... don't look it up. Where I come from there are people who are personally offended by practically our entire manga section (often for religious or semi-religious reasons), yet the deletion of those articles would bring, indeed, a tear to my eye. Although I don't feel that way about this article, I still think it's a bad idea to delete it, just because people are offended by it. Just make sure the article is as "clinical" as possible and it will all be allright. One could even mention in the article that a lot of people have objections to the term. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerbrant_7d11.html" title="User:Gerbrant">Shinobu</a> 22:08, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Meaningless fight talk, with a bogus poli-sci sheen. Orwell wrote a brilliant essay emphasizing that the popular epithet "fascist" had degraded to a point that it no longer had any practical meaning beyond "that which the speaker considers objectionable for some undisclosed reason."

<li><b>Redirect</b> Many supporters of deletion, I suspect, are shy of the forthcoming exertion to come with the article in question.

At first, I voted to keep the article, but after contemplation, I changed my vote. It suits a journal, but not an encyclopedia.

Many here I suspect are newbies, and hence dont have the concept of NPOV under their grasp. Others are yet POV warriors seeking to push or repeat an agenda. If its written in an NPOV way, keep. But the mere existence of this kind of article lends its proponents to claim it like it was theirs to define, forgetting the basic fact that its just a <b>word,</b> and a POV word at that. Theres nothing wrong with POV word articles, as long as the articles themselves are not POV. Judging by many of the comments above, it would seem that there is a basic ignorance of that distinction.

<p>You can, of course, create any number of words using the formula: <i>X</i> + Fascist tendencies = <i>X</i>ofascism. How about 'Graecofascism'? 'Sinofascism'? 'Hindofascism'? The trouble is, having created the term, it's also easy to create a concept to go with it, and then to create a history. You don't even need to go outside the facts; there'll always be, in any nationality, race, or religion that's been around for a while examples of people or groups acting badly. The term 'fascism' is being used in such a Usenet/school-debating-society way that that's all you need. Wikipedia isn't here to invent new concepts, nor to parrot whatever nonsense the U.S. neo-cons have come up with as they flail around trying to find reasons to attack other countries. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:45, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course, Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Hinduist, Buddhist, etc. 'fascism' are a frightening reality, involving <i>...'the most heavenly exctacies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimantalism'...</i> [towards] <i>a new high-tech Dark Ages.</i> But I have yet to see the oh' shorthand used in any serious exposition (from within revolutionary currents, at least, where I've seen such concepts elaborated on at some length). <i>E.g.</i> <a href="http://rwor.org/future/web.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://rwor.org/future/web.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 21:45, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As the article is developed, it's becoming more and more distasteful (and many of the comments made by those who want to keep it betray an ignorance of the issues here, as well as a disturbing emotional tone). We're told, for example, that some Islamic leaders allied with fascists in the second World War, but no mention is made of the fact that the fascists in question were Christians, and the purely pragmatic, non-ideological nature of the contacts is not properly explained. There's in fact no indication that any of the Muslims involved held any sort of fascist belief. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 13:36, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm arguing this in two places – here, and on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamofascism_0d82.html" title="Talk:Islamofascism">Talk:Islamofascism</a> – and the result is sometimes a bit disjointed. It seems clear that al-Husseyni was ideologically involved with Nazism (just as some English aristocrats, royals, and politicians were), but any general Arab support for Nazism shouldn't be attributed to so-called Islamofascism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's the logic, folks: I identify a Nazi-sympathizing Muslim. Islam therefore has a fascist dimension. Hmmm. Does the failure of the Catholic Church to vigorously and explicitly oppose Nazi crimes against Jews justify an entry for Catholifacism?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I suppose that what's offensive about this article (and the comments of some people on this page) is that, whereas we talk about Italian fascists, and Spanish fascists, and Greek fascists, etc., rather than Christofascists, when it comes to the Muslim world it's OK to lump all the Islamic countries and groups together. The turning of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeofascism.html" title="Judeofascism">Judeofascism</a> into a redirect presumably involved a recognition of the same fact in that case; there are of course Jewish fascists (Jews are no more immune to human stupidity and nastiness than any other group), and many people have seen the actions of certain Israeli politicians and parties as having fascist aspects — but it's wrong to use the general, smearing, and to my mind bigoted term 'Judeofascism'. Why on Earth can't the same reasonableness be applied here? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:41, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like your reasoning here, but the thing is. If the use of the term was reasonable then it would not belong in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">List of political epithets</a>. The question for me is weather or not the epiteth merits an article and if such an article can possibly in the current enviornment be NPOV. I think the answer to the first question is yes, this term is used enough that someone will likely look it up here. The second question is what will they find? I voted to re-direct because that seemed the safest waty to make sure they found somethign reasonable. If the article could be keep about the epiteth and NPOV I would have voted to keep. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 09:01, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>There is no such thing as Islamic/Islamo Fascism</b></p>
<p>For those of us learned in Middle Eastern history, it is clear that fascist-derived ideologies and Islamism have always been violently opposed (see:<a href="../../../h/a/m/Hama_Massacre_c745.html" title="Hama Massacre">Hama Massacre</a>). The fascist-derived ideologies in the Middle East such as the Kateab Party, the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_party.html" title="Baath party">Baath party</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian_Social_Nationalist_Party_6900.html" title="Syrian Social Nationalist Party">Syrian Social Nationalist Party</a> have been almost entirely supported by Christians or minority groups in the Arab world that feared Islamism. The founder of the SSNP was a Christian, as the founder of the Baath was Greek orthodox. The Kataeb was founded by Bachir Gemayel, a Maronite Christian militant. All these ideologies were officially secular but had mainly Christian support. Islamic fascism is a contradiction in all senses of the word. Islamism has no ideas about racial superiority either. That is why it is utterly ridiculous to have an Islamic fascism article.</p>
<p>My views on this article are that it is a way for WalkingEagles and Klonimus to insert their own judgement into an Anti-Islamic term that should frankly be listed under political epithets. Just because neo-cons have started using this term more does not make it factually or historically correct.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a> 16:31, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yuber, you remind me of the texas farmer who was the best shot in the west. First he would shoot, and then he would paint a bullseye. I'm not playing a game with you about weather Islamofascism exists or not. It doesn't matter if the term is as you claim "factually or historically correct", it matters that it is being widely used to mean a specific concept. And therefore must be documented in an encyclopedic encyclopaedia.</dd>
<dd>At the moment I have to say that I agree with the general direction of the Islamofascism article. It was a mistake on my part to combine <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fascism_ff36.html" title="Islamic Fascism">Islamic Fascism</a> (Fusion of Islam and fascist political movements) with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> (term to describe totalitarian Islam, and groups that support it.). I think the current split is a good idea, and the two articles can crosslink. I do wish the whole thing could have been done with less rancor, which would have been the case if people hadn't been so quick to delete materiel they found objectionable. . <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 17:53, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a coalition of hate groups (may Allah(swt) forbid) started talking about a Jewish conspiracy to control the global media, coined a single catch-word for that supposed conspiracy, and kept posting that single catch-word on blogs until it started showing up on Google, would that new word deserve an entry in a responsibly -edited encyclopedia?

<dd>You are either deliberately ignoring, or somehow failing to understand, my point. I suspect it's the former. But, just in case .... I am not talking about sanitized article titles like the ones you propose above, but rather something <b>patently offensive</b> -- just like Islamofascism -- as the title for an article. You're not talking about calling the page something vaguely intelligent like Political trends in Islam, but instead insisting on a single, foul-sounding coinage that lumps 1 billion people together with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. My question is, if bloggers made a similiarly offensive, similarly paranoid neologism about Jewish people show up on Google, would <b>that offensive term itself</b> be appopriate as the title of an article? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 02:39, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I voted <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">list of political epithets</a> but I see the case for a keep vote provided the page documents the use of the epithet and only provides links to more appropriately titled articles for discussion of the content. In an ideal world, editors could actually keep to such a policy, and so an article on Yusuf's hypothetical epithet would be good for Wikipedia, but too many editors are too gummed up with hormones and propaganda not to opine on the content, so redirects are better.

<li>I'm gonna be bold, answering, as one who did not vote for "keep", in a forum in which the requestant has not requested my input: Islamofascism is a term that has come to be accepted in journalistic circles, if only "outside CNN", as a descriptor of fascistic tendencies exemplified by the leadership of certain (sadly, the vast majority of) Islamic régimes. Wishing the term into oblivion is neither intellectually honest nor encyclopedic. That said, you'll note, my vote was to redirect the content of this article to Islamic Theological Intolerance or something equally descriptive. The concept within modern Islam is, not only present, but <i>prevalent</i>, and in certain circles, <i>predominant</i>. The term "Islamofascism", however, as derogatory as it might sound to the vast majority of Muslims, is one that has gained a not-insignificant currency in the Journalism of the West. The <i>only relevant question here</i>, if I might be so bold, is whether or not this term should be the TITLE of an article, or a redirect to an article describing the phenomenon. My contention is that Islam has inherent tendencies that permit the interpretation thereof in favor of Fascism, but that the term "Islamofascism" should be applied exclusively to such groups as follow this interpretation, which is, unfortunately, gaining sway within the muslim world. As such, any such article should concentrate on these groups, rather than dragging down the erstwhile phenomenal accomplishments of Islamic Civilization (which OK, here's my bias, is nothing more than the preservation and encouragement of the achievements of civilization overtaken by muslim warriors, but that really has nothing to do with the discussion at hand). To say, however, that fascism is not a(n unfortunate and predominant) trend within modern (vocal) Islam, is neither historically nor intellectually honest. I wish it were otherwise, perhaps more than most muslims, in fact, but the fact remains, Islam in "this day and age" has been coöpted by the dominance and influence of Wahhabism and Allawitism, both of which are quintessentially fascist, sadly. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 10:49, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I do have a couple of questions about some of your underlying assumptions, though, which I hope you'll consider.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When you say that fascism is descriptive of 'the vast majority" of Islamic regimes -- I hope you don't consider Egypt, UAE, Indonesia, Turkey, etc. to be members of this universe of "Islamic regimes"? Do you? That there are Muslims within a secular government does not make it an Islamic regime!</dd>
<dd>Which "Islamic regime," specifically, do you consider to be fascist? If your answer is, say, Saudi Arabia, how does the fact that Osama Bin Laden is a bitter enemy of the ruling monarchy enter into your calculus? Does that mean that the ruling family are Islamofascists, but Bin Laden, by opposing them, is anti-fascist? Are you sure you don't mean to say that some governments that rule over Muslims are <i>authoritarian</i>?

<dd>(sigh)I know you don't like those countries. Question is not whether you like them, but whether a) they are "Islamic regimes," as has been claimed, and b) whether they are fascist, according to some meaningful definition of the world. I can't get Bridges TV (Muslim cable network) here in Massachusetts, but that doesn't mean Massachusetts is fascist. Are you arguing for Islamototalitarianism? If so, you're on the wrong page. Please stay on topic, and please try to focus on the actual conversation we're trying to have, ok? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 22:20, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Iran claims to be an "Islamic Republic", the rulers of saudi arabia claim to be custodians of the two holy mosques and defenders of the faith. IMHO they are self proclaimed "Islamic regimes." Both governments also enforce <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">sharia</a> law which would make them Islamic by definition. I personally have no opinion if they are fascists or not, but I think a good case could be made for both sides. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 01:32, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yusuf, you seem to be missing the point that <b>Wikipedia does not exist to pass judgement, only to document</b>: that means that we are documenting the claims that surround the useage of the term <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascist.html" title="Islamofascist">Islamofascist</a> without passing any judgement over its existance or nonexistance, pejorative nature, moral value of those who use the term, history of use, etc etc.<a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 01:32, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, you and I simply disagree on this.
<ul>
<li>If it were as you say, we would have an independent main article on the word "Nigger," and we don't.</li>
<li>Why don't we? Because it's patently offensive.</li>
<li>Now then. Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two examples I thought of, too, that might conceivably be called "Islamic regimes."</li>
<li>But -- reality check -- the claim was that a <b>majority</b> of these "Islamic regimes" were fascist, and <b>that is simply not factual, unless "fascist" means "objectionable to the speaker" or some such ridiculousness.</b></li>
<li>Factuality is apparently not a big deal for you, which is fine, but if you believe, as you appear to (with others on this page) that there is some "trend" toward fascism in Islam, then I submit that it is incumbent upon you to explain <b>why</b> you believe this, and to use the words "Fascism" and "Islam" as though they had consistent meanings. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 01:44, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>When you say that fascism is a "trend within modern (vocal) Islam," I assume you mean fascism, the real thing, as opposed to fascism, the "boo" word that carries no actual meaning beyond "you're a bad guy." So presumably you are saying that there is a sect within Islam that embraces <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">corporatism</a>? I'm unfamiliar with this sect or its proponents. Can you please be a little more specific about it?

<dd>a) That's a "trend within modern (vocal) Islam"? Where's the trend?

It seems that this is going nowhere! I just wonder how come a NPOV of a few right-wing writers (I say a few) could turn into a 1-0 in the propaganda war and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1405605,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1405605,00.html" rel="nofollow">How the right played the fascism card against Islam</a>! I just wonder indeed how come two articles of the same nature (talking about this one and the other shamefull non-sense fictitious <i>Judeofascism</i>) could have different fates! How come <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeofascism.html" title="Judeofascism">Judeofascism</a> got already a status of <i>pending deletion</i>?!! Because of google hits?! Is this the main argument? (If yes is your answer, then refer to the end of my intervention below). Who spends most of his time discussing the phenomenon of Islamofascism on forums and blogs? Aren't they people who got an anti-islamic agenda?</p>
<p>In this list of pejorative slogans <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/List-of-pejorative-political-slogans" class="external text" title="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/List-of-pejorative-political-slogans" rel="nofollow">at Nationmaster.com</a> both expressions are listed and explained without any POV. So wouldn't be the same in Wikipedia? Worse indeed. Some users have already started <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fascism.html" title="Islamic fascism">Islamic fascism</a> and claim both articles mean different things!! . So explain to us how different they are please! It is clear that there is a difference between <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_mama.html" title="Big mama">Big mama</a> and <i>Big Mama</i>, between <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">bin Laden</a> and <i>Bin Laden</i> ("He's one of them bin-ladens") as refering to Arabs.</p>
<p>If we follow this trend we will end up having duplicate articles confusing readers and ourselves.</p>
<p>I still believe this article <b>have to be kept</b> but also <b>have to focus on the pejorative nature of the term</b> instead of claiming non-sense things relating state controlled business to fascism without any single reference! Do we have to include countries like France into that category?!! A break please!</p>
<p>Do we have to start an article called Americofascism (or whatever you name it) because of Guantanamo camp? It will be a total non-sense kind of article though I will give you this argument:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Islamic fascism" offers you 17,500 barrels of oil.</li>

<dd>Unlike some people on wikipedia, I can change my mind. I carefully reconsiddered what my understanding of the facts of the matter are and came to a new conclusion. Islamism and Fascism are distinctly separate idea's however many Islamist movements are inspired by fascists and may share elements of fascism. My current understanding is that <b>Islamofascism is a notable neologism used to describe sub-types of Islamism that share certain attributes (Anti western, pro Jihad, and seeking to create totalitarian Islamic societies)</b> At this point I don't think Islamofascism as a concept is deeply connected to fascism. How ever many Islamofascists, are inspired by people like the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Mufti_611d.html" title="Grand Mufti">Grand Mufti</a> who are undeniably fascist. In some countires the government is <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, or is influenced by Islamofascists (<a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>.

<p>Unfortunately, Brandon, this "patently offensive epithet" is just that--it is <i>not</i> a scientific term, and is therefore not bound by the need to fulfill any criteria whatsoever, other than its ability to get people to latch onto it. At the same time, however, there are three problems with what you're trying to do here. (1) You're basically trying to browbeat people into agreeing with your point of view by arguing in terms that really have, unfortunately, nothing whatsoever to do with the merits of the article. (2) You're using this logical subterfuge to cloud the issue: there is a phenomenon in the muslim world which this word was specifically coined to describe (which, frighteningly, has more in common with Hitlerian and Goebbelsian Nazism than it has to do with the more readily recognized forms of Spanish and Italian fascism). And (3) you've turned a VfD discussion into a freeforall. Stick to the subject matter. You've succeeded in derailing the relevant discussion (the de/merits of the article), and turned it instead into a discussion of how those who wish to keep the article, with whom you've been very unprofessionally adversarial, should really be doing original research instead. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 13:15, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I understand what you're saying, but I would ask you in turn how you would pursue a discussion of the "merits of the article" if it was <i>your</i> faith or nationality that had been targeted by an article's <b>patently offensive</b> underlying assumption/implication.</dd>
<dd>Let's begin here: Would you agree with me that it is possible that the reason some people want this article to stand independently is in order to lend some kind of legitimacy to a blatant religious slur?</dd>
<dd>With respect, the "merits" of such an analysis as appears in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> are not what we should be most concerned about. (And as a side note, I think my edits have substantially improved the "merits" of this particular piece, which should count for something.)</dd>
<dd>With regard to your points on the "phenomenon in the Muslim world" that you find disturbing. Let me draw a parallel.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The Cosa Nostra has for many years appropriated the <i>trappings</i> of Roman Catholicism in its rituals, meetings, initiations, etc.</li>
<li>The Cosa Nostra has also undertaken many loathsome crimes, including assassination, drug dealing, mass murder, extortion, etc.</li>
<li>Are members of the Cosa Nostra "Catholic"? Interesting question we could debate at length.</li>
<li>Do the actions of members of the Cosa Nostra represent a "phenomenon in the Christian world" that we would find disturbing? I think not. Rather, they are thugs.</li>

<dd>Brandon, as I've pointed out previously, I think this should be a redirect, either to an article that deals with racism, anti-semitism, anti-westernism, or whatever, in the muslim world, or simply back to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">list of political epithets</a>. I agree it's patently offensive, and while anti-semitism and anti-westernism are rampant in the arab world, there are other articles that deal with this already. The Islamofascism article had the potential to be a decent article at one time, but there are related issues, no matter how remotely, that are too close to the hearts of too many of us for it to long remain an NPOV article, unforunately. Deleting it altogether, however, is a bad idea, however, IMHO, because it will open up the slate for someone to start this whole machlochet again.

<p>I see that the issue is getting out of hand and being deflected to personal attacks instead of being a responsible discussion. We don't care too much about <b>keep</b>, <b>delete</b>, <b>merge</b>, but we do care more about being reponsible. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">User:TShilo12</a> claims that <i>there is a phenomenon in the muslim world which this word was specifically coined to describe (which, frighteningly, has more in common with Hitlerian and Goebbelsian Nazism than it has to do with the more readily recognized forms of Spanish and Italian fascism)</i>. Are you serious??! Is this the point you are trying to <i>inject</i> into the article? Is this the <i>agenda</i> behind your support to keep the article? If yes, then I would really <b>Reconsider</b> my earlier <b>keep and merge</b> vote.</p>
<p>If your personal comments are based upon the <i>Grand Mufti</i>, than this excerpt is worth reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>...The most damaging development in this respect was itself the result of western meddling. When the Mufti (religious leader) of Jerusalem died in 1921, the recently appointed British Governor, Sir Herbert Samuel, took charge of appointing a successor, inventing the new title of ‘Grand Mufti’.</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>When the local electoral college of pious Muslims voted for a moderate and learned leader and placed at the bottom of their list Hajj Amin al-Husseini, a young man in his twenties, given to fanaticism and hatred of the Jews, the Governor was initially content and confirmed the appointment. However, at this point the Hajj’s powerful family, backed by right-wing extremists, launched a fierce campaign of denigration against the electoral college, accusing its members of treacherously conspiring with the Jews to appoint one of their own party.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sir Herbert, who was himself Jewish, sought the counsel of E. T. Richmond, who acted as adviser on Muslim Affairs, and who was an extreme anti-Zionist. Richmond persuaded Sheikh Hisam al-Din, the man who had already been confirmed in the post, to stand down. He then convinced Samuel that the best way to restore order was to concede to the agitators by letting the Hajj become Grand Mufti. This was in spite of the fact that the Hajj had already been imprisoned by the British in 1920 for his role in fomenting vicious anti-Jewish riots.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The British themselves were thus responsible for turning an electoral process upside-down in order to install an extremist Palestinian leader. This abuse of power would have fateful consequences not only for the future of Israel but also for ordinary Palestinians who were now subjected to a leader they had not chosen but for whose ill-judged actions they would, in the years to come, repeatedly be held responsible...</i> -richard webster, <a href="http://www.richardwebster.net/israelpalestine.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.richardwebster.net/israelpalestine.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Statesman_f7c0.html" title="New Statesman">New Statesman</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_29.html" title="November 29">November 29</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>If that happened <i>yesterday</i> and explained today, what about <i>today</i>? Which relation is there between the muslim world which this word was specifically coined to describe (which, frighteningly, has more in common with Hitlerian and Goebbelsian Nazism than it has to do with the more readily recognized forms of Spanish and Italian fascism)?</p>

<dd>Just because there has been a confusion between the explanation given for your <b>keep, but rename</b> and your comments relating the phenomenon to Nazis.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think the admins themselves should decide this, not some of these bigots. It is Wikipedia policy to be fair, objective, and NPOV.

It's <b>HYPOCRISY!</b>.

<dd>Ok, thanks for clearing that up. But if this article is kept on Wikipedia, I'm still going to be working on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a>. Until <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> is deleted, I will bring <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a> to perfect featured article status, although it currently does not exist yet. I hope we'll be able to come to a compromise in the following days, if not, expect <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a> to grow! I'm doing this in the name of NPOV, because I don't believe it's right to allow this clearly biased article to exist.

<li>Townships in Indiana (even in Indianapolis) often form the basis for structuring school districts. Indianapolis has eleven school districts; three of them (Indianapolis Public Schools, Speedway and Beech Grove) are legacy districts from before Unigov; the other eight correspond to (but do not exactly coincide with) eight of the nine townships that comprise Indianapolis. Elsewhere in Indiana, it's quite commonly the case that school districts closely follow township boundaries, although it's far more common in less densely populated areas for one district to contain multiple townships. (There are other township-related functions -- property tax assessment and collection is a township function, as are poor relief, small claims courts, and, in many places, fire protection.) <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 03:34, Apr 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that routine information on schools should be included on the page of the relevant town or county or whatever. I am fine with redirects as appropriate. If those pages get too large as a result, the information could be transferred to a page on the school district or whatever administrative unit is used by a particular country. If individual schools are particularly significant (as opposed to just having long-winded entries) then that school can have its own page. This allows the information to be kept and the proliferation of small, often poor quality articles to be kept in check. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 01:37, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just that regardless of your opinion on the article you should do more research before accusing fellow wikipedians of acting in bad faith; though I assume you are smart enough to realize that and are just egging me on a bit, because that is a more positive thought than the alternative. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 06:35, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually I'd just like you to explain how you arrived at the conclusion that a coherent arrangement of information on a single mundane topic is nonsense - or as you so nicely put it, an "indisciminate collection of items of information". I see no nonsense here, and hence no reason for deletion. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 07:06, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have misread the quote. The phrase "indiscriminate collection of items of information (which is taken straight from the policy page and is not how I put it) refers to wikipedia and not to an individual article therein. Whether you agree that including this article violates said policy or not is immaterial to whether this is a valid VfD. There is a difference of opinion about what information belongs in the encyclopedia and what information would turn it into an indiscriminate collection of items of information (something quite different from nonsense; I am intrigued at how you pulled that definition out of those words), which is why we have these discussions and votes, but this nomination is perfectly in-line with policy. Your view that only vanity, original research, and nonsense should be deleted is actually a narrower view than the deletion policy itself puts forth. You are entitled to have that opinion and vote based on that opinion, but you are not entitled to accuse users of nominating articles contrary to the actual deletion policy when they have not done so. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 07:18, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As you are well aware, the Wikipedia default position on all articles and the information contained therein is <i>retention</i> - unless - and <i>only</i> unless - there are compelling reasons for deletion. This is the clear and unambiguous intent and spirit of the deletion policy as it currently stands. Nonsense, vanity and original research are the only stated compelling reasons to delete content from Wikipedia under that policy. This nomination fails that basic test, and is therefore invalid. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 23:47, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Have you even read the deletion policy? The following reasons are unambiguously given for listing an article on VfD: "No potential to become encyclopedic (see WP:NOT), Original research, Inappropriate user pages in excessive or stubborn cases, Vanity page, Advertising or other spam, Completely idiosyncratic non-topic." Notice that WP:NOT is unambiguously tied to the deletion policy as the place to go for a definition of no potential to become encyclopedic. If one were to bother to read that page, one would see the following categories unambiguously stated: "Wikipedia is not a dictionary, Wikipedia is not a soapbox, Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files, Wikipedia is not a free host or webspace provider, Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball." Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base is further defined as follows on the same page: "Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base, that is, it is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not: Lists of Frequently Asked Questions, Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics, Travel guides, Memorials, News reports, Genealogical entries, or phonebook entries, Directories, directory entries, or a resource for conducting business."</li>
<li>I have directly cut and pasted this information from the appropriate pages which expound the official deletion policy of wikipedia. This policy unambiguously states many more categories of articles that can be placed on VfD and properly deleted than just nonsense, vanity, and original research. Your position is directly contradicted by the express words of the policy. You are certainly allowed to vote your conscience and vote to keep the article, but the listing is perfectly valid. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 00:22, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can cut and paste as much as you like, but unfortunately you still haven't demonstrated any direct correlation between Wikipedia's deletion policy and this nomination, which clearly does NOT comply with ANY of the policy requirements listed above or anywhere else within Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 00:58, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is plenty of play in the joints of the unencyclopedic criteria and in what wikipedia is not. The listed examples are only those for which a strong consensus has been reached, and some of those examples are ambiguous themselves. Due to this ambiguity and differences of opinion on what the limits of this criteria are, there are naturally debates that play out on VfD. You interpret the guidelines narrowly, others do so more broadly. Claiming that there is no room for debate is simplistic, and claiming that only vanity, original research, and nonsense are the only criteria is just plain wrong. And besdies, if these school nominations are not valid, why do admins honor the results whether it is to keep or delete? <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 01:09, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you. Thank you so much. That is exactly my view. People seem to think that a school automatically has a Vfd-proof bubble around it and vehemently oppose any naysayers. However, I wouldn't say two weeks is overly long. Since the Schoolwatch team have now made the deletion of all schools a point of contention, each and every deletion discussion that would otherwise be short and simple now becomes a bitter struggle of wills between the "keep every school no matter what" and the "delete if it's useless/obscure" camps. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 00:43, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

Deletion would be inappropriate, since the current text doesn't actually encourage one to purchase the drink, even if some of the text reads like slightly POV ad-copy.

<p>OK, it seems the 42 Below (brand) deletion tag has been removed; this is also a brand owned by 42 Below Limited. Lets remove this deletion request too. More will be added to this page as the brand becomes more popular. Cheers.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Gallery of Book of Kells pages and Gallery of Vergilius Romanus miniatures. I have made these arguments at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Gallery_of_pages_from_the_Vienna_Dioscurides_22aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Gallery of pages from the Vienna Dioscurides">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Gallery of pages from the Vienna Dioscurides</a>, but I will also make them here. First, I strongly believe that pictures are absolutely essential for understanding art objects. If a particular art object is notable enough for an article then the pictures themselves have encyclopedic value, the only question is how best to present them. the same can be said about individual artist, the best way to understand their works is to see as many images as possible. (See for example the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_gallery_cf56.html" title="William-Adolphe Bouguereau gallery">William-Adolphe Bouguereau gallery</a>) In my opinion, there are only two viable options: tacking the images onto the end of the article, as has been done for the <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Aureus_of_Lorsch_261e.html" title="Codex Aureus of Lorsch">Codex Aureus of Lorsch</a>, or creating a separate article, as has been done for Gallery of Book of Kells pages and Gallery of Vergilius Romanus miniatures. I believe that the second option is superior because these galleries can contain a very large number of images. Tacking these onto the end of long article such as the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Kells_61e3.html" title="Book of Kells">Book of Kells</a> can make the pages unwieldy and ugly. Creating a gallery on Commons is not, in my mind, a viable option. First, the most common means of informing a reader of the existence of Commons material, use of the {{Commons|article name}} template, is not particularly useful for a casual reader, they won't know what that little box in the corner means. It is true that a link to a gallery on Commons can be constructed which looks like a regular wiki link, but as this would take a hypothetical casual reader out of Wikipedia, without warning, which at the least would cause confusion. In addition, there is an active discussion on Commons as to whether images should be collected into articles or into categories. At some time a consensus will on Commons may be reached to not have articles, only categories, at which time we would be left without the galleries we need. Finally, Commons is a multilingual wiki. I do not think it would be a good thing to send casual readers to a gallery that is a babel of languages like <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Louvre" class="extiw" title="commons:Louvre">this one</a>, or even worse, one that has no English text. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 16:37, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have not voted on Gallery of illuminated manuscript images. Although I created this monster, I have been recently thinking that the same purpose would be better served by creating a Category, Illuminated manuscript images. It would not grieve me to see this go. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 16:41, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think that there should be deletion if there is a commons page and it should be used because syncrhonization of <a href="../../../e/n/_/En.html" title="En">en</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commons.html" title="Commons">commons</a> pages is unlikely to be flawless. I also think there needs to be a specific policy about how the use of the commons so that this issue is settled. I am not sure I understand the article for redundance with commons and en pages unless they aren't released under free licenses. That might be a good reason *shrugs* I just want an official decision so it can dictate my actions... I just stress to anyone working with gallery pages to <i>please</i> help put things to the commons if they are under a license that allows it so that we can help our friends using other languages. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 00:55, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not as familiar with the "This article is actively undergoing a major edit" tag as I probably should be so I left a note on the talk page indicating that I'd be putting it up for vfd.

<p><b>Band Vanity</b> Coheety is a four-piece rock band from Tiverton, Rhode Island in the United States. ... The following summer, 2001, they recorded and released their third album, The Sizbotean. There was one last farewell show and the boys all went off to separate colleges. This didn't stop them, though. They got together during their winter break and recorded some demos.

<p>Currently tagged with {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-importance_717c.html" title="Template:Cleanup-importance">cleanup-importance</a>}}. This article only <i>tries</i> to describe George Hay, the 8th Marquis of Tweedale. Still, I fail to see how the title "Marquis of Tweedale" is notable enough. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> | <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">Talk</a> 04:42, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Should be moved to George Hay, 8th Marquis of Tweedale and expanded, and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis_of_Tweedale_9845.html" title="Marquis of Tweedale">Marquis of Tweedale</a> page made into a dab page for a list of all of the marquises. That's the standard for other British title articles. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 20:14, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Looks like someone has mostly fixed this already. Briefly:
<ul>
<li>In the UK, the title is usually Marquess, rather than Marquis.</li>
<li>Tweedale is a typo; it should be Tweed<i>d</i>ale.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis_of_Tweedale_9845.html" title="Marquis of Tweedale">Marquis of Tweedale</a>'s content should be moved to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Hay%2C_8th_Marquess_of_Tweeddale_9425.html" title="George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale">George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale</a>. This has been done, but by cut &amp; paste rather than page move; an admin will have to properly merge the histories.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis_of_Tweedale_9845.html" title="Marquis of Tweedale">Marquis of Tweedale</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquess_of_Tweeddale_3285.html" title="Marquess of Tweeddale">Marquess of Tweeddale</a>. This has been done. The latter page lists all the Marquesses of Tweeddale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So, leave this as a <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquess_of_Tweeddale_3285.html" title="Marquess of Tweeddale">Marquess of Tweeddale</a>. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">Talk</a> 23:53, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>I am Nishan de Mel</b>. I've stumbled apon this page and am somewhat amused, I have no idea how this page came to be created. The picture associated with the page is certainly not my picture even though the information contained in it is basically accurate. The argument for my importance seems very dubious; and all the criticisms except the one which claims I have written almost nothing, seem rather well directed.

<li>I believe Gonterman deserves a place on Wikipedia as he is a particularly notable figure in the Internet domain of bad fanfiction writers.

<li>A lot. Professional racing drivers are all notable. I'm no inclusionist, but if they have competed in a professional event and especially won one, they are notable. People will look in an encyclopaedia for information on a racing driver. Thousands of people attend racing events, all who will see the drivers as quite important.

<li>I still feel that it fails to pass the "more notable than the average professor" test. Thousands of people attend college lectures, all of whom (well, most) will see the professors as quite important. But most of the professors do not rate encyclopedia articles. Further, is this really the place that most race fans would turn to for info on drivers? Should WP duplicate the Speedsportmag database? -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> 21:53, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why not? Thats like saying, "Should we duplicate 1911 Britannica's articles?" or "Should we duplicate ~any site~ with information on the USA?". Wikipedia is aiming to become the sum of all human knowledge, and why not everything is important in that sum, people may look here for info on a driver. Speedsportmag, which you refer to, doesn't provide anything other than Sofio's one race. Wikipedia provides more and so a race fan would possibly look here. As for professors, it is a completely different issue in that they aren't important out of that local area. I'm nowhere near where Formula Toyota Atlantic and Binder Racing are based, but to me the information on Sofio is relevant. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 22:39, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why not? We would eventually have had printing without Gutenberg, but without Lincoln the USA might not have survived the South's secession. People like Newton and Darwin belong in the list not so much for their discoveries (we would have figured out gravity and natural selection without them) but because their entire body of work has a beauty of its own, much like Michelangelo's or Leonardo's.

<li>Actually, I did hear somewhere that other people were working on a printing press before Gutenberg's - there was just something special about his when it came out, or he was the first, or something. (He was the Discovery Channel's Man of the Milennium, if I remember correctly.) But I don't understand how Lincoln changed the world on such a scale as Gutenberg. He prevented an insurrection and gave a nice speech, but it was all just pertinent to this one country. Not to be a cynic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I concur, now that it has been accurately titled (as World Almanac's Ten Most Influential People of the Second Millennium), it's a useful article.

And why has the voting gone on for so long, or is this a second vote or what? <big><i><b><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a></b></i></big> 06:26, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ordinarily, I don't favor the deletion of topics that deserve articles. But this article has literally no content--the full text is "The Chicago Democratic Machine is a well known example of machine politics.", plus a few see alsos. In addition, the see alsos are themselves dubious--for example, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Madigan_ca55.html" title="Mike Madigan">Mike Madigan</a> gets only 23 Google hits for "Mike Madigan" "Chicago Democratic Machine" (compare 7000 for "Mike Madigan" +Illinois). In short, this article has no content--WP would be better served by a red-link unless this is severely expanded, and I don't have the knowledge to do that. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 21:40, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is semi-encyclopedic. The phrase "Delta Q Delta" along with the predicate "in the college years" denotes origin of these cheat codes. A similar article can be found on <a href="http://doom.wikicities.com/wiki/Cheat_codes" class="external text" title="http://doom.wikicities.com/wiki/Cheat_codes" rel="nofollow">this net link</a>.

<li>I'd normally vote Delete, but <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">User:Zzyzx11</a> admitted on <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucky_6.9_c058.html" title="User talk:Lucky 6.9">User talk:Lucky 6.9</a> that this was a spite nomination, driven by the belief that <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDude115_8134.html" title="User:SuperDude115">User:SuperDude115</a> is actually <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuraiClinton_47cc.html" title="User:SamuraiClinton">User:SamuraiClinton</a>.

<ul>
<li>That is your point of view <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevelCheck_4bca.html" title="User:LevelCheck">LevelCheck</a>. If you think the message I wrote, <i>I want to let you know that I just put up one of SuperDude115's articles, DOOM cheats, on VFD because I saw that you suspect that he may be SamuraiClinton</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lucky_6.9&amp;oldid=12452970" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lucky_6.9&amp;oldid=12452970" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> implies that it is a "spite nomination" then so be it. The only thing I was doing was notifying them as a favor. As for the nomination itself, I think many people will agree with my original reason: <b>Wikipedia is not a place to post cheat codes.</b> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> | <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">Talk</a> 00:20, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevelCheck_4bca.html" title="User:LevelCheck">LevelCheck</a>, you also say that I am participating in a high-tech lynching.

<li>So you think exposing SamuraiClinton to (as of now 14) opposing comments (and growing) is <b>not</b> high-tech lynching? <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> | <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">Talk</a> 01:17, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As I've pointed out on <a href="../../../l/e/v/User_talk%7ELevelCheck_1ce7.html" title="User talk:LevelCheck">your talk page</a>, there's really no other way for other editors to interpret your nomination of SamuraiClinton as anything <i>but</i> malicious. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 02:12, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
