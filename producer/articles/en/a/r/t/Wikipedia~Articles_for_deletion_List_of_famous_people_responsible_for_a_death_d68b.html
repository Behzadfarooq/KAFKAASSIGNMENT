<p>Another list of famous people who... The big problem with this article is that it's scope is not clearly defined. Who qualifies as a celebrity, what qualifies as responsibility for death. Do you need to pull the trigger, fail to call the police at the right time, not know CPR, refuse a kidney, where is the line? Beyond the problem with scope, I question the encyclopedic value of this article. This article was just deleted(<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:FBnIbSOEGeoJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_people_responsible_for_a_death+http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_people_responsible_for_a_death&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:FBnIbSOEGeoJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_people_responsible_for_a_death+http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_people_responsible_for_a_death&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">google cache</a>) and recreated due to the large amount of unsourced statements that living people were responsible for death. I think this is a magnet for unverified information and a violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> waiting to happen. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 15:26, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. First "magnet for unverified information" and "violation of BLP waiting to happen" are <i>not</i> useful or valid reasons to delete an article. Given the phobia of the dreaded "overcategorization," this is a perfectly worthwhile, verifiable, and easily-maintainable list. I see no valid reason for deletion. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:30, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about the other issues I brought up? Regarding the scope? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 15:31, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That can easily be dealt with via editing. One editor's inability to define a scope doesn't mean that a scope cannot be defined. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ok, so where would you draw the line? So far no editor has defined the scope. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 16:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, and specifically for the scope; such a list is inherently arbitrary, taking in, potentially, everyone from <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Bush_b0c7.html" title="Laura Bush">Laura Bush</a> to celebrities who've served in the military (<a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_Gable_ee09.html" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a> was an air force gunner during WWII; does he count?

It could include <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wilkes_Booth_03b2.html" title="John Wilkes Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a> (famous before he shot Lincoln), but not <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Harvey_Oswald_15b9.html" title="Lee Harvey Oswald">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> (although, since there was pre-'63 press regarding his Russian hijinx, might he have counted, after all)? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 15:41, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Does not have the sober encyclopedic tone required for an encyclopedia article. By its nature this article will invite poorly sourced information in violation of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> tere being no encyclopaedic topic "famous person responsible for death", the term "famous" being subjective, and the degree of responsibility likely to vary between failing to call the cops and actually pulling the trigger, plus the potential for endless sneaky POV and including the objections raised by Robertissimo, this list is arbitrary, subjective, and likely to violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> by lumping together living individuals of varying degrees of complicity. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 15:46, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> This is much better than the already deleted version. I don't think we should delete articles just because they are a magnet for abuse - the answer is to closely monitor the article to make sure it isn't abused. However, the scope is too poorly defined, and is too difficult to define. I don't think there is encyclopaedic value in this list. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 15:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Guy's points, to which might be added that it will inevitably fall afoul of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> in that even when a negative, well-sourced fact is available, a list cannot communicate it in a balanced, sober fashion.

<li><b>Delete</b> As mentioned above, the critera of being 'resonsible for a death' is too vague to be clearly supported. If a source mentions that someone is not reponsible for a death in a legal context but clearly describes them as the primary actor in the event, does that qualify or disqualify for inclusion? If in an interview a man declares himself responsible for his wife's death because he was out of town of business, or forgot to load their home defense weapon, is that the type of resposibility that is being referenced? The large scope of things that the word 'responsible' describes, which can potentially conflict, is inherently problematic. And that is even apart form any consideration of merit or potential for negative interactions with BLP or POV issues. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 16:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Is Bush responsible for deaths in his Iraq war? Bin Laden for the trade tower deaths? The format does not provide room for encyclopedic coverage of the grey areas and "fame" and "responsibility" are mostly grey with very little black and white. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 17:18, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Astounding BLP implications aside, the scope of this is too wide and much too vague, per most of the above. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="purple">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="red">ka</font></a> 17:38, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> I concur with tango. The article is a magnet for abuse yes? reason to delete probably not, althought there may be other reasons. I did delete it when 100% of article was unsourced. NOw it isn't. -- <small><a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini">Drini</a></small> 17:53, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> about the dangers if this list is allowed to stay. How long before we get into a dispute over whether to add <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> on the grounds that they were responsible for the Iraq war? Or celebrity women who have had an abortion? I do not think this is a suitable subject for an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 18:01, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> inclusion is arbitrary, and it's not clear what inclusion signifies; better covered in individual articles where it can be presented in context. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 18:07, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Cost/benefit analysis is, in my opinion, a sometimes valid way to look at deletion questions. Encyclopedic value? Very little. Potential for trouble? Fairly high. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:14, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Too vague. "Responsibility" (apparently meaning moral responsibility) is not something an encyclopedia can decide. Would a soldier make the list for shooting enemy troops? What about a general who puts the troops on the field in the first place? What about a CEO whose company's factories have poor safety records? This looks like a libel magnet waiting to happen, and with very little encyclopedic value to offset the risk. I could see a "List of convicted murderers" or even "List of court cases involving a death", but not this. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:33, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. 'Famous' is ridiculously subjective; as is 'responsible'. If Madonna has an abortion, does that qualify as being 'responsible' for a 'death'? If Mel Gibson's dad has a stroke and ends up in a coma on life support, does Mel become 'responsible' for the death if he agrees that it's time to pull the plug? Further to that, is the judge who agreed to let <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Schiavo_eb3a.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a>'s feeding tube be removed 'responsible' for her death? How about the family members who made the request? Just the one(s) who removed the tube? Maybe the doctors who declared that she was in an irrecoverably vegetative state? <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 18:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per subjectivity of famous. Plus it could be listcruft easily if not handled properly.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 19:53, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - if properly verified and referenced, I see no insurmountable problem with this article. The ambiguities can be resolved by specifying more detail in the lede (not necessarily needed in the article's title, which should be kept simple) or by splitting the list into sub-articles. Now granted, looking at this AfD's results so far it looks like this is a futile "vote", but similar articles may show up later. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 20:28, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Adhering to our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy is only part of the picture. Another large part, ignored by all of the editors above who have asserted that individual entries can be sourced standalone is our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy's bearing upon the list as a whole. The legal systems of the world don't have a single "responsible for death" category. They have gradations, including murder, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, <a href="../../../v/e/h/Vehicular_homicide.html" title="Vehicular homicide">vehicular homicide</a>, and others. The world outside of Wikipedia does not lump all of these together, and thus Wikipedia should not do so, either, per our policy. Doing so is a novel synthesis of data that does not reflect the world outside of Wikipedia.
<p>And before someone suggests constructing individual lists of famous people who have been convicted of (say) involuntary manslaughter: Even ignoring for now the admonition in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> not to create lists of "famous X", a list of famous people who have committed a particular crime is of little relevance to encyclopaedic discussion of those crimes, and is of no use to readers who have come wanting an encyclopaedia rather than a tabloid newspaper. The important cases as far as readers, who come to an encyclopaedia to learn about involuntary manslaughter, are concerned are not the cases that involve famous people. They are the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_case.html" title="Landmark case">landmark cases</a> where the details of the law on involuntary manslaughter have been settled, and where important legal principles were invented or overturned. <i>Those</i>, not lists of cases involving famous people, are the sort of lists that we as editors should be constructing for readers. (Better yet, we shouldn't be constructing mere lists of cases at all, but full discussions of the legal principles and details, citing the cases that were involved.)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>; far too vague. I appreciate badlydrawnjeff's efforts; perhaps a separate list of people responsible for accidental deaths? I like the Burroughs/Tell entry, but the other entries on the page are just murders/manslaughters that are just a drop in the bucket of famous people responsible for a death. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 17:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
