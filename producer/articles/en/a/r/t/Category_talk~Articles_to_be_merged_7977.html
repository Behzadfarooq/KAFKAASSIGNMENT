<dd>It appears that some of the sub-pages of that category have been deleted. In the last few days I've come across a few pages that I've "fixed" the bot-created date stamp to its "proper" date (the date it was actually proposed). Now all but January, October, and the huge September are there (but many of the links still have the <i>proper</i> months included). The ones I noticed were still there, but just a few hours later (meaning right now), they're gone. Is this a glitch or is there some reason the ones from June and August were deleted? Or were they all "taken care of" since then and I just happened to add the template change after they were deleted?

<dd>Oh....i had them tagged for speedy deletion. I've been going through the old merge by month categories and cleaning them out - so merging when a merge was agreed on and removing tags when the merge was oppossed. I thought...they were automatically generated by the template. So i figured i'd tag them for deletion once i emptied the categories. But yes, the deleted categories were all empty when i tagged them. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 03:18, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been considering this merge and redirect for a couple of weeks now, but a current problem on the article that will be redirected made me decide I'd better learn now how to proceed. I have already posted to the talk page concerning my belief that a merge of articles would be a logical and beneficial step. Of course, I want to give all interested parties a chance to contribute to the discussion, so I need to know --&gt; If I submit a request on the Category page here, how many days or weeks will it be before a decision is made? Any things I need to know that I can't read of either of these two pages?

<dd>If you tag the two articles needing to be merged with the merge template headers, then anyone who reads the article will be aware a merge is to be planned. Also, when you tag articles as being needing of a merge, you can write in the edit summary that you're proposing a merge. This will also alert people who have the articles on their watchlists but do not actually check the article regularly.</dd>
<dd>If a discussion is started, then the merging shouldn't be done until consensus is reached in the discussion (or not done at all if it turns out that the consensus is to not merge). Otherwise, i'd say give it a week or two and if no one comments, then there's probably no one opposing. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 06:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why don't we borrow from the QFD format, and make a Wikipedia: Articles for Merging section, where the discussions for merging two articles.

<dd>Yeah, i am. I just didn't have anything to say about this. What exactly is the QFD format? And why exactly do we need it? I spent some time a few weeks ago carrying out old merges, and i didn't find it all that difficult to just look at the talk pages of both articles to decide whether or not people objected to the merge. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 02:41, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the actual problem is that merging is a difficult process that usually takes some amount of knowledge in the subject, which is why this category is so back-logged. <span style="font-size: 10px">â€”&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 05:17, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've noticed, after doing some myself, that many merges really aren't all that hard to do. Although some are. I don't suppose something like a "merge by topic" would work? So sort out merge requests by topic (e.g. "mathematics", "fiction"...etc)? Or would that just take way too much work to do? --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 07:04, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It'd probably be a lot of work, but it'd also probably be worth it. Where do you suggest this sort of thing? Personally, I'd leave the current categories in place, then add specific categoties as subcategories. That way, people could still see the whole list at once, but also look at sections specific to what they know. Maybe we could even include a MERGE RATING SCALE(not shouting, just can't see very well, so having trouble counting apostrophes), that would rate the difficulty of merging the respective articles(Merging a singe paragraph into an article wouldn't be difficult, but merging two similar articles might be..).--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVercalos_9f82.html" title="User:Vercalos">Vercalos</a> 00:31, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well...a few weeks ago, i went through the "merge by month" categories and tried to clean out the oldest ones. And most of them really weren't that hard to do - IIRC, i only encountered three where i decided to just leave since i didn't have enough background knowledge in the area. So perhaps a specific tag and category for "difficult merges" would be appropriate?</dd>
<dd>As for merge by subject...well, the easiest way would be to introduce a new variable into all the merge tag templates, so when someone adds a merge tag, they'll have to choose a category, and the article automatically gets sorted (kind of how we use the one-letter code in the AfD tag to sort them). Old merge articles will still be unsorted, but the new ones would get sorted into categories by subject.</dd>
<dd>Just a thought, is there a wikiproject responsible for cleaning out backlogs like this? --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 01:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that most pages aren't that hard to do in most cases and I think a list of difficult merges, or merges requiring expert attention is a <b>brilliant</b> idea, and that would probably be the most important list to categorize by subject (i mean, an "expert" isn't an expert in everything...)

<p>Hi there. I hope someone reads this. I have basically no meta-wiki skills so I don't know how I would impliment this but it would be extremely helpful if there were a place to look at all the articles to be merged in one list, either sorted by date, by subject, or not sorted at all. I thought there used to be a page like that but I can't find it. Anyway, can someone please let me know if there is such a page, or if not, how to make it or refer it to someone who can?
