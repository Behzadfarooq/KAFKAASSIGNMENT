<li><b>CELEBRITIES WORLDWIDE DELETION PROTEST</b>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Celebrities Worldwide is in fact an industry recognised standard, held in as much regard as a reference point as organisations such as the Press Association and the Internet Movie database. Their clients include major news organisations such as the BBC and ITN. Their website is www.celebritiesworldwide.com - I am talking from experience, as i once worked/am working in the entertainment industry. Please let me know if you still feel they are not genuine - I feel they are an invaluable source to professional industry people, not third rate hacks, who they most certainly wouldn't do business with</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>SC (<a href="../../../s/i/x/User%7ESixorgansofadmittance_2c82.html" title="User:Sixorgansofadmittance">User:Sixorgansofadmittance</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>The article is written in such a way as to present itself as nothing more than an advertisement for the contact service. See <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> for more information. If you can rewrite the article so that it does not come across as a promotional piece, and provide some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a> that establish <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">importance</a>, I'll be happy to reconsider my position. You are also welcome to remove the {{PROD}} tag if you feel that I have acted hastily. However, if the tag is removed with the article in its current state, it will likely be brought to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Articles for Deletion</a> discussion, where other editors will likely hold the same position as I do. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">Speak</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">Spoken</a></small> 14:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DELETION PROTEST</b>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Thank you for your concise, swift reply – much appreciated. First of all, let me say I fully appreciate your concerns, however, I believe you have misunderstood what Celebrities Worldwide and its sister company UPFRONT TV actually does. I've just discovered how useful these services are and it would be a real shame to deny Wikipedia visitors the chance to hear about them.</p>
<p>Celebrities Worldwide offers official contact information for celebrities. It's an amazing resource for anyone in the media or entertainment industry to make contact within seconds with the most direct point of contact for over 20,000 celebrities worldwide.</p>
<p>It's sister company UPFRONT TV is the celebrity booking service and the vast range of celebrities booked by UPFRONT is, I notice, detailed on www.celebritiesworldwide.com.</p>
<p>Both companies have had a key role in creating some of the most high profile events which have been extensively covered by the media and consequently have had a significant impact on popular culture, trend and style over many years. This has been and continues to be a major source of entertainment and fascination to the general public as a whole.</p>
<p>Finally, I notice you have listings for “Nike”, “MacDonald’s” and “Wal-Mart” on Wikipedia whose content does not seem to differ greatly from the information I have provided on the above 2 services.</p>
<p>I trust you will reconsider.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<li>As I detailed in my previous response, the primary issue that I have with the article is its promotional tone. The point I was making regarding the use of the names of Tom Cruise and David Beckham is that I believe that the names were used in order to associate their names with the company, when in fact there is no evidence provided that either of them are actually associated with the company. The article should be written in with a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> in order to avoid sounding like an advertisement. The comparison of this article to articles about <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike.html" title="Nike">Nike</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> doesn't really help much. The articles are definitely not written in a promotional fashion. In fact, the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike.html" title="Nike">Nike</a> articles contain quite a bit of information which is negative. These are giant companies that are clearly <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. It would be very difficult to argue that the articles on these companies should be deleted due to the fact that articles such as Celebrities Worldwide have been proposed for deletion. Once again, you are perfectly welcome to remove the {{PROD}} tag if you feel that I am wrong on this issue (I am just another editor like yourself, not an <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">admin</a>), but I don't believe that the article would survive in its current state if it were to go to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Articles for deletion</a>. You might want to take a look at some of the guidelines and policies I have mentioned (highlighted) to get a better feel for what should be included compared to what should not be included. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">Speak</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">Spoken</a></small> 17:25, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The way to persuade editors is not to argue that Wikipedia visitors should not be denied the opportunity to read an advertisement, which will if anything make editors only more firmly convinced that this article should be deleted, but to demonstrate that this company satisfies the criteria laid out in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:28, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
