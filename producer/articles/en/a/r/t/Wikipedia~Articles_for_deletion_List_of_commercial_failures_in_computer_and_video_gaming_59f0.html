<li><b>Keep</b> <i>commercial failure</i> is determined by the external references used in the article. While the article may have original research in it the Subject does not. Keep per comment from Richardclavell. In response to Jchap2007's comment above - subjective and verifyable are not inextricably linked and objectivity is not a requirement for verifyability from reliable sources. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 01:16, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I respectfully disagree. The American Heritage Dictionary defines subjective as "Proceeding from or taking place within an individual's mind such as to be unaffected by the external world...existing only in the mind; illusory." I don't believe that such a thing is verifiable. On the other hand, so-and-so made such-and-such statement would be objective (and verifiable). But "List of computer games, hardware, etc. that someone has declared to be a commercial failure" still would not be an acceptable list. <font face="Old English Text MT"><a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007"><span style="padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px; background: black; color: white">JChap</span></a> <big><b><a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007"><span style="color: black">T</span></a><span style="color:black">/</span><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JChap2007_1e7f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JChap2007"><span style="color:black">E</span></a></b></big></font> 01:30, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is actually the very definition of "<b>commercial</b> failure". Sure it was a critical success, and was well received by those that bought it but it was a huge <b>commercial</b> failure.

<li><b>Comment</b> I just wanted to point out that while the list of failed gaming consoles is I think, a quite good idea (but what, no Shanda EZ, guys?), a complete list (or okay, only a list of those produced by notable game companies) of video games which were commercial failures would <u>ridiculously</u> long, containing maybe as much as 60%-80% of all games released (after all, this is very much a hit-driven industry), and this even before accounting for <a href="../../../v/a/p/Vapourware.html" title="Vapourware">vapourware</a>. The number of games released is obviously much higher (thousands more) than the number of automobiles that have been commercially marketed (though the list wouldn't be as large as say, List of commercial failures in fiction publishing or List of commercial failures in the Hollywood movie industry). If the list was only to be selective and so deliberately shortened to a manageable size, then the question arises about how this selection was decided, and if it is a subjective choice. Can someone come up with what this selective criteria would be? Such criteria would also help with the POV/OR objections raised in this discussion<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:17, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I mean, the opening line is a staggering and very misleading understatement about the industry:"The computer and video games industry has seen several commercial failures since its birth in the late 1970s".

<li><b>Strong keep</b> It needs sources, but I love this article. I think it's a great idea for an article, I think it has much encyclopedic value, and I wouldn't dispute that anything mentioned in the article was a failure. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 11:26, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> I just added a few citations (not hard at all, but I only did hardware, the games themselves might be tougher and therefore may need pruning), and some of 'em are great reads in themselves. Recommended: Gizmondo Bizarro! But I feel the games that can be referenced should also be kept. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBustter_0784.html" title="User:Bustter">Bustter</a> 11:38, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete the video games section as excessively inclusive list</b> and <b>Rename list as List of video game console commercial failures</b> as per my objections above.

<dd>I can't vouch for all the games but some games do appear to be well sourced. E.T for example is well covered and I don't see any reason to remove that. The game list may need to be limited but I believe that an complete deletion is a mistake. Also the Psychonauts section is well sourced as well --Edgelord 00:46, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> It has many, many references stating the games as commercial failures (i.e. not OR). If a few entries are uncited, just remove them, move to the talk page, or add a citation needed template, instead of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrystallina_cbad.html" title="User:Crystallina">Crystallina</a> 14:15, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete video games section</b> as impossible to keep up and <b>Rename hardware list</b> per Bwithh. Of the thousands of video games released every year, it strikes me as impossible to a) manage the list and b) decide what a commercial failure is. I agree with the editors who say it's too subjective. The 'commercial failures' wikilink doesn't go to a page about what a commercial failure is - it goes to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECommercial_failure_lists_65b9.html" title="Category:Commercial failure lists">Category:Commercial failure lists</a>, which...(wait for it).. includes this list.

<li><b>Verify or Delete.</b> Hate to break this list, really, it is quite thorough and interesting, but like dozen of people have mentioned already regarding the commercial failure lists: what is the objective criterion defining commercial failure?

<li><b>Keep</b>, but I do suggest adding a more specific definition of what constitutes "failure". For example, include a sentence saying something like "For purposes of this article failure is defined as reliable, independent news sources referring to the product as performing very poorly in the marketplace." That would help avoid the inclusion of borderline products that some people thought were failures and some don't, and also help avoid uncited inclusions.<a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
