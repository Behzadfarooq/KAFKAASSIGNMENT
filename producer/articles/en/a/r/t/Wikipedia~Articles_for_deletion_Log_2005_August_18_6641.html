<ul>
<li>Not necessarily; notability and encyclopedic value need to be established for each article separately, which is why I listed them separately. It's possible that one will be considered notable enough (client count, market penetration, etc.) that it will be kept, while the others are not. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenwarren_49e7.html" title="User:Kenwarren">Ken</a> 22:49, August 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a new product space... There needs to be some way to describe these services/products in a factual way. For Zinio, I would remove "As of 2005, over 200 magazines use Zinio and it has 62% market share of audited digital circulation." as this is a "claim" which cannot be externally verified, and in any case, is subject to change over time. For <a href="../../../n/x/t/NXTbook_Media_f762.html" title="NXTbook Media">NXTbook Media</a> and Texterity as long as the descriptions are somewhat factual, its necessary to keep their entries to maintain parity. These are all "vendor generated" descriptions, but unless someone has a better idea, it's better to have some information rather than nothing.</li>

<li>It has been listed as a copyvio, but I'd just like to add my <b>delete</b> vote to make sure an article is never written on this title.

<li>I don't think it's a copyvio and I've removed the notice and reverted the article. The declared source of the copyvio is a set of online lecture notes that makes one brief reference to an "Anti catholic book alleging Catholic plot for domination in US," but does not contain so much as a single sentence matching anything in the article. Due to grammar and general bad writing I think it's vanishingly unlikely that the article is a copy of anything published by a print publisher. <i>If Lacrimosus just wants to make the offensive material less visible he should make some other kind of edit.</i> And a courtesy, major edits made during a VfD really should be noted in the VfD discussion so that people joining the discussion later know that they are discussing something different from what was being discussed earlier. As I write this, the article is back to its original state except the correction of one typo. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 10:46, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've replaced the entire content with the line "See: <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Catholicism_6249.html" title="Anti-Catholicism">Anti-Catholicism</a>." Most of the above discussion relates to versions of the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Catholic_plot_for_world_domination&amp;oldid=21282012" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Catholic_plot_for_world_domination&amp;oldid=21282012" rel="nofollow">similar to this one</a>. If I'd been thinking more clearly I probably would just have made the article a redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Catholicism_6249.html" title="Anti-Catholicism">Anti-Catholicism</a> instead of dragging it through VfD, but as long as it's on the road to deletion let's continue, as "Catholic plot for world domination" is not anything that anyone is likely to type in and hence not very valuable as a redirect. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:22, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>This is page of a chapter of the <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psi_Upsilon_81c2.html" title="Psi Upsilon">Psi Upsilon</a> Fraternity. There are about 2 other chapters of the same fraternity that have individual articles but I'm putting this one up because I'm not sure how the voting will turn out. I'm putting this up for VfD because there's really not much substance to this article. It would be best to link the chapter website from from the <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psi_Upsilon_81c2.html" title="Psi Upsilon">Psi Upsilon</a> article instead of having each individual chapter having a seperate article and thus opening the possibilty of having a "personal" websites of chapters from any fraternity within an encyclopedia. Having one article of a national fraternity is enough. We don't need articles of every individual chapter.

<p>The Daily Howler is notable because it is one of the most influential political blogs out there. Arguably, it is notable also because it was one of the earliest political blogs (1998).</p>
<p><b>Evidence of influence (this list could easily be expanded)</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Journalism_Review_5be6.html" title="Columbia Journalism Review">Columbia Journalism Review</a> ran an article<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3613/is_200501/ai_n9478217" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3613/is_200501/ai_n9478217" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> about The Daily Howler and its author Bob Somerby from which I quote: "Bob Somerby needs no introduction, of course, unless your days are spent solely in the brick-and-mortar world..."</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Krugman_2111.html" title="Paul Krugman">Paul Krugman</a> opened one of his op-eds<a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/080304.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/080304.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p>A message to my fellow journalists: check out media watch sites like campaigndesk.org, mediamatters.org and dailyhowler.com. It's good to see ourselves as others see us. I've been finding The Daily Howler's concept of a media "script," a story line that shapes coverage, often in the teeth of the evidence, particularly helpful in understanding cable news.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Daily Howler was included by CNN<a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/inthefield/blog/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/inthefield/blog/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> on a list of about twenty "political must-read" websites.</li>
<li>It is currently listed by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_Internet_43d9.html" title="Alexa Internet">Alexa</a> as the tenth ranked journalism site.<a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=8040" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=8040" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
<li>Many of the most prominent political blogs include The Daily Howler on their blog roll or equivalent, despite the fact that Somerby does not reciprocate (he has no such list): e.g. <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instapundit.html" title="Instapundit">Instapundit</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Delong_e2ae.html" title="Brad Delong">Brad Delong</a>'s site<a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> (I only checked these three).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Replies to comments by others</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree with <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> that this article is not that well-written. Call me crazy, but I created a stub in the hope that the Wikipedia community would improve it.</li>
<li>I don't understand why fuddlemark thinks the article is POV. I thought I bent over backwards to make it NPOV with locutions like "according to Bob Somerby".</li>
<li>Google rankings: when I search for "daily howler" on Google<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22daily+howler%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22daily+howler%22" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> I get 1.54 million hits (not that it makes a qualitative difference, but I'm not sure why I get a different number than <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>; perhaps we have different preferences). I think the "unique" number <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> refers to is the number in the sentence at the end of a Google search (I had to go all the way to page 37 for "daily howler"):</li>
</ul>
<p>"In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the XXX already displayed." For "daily howler", I get XXX = 367.

<ul>
<li>I agree with Proto that most blogs are not notable, but of course that argument has no force in talking about a particular blog. I strongly disagree with his/her notion that all articles about particular blogs be merged into a single article or list. Should we do the same for newspapers? In fact I think Wikipedia has the opposite problem: the coverage of notable blogs is weaker than I would expect, especially of an online encyclopedia.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the Daily Howler is well enough known for inclusion.

<p><i>Terry Gasper is a game commonly played by Worthington,_Ohio and environs teens specifically students at Linworth AP and Thomas Worthington High School</i></p>
<p>A Google search for <b>"Terry Gasper" Linworth</b> gets 0 hits. Either this is completely made up or too insignificant for Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnargle_b80e.html" title="User:Snargle">Snargle</a> 03:55, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The game is an underground sensation getting bigger. I understand the criteria for what should be included in an encylopedia but I think the idea that its relevency is directly tied to its google score (or apparent lack thereof) is pure folly. I mean, if you do a search on 'columbus teens whippits' or any phrasing close to that you pull up nothing but porn yet last month no less than four local Columbus establishments were busted for selling 'whippit kits' to youngsters. Now, this is a significant story and issue and yet has no coverage from Google except to the Columbus Dispatch and other subscription only (and thus non-annexable by Google) local newspapers. <a href="../../../c/g/a/User%7ECgardner_18e2.html" title="User:Cgardner">cgardner</a> 01:24, 18 August 2005 (EST)</p>

<p>This "game" or "activity" or whatever you choose to call it is real, and only getting bigger. As a former resident of Worthington, class of 2003 graduate, and class president I can assure all the unbelievers that this passtime exists. Sure it is still struggling for popularity, and it is doubtful there will ever be tournements, it is still a huge part of youth culture in a small suburban midwestern town.</p>

<p>I can vouch for this game. I'm from Worthington and graduated high school in 2000. Though I don't know who this Terry Gasper guy is, I can tell you that the game has reached Miami University of Oxford, Ohio where I first learned about it at a party. It's not as big as beer pong by any stretch, but I'd go as far as to say that most people around campus would have heard of it. I don't know if this helps or not. -D.G.</p>

<li>I was referring to the creating (or expanding) of articles on schools; surely you're not suggesting that the WikiProject Schools is responsible for the school deletion nominations? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 14:16, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, actually I wrongly thought that this is what you were suggesting. Nor does that WikiProject govern the creating and expanding of school articles. They seem to be largely spontaneously occurring wikifauna. Their may be a fairly strong sieve effect favoring the deletion of schools outside the developed world, even taking into account the geographical concentrations of Wikipedians; less verifiable information is available. Ideas on how that might be counteracted would be welcome. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:38, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>See, that is precisely the problem. I'm talking about expanding or creating articles on schools outside of the US/UK area, and you are talking about countering the deletion of them.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not a notable high school, and the only people who would look this up are the people that live in the area and went to the school. Their only claim to fame is that they won a soccer championship and was attended by a semi-notable historian. My high school was visited by a president and won dozens of state titles, but that doesn't mean it deserves an article, because nobody cares about a little ol' school in the suburbs of a big city.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think this is very interesting. I haven’t been here in over six months when there was a pretty even chance of this breaking even for keep/delete. Back then i was a deletionist and i am not going to say that the big shift in community opinion comes as a pleasant discovery. However, if our space ever outgrows our resources and something such as downsizing is necessary, i think you can rest assured that non-notable schools will be at least looked at as a target. if nothing else other people who arnt in support of these articles will jump at the chance. After this in time iv found that i dont really care and just wish this amount of energy could be focused don bringing our species description articles as up to date because were sorely lacking support in that area. Since species are more important than a simple human institution, the vigor of the support for the articles somewhat mystifys me. <a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFledgeling_731d.html" title="User:Fledgeling">Fledgeling</a> 04:34, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unlike schools, species articles are not "endangered" (as it were) on wikipedia, and therefore do not need so much support. Since storage space is essentially free, the online version of wikipedia will never run out. Cut-down versions of wikipedia would however be useful for distribution, and for providing random page users with a more educational experience. These versions can be provided in a non-destructive way by rating or tagging existing pages, e.g. the recent <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/En_validation_topics" class="extiw" title="meta:En_validation_topics">validation proposal</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:16, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We keep railway stations. We keep bridges. We keep highways. We keep radio masts.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Why are so many suggesting that they stop being nominated "until consensus is reached"? I suggested not nominating them because they won't be deleted; in other words for practical, not philosophical reasons. There is <b>no current discussion</b> on consensus. Wikipedia Schools is dead. There is <b>no ongoing effort</b> to reach consensus, since the pro-school faction seem to resent any effort to put a bar on notability, as is their right, since they view all schools as notable. If the discussion is taking place somewhere and I just don't know about it, please correct me.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html" title="User talk:Scimitar"><sup>parley</sup></a> 15:46, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree. There's no ongoing effort; all talks have broken down. Until and unless the strongly inclusionist trend of the past four months either declines significantly, or solidifies into a consensus to keep schools, we'll have an impasse and VfD will be the appropriate forum for resolving the matter.</li>
<li>I'd observe that those supporting the existence of school articles have become better at concentrating their energy on nominated school articles, using the five-day lag time to research and clean up articles. Those opposing school articles have only one realistic response to this: to concentrate on preschools and other more controversial entries. This could be a realistic way of building support for the case that there should be some kind of boundary (which I would support--unverifiable entries, which preschools tend to be, shouldn't be on Wikipedia). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:10, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The only real hope for those opposing school entries will be a serious decline of 'inclusionism'. Supporters will eventually turn to preschools and other institutions which may be less notable and research and clean up the articles in the same way now being undertaken for other schools. The view that schools are inherently notable includes private schools of all shape, preschools and other forms of schools. All VfD does at present, is force the cleaning up and researching of school stubs within the five-day lag time. In the meantime, the only sensible thing is continue VfD and for the 'inclusionists' to continue suggesting "stop nominating". This will be my vote on all schools I vote to <b>keep</b> from now on (or <b>Bicycle</b>).--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 20:37, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>So you're saying that <i>all</i> schools are important and deserve articles. Nobody's going to be writing a paper about school in metro Cleveland, where this information would be needed. The school has no importance, like many schools, and the article is useless. Should I make an article about my preschool, because our restroom had only one toilet and many kids, or how we couldn't go outside for our picnic because it was raining... no. It's pointless information, and nobody cares. The line has to be drawn somewhere.

<li>It's a matter of principle.

Well the content probably should have just been userfied, but since he said that he didn't want it up anymore, and blanked it himself, I felt there was no need to see this whole VfD out.

<ul>
<li>There are lots of discussions on trying to slim the VfD process, but they are not taking place here. Making the redirect suggestion here would be fine, simply making the redirect circumvents any disucussion. In some cases, people also merge during a VfD and that means that, even if a debtae concludes the page should be deleted it can't be because of the GFDL. So drastic action on the page should wait until the conclusion of the VfD, as it says on the tag. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 16:13, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I understand that, but there was nothing on the page. The creator of the page himself says he doesn't want it anymore.

<li><b>Comment'</b>. It's been the occasion of some interesting legal questions. Borkified and Jived documents were submitted as evidence in the case Scientology versus Panoussis, 1998 in Stockholm, as reported by freelance journalist Karin Spaink. The defendants claimed that this was legitimate parody; the plaintiffs, violation of copyright. I've started a small section on this and will complete it when I found out whether the issue of parody through automatic filters was ever decided.

<dd>First one: "very short articles providing little or no context". Mind you, I'm not disputing the context could be extended based on what was in the article and/or personal knowledge (you obviously did so). Further disagreements are tantamount to asking what context is needed before it moves away from "little or no context". A useful question, but one the CSD policy does not answer, and is left to personal opinion (with common sense applied, of course). <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 15:42, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, while I understand your reasoning, well I don't think there should be anything special in a stub. If my son said "what's jive.exe" and I replied "it's one of those programs that translate ordinary speech into a weird dialect", he'd probably have learned pretty much what the program was about. If that can happen in speech I don't see that it needs any more in the way of words to convey the same idea in a stub article. I think we should be permissive of stubs like this that obviously make sense. I've no idea what extra context would be required than the correct juxtaposition of the concept: <i>program</i>, <i>conversion</i> and <i><a href="../../../j/i/v/Jive.html" title="Jive">jive</a></i>, which were all there: <i>"Jive.exe is a <a href="../../../d/o/s/DOS_a58e.html" title="DOS">DOS</a> program that converts plain english to <a href="../../../j/i/v/Jive.html" title="Jive">jive</a>."</i> <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">User:JYolkowski</a> had earlier removed a speedy tag because, he said, he didn't think it lacked context. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:38, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I note that at the time <a href="../../../j/i/v/Jive.html" title="Jive">jive</a> contained nothing useful, and JYolkowski only removed the speedy tag without a clarification beyond "I think the context is sufficient" (making it a he-said-she-said-but-<b>I</b>-think case for any admin clearing it out). But I'm not arguing the point here: we agree that a reasonable difference of opinion is possible in this case, even if we may disagree on the most productive course of action, and we also obviously agree on the outcome of this VfD. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 00:27, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have come to believe that this article was inappropriately titled from the start (a typo?). All my sources indicate that the correct spelling is "De Vermis Mysteriis" – hence, the redirect I placed in the article. However, I don't believe that the improper spelling should appear in Wikipedia because it may mislead readers into believing that this is an alternate spelling. <b>It is not!</b> I can provide a list of sources with the correct spelling if necessary. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGate2Valusia_5b8a.html" title="User:Gate2Valusia"><sup><font color="midnightblue">G</font><font color="crimson">a</font><font color="darkorange">t</font><font color="steelblue">e</font></sup><font color="black"><big>2</big></font><small><font color="purple">Valusia</font></small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/a/t/User_talk%7EGate2Valusia_d693.html" title="User talk:Gate2Valusia"><font color="darkgreen">Oh?</font></a><font color="black">..(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gate2Valusia_f4b1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gate2Valusia">contribs</a>)</font></sup> <font color="mediumblue"><small>08:29, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</small></font></p>
<ul>
<li><b>No vote</b>. This is a title of a fictional book. I'm not familiar with Lovecraft's work any more, but the <i>de</i> in the title would be correct. It means "about", and <i>mysteriis</i> is ablative plural case of mysterium, making the title "On <i>(or about)</i> the mysteries of the worm". "Vermis mysteriis" might also make sense, but would be an unusual title for a book. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:53, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To clarify, the problem is the double "i" in "Vermiis" – that's why the title is incorrect. What probably happened was that the original editor clicked on a red link with a typo in the title. The request here is to <i>delete</i> this particular redirect.<br />
To further clarify: the spelling used in <a href="../../../c/t/h/Cthulhu_mythos.html" title="Cthulhu mythos">Cthulhu mythos</a> fiction is "De Vermis Mysteriis"; thus, "De Vermiis Mysteriis" constitutes an invalid redirect. "De Vermis Mysteriis" is the spelling that appears in the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bloch_eaf8.html" title="Robert Bloch">Robert Bloch</a> <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_story.html" title="Short story">short story</a> that introduces the book, "The Shambler from the Stars" (written in 1935).<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> as redirect - misspellings are often used for redirects, and this rule should apply doubly in the case of the Cthulhu mythos.

<li><b>Comment</b> the easy way to deal with these is just redirect to the right spelling/main article whatever - does no harm and is a lot easier than a VfD.

<dd>As far as I understood the nominator, he explicitly objected for the different spelling to be used at all (although you're obviously right in general), and this VfD prevents the redirect from workong, as quoted above.

<li>Well it's a classic of three-minute pop, but I can't think of much else to say (except that I'm humming it now) so <b>merge and redirect to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blondie_%28album%29.html" title="Blondie (album)">Blondie (album)</a></b>. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:12, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't see the value of keeping it, TBH - a full tracklisting and list of singles is available at the main <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blondie_%28album%29.html" title="Blondie (album)">Blondie (album)</a> article already. --<a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Shaped_Box_3207.html" title="User:Kurt Shaped Box">Kurt Shaped Box</a> 17:33, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>My rationale for redirect in this case is to enable someone to type in the song name and find the name of the group and the album. This is a catchy song, I'm surprised it never made a single (actually the whole album is a pop classic, just about everything could have been released as a single). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:45, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Before you dismiss my website as a vanity site, please understand its not always about me and there are many times, I am the brunt of the joke. Its not a site about how wonderful I am. We've had a cult following for 8 years and the site has published 444 consecutive weeks. I am not sitting here saying it is a hugely notable site, but it has been a consistent, conscientious effort to providing somewhat clean and decent entertainment to the web.

<p>A previous version of this article was nominated for deletion on 19 July. See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Religious_persecution_by_Jews_59c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Religious persecution by Jews">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Religious persecution by Jews</a>. Despite a majority of opinions to delete, the closing admin determined that it failed to meet the necessary standard of "rough concensus". The first VfD was closed as a "no concensus" decision. The decision to close the first debate was reversed by another administrator. The reversal was deemed to be out-of-process and was itself reverted. It was discussed several places including <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive38_5e59.html#User:Sjakkalle.2C_User:IZAK_and_the_VFD_debate_on_Religious_persecution_by_Jews" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive38">here</a>, <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle">here</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistorical_persecution_by_Jews_e91d.html" title="Talk:Historical persecution by Jews">here</a>. In the meantime, a Vote for Undeletion was formally opened. See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_Religious_persecution_by_Jews_6cbc.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion/Religious persecution by Jews">here</a>. Given the circumstances, the vote for undeletion was also considered by some to be out-of-process. Again, there was a majority opinion to delete (or redelete) the article but this time, the vote-count was even closer than in the VfD decision. I am returning this to VfD for a second discussion.</p>
<p>I note that the article has been moved to a different title and that it has been extensively edited since the first VfD began. I encourage everyone to carefully re-read the article and decide again based on the merits and weaknesses of the current version.</p>
<p>This is a procedural nomination. Do not interpret this nomination as a "delete" vote. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 12:32, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>No vote</b>. But by having "participated" in this debate, I will most definitely <i>not</i> be closing this debate.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've no strong feeling here -except <b>all three should be treated in the same way</b>. I'm not sure that generic 'persecution by' articles can be NPOV. They assume an historic contunuity between persecutors that is debatable - and that persection was done 'as Jews' or ' as Muslims'. The Islamic article has been moved to Religious conflict and Islam. That's not great either, but if it's allowed to stand then the same treatment should be given to the other articles. Indeed, I'm tempted to add both of them to this Vfd so that all are kept, deleted or renamed alike. Anyone second that? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 13:18, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Don't.</b> Then there'd be questions about the validity of the VfD, and the "rough consensus" would be <s>harder</s> impossible to determine. If each had its <i>own</i> VfD, that would be a good thing in the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:eventualism">long run</a>, but would generate more heat than light in the very short term. Also, it's usually seen as bad when a single editor nominates an entire group of article.

<li><b>Neutral</b> but if good reasons are given for delete, you may change my vote to delete, I'm going on vacation. Just because other topics have a "persecution by" doesn't mean all groups have to. Right now this article feels like a token attempt to keep things "fair". My sense though is the article doesn't need deletion yet but does require <b>serious cleanup</b>. The article is verging very close to origional research, I'm almost tempted to say it might be worth wiping out the article and starting from scratch. Opening your religious text of choice and finding what you want is origional research. I'd be much more comfortable with this article if it was using academic sources which are explicitly mentioned.

<li><b>keep</b>. I voted to delete last time because the article was called <i>Religious persecution by Jews</i> but contained no examples of religious persecution! The current article contains sufficient examples to justify its existence. The subject is of real historical interest. Also, to delete just this one of the three articles would fuel complaints of "bias". Anyone who looks at the three together can judge for themselves just how "persecutory" Jews have been in comparison to Christians and Muslims. It's better to give people all the facts than suppress material and fuel resentments. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 10:19, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep it</b>, For those that think its advertising - take a look at any link that is about a commercial enterprise. They could all be called advertising. Do you think that anything commercial should not be on the web. Commerce and business on the web have made it successful. The power of the web and of sites like Wikipedia are rooted around inclusion, not exclusion.<small><i>(Previous unsigned comment was by 66.32.71.124)</i></small></li>

<dd>You're missing the point of what an encyclopaedia is. If your site was a sandwich bar that was being considered for deletion from the local directory of sandwich bars, you'd be absolutely correct in what you say. However Wikipedia is not a local (or international) directory; it is an encyclopaedia. Are you likely to find an entry for your site in <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>? No, because that's not a directory either. Might you find an entry for <a href="../../../x/e/r/Xerox.html" title="Xerox">Xerox</a>? Very probably; it's <b>notable</b> in a way in which with the best will in the world you cannot say your site is.</dd>
<dd>Note that an unwillingness to include your article in WP does <i>not</i> imply any unwillingness to see it succeed - best wishes for the success of your enterprise. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 11:21, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>According to the Wikipedia introduction "help make Wikipedia the best source of information on the Internet", and the current content, I can understand the difficulty in defining <i>what it is</i>. Certainly some are willing to assert <i>what it isn't</i>. Looking at Wikipedia as just an encyclopedia would eliminate much of what makes it special and unique. Inclusion is what makes Wikipedia special.--A73 14:55, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Keep it! The site provides community links that benefit a wide cross-section of the population. It isn't advertising but rather it fits the meaning/intent of an encyclopedia. -Julio</p>

KEEP IT - Since when did wikipedia become such an elitist bunch of users? I think the website is a great portal for people to use.</p>

<li>Allmusic turns up a few bands named "Legacy", though I can't tell which, if any, this is supposed to be. There is almost no information on any of them. I'll go with <b>delete</b>, because the title is all wrong, and the content is basically crap too, making nothing really salvageable. It's also impossible to google, as far as I can tell, as "legacy" is way too common of a word mentioned when discussing any sort of band. If someone wants to write an article about this or another "Legacy" band at <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legacy_%28band%29.html" title="Legacy (band)">Legacy (band)</a>, they should go ahead, though they should give some indication if why it would meet the criteria at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:10, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move to Wiktionary</b>....and clean it up.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Let's be honest here: much of the objection is apparenty from WSU alumni and supporters who object to seeing the term publicized. This is not a legitimate reason for striking it from Wiki - you can't wish the term out of existence. Having said that, the entry is more appropriate for Wiktionary; references to "coug it" in Wikipedia should be limited to specific mentions in entries pertaining to Pacific Northwest culture, Pac-10 football, the Apple Cup, the Mike Price/Alabama episode, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Equally importantly (and I say this as a Husky who had Cougs in my wedding party) - it needs to be cleaned up and presented less subjectively; the current definition is clever, but its clear anti-Coug slant is a violation of Wiki's neutrality policy (You might say " Always be a good sport - be a good sport all ways").</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Cougs, on Wiki you can edit anything you wish. Some Husky went to a lot of work to create the entry's structure, saving you a lot of work. All you have to do is change it.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Do not delete, this is a producton studio, and the article details the history and workings of said studio. It does not endorse a clan, a forum, nor does it contain bias shedding a fair nor poor light on the studio. It only gives descriptions of members, movies, and projects that the studio puts forth. ---This wiki is about a studio just formed within the past two weeks, so therefore, predetermining that this is an unreasonable entry when the studio and its users (myself included) are relatively new in scheme and new to Wiki, is an unfair judgement. The two users defending its relevance are both users to Wiki who registered today to create an article about our studio. The forum has 14 users, but the users have grown in size recently. In just three days, the forum grew to its present size. Going into the future, a reference guide to the history of our studio would be helpful to new members. While it is sure that a giant number of users wont access this information, niether will many people reference what the national bird of Andorra is either. This article clearly does not endorse, advertise, or promote the studio, it is an article doing exactly what an encyclopedic article should, explains an organization with a NPOV and in an informative way. And the remark about a certain 'xCRAZ3SN1P3Rx' is irrelevant, that has no bearing on this article's delete status.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article definitely needs some cleanup but this is a valid NASDAQ-listed company and most of the information is factual, not "advertising". The listing of products is perhaps over done, but it is an editing job, not a reason to delete. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 22:45, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, this is pure advertisement. It may be a real company with many facts in the article, but we delete adverts here. Nuking the article so that someone can start over is a totally acceptable option. The removal of the cleanup tag points even further toward a delete. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 00:45, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The nasdq listing kind of says it all. The article needs a good rewrite/cleanup. Cleanup tag is back in.

<p><b>SAVE</b> I order blagadoush every week at Ali Baba's on Macdougal Street in NYC. This is definitely a word. If you don't believe it you can go to the restaurant to see for yourself. As for Michael Smiley, I cannot say whether or not he has anything to do with the discovery of the word. I do know that the description of the food is on point though. <b>*****SAVE!!!****</b></p>
<p>I don't know who the Smiley fella is, but I'll also atteest to the veracity of the word. My best friend is Ethiopian and personally told the owner of Ali Baba's on Macdougal to list "Blagadoush" next to the Babaganoush entry on the Main Menu at the restaurant. I don't know why so many people are incensed by this though, it's not really a big deal, but most NYU students invoke the new term now too....Thanks.</p>

<li><b>Reply</b>: The thing is, we're not here to "discover" anything. That would be orginal research. See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, our policy on that topic. To be included in Wikipedia, a subject must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. If the word comes into common usage, a google search should show results. And yes, just as that silly European "discovered" a place that other people had live in for millenia, Wikipedia only includes topics that are already known. An encyclopedia <b>collects</b> knowledge, it doesn't <b>produce</b> knowledge.

<li><b>Delete,</b> as above. I personally think likely hoax. www.anywho.com does not know of anyone named Sigmund Hardy in either California or Arizona. I do get exactly <b>one</b> Google hit on "Sigmund Hardy" but the circumstances are <i>very</i> odd. My preferences are set to search any language." I get a hit at a Dutch-language literature site, <a href="http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/lic/autor.asp?paras=/lg;1/aut_id;3443/" class="external free" title="http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/lic/autor.asp?paras=/lg;1/aut_id;3443/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/lic/autor.asp?paras=/lg;1/aut_id;3443/</a>. "Sigmund Hardy" does not show up visibly on the page, but it is hidden in the source text where it forms part of a popup menu. It is a list of separate items, but Google picks it up as "Thomas Carpenter, Edward Forster, EM Freud, Sigmund Hardy, Thomas Joyce". Get it? Forster, EM; Freud, Sigmund; Hardy, Thomas... I can't quite imagine anyone running across this by accident and using it as inspiration for a hoax, though. Anyway "Sigmund Hardy" will be a good Googlewhacking search item, at least until Google indexes the VfD article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:53, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

This is interesting. What's your definition of independent research? This is based on well established work, which thousands of people around the world are engaged in, and it most of it is written in a style typical of the field. There has been a request for an article on this subject (see the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocacy.html" title="Advocacy">advocacy</a> discussion page), and I am employed as an expert. The last two sections are slightly speculative, but I have informed the independent advocacy community about my post and it would be good if the experts could make these sorts of decisions and tidy the article up.</p>

<li><i>Comment</i>: The valid criticism would be of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> not "Independent Research". I think that "Independent advocacy" is a Scottish term and not the term used to describe the same thing in other English speaking parts of the world. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 23:20, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have published original research under this definition in an advocacy magazine published in London as well as other places. This article is not original research. Most of it is copied directly from published information that has been produced out of a consensus of the eight advocacy projects I support. These include branches of national organisations including Mencap, Barnardo's and Age Concern. I am also a committee member of the (English) National Advocacy Network and I know this article fits closely with common practice across England and Wales as well as Scotland. They also have this sort of advocacy in Scotland, where it became a statutory requirement for each local authority to commission independent advocacy schemes in 2001 - hence the references published by the Scottish Executive in the same year. This is despite the potential confusion with, and in addition to, the Scottish solicitor-advocates you find in every town. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisctrix_c229.html" title="User:Visctrix">Visctrix</a> 23:51, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nothing to do with OR. Copyright violation (copyvio) depends upon the criteria under which the informaton was published. If your organisation claims copyright (and this is independent even of whether <i>you</i> put the information there in the first place - even if you did so personally you did so under the copyright of that organisation) and you have copied that information elsewhere you are in breach of that copyright, unless the copyright holder has specifically authorised such release . I would advise you to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> and be aware that anything on Wikipedia is licensed under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>, so effectively if you put anything on WP you are stating that the copyright holder is willing to license the material freely. For what it's worth I'd vote 'keep' for your article, though with some NPOV cleanup, but if it's violating someone's copyright it has to go. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b6/Pentacle.svg/15px-Pentacle.svg.png" alt="" width="15" height="15" longdesc="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" /></a>&#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 00:58, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On re-reading, he also states "I have published...in an advocacy magazine".

<dd>All of which is why I said If he is "copying from your own publication <b><i>with authority</i> to release this</b>..." then it was ok, as to a magazine it denpends what their deal is, but most only buy "1st serial" rights from authors, the author retains the copyright and the right to publishe elsewhere, possibly after a stated delay.

<dd>VfD issues aside, copyright is a bit more complicated than that. The original owner of the text must release it to the open license, and you realize that it will not stay intact, right? The text will be edited by others, extensively. This does not change the fact that this article appears to be non-encyclopedic and would require an extreme rewrite. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">Chairboy</a> 22:04, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Since there appears to be little clarity about the copyright status of this, and per Chairboy (and come to that, myself) this needs POV editing that doesn't seem to be forthcoming from the author, I vote <b>Delete</b>. Visctrix, it might be good if you could sort out:
<ul>
<li>The potential copyright issues (and "we're putting it on here so a lot of people will see it and it can be redistributed" is <i>not</i> enough, as Chairboy says)</li>
<li>The POV aspects of the article - that's "Point Of View" - articles on here should be NPOV; "<i>Neutral</i> Point of View", not, to coin a phrase, <i>advocating</i> a POV. Your statement that "I support independent advocacy" above says that your article is placed in a spirit of advocating a POV (once again, pun unintended). Wikipedia specifically <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine" title="WP:ISNOT">prohibits</a> such advocacy. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b6/Pentacle.svg/15px-Pentacle.svg.png" alt="" width="15" height="15" longdesc="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" /></a>&#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 21:56, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm doing my best, and I've just deleted the final section before the references which I admit was somewhat speculative. I have asked members of the advocacy community to contribute to this debate and to the article, but clearly this hasn't happened yet.
<ul>
<li>I'm a bit confused as to what you think is POV in the article. There was one place in the deleted section that said 'in my experience' but that is all I can see. I'm left wondering if you think that the initial sections, which are carefully written to be understandable by people with little literacy and are therefore in the second person, count as POV. Can you give me any more specific pointers?</li>
<li>I've read <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> and I can't see anything on that page, nor am I aware of any other reason, why any of the text of the article may constitute a copyright infringement.</li>
<li>This subject is very topical in the UK. Two major pieces of legislation have just been passed that will extend the importance of advocates (see Talk:Independent advocacy) and I have provided links to three national advocacy organisations and networks as well as to publications of the Scottish Executive. I can provide more links later on in the week. Historically there have been advocacy organisations working in the UK for 20 years, and in the US and Germany even further back. The UK Government seems to have problems with the lack of clarity surrounding advocacy work in a similar way to the people calling for this page to be deleted - but the thousands of people who benefit each year from working with advocates have no such qualms. I am very surprised and disappointed, as a new contributor to Wikipedia, that my work, in good faith, on a subject of such significance, could simply be deleted after 5 days. I'm certainly happy to continue working on this article, and others, but I need more time for this, and I think there are issues that need more debate. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisctrix_c229.html" title="User:Visctrix">Visctrix</a> 23:21, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Is the article not notable, or are you saying that Saniel Bonder is not notable&#160;? If the article seems a little light, it is. It's a stub. That's what stubs are. They need further information, etc. But clipping them because they are small is IMHO not the way to go. I have taken note of Bonder a while back, and think it's great that someone commenced an article on him. I hope that the existence of the stub will invite more people who know about him to contribute. I invite you to take note of him so your point of view becomes that he is notable.</dd>

<li>Comment - noticing the policy on merging and deleting... the external hard drive part wasn't a merge in any way, I wrote that before I'd ever heard of this 2.5' article. That was just a coincidence. The article did prompt me to add the part about differnt sizes of hard drives to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_disk.html" title="Hard disk">hard disk</a>, but I already had that knowledge, so I don't think that quite counts as merging. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAqua008_7061.html" title="User:Aqua008">Aqua</a> 00:23, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
