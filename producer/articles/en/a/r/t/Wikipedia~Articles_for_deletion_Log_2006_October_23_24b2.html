<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Goatse.cx is well-known throughout the Internet as a prank site, and I couldn't imagine an encyclopedia aspiring to be "complete" not having an entry on this. In addition, the article already exists, and with quite a bit of detail. I certainly don't object to the so-called "link farms" being removed, but surley that doesn't justify deletion of the entire article? —<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELantoka_28a7.html" title="User:Lantoka">Lantoka</a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELantoka_f8aa.html" title="User talk:Lantoka">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lantoka_9349.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lantoka">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 01:15, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: It's a well known site.

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry, but <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is rather an important concept.

<li><b>Comment</b> What is all this talk of unreliable sources? So what if the sources suck... that doesn't make it any less significant. It is unarguable that Goatse.cx is a huge Internet phenomenon, so why all of these attacks on the so-called "sources"? Yes they are absolute crap and just point at like 20 million different goatse sites, but for god's sake, please stop basing your reasons for deleting the article on "unverifiable sources". Is it that surprising that Time Magazine hasn't written an article about some guy holding his asshole open? If you want evidence that this is an important Internet phenomenon do two things: 1) look at <i>the majority</i> of people that voted keep on this page, despite the article being about disgusting material and at first glance appearing "unencyclopedic", and 2) do a google search for goatse and take note of the <i>1.7 million hits</i> that it generates.

<li>I see your point, but I still think deleting the entire article may not be the best thing to do here. Forgive me for my naive newbie question: the popularity of the phenomenon should be easy to establish through primary sources - wouldn't it be possible to build an article around this? Of course I absolutely agree that pure speculations about persons etc are highly inappropriate, and need to be removed, but I somehow thought the popularity of the phenomenon itself is verifiable without a lot of academic or established print media secondary sources? I also thought some verifiable trivia may be worth mentioning, such as that goatse.cx was one of the earlier <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain_hack.html" title="Domain hack">domain hacks</a>? <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReidarM_33a8.html" title="User:ReidarM">ReidarM</a> 04:08, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem with primary sources is that several uses of them can violate <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia policy regarding original research</a>. Generally, primary sources should only be used if <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> have introduced a concept, but the primary source is necessary for proper clarification and/or illustration, or something to that degree. To be specific for this article - look at the entire section about parodies, tributes, and trivia. Not only are trivia sections generally discouraged, but there is not a single reliable source that introduced the idea of parodies or tributes, so that all of these are left without real reference and violate the original research policy. Now look at the Geographic Location section. While the place to which a ".cx" would be easy to verify with a reliable source, the rest of this section appears to be original research. While it may even be possible to have decent sourcing of the date when the site went offline (for section The Site Goes Offline), the reporting on the rest of the content appears to use either primary sources or message board postings - the former aren't recommended, the later aren't reliable. Origin section - completely original research. Etymology - speculation in its entirety. This sort of thing is usually removed straightaway from articles about, say, radio and TV call letters when editors offer etymological possibilities. While I can't argue that the proposed etymology makes sense, there is no sources to document the claim, which goes again WP policy. The lead appears to be relatively harmless, as a brief description of the content is a permissible illustration in my opinion, although it is still a borderline inclusion without proper sourcing. Still, as it is a description of the content rather than any sort of synthesis of it, it may be acceptable. The thing is, if you were to pull most of the information that truly can't be sourced reliably, you're left with just a little bit of information that could easily be housed in the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">shock site</a> article, with this redirecting there.

<li>I too am concerned about the lack of secondary sources, but I don't think that should stop us from having an article on this (in)famous domain. At some point, some sociology major will write a doctoral dissertation on Internet <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_sites.html" title="Shock sites">shock sites</a> and get it published in a journal. In the meantime, we can do our best based on the popular knowledge of the site and the primary sources we do have. Between me and Konstable, considerable changes have already been made to the article, improving it infintesimally from the version we had before.

<li>Generally, if something is lacking sources, that's a cleanup problem. If something can't be sourced, that justifies the removal of the content. It troubles me that we should keep unsourceable information or "popular knowledge" and assume that it will eventually be reliably sourced because a source will eventually exist. That, to me, is no better than "this band will eventually be notable" or "this person will eventually do something" or "my pet goldfish will eventually star in its own television series." If a source doesn't exist for the information, then it really should be purged from the article. GassyGuy 05:37, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The examples you cite all involve speculation about insignificant things becoming significant. I contend again that this article is significant (pretty unarguably, and Google works as a great source for that)... Our problem, however, is an almost complete lack of secondary sources. I would speculate that this is due to 1) the site's content, 2) its lack of publicity in academia (it's popular on the Internet), and 3) it's very "newness". You don't see history books that could properly be called "secondary sources" and referenced in an encyclopedia published about our decade until many many years after it. So again, I argue that the sources are a problem, but that we can make do in the meantime. —<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELantoka_28a7.html" title="User:Lantoka">Lantoka</a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELantoka_f8aa.html" title="User talk:Lantoka">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lantoka_9349.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lantoka">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 05:49, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It would help if this paper actually did cite it. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It's included in the raw data, which, in this case, consists of logged IRC chats, in Appendix B. There's no mention of goatse in the actual paper, nor does the chat even discuss what the site is, just has the word appear twice. GassyGuy 08:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

The "goatse" (short for "goatsex") is an image circulated on the internet that is a favorite of the Pen community. It shows a highly pixilated image of a man holding his anus open, magnified to revolting proportions. Many threats like this surface when someone posts off topic, or tries to change the subject of talk within a thread. The image of "goatse" is used both as a "topic nazi" threat and as a form of thread derailment, both context dependent.</i> <a href="http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04072005-145922/unrestricted/thesis.pdf" class="external free" title="http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04072005-145922/unrestricted/thesis.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04072005-145922/unrestricted/thesis.pdf</a> [Note - I never seem to get the wiki markup right, forgive me for my lack of skills.

<li><b>Reply</b> These two certainly seem like better sources. I <i>think</i> they count as reliable under policy, though I'm not actually well-versed enough with theses to give a definitive. Can someone who knows for certain chime in? Anyway, they do look like good sources. Personally, I'd accept them. The problem remains, however, is that here is what these sources confirm: 1) Goatse exists. 2) This one can be used to source some of the ways in which goatse is used, and even now there is a reference for etymology (e.g., "According to blah blah blah, "goatse" is used as a short form of "goat sex" blah blah blah). Nice research. What these two sources do not do, however, is verify the majority of the rest of the content, including the discussion of the origins, the tributes and parodies, and the rest. I'm not changing my vote only because the verifiable content produced by these papers is still the same content housed at the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">shock site</a> article, but I do think these two papers are certainly better than the current sourcing and should be used in both articles.

<p>1) If the term genocide applies on the Greek war of liberation, then it MUST be applied on any other war of liberation where the oppressors are eliminated; 2) AND it MUST be applied on all the acts of agression, murder, destruction, deportation, occupation and enslavement committed against the Greek - Byzantine - Romioi - Christian people since AD 634 by the Ottoman Turks, the consequence of which acts can be seen by comparing the map of the East before AD 634 and now. The alleged genocide against the Turko-Albanians committed during the Greek war of independence doesn't compare to this long and brutal genocide of the Greeks and those of a Greek origin, as well as of the Christian Orthodox, which is still carried on until now, 2006, when Greek churches were attacked in Palestine. The Turks have committed hundreds of genocides against the Greek people (not only in Greece) from AD 634 till now with facts about acts of conquest, massacres, deportation, enslavement etc.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> this page. Its history is flavored with nationalistic undertones, turning upside down what social scientists have beem trying hard to do, namely, give genocides their appropriate "light" in history. A revolution and war of independence is defined as a genocide, in which case alll wars and revolutions and rebellions involving the killing of the oppressor defacto become genocides. This compromises the heuristic tool or use of the term genocide. What then is the difference between Holocaust and Armenian genocide on the one hand and wars of independence by people fighting against an external oppressor and conqueror? Thank you.

In fact, this is what more or less i say in Greek above, with also an invite to him to say something in Greek (with the note that it is really easy for a native Greek to understand if the other is a native Greek-speaker...).

<dd>Read the comments here. The language u use is by far not academic, unencyclopedic, full of hate. Your spelling mistakes indicate (as mentioned above by a fellow wikipedian) that u scanned a paper. the sources u have added are like footnotes that do not work. all these are suspicious enough concerning the reasons and the validity of the sources (if they indeed say what u claim they do). Lastly, keep Greeks and Islam aside... It was not a religious war, nor a crusade! it was a war for independence against the conquerors. and, btw, have in mind that the Greeks ("nationalists" as u say) have excellent relations with the islamic states. better than any western country, and by far better than Turkey itself.

<p>Hectorian. Do you mean, that you greeks are so innocent angels? Then please tell me the fate of turks of Mora and Crete. What happened to those people? Where are their graves? If you know it so much then Why dont you write an article about "Turks of Greece after 1821"</p>
<p>You, all greeks in Wikipedia, are so organised and protective. You all seem to be in a panic in a simple logic. If turks kill someone its "genocide", but if there are killed "normalities of a war". Blaming turks in front of the world and maybe gaining some benefits from it. Like you are doing since 180 years. Cry like a baby and maybe super powers give you a candy. Our lovely ridicilous former slaves&#160;:-))</p>
<p>Your claims about:"...war for independence against the conquerors" is funny. Greece lost the war in 1825. But England and Russia wrote the fate of war in Navorino. Greeks can never win a war. In its history greece always had a master power controlling it. You were our colony for 400 years then we sold you to Russia. Then England took you. Then USA and today EU.

<p>Am I detecting an inferiority complex on the part of our Turkish friend? If so, then it is wholly justifiable in my opinion, I mean the main difference between Greece and Turkey is that standards of living in Greece are significantly higher than those in Turkey (although we must give the Turks some credit - after all, I do hear they do have one of the highest standards of living in the Third World). Perhaps the military dictatorship in place there won't let the economy blossom.</p>
<p>On the other point you raised, I think you should know Greeks really don't hate Muslims, <i>au contraire</i>, they get on together perfectly, and see what happens to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch_Irenaios_87cc.html" title="Patriarch Irenaios">Greeks who don't follow that line</a>. Maybe this is why, unlike Turkey, Greece has yet to experience Islamic terrorism.</p>
<p>As for Russia, it's a known fact that Greece is Russia's mouthpiece in the EU, all former communist states in the EU despise Russia now, Greece is their only traditional and actual ally in Europe. This is obviously due to them saving us from <i><a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">dhimmitude</a></i> (Britain and especially France were more skeptical).</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to know the fate of the Muslims (a term which includes and is not equal to Turks) of Morea and Crete, they were repatriated to Turkey as part of the population exchanges directed under the Treaty of Lausanne. If you really want to compare the situations, see what George Horton in his book <i>the Blight of Asia</i> has to say:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"[o]ne of the cleverest statements circulated by the Turkish propagandists is to the effect that the massacred Christians were as bad as their executioners, that it was “50-50.”" On this issue he clarifies that "[h]ad the Greeks, after the massacres in the Pon­tus and at Smyrna, massacred all the Turks in Greece, the record would have been 50-50—almost." As an eye-witness, he also praises Greeks for their "conduct [...] toward the thousands of Turks residing in Greece, while the ferocious massacres were going on...", which according to his opinion was "one of the most inspiring and beautiful chapters in all that country’s history."</i></dd>

One (yes, only one) of the Turkish keep votes seems to be from an experienced user. The closing admin may actually ignore the "votes" of Turks and Greeks (many single purpose accounts on both sides) but also of Armenians and perhaps even of a "Russian" Belgian like me.

<li>Begging pardon, but as someone who's actually studying philosophy of science academically right now, the term "scientific attitude" is so vague as to be hopeless. Much better minds than we have tried to define what makes up science, and there is no agreement yet on even whether it <i>is</i> an attitude (as opposed to a societal value system, logical system, or something else), let alone what such an "attitude" might be. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 15:43, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That would explain why there are so many opinions about the subject (as per google, amazon, pubmed above) . Quite worthy of an NPOV article explaining the different views!&#160;:-) Thank you for pointing out that this is a notable subject in the philosophy of science. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 19:45, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I'm saying the opposite if you'd listen. I'm technically pointing out that the title itself (and hence, the subject) is <i>question-begging</i> as far as academia is concerned. There is so little consensus out there that there isn't even agreement on what is being discussed, let alone the details of it. Every philosopher of science has their own take on how science is done and why, and has their own set of things that they focus on. While concepts like <a href="../../../v/a/l/Value_theory.html" title="Value theory">Value theory</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationality.html" title="Rationality">Rationality</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradigm_shift.html" title="Paradigm shift">Paradigm shift</a> have gotten a lot of attention, there are few treatments on "scientific attitude" out there. In my own search of the literature I get 26 hits, of which (judging by the titles and abstracts) all but one merely use the term without elaboration. (I'm not sure what a search of a <i>biomedical</i> journal repository such as PubMed is meant to demonstrate about a socio-psycho-philosophical concept.) Most of them use the term in mutually-incompatible senses. Undoubtably something could be written, but this is an areas of inquiry that has yet to stabilise in the real world and I do doubt that we humble Wikipedia editors could document something that the real world hasn't even begun to settle on without resorting to original research. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 23:29, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Philosphers of science can debate forever, in the mean time, there's science to be done on the ground. People are showing *some* attitude or other. Are you sure there's no material on that topic? Google and amazon (and <b>even</b> a <i>biomedical</i> search) show hits.</dd>
<dd>I just did searches in some locations I use regularly. Each gave quite a number of hits. I think scientific attitude has probably been discussed to death for centuries. I'd be quite surprised if there was no literature on the subject. Once again, if people are discussing the topic, and the subject is unstable, you can report which main ideas have formed over time.</dd>

<dd>I'm with you until you say "you yourself...". Yes, there may be material. I doubt it, and for the reasons I state. People are free to go do that research and create a new article at this title. Where you lose me and my patience is when you attribute words to me I haven't written. I have specifically said that, to my knowledge, there is <i>not</i> literature on the subject. What I <i>have</i> said is that there is literature about something that <i>some people</i> could label "scientific attitude" if they were to engage in original research, but that such a term is not in currency that I am aware of. I said that there is debate about <i>science</i> in general and what it means to do it, so much so that there is no agreement (not "disagreement") on the terms used. Simply put, to my knowledge what constitutes the "scientific attitude" is not under debate because the debaters on the topic of <i>science</i> are busy with other things and haven't begun considering the colloquial term in any academic way. Again, I may be wrong, but using a mistake about what I'm actually saying (or at least trying to say) in your persuasion is not going to convince me of that. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 01:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough on misunderstanding, my apologies. But if what you say is true, how does one account for so many hits, sometimes for the literal phrase? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 20:21, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are two ways to account for it: (1) the term has a lot of common currency but isn't treated on as a topic of discussion (i.e., it's just a common term and not a solidified concept), or (2) that I'm wrong, and there is treatment of the topic in a focused way with common premises. I believe (1) is the case, but I recognise that the reality may be between the two. (That being wrong isn't a fatally-bad thing is one of the joys of consensus decisions.) — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 21:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I created the article, so my vote may come as a surprise here- just a warning, the explanation here is about to get long-winded. I created the article, which is indeed a local joke, and had figured that by notifying a number of friends we together, with our collective memory of 2005 could retrace more or less the history behind Herman cares and explain what particularly about it appealed to the community's sense of humor. (Just a random sign saying "Herman Cares" doesn't make much of a joke, so some explanation is needed.) However, someone or other vandalized the page and turned it into.... I don't even know what to call it, and now is reverting it back whenever I (or any one else) tries to fix it. So, I propose we kill the article for now, wait a while, and then repost- with luck, we can then productively build the article up and fix it.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the verification thing, that is an issue, and the Poolesville web page really doesn't make sense as a source- so, until we dig up some references that are actually worthwhile, I'd say that year it really ought to go in the dustbin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry all- had no idea the trouble this'd become, I figured it'd manage to build up gradually into a decent article if I laid down the basic spine of it and let other locals familiar with the joke know, I didn't expect we'd spend all our time fixing vandalism. That said, I do take exception to the "made up in school one day" comment- as this isn't something made up in the sense of just a new "hey that'd be fun to post on Wikikpedia" but rather a running, well established joke that's become a part of Poolesville culture. The other troubles I had anticipated would be fixed very rapidly with a number of people working on it, but as I said, we all got sidetracked by the vandalismNullius in Verba 01:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Nullius, the wikipedia is not a repository for inside jokes, period. There are literally millions of running jokes out there; any decent sized city will have thousands that are shared by various cliques.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I have checked <a href="http://www.angeltowns.com/town/peerage/index.html?http://www.angeltowns.com/town/peerage/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.angeltowns.com/town/peerage/index.html?http://www.angeltowns.com/town/peerage/index.html" rel="nofollow">Leigh Rayment's lists of peers and MPs</a>, and can find no trace of anyone called Ken/Kenneth Knight/Night who was an MP or peer in that period. Since ministers need to be a member of either the Commons or the Lords, that pretty much rules out any possiblity that a "Ken Night" was a minister, <i>unless</i> this omission is one Rayment's occasional omissions, which I think unlikely. The most likely explanation, to my mind, is that someone called Ken/Kenneth Knight/Night may have had some role at some point as civil servant or special advisor or head of some commission in wartime, and that the ministerial tag is a misunderstanding … but that is not what is being claimed here, and no sources have been offered to support any such explanation. -<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 13:34, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I hope that the newest reference I just added satisfies your request for a reference that gives this company verifiability (including a more explicit declaration of notability as the 2004 Market Leadership Award winner from Frost &amp; Sullivan). It's from a 3rd-party news source on tech companies. The two references should satisfy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> making the grounds of this AfD somewhat moot. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 16:23, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maybe it wasn't clear because I added my response inline instead of at the end of the AfD section: I have added 2 sources (1 from an online tech news source denoting the company's notability as a market leader for its field, 1 from a city newspaper article denoting the company's latest software package being used in academic settings). I did not create this article, but saw the AfD and felt that this company was notable enough to stand as verifiably notable and the article could be reliably sourced (as it is at this time). <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 18:19, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>How about Astute Technology?

<ul>
<li>I have addressed the AfD nomination of Astute Tech on its own AfD page. The difference as it relates to Anystream is that Anystream has reliable sources (that have been added since your nomination) for its technolgy and company's notability and Astute Tech does not (that I can find). Each article should keep or delete on its own merits (given no proof or evidence that they are a series of articles or anything like that). <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:10, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b> I don't see a reason, really. The article is severely biased towards the West, because the West because every album on the list is a rock album, and rock was created, developed, and pioneered in the west. I do agree that the article uses quite a few weasel words yeah, and maybe the genre-creating albums section should be cut, but I think once a good number of accolades are provided, and artists who site the albums as influences and all that, it should be kept. Instead of searching all over to find where to start with a decent music collection, readers can just quickly access this list, look at different genres and start to build their collection from there. It's very helpful. ClashingZeppelin 20:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Not only is it severely biased towaords the west, the number of citations to Rolling Stone indicate that it is biased towards a particular conservative - one might say reactionary - view of western popular music. The suggestion that somebody would use a list in an encyclopaedia to start a music collection is somewhat risible, too. It implies that he or she would know nothing about music and had no opportunity of hearing any - in which case why would they want to start collecting it? <a href="../../../b/t/l/User%7EBTLizard_ebd6.html" title="User:BTLizard">BTLizard</a> 09:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> as per JoeSmack. Article does not even try to assert notability. "it's a street, with lots of traffic" (I paraphrase, but that's the substance of it) does not amount to an assertion of notability. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 01:30, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, it's part of a major through-route between Melbourne's eastern and western suburbs, as the article makes clear.

<li><b>Keep, but Rename</b> I looked into it; the argument that the thing isn't an EP has merit; amazon.com calls it the American Idiot single, but the track name and the rest of the info is correct.

<dd>What proper chronology? There is no EP with that title, only a single. No one claims that singles don't deseerve their own articles, and certainly for very well known bands like Green Day.

<li>I wasn't trying to imply you were basing it on such bias, consciously or otherwise. The point was really couple with the other regarding lack of English language sources, there are many people in this world who should meet our standards for inclusion who don't have a single word in English written about them elsewhere, so although it would be nice to have English language sources it is by no means necessary and deleting merely on the basis of a lack of those sources could be a part of systematic bias.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article is constantly being edited by her (at least it's the same kind of broken English that I see on her website) and she's created stubs of people for the sole purpose of linking back on herself - see Krisztina Stefanik, Miklós Győri and <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Balazs_536b.html" title="Anna Balazs">Anna Balazs</a>. I've tried to improve on some of the stubs, but now she's deleted their content entirely. Also, the article on her is getting more and more inaccurate - eg. "Autizmus - egy másik világ" was not published by the University of Pécs, it was published by Kódex Nyomda Kft. in a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html" title="Vanity press">vanity press</a> anthology, "Új Galaxis". To my knowledge, she has written no "novels", only an autobiography and a few short stories. I'd still say "Keep" if not for her actions that border on vandalism, and for the lack of hope that the article will be improved upon in the foreseeable future (mostly because of the autobiography which did attract an amount of media attention). <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrezzey_1ac7.html" title="User:Prezzey">prezzey</a> 07:29, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete or transwiki</b> I looked at the sources and the content and I have to agree with Prezzey – she's using this article and creating others to amuse or occupy herself. There are lots of people who are subjects of documentaries about autism, weight, medical conditions, and the like who aren't notable and shouldn't have articles. I think this is one of those non-notable people. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrakatoaKatie_d1a7.html" title="User:KrakatoaKatie"><font color="salmon"><b>Krakatoa</b></font></a><a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrakatoaKatie_7f28.html" title="User talk:KrakatoaKatie"><font color="teal">Katie</font></a> 09:11, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment:</b> In regards to the amazon.com Sales Rank, as of this writing, the rank indicates #88,470 in books and 52% of the people who look at the page purchase the book. The sales rank has certainly not been in the 1,000's, but can be considered notable for a first novel. However, please clarify the amazon.com sales rank standard for Wiki.</dd>
<dd><b>comment:</b> In regards to the Google search, as of this writing, a search for "bowie ibarra" has 598 unique hits, all of which, as noted before, do not relate to his book. But what is the Wiki standard for Google hits to be considered relevant.</dd>
<dd><b>comment:</b> 'Popularity' - the novel has gained a popular following among zombie fans around the world, with the first review of the original vanity printing coming from England (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> There are no set-in-stone standards for SalesRank or number of Google hits, each Wikipedian will probably have his own opinion on how low is "too low" to really call a work notable. 88,470 (or 101,000) is probably well below anyone's threshold though. Should all the 88,469 books with a higher SalesRank be listed as well? As for Google hits, they just serve to give a broader picture of how much buzz this guy and his books are getting, how much they're being discussed and reviewed, etc. The generally-agreed-upon guidelines for notability in books can be found at <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOK_b369.html" title="WP:BOOK">WP:BOOK</a>. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 20:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment:</b> The article has attempted to take a neutral tone, providing only facts without embellishments.</dd>
<dd><b>comment:</b> If Google searches and Amazon.com sales ranks are a standard Wiki uses in determining notability, then the reviews of Brian Keene and David Moody need to be reconsidered. Author Brian Keene has a sales rank (as of this writing) for 'The Rising' at 10,164, a four star rank for his book (published two years ago) with 145 user reviews, as well as being awarded the "Bram Stoker Award" for this story. His sequel 'City of the Dead' is currently at 15,336 with a 3 and a half star rating. His Google search results in 123,000 hits. Brian Keene also has his own Wiki page. The information provided in his bibliography is comparable in tone to the article being discussed.</dd>
<dd><b>comment:</b> David Moody, who also independently reviewed the book "Down the Road" has an amazon.com sales rank as of this writing for his zombie novel "Autumn" of #36,471 for his novel published last year. A google search of "david moody" provides 119,000 hits, with not all of which relate to the author. user elaire26</dd>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Being unique isn't a criterion for inclusion. I'm unique -- there's only one of me in the whole wide world -- but I haven't done anything worth writing about, and no notable third-party publication has published an article or review about me. The same can be said for Retarded Animal Babies. In the absenece of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information that establishes notability, this article should not be included.

<p>Keep! Why delete it? It describes the antics and goings-on of a group of animals. It's an animation- so it's not for kids. The article on wikipedia isn't rated R, just because the toon might be. Wikipedia is a source of information, and that's exactly what this is doing- informing everyone who cares to listen about RAB and it's contents- that doesn't mean they're going to go off and show it to a bunch of kids.</p>

<p>4400 has an individual article for each episode. The articles each contain a single quote from the episode, and a brief summary. The articles contain nothing else but an episode summary.</p>
<p>At worst, the articles are just repeating the 2-line summary from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_4400_episodes_0947.html" title="List of The 4400 episodes">List_of_The_4400_episodes</a> (for example, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Home_Front_%28The_4400_episode%29_ef5e.html" title="The Home Front (The 4400 episode)">The Home Front (The 4400 episode)</a>. All articles for season 3 are like this). At best, the articles contain a scene-by-scene synopsis (which is something that's supposed to be <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">avoided</a>).</p>
<p>They contain nothing about the episode's relevance in the ongoing story arc, nothing about how the episode was received, its impact on popular culture, or any other commentery or real world context. All the broadcasting information can be added to the table at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_4400_episodes_0947.html" title="List of The 4400 episodes">List_of_The_4400_episodes</a>. The summaries there can be expanded a little, or an article could be created for individual seasons when there's actually something to say about them.</p>
<p>We certainly don't need an individual article for each episode if the article is just summarizing what's happening (and there's really nothing else to say about them). <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a> does say to create episode articles "<i>Once there's enough independently verifiable information included about individual episodes...</i>" which really isn't the case here.</p>

<dd>Unverifiable = criterium for deletion. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> = criterium for deletion. When you remove the plot summary, there is nothing left. IF no one can give me even an indication of what sources can be used to add some kind of external, verifiable information about a specific episode, then this means that there is nothing to fill an article with at the moment. Stating that "each will have enough information" as a reason to keep it is baseless crystal ballism, similar to "my band will one day be famous". Not one of the keep voters have given reasons within the policies as to why the articles as they stand should be kept, and not one has given a shred of evidence that they can be remade according to Wikipedia policy. While "uncomplete" is of course not a reason for deletion, it still is a huge non sequitur from my comment. Please indicate how and where you'll find more out-of-universe info for these articles per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, instead of just stating that they have "good quality content" (which ones?). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 11:45, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, without going back and watching the episode and tracking down additional verifiable information, I have little doubt that it could have a references to other stories section and a trivia section, similar to several of the Doctor Who episodes (e.g., <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Girl_in_the_Fireplace_e30d.html" title="The Girl in the Fireplace">The Girl in the Fireplace</a>). For example -- and I'm making this up, but bear with me -- "This episode marks the first appearance of a 4400 outside of NTAC's direct supervision," or "The pain Lily suffers on her eldest daughter's doorstep foreshadows the attack on her daughter in <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_Fate_Would_Have_It_%28The_4400_episode%29_fa65.html" title="As Fate Would Have It (The 4400 episode)">As Fate Would Have It</a>" or "This is the first episode in which Mickey Mouse appears in the opening credits."</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which you've quoted yourself, states, "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot." I concur. The solution, however, is not to delete the skeleton onto which this analysis and detail will hang, but rather to flesh out the skeleton and give it life.</dd>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Could you clarify? <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravisl_9999.html" title="User:Travisl">Travisl</a> 01:14, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What I mean with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is the examples you give (and I know you made them up, but you'll get the idea): "The pain Lily suffers on her eldest daughter's doorstep foreshadows the attack on her daughter in <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_Fate_Would_Have_It_%28The_4400_episode%29_fa65.html" title="As Fate Would Have It (The 4400 episode)">As Fate Would Have It</a>": is that an idea you have, fans have on a forum, or is it an idea, an interpretation given in some reliable source (a newspaper, a documentary, ...) as defined in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>? I fear that most of this kind of info would come from not-reliable sources (not meaning that it wouldn't be true!), and thus should not be included in Wikipedia. In the end, if all you have is such info, then you don't have an article, and it should be deleted until such scholarly info is available. Since it seems that not much of such info is available, the best idea seems to me to get an article per season, and delete the individual articles. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 05:28, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What is verifiable in an episode is an interesting subject. As a normal viewer, I am aware of various things the director can do to advance the plot non-verbally. They'll linger on someones eyes, while they have an angry look, to show that person's displeasure over something that was just said, for instance. I think a case could be made that these things are obvious to a normal viewer and therefore verifiable by watching the episode. I can also hear objections to a "normal viewer's" existence. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 05:43, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, that is original research (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Even if "everybody knows" something, if it isn't written down (or said out loud) in a reliable source (as defined in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, so no primary source), then it isn't acceptable. Again, it is not about truth, but about verifiability. Now, a plot summary is verifiable (look at listings in TV magazines and so on), but an article which is only or even mainly a plot summary is not acceptable either, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. So in the end, it doesn't matter how many people have an opinion about an episode, or even if they all agree: if no "scholarly studies" (reviews in reliable, reputable magazines, books about the series from an outside perspective, ...) exist, then no article following Wikipedia policies is possible, and they should be deleted (I have no problem with an article about a whole season as a compromise: I don't dispute that the series exists, has been shown in many countries, and has gotten a lot of viewers and so on). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:06, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not saying it's 100% <i>impossible</i> that those can turn into decent articles. But just that...given there is currently nothing to say about them except summary, why should we bother to keep the articles around for the off-chance that they may be expanded in the future? I mean...wikipedia has information about tons of TV (including cartoon/anime) series. Does that mean if someone went out and created articles like <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrible_Swift_Sword_%28The_4400_episode%29_e391.html" title="Terrible Swift Sword (The 4400 episode)">this</a> for each and every episode of each of the more popular TV/cartoon/anime shows, we would keep them all? That'd be thousands of articles, many would never be expanded. I mean, i understand this "<i>Generally, articles on episodes of television should not be listed for AfD (unless they are completely unverifiable, original research, etc.)</i>", but the same page also states to create articles for each season (or other logical division) when there's enough <i>independently verifiable information</i> and THEN create articles for each episode "<i>independently verifiable information included about individual episodes</i>". In this case, i'm doubtful there's even enough independently verifiable information for season articles (lenght isn't a concern. Seasons in 4400 are only 13 episodes long, or 6 in the case of season 1), so why give individual episode articles a chance? --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 07:54, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> - Some of the pages are only a few months old. They seem to be growing quickly.

<dd>On the contrary, AfD is a discussion by arguments intended to reach a consensus, not a vote. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_Deletion_f620.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion</a>, section "How to...", which says (first line): "The debate is not a vote; please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments." That is why I ask people voting keep to show us some evidence that their arguments are based on something more than wishful thinking. If you can't convince other people that there are for the moment (not in the future) ways to make the articles good enough (with regards to the Wikipedia policies) by providing good sources, then a thousand people can say <i>keep</i> and it still will be worth nothing. When there is discussion if the sources given are good enough, then you can have a no consensus (defaulting to a keep of the article in reality): when there are no arguments for keeping (only "votes" with unsubstantiated claims), then the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 11:42, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Would that be a bad thing? We have a decent general working consensus when it comes to albums from artists - all musicians get albums, but the songs only get them in certain circumstances.

<ul>
<li>Yes. Wikipedia isn't supposed to be an indiscriminate collection of information. To quote "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary <i>may</i> be appropriate <i>as an aspect of a larger topic</i>." The problem with these articles is that they often end up being merely episode summaries and nothing more. Once there's enough to say about a TV series beyond the main article, we expand into smaller articles, including articles about plot and seasons. That should come <i>before</i> expanding into individual episodes. There's no point having articles for individual episodes if all they're going to do is repeat a two-line summary from the main episode-list article. If a dedicated fan wished to expand the articles about that TV series, they can start with decent season articles, then expand into episode articles when season articles get too big. Albums are different, because you can't sensibly group them into larger articles. I suppose something like "all albums by X" is sort of possibly, but doesn't seem to work. Where as "season X" instead of many "episode X" articles seems to work fine. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 12:28, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(edit conflict) All 5082 episodes of <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours.html" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a> their own article? The horror! Let's add all 6409 episodes of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a>, all 5000 or so episodes of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsnight.html" title="Newsnight">Newsnight</a> (before someone accuses me of focusing on soaps), and so on... Artists make one album a year (on average), not 26 or 200. Every album by a major artist gets tons of professional reviews: I don't think many episodes of Neighbours have gotten even one professional review or analysis. The Simpsons, to come back to the argument, are one of the most discussed long running TV series ever, and even so, the article referenced (the very first long episode) is after three and a half years still pretty bad (though a lot better than the 4400 episodes we are discussing here). When there is really enough independent, out-of-universe, verifiable material to write articles about any episode, please do so: until then, why bother? Those articles are only describing what you see when you watch such an episode, and aren't giving any insight, and more importantly aren't acting like a tertiary source reproducing and condensing the comments of secondary sources, <i>which is what all Wikipedia articles should do</i>.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: I don't know where you have heard that "good info doesn't exist for this show", I certainly haven't read that in this AfD. What I (and others) say is that for many individual episodes (e.g. "The New and Improved Carl Morrissey", the one which started all this), there is for the moment not a shred of evidence that there is enough reliable, non-trivial coverage (i.e. reviews, analysis, ...) to write individual articles. I have also explicitly stated that I assumed that an exception could be made for the pilot, as those often do get more attention (although the link you give is not an acceptable one, as this is just a kind of Wiki, the opinion of some reviewer, not a peice written by any journalistic standards or published by a reliable publisher). No one is arguing that we shouldn't write about the show, in fact I think everyone here agreed that an article per season was quite acceptable. You are just using a strawman. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't have a problem with individual episode articles, provided the information is verifiable. They can be useful. On a related note, though, in examining this I did put <a href="../../../t/h/e/Category%7EThe_4400_7bb1.html" title="Category:The 4400">Category:The 4400</a> up for cfd, since the unique parent category for the show doesn't appear to be necessary, and generally it's a bad idea to have a seperate unique category for individual shows and films. Since this discussion is related, I'd recommend taking a look at the cfd for that category and giving input, one way or another. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b>. Though I agree that we shouldn't have individual episode articles on every television program out there, Wikipedia should follow the lead of how outside sources are handling it. In the case of shows such as <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a></i>, there are definitely individual discussions going on about different episodes, and fans routinely refer to the episodes individually, rather than as a grouped set (such as with a soap opera like <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Hospital_da91.html" title="General Hospital">General Hospital</a>). In the case of <i>4400,</i> the show has millions of viewers <a href="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_6980.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_6980.asp" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, and is clearly notable. It has garnered multiple Emmy nominations, survived multiple seasons, and has a substantial fanbase. Further, it appears that the fans discuss not just the show as a gestalt, but individual episodes by name. As such, it makes sense to have a separate article on each episode. However, I will add a caveat, that I do see a difference between <i>current</i> notability, and <i>longterm</i> notability. <i>4400</i> is definitely popular and notable now, but 20 years from now, it may be little more than a footnote. As such, it would make sense to me that Wikipedia learn to adapt to these changing levels of fame, such that a show which does deserve dozens or hundreds of articles today, might in the future (a generation from now?) be better served by merging these articles into a more concise general summary of the entire arc of the show. But for now, while interest is high, I say keep the articles separate and let the information flow. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 21:44, 26 October 2006(UTC)</li>

<dd>This is a weak argument. As others have mentioned above, some articles only exist because they haven't been nominated for deletion. Per [WP:NOT], Wikipedia is not a dumping ground for inormation, and that includes plot summaries <i>that do not reference the episode in the context of the real world.</i> That is, unless these individual episodes have garnered the attenetion of significant third-party sources -- forums and fan bases do not qualify as such -- there's nothing worth writing about. We can't have the articles on 4400 Episodes because they're only plot summaries, and offer no [WP:V|verifiable] discussion on their motifs, symbolism, themes, technical achievments, controversies and so on. The burden to prove their verifiable notability and connection to outside discourse lies on the "keep" voters. That the show is popular and generates major amounts of notable discussion is a good reason to keep <i>the main article.'</i> But the same level of interest must be discovered for an individual episode if we are to allowe them to propegate. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 22:28, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, two months seems like it would be plenty of time to find an article -- any article, even -- that offers the kind of information that we're asking for. With the show's popularity, finding an issue of Entertainment Weekly or a similar publication that brings significant information to light shouldn't be an issue. The problem that's popping up here is that such information <b>doesn't exist.</b> People seem to think that we write an aritcle and slap what we "know" into the pages, and then come back to source it later when we find something that backs up the claim. That's completely wrong. If you can't source it per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, then it <b>shouldn't</b> be in the article.

<dd>The first two points can much better be included in a season article / episode list (since the TV show info stays the same, and most of the people involved don't change between episodes): featured songs seems to be a very minor point (and the theme songs are usually the same for every episode anyway), location usually as well (and will often be the same across most episodes anyawy, so again better suited for a list), so the main discussion is the length of the plot, which seems in the current articles way too long for the amount of other info available, the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> attention these episodes have received, and per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. The plot summaries as they stand now are hardly comprehensible for someone not familiar with the series, so should either be way longer (which is totally unacceptable per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), or way shorter (not focusing on particular details, but giving a very general story line). So I don't see why your previous post can be adressed by a season article? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:01, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe a large part of our disagreement centers on formatting. Our goal is to answer a users questions, and I think we should make them do the least amount of scrolling and clicking as possible. An infobox with complete cast and crew info just won't fit nicely on a season page, and that's verifiable info that we can all agree is important, and it changes episode to episode. You could make it 1 click away, but why not 0 clicks away? As far as the level of plot detail, the best way I've seen to do that is in the Buffy pages, for example <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightmares_%28Buffy_episode%29_fad5.html" title="Nightmares (Buffy episode)">Nightmares (Buffy episode)</a>. A shorter summary answers very general questions, and a longer one explains the context. Another thing that doesn't go well with season pages are external links. Imdb and tv.com have individual pages that should be linked to. You could link to their lists, but then you've added maybe two clicks and some scrolling/reading. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 16:25, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Or, conversely, if a user is trying to learn more about the series and wants to see what information we have on individual episodes, they'll have to make at least 27 clicks to read the same sixty-five sentences per season. Many of those sentences will be duplicate information, as per <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram's</a> comment above. Less scrolling, more clicking. And that's if we grant that navigational concerns are grounds for keeping an article from being merged. There is no Wikipedia policy to support that belief, especially when it conflicts with other needs. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 19:31, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP!</b> This article is extremely useful for any RuneScape user, I myself being one, and since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia for everyone, you just make articles that reference to everyone - even though you may have a different oppinion on the game, leave the article here because it is not about the game, it's for the users of the game, if you don't like the game leave the article here, because it will be most likely re-written, and as you can see there was a lot of time and effort put into this guide.

Instead of fitting the weapons available in RS into some sort of context, this article merely lists some of them in such a way as to bore readers to tears or confuse them with impenetrable RS gabble. Most of the relevant information has already been ported to the <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_armour_2013.html" title="RuneScape armour">RuneScape armour</a> article, in preperation for a renaming to RuneScape equipment or something of the like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst that article is neither perfect nor complete, at least the information therein is organized in a way which might actually mean something to someone who doesn't log into RS on a regular basis. The weaponry article gives undue space to weapons which are scarcely used in RS because of the way the combat system is geared. Entire classes of weapons such as claws, warhammers and shortswords are redundant because they are either too slow in attack rate or do not offer the same damage potential of others. Devoting paragraphs of text to items which the vast majority of the game's players wouldn't touch with a bargepole seems to be slapping information into the article for the sake of it.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of edits continue to happen because the article is not set out as a WP article and the emphasis is on indiscriminate listing instead of actually giving information to non-players. Despite protestations that the article is undergoing clean-up (and I had a darned good go myself at one point), the article is still a mess and would need rewriting from the ground up (with most text deleted) in order to go anywhere. The armour article is there for improvement, I suggest this problematic fifth wheel is removed and put back in the trunk where it belongs. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 16:21, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a notable record label. It is a group of friends that 1) rarely bother to seek out press in the first place 2) pool their money in order to release records their way 3) the biggest and most important record label in Madison (despite their almost completely non-commercial nature) 4) and most importantly, the label is a reflection of the new independent music culture in this internet age. Press and record sales aren't what they used to be...most indie labels now operate like tiny major labels looking to sell songs to Grey's Anatomy or something. True independent music is now entering a currently directionless age where labels like Sector Five are feeling out the new territory. Bands now break over blogs and the internet (see: <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beirut_%28band%29.html" title="Beirut (band)">Beirut (band)</a>).</p>
<p>No one from Sector Five is involved in the creation of this page...it is NOT a publicity stunt...it is difficult to prove to you, but they ARE notable...times are just changing...it's a bit reminiscent of the directionless beginning of the very early '80s. To marginalize this label is to be short sighted. Fifteen releases in 3 years is nothing to sneeze at.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Does recording a far reaching and sizeable musical community for posterity really do Wikipedia more harm than good? I understand your policies, but might this be an exception to the rule? Let me know what I can do to save their page, please. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Minotaur029 (<a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMinotaur029_7fba.html" title="User talk:Minotaur029">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Minotaur029_bbec.html" title="Special:Contributions/Minotaur029">contribs</a>).</small></p>

</ul>
<p>The traditional policy makes nearly perfect sense...but if there's any organization that is capable of recognizing where policy might fall short occasionally, I'd imagine that Wikipedia is that organization. I've seen some instances of press for this label with my own eyes. This may be the internet age, but even now, not all press makes it onto the internet.</p>
<p>If I might speak a bit recklessly right now though...it is irritating for me to see bands touring through Madison, accepting Sector Five's hospitality, and then going on to be able to make their own Wikipedia page (not to mention sometimes being rude to a gracious community when they come back through town "bigger" and "better" than they used to be). As a lifelong amateur historian in my own right, I would not put something on Wikipedia that I felt was not legitimately worthy of being catalogued (I took into consideration Wikipedia's current standards when I made the original page). I cannot help but expect that you will tear this entry down, but I take music history (and this encyclopedia) seriously, and this label is deserving of an entry in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You can take this page down, but I think that it will be back up within a matter of years anyway...your policies will have probably evolved by that time on their own. Even if said policies do not evolve, in a couple years (just by virtue of sticking around) Sector Five will probably satisfy Wikipedia's 2006 requirements for having a page. The next <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana (band)</a> is not only possible, but I feel that this band will almost certainly become huge by word of mouth (blogs, the internet) and not through the standards that Wikipedia has set pertaining to "notability" at the present time. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Minotaur029 (<a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMinotaur029_7fba.html" title="User talk:Minotaur029">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Minotaur029_bbec.html" title="Special:Contributions/Minotaur029">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wrote most of the current text for this article and I am involved with the software, so I will only comment. I would argue that the software in question passes the first test of the proposed guideline on software notability, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The software package has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The RPG Toolkit received brief treatment in Game Pro magazine in 2003. (I have no evidence of this, and a quick search found only broken links to an image of the page. But it's true.) An older version of the software has an editor review with a rating of five at download.com <a href="http://www.download.com/RPG-Toolkit-Development-System/3000-2121_4-6676850.html?tag=lst-0-1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.download.com/RPG-Toolkit-Development-System/3000-2121_4-6676850.html?tag=lst-0-1" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. Additionally, it has supposedly appeared in several other magazines. The software is affiliated with none of the sources mentioned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, proposed guidelines aside, I doubt whether anybody would actually look up the Toolkit in Wikipedia, except somebody who already knows of it. As I am involved with the project, I will leave it to others to consider the arguments I have mentioned. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinJF_3713.html" title="User:ColinJF">Colin</a> 03:14, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If it could be shown that this software had had some reviews in major game industry press, I might change my mind, but until then, I'm afraid I have to side with the "Delete" crowd. For now, this product might be worth mentioning on some larger list of game development software, but it's not appropriate for it to have its own article. If more acclaim becomes available later, the article can be re-created. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 18:18, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is unfortunate that New Worlds Project has been put for potential deletion. At this rate, no play-by-post game will ever be listed on Wikipedia giving Wikipedia users a unbalanced view of our community. I wonder why New Worlds Project has been nominated but <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alleria.html" title="Alleria">Alleria</a> has not. I respectfully submit that New Worlds Project does meet the WB:WEB. Falling under the play-by-post games category, New Worlds Project is one of the leading examples of play-by-post games and is the only one to actually be incorporated both in Belgium and in the US. See [<a href="http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv/tsvf.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv/tsvf.htm" rel="nofollow">Belgian Monitor</a>] and the [<a href="https://secure.utah.gov/bes/action/index" class="external text" title="https://secure.utah.gov/bes/action/index" rel="nofollow">Utah Business Entity Search</a>]. Likewise, it is the only play-by-post game that actually produces reference materials and full-length novels available for purchase. See [<a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/263588" class="external text" title="http://www.lulu.com/content/263588" rel="nofollow">New Worlds Project Reference Guide</a>], [<a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/445512" class="external text" title="http://www.lulu.com/content/445512" rel="nofollow">New Worlds Augusta</a>], [<a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/385633" class="external text" title="http://www.lulu.com/content/385633" rel="nofollow">New Worlds Project Nalnath Cluster</a>]. In the light of these examples, one can see that New Worlds Project is certainly well on its way to becoming some much more than a game and of relevance to the Wikipedia community. I plead that the article on New Worlds Project should remain part of Wikipedia, offering an excellent example of play-by-post games, and new efforts to bring play-by-post games (and their positive results) to an ever growing community. --Kimmetje 10:37, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Kimmetje above. Though it may be shaky ground to allow a PbP game to have its own article, the fact is that the community has become large enough to warrant listing, and produced external material available beyond their game. It is a game, but it is a notable one that has established its own non-profit organization to promote PbP games as an educational tool for use in real classrooms. It is not a personal project and deleting it would be a mistake due to lack of information. However, the article should be reviewed and edited. --<a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrug_c627.html" title="User:Frug">Frugen</a> 07:30, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Kimmetje pretty much sums it up. The New Worlds Project is a serious (i.e. they've even registered themselves as a business) online collaborative creative writing project that is well known (read: notable) in the Play-by-Post community.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This is, if anything , even worse than the other similar article nommed today, because it's mostly a long list of "satire" which is neither funny, interesting, or understandable to those who don't already play the game (and, in all probability, not to those who <i>do</i> play the game, either).

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are several thousand roleplayers over the course of over a decade who would most certainly agree that this role-playing realm is notable. The article is in its infancy, and needs a great deal of elaboration, but it does NOT deserve to be deleted. If anything, the satire section, which is NOT the entire article (or even most of its substance) could stand to be removed. But the entire article? No way. Besides... this meets criterion point number 3 in the Web criteria for notability, being distributed by Dragonsmark.com AND Ringsofhonor.org, let alone its solid place as a part of AOL. Also, I have been tagged as a single purpose account, yet the fact is that I am new to the wiki community, and this is simply the first article I have edited.

<li><b>Delete</b>. As someone who's actually played within this universe, I might be able to offer something unique to the discussion. <b>RhyDin</b> is nearly synonymous with text-based role playing on AOL, and has been since the eariest versions of AOL. It dominated the Arts and Entertainment section of AOL chat rooms for nearly a decade, and remained the prominent role play setting within AOL until four or five years ago. An overwhelming percentage of current AOL role players started within the RhyDin universe, and you can <i>still</i> find rooms open that play RhyDin-style games.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>With that said, though, I'll be the first to admit that it's going to be a pain in the ass to reference. Because RhyDin began as an AOL-only universe and developed in a quasi-evolutionary way into its current form, you'll be hard pressed to find information on its history. This is mentioned on the talk page, although not much has come of it. No new editors seem to have arrived, and my own attempts at finding non-trivial references that would meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> -- <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> is inappropriate, as the game merely uses AOL -- have met with futility.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> While I appreciate that a merge suggestion saves all the work I've done on the RhyDin entry from being a complete waste, I still have to assert that RhyDin deserves its own dedicated entry. It only began on AOL, and has since evolved far beyond it. Although the <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_chatroom_game_f3d2.html" title="AOL chatroom game">AOL chatroom game</a> entry is also something I've got a considerable amount of experience with, so that may become one of my next targets for editing. Yes, RhyDin is difficult to chronicle, but I am willing to do every bit of research necessary. As I stated before, this article is in its infancy, and it is only recently that I took up the reins and decided to flesh it out. The Satire section has since been deleted, and my focus with the article is in the process of shifting. What it comes down to is the fact that this world has a huge amount of relevance and was a huge contributor to the formative years of literally thousands of people out there. Most people have since laid their characters, and their RhyDin experience, to rest, but the fact remains that it literally meant the world to many, many people. I feel very strongly about this, and I can't just let it all be for naught.Sacredepitaph 14:33, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fon't know about this one. Page was created by <a href="../../../g/u/s/User%7EGustavobernhardt_3052.html" title="User:Gustavobernhardt">USer:Gustavobernhardt</a>, so a personal interest piece. Article gives no explanation of how the coat of arms was awarded or designed. I have been unable to find any information elsewhere in Wikipedia or though Google etc. It is possible that this is a historic coat of arms; it is equally possible it was bought from any of a myriad of artists and companies that will give you a design for a fee. In the absence of any sources, I recommend deletion. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:38, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, there is something vaguely similar <a href="http://www.bernhardt.org.uk/family%20coat%20of%20arms.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bernhardt.org.uk/family%20coat%20of%20arms.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, awarded in the UK in 1997 (article says these arms are German). There is something armorially identical (but a quite different image) <a href="http://www.geocities.com/viljoen_family/stoor/bernhardt.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/viljoen_family/stoor/bernhardt.gif" rel="nofollow">here</a>; unfortunately, I can't find any information about it beyond the image itself. The image in the article looks like it was scanned from an old book; if this is in fact the case, it would be to the article's credit. (If nothing less, the image does not look like something that came from one of those <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucket_shop.html#A_heraldic_scam" title="Bucket shop">heraldry "bucket shops"</a>.) I'm going to have to think about this one. I definately don't like the idea of keeping something unverifiable, but I don't like the idea of deleting what could well be a legitimately granted coat of arms, either. Does anyone have any books on German heraldry? <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 00:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, NN vanity. There's no information even who the Bernhardt's are. WP doesn't have CoA articles for old noble families and likely won't have. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 00:06, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, we have material for a great part of the Polish nobility, and we probably have for a few British families as well (unfortunately, the heraldic material is still very underdeveloped). Interestingly, we at <a href="../../../h/v/_/WP%7EHV_16b5.html" title="WP:HV">WP:HV</a> have never discussed this scenario, but I don't think this family is <i>particularly</i> notable. I wouldn't rule out the possibility of articles about noble coats of arms completely, provided the holder (and/or the arms) was famous enough. No vote, but it might be an idea to ask WP:HV if anybody knows more about this one. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 22:54, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Obvious Prank, as far as I know there is no offical name of "Magic Roundabout" in the Uk.

<li><b>Um</b> I am torn here: both Hemel and Swindon have "magic roundabouts" and both of them are a source of local notability.

<dd>The notability standards for both companies an organizations states "has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works". The two key words in that segment are subject and multiple. The linked article does not establish notability because it is 1)not about Lab X Records, but rather merely mentions it in passing, and 2) is only one article.

<p>Now to address the two delete comments in detail above:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Snow Coverage is coverage of snow. Whoopee...": Ok, this is someone's opinion. They have a right to that opinion. That doesn't say this article doesn't have encyclopedic content. The references and sources from all over the United States say otherwise that this is a part of American Culture.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"It is unverifiable, original research. Even if properly sourced, it can't be more than a dicdef. Were historical examples to be introduced, they would make more sense on the individual snowstorm's page": In fairness, there were no references and sources posted at the time of this comment. This has been changed. As for the "historical examples", this is tricky. Snow coverage is often "overhyped" (as the sources point out) and the individual snowstorms aren't encyclopedic enough to warrant being in here. However, there is an example of John Bolaris' "Storm of the Century" that should suffice.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Even if specific storms aren't encyclopaedic on their own, a brief mention in the article would help its encyclopaedic value. <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_circus.html" title="Media circus">Media circus</a> is on the same level IMHO...borderline encyclopaedic, yet benefits from reliable sources including OED, with specific quotes mentioned to back up the phenomenon's existence. If there are no real historical examples (aside from The Blizzard of '96 as quoted in the media circus article), then the phenomenon isn't really significant enough to warrent its own article. Merging some info into <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_circus.html" title="Media circus">Media circus</a> may strengthen that article, however. -<a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunningonbrains_2b29.html" title="User:Runningonbrains">Runningonbrains</a> 16:50, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep —</b> JonMoseleyI think it is a significant weakness in this process that we are not advised of the basis or category under which deletion is being considered, in order to better evaluate and respond. However, I think that throughout Wikipedia discussion of events and organizations and activiteis of interest is frequently greatly enhanced by knowing something about the actors involved. It is a very common, and very helpful, aspect of Wikipedia to not only know what happened but also who it was who had a hand in it. Furthermore, just as a stand alone proposition, people often want to know "WHO IS X, anyway?" if they hear a name. Indeed, explanation of persons is a common feature of a true paper encyclopedia. Therefore, I do not see how it can be appropriate to remove any information about anyone on the public scene. I see far less important and more trivial entries on Wikipedia. Unless space is an issue, in which case you should try a few SMALL VERY FEW ads to cover costs, I cannot see any justification for limiting people's knowledge of who is who and what they are doing on the national or even sub-national stage.</li>

Suffice it to say, it has been deleted at AfD, kept at AfD, and sent to DRV in the interim for reasons of sockpuppeting, vote soliciting and other improprieties several times. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_October_18&amp;diff=83219784&amp;oldid=83188636" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_October_18&amp;diff=83219784&amp;oldid=83188636" rel="nofollow">The most recent DRV consensus</a> results in this relisting. I'd suggest everyone consider the article anew, without reference to any previous discussion. This debate will be semiprotected to prevent IP spamming; in addition, because of prior complaints of "vote soliciting" on every side, notifying other Wikipedians en masse of this relisting is strongly discouraged. I'm sure most interested folks have the article watch-listed by now, so extra notification, besides the AfD template on the article, shouldn't be needed.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Let me point out that I like indie bands, before I start, so this isn't an anti-indie vote or anything. But I've looked this over several times, and these guys don't meet the necessary mark. Badlydrawnjeff mentions the media mentions; an analysis of the four mentions in the article would indicate that one is a mention in a calendar listing, another is a blog with a passing reference to the band in an article about a local club, and a third requires registration, so I've no idea what it is. The article in College Times is about the only potentially solid reference to the band that I can track down, and I waded through several pages of Google listings as well. To me, that suggests they fail on the multiple, non-trivial mentions. And a look over <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> indicates that they miss the mark on all suggested guidelines. I'm sorry, but that all adds up to a delete, with absolutely no problem allowing a recreation down the road if they meet the guidelines. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 16:14, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I used to edit a weekly newspaper. We used to list about a dozen or so events every week as a calendar, including neat little writeups about the bands. They looked exactly like the New Times mention. It's a <i>calendar listing</i>, not an article. The AP (which, for anyone who doesn't mouse over the link, does not stand for "Associated Press") mention is a part of a band list, and is not an article. The HeartattaCk piece looks like an editorial of some sort to me, and mentions the band name once, waaaaaay down at the bottom; is the whole thing about AJJ? I can't honestly tell. And I'll give you the AZ Republic article - but it still fails multiple, non-trivial coverage. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 02:54, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Has not had a charted hit on any national music chart.</li>
<li>Has not been certified gold in any major country.</li>
<li>Has not gone on an international concert tour. Has performed in other states in the US, but does not qualify as a full national tour.</li>
<li>Has not released two albums, hasn't released any albums on a major or indie label. They are releasing a split EP on a relatively small indie label, but this is far cry from the two albums.</li>
<li>No reliable cited sources. There is a minor mention in a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_New_Times_0639.html" title="Phoenix New Times">Phoenix New Times</a>, a local paper, but this is not a major article. The AZNightBuzz link is a blog, therefore not reputatable. The eCollegeTimes has only 50 unique hits on Google, not reputable. The State Press is a bigger article, but is only a small college paper and part of a news page . Does not hit "Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media". No national press whatsoever</li>
<li>No major members from other bands</li>
<li>Not a notable style for a city or a local scene of a city. If it were, they would have received more verifiable press mentions.</li>
<li>Has not won or been placed a major music award. Won one "Best of Phoenix" award from a local paper, and was nominated for another. These are nowhere near "major".</li>
<li>Not performed performed music for a work of media that is notable, or been on radio</li>

<dd>If you're talking about that Heartattack thing wouldn't call a small music 'zine national. If you're on about the Alternative Press mention, it wasn't a non-trivial mention.

The other links you've provided elsewhere only show that the group has toured in various cities, a claim that (a) wasn't being denied and (b) doesn't exactly validate the article as per WP:MUSIC.

<li>I went to the New Times site and was able to get to the article. I have reprinted the text on the Talk page for your perusal. As for the ASU site, it wasn't a login required site when I originally cited the article, but it is representative of a printed material. I'm sorry if you don't want to take the time to check the sources, but that kind of discounts your comments about them not being reliable, since you're not taking the time to really look. I, on the other hand, have taken plenty of time to find these sources and cite them accurately within the article, as to verify all assertions of notability. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 19:43, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>*sigh* I never said that the ASU source was unreliable; I merely said that, of the four sources in the article, one required you to log in. That's all. As others have done, I'm going to direct you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> (and, while we're at it, <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>). You've yet to prove to anyone's satisfaction but your own that the band is notable; the majority of the links provided have only shown that they have toured, which in and of itself is not a particularly notable accomplishment. The few articles you have provided that actually <i>do</i> cover the band either do so in passing or are non-notable in and of themselves. If I may make a suggestion, the spread-out nature of this AfD is also making it almost impossible to follow; I would suggest consolidating <b>all</b> of the sources that you've provided onto the talk page, where we can quickly and easily see them all; I'll be willing to admit that perhaps a noteworthy and reliable source has been lost in the mess of all this, and consolidation might fix that. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 14:40, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

And they did not need me to consolidate all the sources provided, they merely read the article and saw the sources and external links mentioned at the bottom of the article. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 16:46, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

I'm not persuaded that the series of gigs in the south and West of the USA counts as a "national tour", and their presence in listings doesn't count for me as non-trivial coverage. The other articles are all local (to their state of Arizona), and most time out or require registration to read, so I can't rate them.

<li>It's a well established /guideline/ for establishing notability, something that is key to Wikipedia. However, it's not policy - indeed, you can cite reasons outside WP:MUSIC. It's just that /a lot/ of people use WP:MUSIC for establishing notability, and if you don't reach it you're likely to get a lot of delete votes as it's a fairly reliable catch-all even if it's not perfect.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Notability here is borderline. I can understand and respect those wishing to delete, but if the <i>spirit</i> of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is to weed out little brats with MySpace pages and not to marginalize indy music then I feel we are being overzealous. Still, they should meet the <i>letter</i> of at least one of the criteria, here is my read at this time:
<ol>
<li>Their <i>tours</i> <u>fail</u> as they have yet to travel the entire US...though a similar region in any "medium-sized" country would be "national".</li>
<li>Their <i>albums</i> <u>fail</u> because they are not on a label...though they are part of a collective and are reported to soon have a release on a significant label (the last bit being unsubstatiated).</li>
<li><i>"Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media...(university newspapers are usually fine)"</i> This one I think they <u>may pass</u> based on the <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/music/articles/0922withtheband0922.html" class="external text" title="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/music/articles/0922withtheband0922.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> in the <i><a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Republic_46b7.html" title="Arizona Republic">Arizona Republic</a></i> and the <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/bestof/award.php?oid=oid:197034&amp;section=oid:34824&amp;year=2006" class="external text" title="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/bestof/award.php?oid=oid:197034&amp;section=oid:34824&amp;year=2006" rel="nofollow">award</a> in the <i><a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_New_Times_0639.html" title="Phoenix New Times">Phoenix New Times</a></i>.

<li><i>All other criteria</i>, they <u>clearly fail</u> at this time. Thus I would suggest we pass them based on # 3 alone. This may seem very generous.

<li><b>Comment:</b> You're welcome. I'm not sure what the criteria may be for "compelling" press coverage, but the author has included more than three cites to sources that are verifiable secondary sources (several having paper and online avialability).

<li><b>Delete</b> per WP:MUSIC. As for reliable sources, I really don't see one. The ASU article is expressly out per WP:MUSIC: "Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...)." The AZ Night Buzz is a blog. And the College Times? Definitely not something I would consider reliable. The article in the Phoenix New Times is not displaying for me, so I am unable to judge the content of the article itself, but the publication as a whole is a local paper for a large city, but it is still not a far reaching paper, leaving its value rather limited as well. Even if these articles were considered to be reliable sources, the next question is, would this band meet WP:MUSIC? They have not gone on a national tour. They have toured a portion of the U.S. They don't have two or more albums on a major label, no major music competition, no major award, they aren't getting radio time, and they don't have any independently notable members. As for "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city...", I see nothing to support that argument, even with the sources given. So with or without the sources given, I believe this band does not meet WP:MUSIC and should be deleted. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelnuneb_b3c1.html" title="User:Maelnuneb">Maelnuneb</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaelnuneb_aa13.html" title="User talk:Maelnuneb">Talk</a>) 18:50, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b> Frankly, this entry bugs me a lot less than the really insignificant slew of public schools that always survive AfD just because they are schools. The main problem I have with this is I can't tell whether it's a wacky alternative collective that is actually a school - which is interesting and relevant - or whether it's a wacky alternative collective that just thought it would be wacky and alternative to pretend to, like, teach stuff. Given reliable cites, I think it's a keeper. Without them, it should be removed. - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorporal_Tunnel_bf12.html" title="User:Corporal Tunnel">Corporal Tunnel</a> 18:10, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that this article should <b>not</b> be deleted. If it be deleted I foresee it will easily be recreated by someone else, and the same issues may be rehashed. It appears a reason given here for deletion is that this article became controversial. If this were a valid reason, the Wikipedia article on the Holocaust or Christopher Columbus, and many others, would also be deleted.</p>
<p>The following further reasons to keep this article....</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject of this article (John Lane) has weighed in on this article on Wikipedia and has shown that he believes the description of "famous" applies to him. He had no objection to that description when making several other edits to the article.</li>
<li>In the world of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>, the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalist_Catholic_36a0.html" title="Traditionalist Catholic">Traditionalist Catholic</a> is a major subject, most notably the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_St._Pius_X_8d3f.html" title="Society of St. Pius X">Society of St. Pius X</a> (SSPX). This Society spends considerable time writing articles against <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedevacantism.html" title="Sedevacantism">Sedevacantism</a> because among Traditionalist Catholics they are the next biggest group that opposes that Soceity for alleged errors.</li>
<li>Among laymen associated with this priestly Society (<a href="../../../s/s/p/SSPX_8cc1.html" title="SSPX">SSPX</a>), considerable time is spent on Internet discussion forums talking about the Sedevacantists.</li>
<li>The subject of this article considers himself one of the <i>"world's leading lay sedevacantists"</i> according to an advertisement for a conference that was held in upstate New York in 2002.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/m/r/CMRI_3fb0.html" title="CMRI">CMRI</a>, a major portion of sedevacantist Catholics, has just invited John Lane to their yearly conference in 2006 to give some talks, and to give the keynote banquet speech.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it is clear enough that this contemporary article is necessary, and if deleted, it will once again be created. I think progress has been made so far, and it has been well-established that more citations need to be used for various statements. Vandalism is not unusual on Wikipedia and this cannot be used as an argument to delete an article. --<a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlossando_bf55.html" title="User:Glossando">Glossando</a> 23:24, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mr. Glossando, - I believe that vandalism is intellectual terrorism. I do not ordinarily believe in giving into terrorism. However, as this seems to be merely a three-way controversy involving Mr. Lane (&amp; Brian Boru IV and other of his allies), you and me, and as no other person / contributor seem to be interested to intervene, such as by protecting the page, etc., I do not see what good purpose can be served by this unseemly fight. If you can bring in more people, such as to protect the page from the Lanistas' intellectual terrorism, it would serve some good purpose. Incidentally, I believe that in my original write-up, I did provide reference webpages, references which were edited out by "Mr. Lane", Boru, etc. themselves, as far as I know (e.g. <a href="http://www.catholicintl.com/debate/debate.html" class="external free" title="http://www.catholicintl.com/debate/debate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicintl.com/debate/debate.html</a>). It is strange that "Mr. Lane" objects to facts collated here from those webpages, but not to those webpages themselves. He should, if he were honest, go to those pages and vandalize them with "citations required" notices all over them. But it is far more easier to do that with Wikipedia than at other places. Actually, I realize that Lane and Co. are a sectarian cult and I have a shrewd guess as to the real reason for their objection to this page. I have seen how they treated a recent interlocutor, Quirinus (<a href="http://quaesitoresfidei.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://quaesitoresfidei.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://quaesitoresfidei.blogspot.com/</a>), on their St. Bellarmine forum (<a href="http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=178&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" class="external free" title="http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=178&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=178&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0</a>), and it is typical of a sect or cult. Just for the record, I am not "Quirinus". I had been personally in correspondence with M/s. Daly &amp; Lane a few years ago, and recently with another of the Lanistas. -- <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Wikidness_38aa.html" title="User:My Wikidness">My Wikidness</a> 02:41, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Delete or not, I don't care. But I want the original version deleted. It's libellous and even as an historical relic it should be expunged.</p>
<p>What is going on here is merely that a person with some malign agenda as a result of a personal disappointment (now openly admitted) has invented facts about me and published them here, and objects to my attempts to have these things rectified. Glossando appears to have (belatedly) begun to follow the guidelines here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographies_of_living_persons" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographies_of_living_persons" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographies_of_living_persons</a></p>
<p>I read that this morning for the first time and it describes my own experience to a "t."</p>
<p>But Mr. Wickedness seems entirely ignorant of Wikipedia rules and guidelines.</p>
<p>As for the lack of objection to the use of the word "famous," Mr. Glossando, that was one of many words I thought inaccurate but not actually libellous, when I edited the article originally. I also left in numerous examples of bad English generated by the original author. This purely negative argument of yours therefore adds nothing to the discussion. If "fame" is measured in the awareness of a few hundred people that one exists and has an opinion, then I am famous. But I suspect even Andy Warhol would struggle to grant me that particular tag. &#160;:)</p>

<dd>Mr. Lane, I have verified your IP address and am certain you are who you say you are. However, I have always acted in accord with the rules. Nothing belated about it. You have not. And it appears not only are you in league with the vandalism of Brian Boru (possibly even a sock puppet), but out of your ignorance of WP rules, you were also in violation severely, and basically demanded things without any proper discussion. Try to do the same to ANY watched article on Wikipedia and you will get reactions like mine. You were in violation, not I. And do you think further that when a month ago you conceded to the CMRI advertisement about you and then come here now and put requests for citations over the most common facts even contained in that ad you conceded to...that you should be taken <i>seriously</i>? Or making your own edits and keeping request for citations on them is a serious thing to do here? Things like that make it appear to be disruption, and for things like that reverts are expected. Don't complain. Would you like to now categorically deny you know who that person is behind Brian Boru IV's vandalisms? I have more to say, but I will leave it for the article's discussion page. --<a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlossando_bf55.html" title="User:Glossando">Glossando</a> 11:14, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>You continue to attempt (via the article's discussion page) to provoke me to provide accurate (but irrelevant) data by speculating about the facts and prodding me to deny your unfounded speculation. You are a Wikipedia disgrace and I am reporting your behaviour to Jimmy Wales and Co.</p>
<p>Here are the guidelines you have violated:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Editors must take particular care when writing biographies of living persons, which require a degree of sensitivity, and which must adhere strictly to our content policies: Verifiability Neutral point of view No original research We must get the article right. Be very firm about high quality references, particularly about details of personal lives. Unsourced or poorly sourced controversial (negative, positive, or just highly questionable) material about living persons should be removed immediately from Wikipedia articles, talk pages, and user pages.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>When I removed such claims, you blundered and reverted the article.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Jimmy Wales warns other editors to think twice when encountering such attempts:</p>
<p>"...reverting someone who is trying to remove libel about themselves is a horribly stupid thing to do."&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Horribly stupid?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;The problem can be compounded if the subject attempts to edit their own article to remove problematic content. Since they are likely not regular Wikipedians, they will be unaware of our policies, and will often be accused of vandalism or revert warring when they are in fact trying to edit in good faith.</p>
<p>Accordingly, editors must take particular care with writing and editing biographies of living persons with these key areas in mind:</p>
<p>The article itself must be edited with a degree of sensitivity and strict adherence to our content policies; If the subject edits the article, it is of vital importance to assume good faith in terms of dealing politely with them (see Wikipedia:Autobiography for content decisions in this regard); If an anon IP address or a new account turns up to blank a page about a living person, or a section of it, it may well be the subject. Try not to act aggressively, but instead engage the person in dialogue, and check that the article in question does not contain any unsourced or poorly sourced criticism. If it does, delete that portion.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>It is true that having blunered initially, you became more polite and entered into discussion, but when you failed to verify the nonsense in the article, which anybody could see was the work of a biased writer, you refused to appply the guideline above - viz. "If it does, delete that portion."</p>
<p>You continue to violate this rule by repeating gossip somebody is feeding you in the hope that I will confirm or clarify it. You are a disgrace to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Editors should remove any controversial material about living persons that is either unsourced, relies upon sources that do not meet standards specified in Wikipedia:Reliable sources, or is a conjectural interpretation of a source. In cases where the information is derogatory and poorly sourced or unsourced, this kind of edit is an exception to the three-revert rule. These principles apply to biographical material about living persons found anywhere in Wikipedia, including user and talk pages. Administrators may enforce the removal of such material with page protection and blocks, even if they have been editing the article themselves. Editors who re-insert the material may be warned and blocked.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Ditto.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Jimmy Wales has said: "I can NOT emphasize this enough. There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative 'I heard it somewhere' pseudo information is to be tagged with a 'needs a cite' tag. Wrong. It should be removed, aggressively, unless it can be sourced. This is true of all information, but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons." &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Jimmy Wales does NOT say, "Try and provoke the subject by further lies until he coughs up the data we want."</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; He considers "no" information to be better than "speculative" information and reemphasizes the need for sensitivity: "Real people are involved, and they can be hurt by your words. We are not tabloid journalism, we are an encyclopedia." &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>You are, I repeat, a disgrace to Wikipedia. For the record, your gossipy lies are untrue, but I refuse to enter into a discussion of them in order to satisfy your perverse desire to discover irrelevant details about my life. Your game is contrary to the letter and spirit of Wikipedia and to the common rules of courtesy and honesty.</p>
<p>John Lane.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This looks pretty clear-cut to me. We have:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>- Concerns from the subject, credibly expressed, that the article is being abused as an attack</dd>
<dd>- Questions over whether the subject meets our <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">biographical inclusion criteria</a> (which is mainly a reflection on the amount of external notice, of course, and is in no way a reflection of the person's worth)</dd>
<dd>- Lack of independent sources, identified and not remedied</dd>
<dd>- Edit warring by interested parties in flagrant contravention of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a></dd>
<dd>Overall, that puts it, in my view, in the "more trouble than it's worth" category. Let's wait until John Lane has been the subject of multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable independent (and dispassionate) sources, and a disinterested third party writes a verifiably neutral biography based on, and citing, those. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 18:07, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Question: Would a person who is a writer and advisor for a public periodical be considered well-known? In addition the person being published by a 3rd party web site to be an international speaker, invited to give a keynote speech by and for that same third party's annual conference, and arranged by that third party to debate another person publicly who also already has an entry on Wikipedia, as well as having that debate sold on the Internet by that 3rd party, as well as by that other well-known debater? Do I need to give the details? I have described John Lane (sedevacantist).

<p>I looked at the guidelines for notability and it says, "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." This man fits this in regard to the field of <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedevacantism.html" title="Sedevacantism">sedevacantism</a> having owned and run the domain www.sedevacantist.com for 6 years now. If not, I think the article on that field does not belong on Wikipedia either. --<a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlossando_bf55.html" title="User:Glossando">Glossando</a> 14:36, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - to end fruitless controversy. The subject possess notability, as a matter of fact, even if it is only for the field of comparative religion, and regardless of the 'smallness' of the group; yet, it is not so small as is thought of, the subject being more than a fairly influential Sedevacantist, and also associated with the much larger CMRI entity.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just because it's a "30-word stub", as you said, it does not neccesarily mean it should be deleted. So long as it provides <b>some</b> information, it should be considered a part of Wikipedia. If we deleted every stub that was 50 words or less, how much of wikipedia would we lose? Every day, stubs that were merely a sentence and infobox become larger. Some even reach <a href="../../../f/e/a/Featured_Article_1a49.html" title="Featured Article">Featured Article</a> status. If we delete every short stub, we're cutting down on future information.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Sometimes, I think people get slightly over excited about the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> rules.

<li>"Deutsche is the feminine adjectival form for Deutsch". So we will get a separate list for Deutscher and, wait for it, another list for the masculine which just happens to be... Deutsche.

<li>No, it doesn't.

<li>Are you saying Deutsche doesn't exist as a word?? That's very strange, since it provably does exist, and the possibility of somebody entering it into Wikipedia is thus not nil. Thus it is useful as a navigational tool to have a disamiguation. If you wish to argue otherwise, please make some arguments that are more substantial than referring to policy pages. I can't see anything on <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> that precludes this usage, and it starts off saying <i>However, it is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception.</i> thus I would say even if there were a problem you could explicitly define, you'd still have to make a common sense argument.

<li><i>Are you saying Deutsche doesn't exist as a word?</i> — I'm saying what I wrote.

<li>I'm afraid I don't understand your question then, please try to explain it better, and address its relevancy to this situation. And sorry, but you do have a problem with making references to pages without specifing what and where you're talking about. I'm not going to read a whole page and try to decipher what you're talking about. Sorry. I'm afraid I just can't respect that kind of argument. Especially when you do it, as I've said before, multiple times in the same article. That's bordering on harassment. And the common sense works both ways. Yes, this page shouldn't cover everything that starts with Deutsche, but that just means that the page shouldn't do that, any more than the thousands of other disambig pages don't try to cover everything. And as I said, I'd have no real problem with a redirect to Deutsch (disambig), except for the clutter issue. Still, if you can work around that, go ahead. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Then please familiarize yourself with <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> and the entire purpose of disambiguation articles. Disambiguation articles are for where two or more articles, or redirects, would otherwise employ the same title. Things that <i>aren't actually known</i> as "Deutsche" don't require listing on a disambiguation article at <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsche.html" title="Deutsche">Deutsche</a>. There is no ambiguity. This isn't a disambiguation article. It's a mis-titled list article — one with a pretty bizarre inclusion criterion.

<li>I'd agree with you if there were really no disambiguity to resolve, but it's not inconceivable that someone would pick up only the first part, e.g. "I work at Deutsche <i>garble</i>", in which case this can come in useful - it's not your usual crufty "List of songs that contain the letter y" or something. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 08:53, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>We seem have some consensus (perhaps incomplete) for making a common article on patterns and listings these within it. Perhaps we should start discussing it.</p>
<p>One thing I would bring up is that the same article situation could exist for china patterns. It seems to me that we could/should write a single article to cover the whole phenomenon. <b>BUT</b> her's the rub: popping over to Replacements Ltd., I see that they claim to have <i>250,000</i> patterns <a href="http://www.replacements.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.replacements.com/" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>! They have 13 pages for Gorham alone, and I'm not even going to think about counting all the Noritake china patterns. I don't think any sane person could compile all this stuff into an article, or for that matter sort through it for notability; and I don't think any sane person would read it all.</p>
<p>I think the best we can do is talk about the phenomenon generally, and <i>maybe</i> mention a few examples (<i>with</i> images, because there's no point in this without a picture). If we can get a source for a historical treatment, example patterns would fit into that. BUt I think we need to think more about what a vote of "<b>merge</b>" means. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 16:52, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Devil's in the details, right? If we could count on someone being an expert and happening along to spiff things up, then we could ask for an article that deals coherently with major design schools, lists a couple of examples, mentions sub-variants, and stays free from overt considerations of commerce.<br />
Like <i>that's</i> going to happen.<br />
I suspect this should be allowed to stumble over problems as they come - in other words, let these merge into a stub article, which will either vanish into neglect or start to pick up mass. Then when it gets too big some other enterprising editor can come along and slice it up into bite-sized pieces.<br />
I was doing some research into coffee cups the other day (oh the places we go), for example, and though there are thousands of coffee cup patterns by hundreds of different companies, there are really only a few <i>designs</i> - everything else is a variation. So there's the Diablo, the Barrel, the Bistro cup, a few others I'm already forgetting. It's likely that here too there will just be a handful of main designs, and if an expert happens along perhaps it'll all turn out well. - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorporal_Tunnel_bf12.html" title="User:Corporal Tunnel">Corporal Tunnel</a> 17:30, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mangoe makes some good points. However, both articles contain encyclopaedic material that it would be a shame to lose. Another thought. Both manufacturers of the silver have existing articles <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_%26_Barton_8ee9.html" title="Reed &amp; Barton">Reed &amp; Barton</a> for Francis 1st and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace_Silversmiths_Inc._68c1.html" title="Wallace Silversmiths Inc.">Wallace Silversmiths Inc.</a> for Grande Baroque. Indeed Grand Baroque is already mentioned in the Wallace article. How about merging the articles into the relevant manufacturer's articles? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 17:39, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many of the articles on silversmithing concerns are in terrible shape (e.g. <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace_Silversmiths_Inc._68c1.html" title="Wallace Silversmiths Inc.">Wallace Silversmiths Inc.</a>, which is yet another fulsome ad copy article). Howeer there is certainly room in all of them for expansion and wikification, and it seems to me that talking about some of their more famous patterns in the the context of those articles is where the patterns being discussed should go. Therefore I second this proposal. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 18:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As per the concern of too many patterns the Grande baroque and Francis 1'ts stand out based upon there uniqueness. Given that Grande baroque is probably the most sought after pattern (as can be verified by anyone in this field) and Francis 1'ts has a very complex pattern in addition each one of the set has a different design which is not the case with most - if not all - other patterns. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBloger_aa64.html" title="User:Bloger">Bloger</a> 17:48, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I don't know about that. What about International's "1810"? What about "Repousse"? "Francis 1st" is an old and well-known pattern, but so are very many others. I'd call the "each piece a different design" a trivia point. It's a well-known pattern, to be sure (it's what my mother-in-law has) but it's still just another silver pattern.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The thing is that I don't think we can say enough <i>factual</i> about them. Even the articles in the silver collector's magazine are straining for material, and much of what we have in the article is just puffery about what a great pattern it is. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 18:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"1810" is also a very familiar pattern-- rather the opposite of any of the other patterns mentioned (it's extremely simple). Like any of the other patterns we've mentioned, it gets a bajillion Google hits. The thing is that what we are doing here is simply citing some of the best-known patterns from each manufacturer. Well, it seems to me then that we can say for Wallace that one of their major/best-known/whatever patterns is "Grande Baroque"-- with a picture-- and for International, "1810", and for Reed &amp; Barton, "Francis 1st", and so forth. And if the pattern played an important role in the company's development, say so. But we aren't here to sing the artistic praises of any given pattern. A Wikipedia of, say, 1965 might well have said that F 1st and GB were fussy old patterns which had fallen out of fashion. When we get rid of the opinion, and lacking a picture, what we're left with is next to nothing. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 19:28, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Let me just note that describing Brooks as 'non-notable' isn't an attack on him or a denigration of his work, and that Krishnaji is quite right that Brooks has an impressive publication record for someone so young. Nonetheless, there are many academics in the world, not all of us are appropriate encyclopedic subjects, and having published books (even with major publishers) should not in itself be a criterion of notability. Brooks hasn't yet added significant concepts, theories or ideas to his discipline, or written a 'must-read' book, and he's not a central figure in any of the various subjects he works on. Try googling 'philosophy punishment reading list', for instance: you'll find many mentions of Hart, Dworkin and Foucault, some of Anthony Duff, and few to none of Brooks.

The article does not even try to assert notability: it describes Brooks's work, but does not even try to assert the notability of either the author or the books. Krishnaji points to Brooks's prolific publication record, but that is of itsef not a criterion for notability: plenty of people work very hard and are skilled in their fields, but that does not amount to notability. As Sam Clark says, non-notability is not a denigration of someone. I'm also very concerned by utcursch's evidence of reference-spamming, which appears to me to be an attempt to use wikipedia to manufacture "evidence" of notability: there <i>may</i> not be a specific rule against this, but it's clearly an inappropriate practice. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 09:46, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>On the one hand, a track record of 50 peer reviewed publications is more than the average academic has. On the other hand, he got his Ph.D. in 2004, and he works in a fairly middling university. Something doesn't compute there. 50 scholarly articles in 2 years is a simply mind-boggling record, unless these are mostly 4th-rate journals. I strongly suspect that to be the case, because they don't make <a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/policy/review_phil.html#rank" class="external text" title="http://www.nla.gov.au/policy/review_phil.html#rank" rel="nofollow">this list</a>, and Harvard hasn't snapped him up. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 09:55, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it is true that 50 peer reviewed articles is more than most academics has. That is surely notable and worthy of mention. Of course, Derex didn't take a close look at the list. Brooks started publishing articles in 2001, not 2004. His production of 6-8 articles per year is in line with other notable philosophers, such as Martha Nussbaum. Fourth rate journals? Since when were journals like <i>Philosophy</i> or <i>Ratio</i> or <i>Utilitas</i> or <i>Journal of Social Philosophy</i> etc 4th rate? Since when were publishers like Routledge and Blackwell 4th rate? Brooks works in philosophy which may explain why he's not on the list. To think he's not notable because either no one here knows about American academics or the worthiness of different articles is nuts. John</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. John's right about the articles being in perfectly decent journals, but I don't think that having published a large number of articles is a sufficient condition of notability. And as a matter of fact, I do know about academics in this field, since I am one.

<li><b>Delete</b> as above. The concept of a "resource war" is a valid one, and there is plenty of scholarly material about how the Iraq war can be classed as a resource war, and how the 1967 6-day war can be viewed as a resource war over water. However, the concept needs careful handling and this article is simply a collection of unsourced POV statements and wild assertions, all conveyed in a most unenclyclopedic tone. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 09:52, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There's definitely an emerging consensus that the current text needs to go. A remaining question is whether the subject deserves its own (improved) entry. I don't think anyone seriously doubts that wars have been and be fought over resources, so this questions centres on whether the term 'resource war' is accepted terminology in war history, or whether such issues are better treated under the 'causes of war' article. My preference is for the latter, but I could be convinced by decent references to material on the concept of a 'resource war'. --<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENmcmurdo_69fe.html" title="User:Nmcmurdo">Nmcmurdo</a> 12:40, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article is extremely accurate and cross-referenced in a way that verifies the content. Malicious Wikipedia 'users' have targeted this entry because they seem to be intent on making Wikipedia a strictly US &amp; UK focused music reference with little regard for the rest of the world, let alone a small country like Cyprus. <sub>The above unsigned article was posted by 08:28, 24 October 2006 Leannastarvou (Talk | contribs)who also removed all previous comments.</sub></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I appreciate what you say about the focus on US/UK music, however, this artist has merely had a record released, which is not notable in itself.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The most notable issue with regards to this artist for me at least (apart from his talent as a singer-songwriter) is that he is heaviliy involved with creating opportunities for musician of the two communities in the divided Island of Cyprus (ie Greek and Turkish Cypriots) to meet together through music either ro record or deliver live performances. This is an issue not noted in the article but evident on the island and in the LP (Poquito Loco)itself. Most notably the song Eastern Drums is a multi-lingual piece (Arabic English and Greek). There's no doubt this artist is important to Cyprus and in the grand scheme of things in terms of Cypriot youth Greek-Turkish relations. I think it would be narrow minded to delete related articles from Wikepedia (especially as they are not competing with any other 'notable' US or UK entries of the same name (Poquito Loco??). --tommcmillain 25 October 2006</dd>

<dd>This station should be kept. It was bought by Fisher Communications in January 2006. Radio Station World lists it as a Telefutura affiliate <a href="http://radiostationworld.com/Locations/United_States_of_America/Idaho/tv.asp?m=ida" class="external autonumber" title="http://radiostationworld.com/Locations/United_States_of_America/Idaho/tv.asp?m=ida" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>, as does Univision <a href="http://www.univisionradio.com/corp/en/mp_list2.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.univisionradio.com/corp/en/mp_list2.jsp" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>.

<dd>(I've slightly reformatted your comment to make it more legible.) OK, but I don't quite see how this translates into notability per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Your links merely indicate that this radio station a) has been registered as such and b) has some physical antennas on a hill somewhere. The Fisher Broadcasting report just certifies that it meets certain radiation standards; it doesn't say anything about notability. WP:CORP requires that "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself", excluding trivial coverage such as in the first links. How does KUNP-LP meet this standard? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 05:15, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Licensed and operational television stations have always met the standard of notability. Please refer to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KTFL_bac7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KTFL">KTFL deletion proposal</a> for standards on notability of broadcast facilities. The inclusion of the TV station in Radio Station World and Univision establishes multiple non-trivial published works independent of the company/corporation, meeting even your standards, which are far more stringent. (Univision does not own the station.) In addition, the station is listed by the FCC as having been licensed since 2001. Apart from a personal testimony that the station is actually broadcasting Telefutura programming on UHF channel 24 in Pocatello, Idaho, I'm not sure how much more proof you can get that this station is operating and as such, merits inclusion into WikiPedia. There are many other stations included in Wikipedia with less documentation than KUNP-LP has. What I think we'll both agree on is that the KUNP-LP article as it stands is of poor quality and is based on long-outdated information - once this proceeding is complete, I plan to update and expand the article. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 09:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'll have to disagree on the notability issue. Neither <a href="../../../t/v/s/WP%7ETVS_4679.html" title="WP:TVS">WP:TVS</a> nor the AfD you referred to indicate any general community-wide consensus that TV stations are <i>per se</i> notable, as opposed to other corporations. The sources you provide only list the station in a table of stations. This is utterly trivial coverage under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> ("Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories"), leaving aside the question whether these are reliable suorces under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> at all. Being licenced by the FCC isn't a notability criterion, <b>multiple substantial coverage by reliable sources</b> is (see in general: <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). Finally, I'm afraid your personal testimony isn't allowed under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and at any rate it's immaterial whether they broadcast anything. If no-one has bothered to write anything of substance about this station, they're still nonnotable. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 11:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't offering "personal testimony" - just using it as an example. Broadcast stations licensed in the US by the <a href="../../../f/c/c/FCC_a44b.html" title="FCC">FCC</a> or in other countries by their equivalent have always been accepted as notable in the English Wikipedia, either for standalone articles, or, as in the case of translators, for redirects to primary stations;. Using your standards would probably eliminate a good 50%-60% of US TV station articles already in Wikipedia due to the number of low-power television stations. Your arguments under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> are unconvincing, as the former has no specific guidelines that apply to broadcast television and the latter relies on precedent as a standard, precedent which overwhelmingly favors keeping the article. Your citation under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> also does not apply, as the <a href="../../../f/c/c/FCC_a44b.html" title="FCC">FCC</a> has published several documents concerning this station. Here's what I propose: let's keep the article, then post your argument to <a href="../../../t/v/s/WT%7ETVS_21aa.html" title="WT:TVS">WT:TVS</a>. If they go along with it, I will too, and will personally nominate the article again for deletion. But you're going against years of precedent here and taking up more space than the original article ever did in the first place. I don't know what kind of personal crusade you're on with this or why you think that your idea of notability trumps that which has been accepted until now, but I recommend that you leave this article as is and take up your cause with the TelevisionStationsProject group. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 20:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, let's see what some other people think around here, first. General AfD is the proper forum for notability discussions, not some specialised group, and I've yet to be convinced that the established precedent you mention does in fact exist. Contrary to your impression, I'm not on a crusade against anything and have in fact never before (I believe) edited anything TV-related - I just happened to stumble over a run-of-the-mill corporate article with no assertion of notability, and here we are. I'd appreciate it if you could <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> in your co-contributors. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 20:54, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your vehemence surprises me, especially in regards to a project in which you've had no dealings before. My "personal crusade" comment was not an assumption of bad faith, but rather a commentary on your insistence. Nevertheless, it has apparently offended you, and so for that, I do apologize. You might wish to consult <a href="../../../a/a/g/WP%7EAAGF_5ca1.html" title="WP:AAGF">WP:AAGF</a> next time before citing <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> so quickly. Also, please understand that broadcast entities do not fit well into your "run-of-the-mill corporate" template, especially when it comes to low-power broadcast. A low-power Telefutura station is not the same as a neighborhood McDonalds, and I'm not sure if any low-power television station or even any small-market full-power television station meets your "multiple substantial coverage by reliable sources" criterion for notability, which by the way, is not an established standard for notability. But low-power television stations are notable, as are full-power stations in small markets. As for the article's lack of assertion of notability, I've already covered that: it's a poorly-sourced, poorly-written article, but the answer is to improve the article, not to delete it. If I didn't think I could improve it, I wouldn't be contesting the AfD recommendation. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 02:23, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Contested Prod. Yet another joke religion. Per the article and Talk page discussion, the entire history of the religion was 3 hours at the Burning Man festival. No sources outside Burning Man. No indication of any activity since, but author argues that it might happen again next year.

<dd>Three hours is much longer than the average Sunday mass lasts. Babarism is not a well-enough established or widely-enough spread religion to hold a weekly service due to how spread out its worshippers are. Furthermore, as many people only attend church on special occasions such as christmas or easter, an annual meeting isn't that infrequent. To call it simply is demeaning to the deep morals that can be learned within Babarism's approach to the Babarism bible. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 21:40, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would prefer specifics. First off, this article is about a religion, that it mentions an organization (the Church of Babar) is only a side-note. The Church of Babar is not the whole of Babarism, as in many faiths such as <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicca.html" title="Wicca">Wicca</a>, there are more individual practitioners, the CoB is simply the only organized practise to espouse doctrine for the faith.</dd>
<dd>Still, even ignoring that this is an article about a religion (and one that has had a gathering, unlike <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frisbeetarianism.html" title="Frisbeetarianism">Frisbeetarianism</a>), even approaching it from the role as an organization, it is still qualified. The scope of it's activities in an international festival such as <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Man_8f2f.html" title="Burning Man">Burning Man</a> make it Criteria #1 for Organizations. The <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Man_8f2f.html" title="Burning Man">Burning Man</a> Festival is a justified third party which published an announcement of the event. It was not published by the Church of Babar itself, so it is not an internal document. This has gone far beyond the level of a simply <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made up ideas</a> due to the organization and collectiveness witnessed. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 21:40, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep Babarism.</b> There are at least 17 parody religions in Wikipedia. These religions are based on widely known elements of popular culture around the world, including international soccer star Diego Maradona: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Maradona" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Maradona" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Maradona</a>, the Frisbee: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbeetarianism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbeetarianism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbeetarianism</a>, and more. Due to the religion's loose affiliation, ceremonies are not widely known about and do not garner much attention. This does not detract from their value and importance to the religions followers. At the time of this post, there were at least 40 mentions--<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethnickerson_fe5e.html" title="User:Sethnickerson">Sethnickerson</a> 05:17, 26 October 2006 (UTC) of the religion on the web. That tells me that Babarism is gaining acceptance and spreading by word of mouth, similar to how many religions spread before the advent of the World-Wide-Web. This religion deserves its place along side all of the other religions on Wikipedia, real or imagined. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethnickerson_fe5e.html" title="User:Sethnickerson">Sethnickerson</a> 01:34, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: your vote might matter if this were a vote, but it's not! It's a discussion to try to establish a concensus. And pointing at other articles is not going to advance your case.

<li><b>Keep</b> Babarism. I've actually met more than one Babarist and in non-burning man environments. I can assure you they each seemed totally sincere. I agree that it's not a religion, and the Babarists I met never claimed it was, but there are people out there who follow their philosophies. The groups I met were in Phoenix and Chicago and seemed to be unrelated to each other (aside from the whole Babar thing). The only way I met the group in Chicago was because I recognized their "WWBD?" wristbands. (dwishman (at) hotmail.com)</li>

<dd>Yeah, I've been thinking about this because this is one of those unclear areas. I think the problem is that only the existence of the event at Burning Man is verified by the mention in the Burning Man newsletter. I'm going to make some assumptions here so, of course, correct me if I make an erroneous assumption. I'm guessing that the Burning Man newsletter provides just the name, time and location of the event and not a long description of the event and certainly not a description of the Babarism religion itself. Thus, if the event were mentioned in the Burning Man article, one could not challenge the assertion that the event had been held on the grounds of it being non-verifiable. The Burning Man newsletter provides the verifiability of the event BUT not of the details of the religion as presented in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, you cannot justify the whole article on Babarism based solely on the mention of the event in the Burning Man newsletter. What you would need to look for is a journalist or scholar who went to the event and reported on it in some newspaper, magazine, journal article or book. If there was an official Babarist newsletter, that might be argued as being a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Failing any of the above, the article fails for being non-verifiable.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Note that this argument falls apart if the Burning Man newsletter provided an after-the-fact account of the event with a full description of the details of the Babarism religion as presented in the article AND copies of the Burning Man newsletter are available either online or in libraries/archives accessible to the public.</dd>

<dd>I understand this concern Richard. The details regarding the religion, I obtained from the website <a href="http://www.babarist.org" class="external free" title="http://www.babarist.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.babarist.org</a>. It certainly counts as at least one interpretation of a religion, that being the Church of Babar's. The reason I give it precidence in the article's creation is that it is linked to on the Burning Man official theme camp announcement list as being the homepage of the creator of the encampment. So due to that, it's not as if someone just wrote a page on it. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 16:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep Babar</b> While I am not a member of the Babarist religion myself, my husband (much to my chagrin), was converted at the 2005 Burning Man. This is actually the 2nd year that the Babarists have held their Babarist Bash in Black Rock City.<br />
And to the poster above who argues that blogs are not considered "reliable sources," I'd like to remind him of the recent release of "Snakes On A Plane;" and the blog for said movie that just became the viral marketer's wet dream. Not only were new scenes filmed for the movie because of the blog, but more hype was created due to this movie's blog than previously thought possible. The creator of the blog was even invited to the movie premiere. While it's true that many, if not most, blogs cannot be considered "reliable sources," you can no longer automatically discredit sources just because they're not mainstream.149.169.67.118 17:41, 24 October 2006 (UTC)Shawnna</li>

<dd>In that case, there was widespread reporting <i>about the blogging</i>, and the reaction to it, in numerous reliable news sources. The blogging was the <i>subject</i> of news stories, not the source. There's no indication of that occurring here. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 17:48, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Shawnna, I understand your point about blogs but I'm not convinced that it applies here. Moreover, I think it's a bad idea to get into an extended discussion of the merits of a Wikipedia policy in an AFD discussion.

<dd>Shawnna, I'm sorry, I wasn't aware at all that a <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Man_8f2f.html" title="Burning Man">Burning Man</a> event was held for this in 2005. If it was, I'd think it here be <a href="http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/2005/05_camp_vill_1.html#B" class="external text" title="http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/2005/05_camp_vill_1.html#B" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Perhaps in 2005 it was an unofficial gathering that mitigated the creation of the official 2006 theme camp.

The modern definition of news is what people find important to them, whether it be a major media outlet, the newsletter of a festival, or a blog. When an organization such as the Church of Babarism is referenced in multiple sources by a number of unaffiliated individuals, this warrants merit and establishes authenticity.

<p>I am only moving this article from CSD to AfD to determine whether anyone cares enough about it to keep it form being deleted. I have no strong opinion whether to keep or delete this article.</p>
<p>It appears that Paris "famous because she's well known" Hilton has recorded this song on her album -- so it may be worth including in Wikipedia. However, this article has bounced between a stub &amp; CSD listing, while the frequent victim of vandalism. As it currently reads, the article is not worth saving, but a previous version might be worth recovering. Does anyone care enough about this to do the work &amp; redeem it? If not, let's delete it until someone comes along who will. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:17, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I recovered the content from past versions. Reading the comments here is quite remarkable. It appears people are voting against the article just because they don't like Paris Hilton. Well, if this is indeed her next single, it is definitely worthy of an article; however, I could find no verification of that anywhere. Nevertheless, I vote <b>keep</b>; I would like to see a nice article here even if it turns out not to be a single, and if others don't favor that option, it can eventually be merged (if it's not a single). There is no reason to make the decision now, and in the meantime it works fine as an independent article. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:16, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't like Paris Hilton, but that had nothing to do with my vote. It is a non-notable song, and as such, doesn't warrant an article (if it actually <i>is</i> released as a single, <b>then and only then</b> is an article warranted; <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>).

<p>Does not establish notability of event. While the article claims some notability, it is unsourced <s>and the claims of notability are written with weasel words.</s> <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 21:33, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am a friend and associate with direct contact with Fraser Clark. I was reading a document on his Zippies and the Pronoia Tour. One stop on the tour, is as I describe in the Pronoia Tour page. The tour had far reaching impact on many. I am not sure what weasal words are (even after reading the defination) as used in reference to my writing, please advise? I was only trying to give an example of what the tour was all about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, How better can I describe what I witnessed as part of the birth of the world wide web and contact with physical reality - that went on to have such positive influence on so many people - i.e. KidCast for Peace; Solutions for a Better World, and those touched by it which was directly influenced by the pronoia tour?</p>
<p>Unsourced? What do you mean by that? Just that I need to sign my name or something? Also I would like to know how to link the entry to my [<a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/PeterRosen" class="external text" title="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/PeterRosen" rel="nofollow">Creativity Cafe Sandbox</a>] page (for that is the next incarnation of the Zippy Tour's influence) and my personal TWIKI page: <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/PeterRosen" class="external free" title="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/PeterRosen" rel="nofollow">http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/PeterRosen</a> <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterrosen_6a18.html" title="User:Peterrosen">Peterrosen</a> 22:12, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Neutral</b>.</s> With a bit of digging, I found some credible, third-party sources, and enlarged the article a bit. I see that the school (at least as of a few years ago) participates in <a href="../../../d/a/r/DARE_79b8.html" title="DARE">DARE</a>, the anti-drug program taught by police officers. I had hoped to find an inspection report from the Florida Department of Education, but didn't find one. The school board publishes its attendance policy in English, Kréol, Portuguese and Spanish, so it would be interesting to see statistics on the percentage of students for whom each of these is the first language. It would also be interesting to see percentages of students by ethnic background; sometimes individual schools vary markedly from the statistics for the school district as a whole. I also saw some references to a construction plan, including a comment from a police officer: "Organized, mechanical security is needed at the “parent drop-off” point, as this area is not located at the main entrance. It appears that the first floor restrooms are accessible from outside the building. What security will be provided to prevent an unauthorized person from entering the restrooms, undetected?" All these things suggest that Bayview Elementary is more than "just another elementary school". And, since the school is in Florida, the school presumably engages in high-stakes testing, which creates an atmosphere in which many pupils do not thrive. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 02:50, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It's amazing what can be accomplished when your goal is to make Wikipedia better by working to improve articles. I'm usually leery of elementary school articles, but as modified by my esteemed colleague <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> and I, the article provides several sources in full compliance with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and makes an explicit claim of notability per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> the school was one of 16 schools in Florida recognized with the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Award_of_Excellence_in_Education_df7c.html" title="Blue Ribbon Award of Excellence in Education">Blue Ribbon Award of Excellence in Education</a> from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Education_de27.html" title="United States Department of Education">United States Department of Education</a>, the highest honor that an American school can achieve.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes, I added the page. But I think the removal of the page would be, well, don't know exactly what to say. You see, to me, to most people, bat bathing is something just not done or even contemplated. But to others, those living in poor countries, perhaps, or those living in a manner closely attuned to nature, bat bathing is something that may be enjoyable and certainly provides entertainment. It might even be something you do on the way to getting dinner, if you eat bats. So, since Wikipedia is supposed to represent the world, and not just the developed world, I say it should stay in. Indeed I added it initially knowing it was not a common thing to do in developed countries. Listen, some new birds were discovered in South America and a new monkey was discovered in India. Should there be no articles about them because they are not in our backyards? Thanks, do what you want, but please consider what I have said.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As to "Neologism," I see that defined as "1) a new word, usage, or expression; 2) a meaningless word coined by a psychotic." As to 1) it is new, but only to you, with blinders on to the people in less developed nations. They know about this, but they don't have the computers or even the English language skills to get on here and fill in the details. Is it fair to wipe out the page under these circumstances? Is Wikipedia not designed to be inclusive? As to 2) well I hope you don't think this one applies in this case.</dd>

<dd>Hey, I see you are open minded. Therefore, I'll tell you all I know. First, this is not speculation. The bat bathing incident was described to me by a good friend of mine who lived for years in Guatemala. The description was vivid and the bat bather clearly enjoyed the experience. My friend was taken to the mouth of the cave by native Guatemalans who had previous experience bat bathing. So I did not make this up. I am reporting it. Its occurring in remote regions of Guatamala where people don't run off to write wiki pages doesn't mean it doesn't happen or it's not wikiworthy. So again, I thank you for keeping an open mind, and I hope this helps. --<a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegitimateAndEvenCompelling_4e11.html" title="User:LegitimateAndEvenCompelling">LegitimateAndEvenCompelling</a> 04:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
