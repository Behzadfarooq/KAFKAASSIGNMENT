<p>The result was <b>Keep</b> but some strong arguments for delete so a future relisting is a distinct possibility depending on other factors relating to the character.

There's nothing to the article that isn't already covered in the show's article.

<p>the dark enforcer was notable in his own right just as every characher from the show not just feedback the winner <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.201.25.96 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.201.25.96_d259.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.201.25.96">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Not notable enough for an article. A brief mention in the main article is all that is needed imo. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 13:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - TV title page is large enough that it does not warrant the inclusion of this article, as this article can stand alone. notable enough subject.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 15:24, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Not only a character on the TV show, but also a villian in Feedback's comic.--<a href="../../../u/n/o/User%7EUnopeneddoor_d710.html" title="User:Unopeneddoor">Unopeneddoor</a> 20:17, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>-The character stands out from the others because he was the only one who, even after being eliminated, remained on the series. He is probably going to be featured in Feedback's comic book, and therefore, he is noteable. Also, Steel Chambers' created <i>Iron Enforcer</i>, but Stan Lee helped to come up with the idea off <i>Dark</i> Enforcer...therefore, he is a character in the Marvel Comics Universe.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Colorblinddj (<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColorblinddj_1b3b.html" title="User talk:Colorblinddj">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Colorblinddj_899a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Colorblinddj">contribs</a>) 21:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The character is not part of the Marvel Universe. If the character even appears in the Feedback comic, something that's far from a settled question and thus irrelevant to the character's notability, he would be part of the Dark Horse universe. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:12, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> He was featured in both trailers of the superheroes, therefore it shows he is a main character.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.76.150.206 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.76.150.206_11b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.76.150.206">contribs</a>) 19:07, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Assuming he gets mentioned in the TV show and Feedback's comic he is probably notable. Otherwise, I'm not certain that's the case.<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaleAqua_4586.html" title="User:PaleAqua">PaleAqua</a> 21:45, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, even probably noteworthy outside of the show. Regardless, reality contestants?

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Hate to be a tool and down on someone else's article, but this person is not notible enough for an article. Being on a reality show, especially <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_to_be_a_Superhero__199e.html" title="Who Wants to be a Superhero?">Who Wants to be a Superhero?</a> does not yield the notibility for an article. Further, he is not a comics villain. The user(s) who made his article simply added the SHB incorrectly. Note that he's classified as a DC comics character. This is likely an error based on the similarity between the villain color and DC's color. (Don't get me started on how wrong that similarity is.) He was in the fake—I say, FAKE!—trailers because they didn't have anyone else to use. Viewers will note the other "villains" "problems" were "Chickman-man" (a giant baby chick) a fake asteroid and several pieces of footage ripped from other sci fi originals. These weren't perspective trailers for their possible sci fi films by any means. Finally, he appeared in his non-villainous costume at the end to congratulate Feedback. Feedback himself doesn't consider him his enemy. Bottomline, all we need is one article for the winner, who is and will be notible. That's not POV, either. These characters aren't even described in the reality show article. Honestly...I hate to say it, but if I've seen fancruft, this is it. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited</a>. 03:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: New posts at the bottom, okay? Also, it was performance on a reality show. They hired actors as prisons, too. You think they'll call Dot back and draw her into ther comic? Gees.

<li>No one's explained why his significance <i>to the show</i> makes him notable. The original proposal still stands despite those arguments, doesn't it?

<ul>
<li>Hmm. Good point. He's still just a fictional persona developed specifically for a reality show. There's no solid confirmation he'll be appearing outside that format and, if anything, his finally appearance without the villain costume could imply that they're actually done with him. Whatever the result, I'm game for seeing this through. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited</a>. 23:50, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
