<p>This page is only hanging on by a thread. it's only justification for being in existance is for three songs, one which was at number forty nine on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart, and the other two were number ones in 1979 on the Hot Dance/Music Club Play Chart. This article is WAY too short. It is a waste of space. Normally I will look for alternatives, but this article has no external links, and two ambiguous wikipedia links. The article is rarely viewed, and has been edited minimal times. It should be deleted, in my opinion. <a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 11:06, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Making the charts qualifies the subject, per <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">WP:NMG</a>. However, the stub needs to be properly sourced and expanded. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 11:23, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Article qualifies per <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">WP:NMG</a>. Moreover, nominator for deletion has (several times) redirected <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voyage.html" title="Voyage">Voyage</a> (a disambiguation page} to <a href="../../../i/n/s/Voyage%7E_Inspired_by_Jules_Verne_66e2.html" title="Voyage: Inspired by Jules Verne">Voyage: Inspired by Jules Verne</a>, an article that he proudly displays on his User Page as one to which he contributed (also see edit history of "Voyage"). I question his motivation for nominating <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voyage_%28band%29.html" title="Voyage (band)">Voyage (band)</a> for deletion, as it is obvious he wants the search term "Voyage" to point directly to his chosen article, rather than to a disambiguation page. Further discussion is also on my (and Paaerduag's) Talk pages. -- <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricorbit_f0c3.html" title="User:Ericorbit">eo</a> 11:40, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am REALLY sorry about this misunderstanding everyone. I thought that if there were two articles sharing a common name and that one article was larger and the other was tiny, the major article popped up when the common name was typed into search, and then there was a link in italics to the smaller article. 'eo' seems to think this is wrong, and perhaps it is. anyway, that IS NOT my reason for nominating 'voyage (band)' for deletion. Voyage (band) is a stub, and it is only because of its name similarity to the article that I created, about the Voyage PC game, that i noticed that it is incredibly short and probably not a worthy article. it may have 3 songs, but honestly, is it worth keeping, seeming that it doesn't even have a meagre 5 lines? in my opinion, it is not worth keeping. I swear that this is not a vendetta against the article or its creators, but merely a justified AFD based on the article itself. Please continue imputing your opinions. --<a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 12:15, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. They've had hits, that's good enough for me. Article shouldn't be deleted just because it's brief - a request for expansion should be put there if its brevity causes offence. In terms of inclusion, they easily meet notability criteria. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 13:08, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Band is clearly notable. That something is a stub is in no way a reason for deletion. If you think the article lacks content, it's time to research or request expansion, not time to delete. GassyGuy 14:14, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> By the way, before the <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voyage.html" title="Voyage">Voyage</a> disamiguation page was vandalized the first time around, there had been several entries on the page. I added two of those back, so I hope this will help Paaerduag make an easier decision about the merits of having it as a disambiguation page as opposed to a redirect.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's paaerduag here, the person who started this AFD. I know that the article complies with WP:MUSIC, and people keep saying that the band is notable. why, then, is it's page so short? surely such a famous band deserves more than a few lines? that is why i question exactly how famous this band is. I, personally, have never heard it referenced in pop culture. now maybe that's because I don't get out enough, or maybe it's because it isn't that famous anymore. I understand the above comments, but is this article really serving a purpose? I mean, an article should provide a DECENT amount of information. this provides minimal. if it is truly a famous band, why not expand? but right now it seems remarkably unremarkable. --<a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 09:39, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Just becasue it's short doesn't mean it should be deleted. It can just be expanded when someone familiar with the subject comes along. And really, that's nice that you haven't heard of them, but that also doesn't qualify for deleteion.... <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThankyoubaby_40b3.html" title="User:Thankyoubaby">Thankyoubaby</a> 15:38, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. The quality or length of the current article is not of the slightest relevance. And AfD addresses whether the topic itself is notable. I think I vaguely remember hearing of this band some years ago, personally, but whatever radio station Paaerduag or I happened to have tuned to doesn't matter if they had some decent chart showings, which they seem to have. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 17:31, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
