<li><b>Comment</b> - Having authored articles in such publications as the New York Times and the Economist is, in my opinion, certainly enough to establish notability for a Wikipedia article, regardless of the greenlighting issue. The quality of such publications sets journalists whose articles they publish above the herd. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 22:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Being a columnist would be a different matter, but the fraternity of people who've published one NYT article is rather large. The WP:BIO criteria for authors seems to be reviews or awards; for a journalist, determining notability should be much the same. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 22:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, because there are oh so many reviews of newspaper articles. And <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> paper - the fact that there are a lot of notable journalists does not mean we should cover fewer of them. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 00:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, he's published six New York Times articles, not one. Also two Economist articles, two Slate articles, a wealth of stuff in MacWorld, and a bunch of things for Wired News.

<li><b>Delete.</b> It's difficult to search for media coverage ABOUT a journalist, because google turns up so much BY him. But I'm not seeing very much written about this person, and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requires significant writing about him. Even in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenlighting.html" title="Greenlighting">greenlighting</a>, which is his strongest claim to notability, I'm not finding examples of anyone but himself writing about his role in it. Of course, someone else might come up with the sources I'm not seeing. -<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 22:39, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What? Journalists tend to be more notable for their own contributions than what people write about them. I know of very few who would pass notability on the grounds of other people writing about them. But that's OK, since "has written for the New York Times" tends to be pretty good. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 00:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Let me repeat the argument I gave in the past two VfDs: Media sources often publish no information about who its authors are, other than their byline. Wikipedia articles about journalists allow a transparency that otherwise might not exist. At a time when even our most respected media sources, such as the New York Times, are being called out for not properly investigating <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/opinion/28pubed.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/opinion/28pubed.html" rel="nofollow">the ties and backgrounds of its writers</a>, is Wikipedia not a valid source for looking up more information on the backgrounds of the people who are shaping our impressions of the news? Wikipedia is not a printed encyclopedia. More information is better. If even one person who wants to know more about Farivar or any other writer, including background that might influence their writing on a particular topic, gets that information from Wikipedia, it has served its purpose. Wikipedia is not Who's Who. It should be expansive. <a href="../../../j/s/n/User%7EJsnell_4a6e.html" title="User:Jsnell">Jsnell</a> 17:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because a media source doesn't publish information about its authors, doesn't mean Wikipedia fills that niche; <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a> of journalists or anything else. Just like any other journalist, until Farivar receives "multiple independent reviews of or awards for (his) work", or fulfills any of the other <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines, he is simply not notable enough for his own article. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 20:03, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The previous keep vote has no grounding in Wikipedia's policies. We do not compromise our notability guidelines to combat potentially false information in other mediums. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 00:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We compromise our notability guidelines whenever we feel like it - that's why their guidelines, not policies. Furthermore, it's clearly the case that the author guidelines are poor choices for journalists, considering the paucity of meta-reporting. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 02:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Out of curiosity, are you referring to something other than the greelighting hoax as a "significant event in the history of the evolution of the journalistic profession"? <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 05:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The new ability of how using the internet a small group of individuals acting with discipline can rapidly create out of nothing news and cultural trends that are then treated and adopted as genuine, and the detailing of how this is done is a noteworthy event in journalism. It never happenned before, the sudden change in the nature information flow in past decade made it possible. It's an evolution. The person who wrote the article on how such a thing is done is then a noteworthy contributor. There it is. Normalphil 05:30, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The method is now prooven. Some one can use it as a template to accomplish some other end than a joke (example; net-roots political campaign). The public on the recieving end can have the ability to site greenlighting and be forarmed against such manipulations of information. Normalphil 06:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Considering the failure and almost total lack of media coverage of the hoax, I wouldn't exactly say the method was "proven". <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 11:34, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Because a person caught on, and had access to the public forum.
