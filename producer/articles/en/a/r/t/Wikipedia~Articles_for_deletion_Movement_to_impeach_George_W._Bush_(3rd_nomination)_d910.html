<li><b>Keep</b>. It is easily verifiable that there us a movement to impeach Bush. Even if it is purely partisan (and I think the reality is more complex than that), that needs to be documented. There's no Wikipedia rule that only movements which Congress gets involved in get to be documented.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm the initiator of this request (sorry I didn't format afd correctly - thanks for fixing it wafulz). This article reads like an editorial or a partisan blog (left or right). This isn't a movement like Civil Rights Movement or even something small, it is a highly partisan effort. If congress takes this up in even a minor way, then document it. Right now, this is just a purely POV effort that belongs on Kos or some other political web site. 72.255.99.114 02:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is an argument that has been addressed countless times in the talk page - where else on Wikipedia do we document efforts to impeach GWB? Please use the talk page as a first step, and also review prior AfD discussions, as was suggested before making an AfD. Also, the article does not "read like an editorial of a partisan blog" nor is it a "partisan effort", many people on both sides of the isle have worked hard on it over many years time. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 03:17, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think there is a distinction between <i>NPOV</i> and <i>fair and ballanced</i>. NPOV is the use of neutral language. It is easy to talk about a partisan issue in a neutral tone. <i>Fair and ballanced</i> is where you try to represent both sides equally. But what does that mean? Do you give both sides equal time? Do you give each side equal time proportional to their contribution? After all the 'pro bush' side is not participating in the 'debate'. What if their are multiple sides, how do we calculate what is the right ballance? NPOV is something that can be achieved, it can be argued at the level of individual sentences and phrases. Fair and ballanced is just a matter of opinion. We will never satisfy everyone with such a rule rule, so wikipedia doesn't have it, and rightly so. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzie_9cfb.html" title="User:Mozzie">Mozzie</a> 23:50, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. (What the heck is a "speedy keep"?) Skimming over it (I agree it's too long), my assessment is, while this article may need NPOV improvements, it doesn't seem to be an article <i>promoting</i> the movement. Rather, it appears (to me) to be an article <i>about</i> the movement. Articles <i>about</i> a partisan effort are still valid for an encyclopedia. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 03:22, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's an awfully slanted article because of its reliance on pro-impeachment sourcing and lack of anti-impeachment sourcing. But POV cases are never hopeless. Maybe I missed it, but I didn't catch anything in the entire, looooooong article casting doubt on the move to impeach or showing that it is advocated only by a fringe of the Democratic party in Congress. The article is warped. Nevertheless, deleting it isn't the answer, straightening it out is.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:04, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, it's a pretty shoddy looking page...and doesn't really justify its own existence. It basically just rattles off opinions of individuals ad infinite...which may violate Wikipedia's provision on indiscriminate information, which is all that the page really is. There isn't really much information about the "Movement to Impeach Bush"...just people that want to. The opinions of his political opponents don't necessarily comprise a movement, nor justify its own article.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkBirdDuke_b901.html" title="User:MonkBirdDuke">MonkBirdDuke</a> 08:31, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article is about a specific movement. Stuff that isn't about the movement doesn't belong in the article. Criticisms of the movement do belong in the article. A lack of inclusion of criticism is a fixable POV problem, not reason to delete. Being of a short-term nature isn't reason to delete either, especially since any movement to impeach a president will have historical relevance in the future. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 20:45, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have come across this entry, courtesy Google, in my research on the subject of impeachment, and found the content the most comprehensive of all the Search finds I have checked so far. The content is factual and balanced in listing pro-con views on the subject. The entry may be revised or complemented, but should NOT be deleted. I strongly recommend that the entry be removed from the deletion candidacy.</p>

<li><b>Keep due to previous afd discussion</b> - While I'm not sure about the article has a netural POV, the bottom line is that this article has already survived the AFD process. So unless something significant has changed it should be kept for consistency with the prior discussions. Once a decision on afd is made it's a bad idea to keep renominating the article unless something major has changed; otherwise there's no actual closure from these discussions. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:39, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is notable per the many scientific polls showing public report in the 30's, about the same level as his present approval rating, and numerous articles abut it in national media. In the U.S. House of Representatives, 36 co-sponsors of impeachment resolution H. Res. 635. Ninety- something references. It is extremely unlikely to happen without some changes in the House and Senate and even then some "smoking gun" beyond what is cited so far as grounds. NPOV or unsupported statements should be deleted or fixed, and arguments against impeachment should be included, even if by proponents.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:04, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Clearly this article will be kept, but I find it pretty disturbing. It smells like a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_fork_160a.html" title="WP:POV fork">POV fork</a>. Even a well-sourced repository of complaints about Bush is...a repository of complaints about Bush. The "impeachment resolutions" are presented as much more high-profile than they really are. The vast majority of even the most liberal groups don't advocate anything of the sort. Things like "The ImpeachBush.org website claims to have collected over 736,000 signatures (as of September 25, 2006) on a petition to impeach Bush. None are known to have been created to oppose it" feel like <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wikipedia%7EWeasel_words_3d79.html" title="Wikipedia:Weasel words">weasel words</a> -- could the reason be, perhaps, that this movement is so low-profile that no one would bother to oppose it? I don't see any petitions opposing the movement for the violent overthrow of the US government either -- is this evidence for the movement's success? Of course not. The "rationales for impeachment" section is no better -- this title really just seems to be an excuse to make the article Why Bush sucks and not have it deleted. I am by no means a fan of Bush, but I am not a fan of weaseling POV into Wikipedia either. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 02:29, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I see "POV fork" thrown around quite often in AfD's -- but you can't label it a "fork" without saying where it forked <i>from</i>. If not here, where else on Wikipedia do we document the people and organizations who want to impeach GWB? If we did it in the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> article, it would be too large and would justify a <i>Main article</i> split. That's all this is. In fact, this article was originally created (year or two ago) because the amount of material was overwhelming the GWB article causing a POV unbalance in that article. There was no intentional foul-play ("POV fork") by anyone it just evolved organically like most articles on Wikipedia do when the subject matter becomes long. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 03:44, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps the idea behind POV forking needs some explination. It is where two different parties disagree on a topic so one starts up a new page to express their views. For this article to be a POV fork there would have to be another page on the movement to impeach President Bush.

By the way, I personally disagree with almost all the politics of the people described in the article, but I am aware that they are really out there, really vocal, and they have had a lot of activity in the public life of our country. maybe call the article <b>"Campaigns to Initiate Impeachment Proceedings Against President George W.

<li><b>Delete:</b> This article is just a political maneuver, will we need articles for every single politically driven crusade? This would never, ever, make it into an off-line encyclopedia. It's not even a real movement, just a bunch of opinions. 148.63.236.141 01:07, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To add to my above comment, looking at the history of this article, it also looks like its been carefully kept POV for a long time. The previous AFD discussion also has comments regardings pov, yet when someone tries to edit it, they get yanked unless they are "the movement". This article belongs on a blog. 148.63.236.141 01:09, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Where on Wikipedia do you suggest editors document the people and activities and headline news stories about this topic? Or do you propose we play whack-a-mole and remove it whenever it pops up in other articles (like it used to before this article was created)? Who do you propose will monitor this whack-a-mole activity, should we have a special Project set up for the purposes of censoring this information from all Wikipedia articles? Or do you think it makes sense to isolate it into a single location where it can properly be monitored? In other words, these activities are real, they exist, people will write about them, you can't stop that - but you can isolate and monitor it. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 17:18, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The wack-a-mole argument does make sense, at least its in one place. Just reading the comments here (many below) shows how partisan wiki-editing is. 148.63.236.141 01:04, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No need to politicize it. That is all these AfD's really are, now, stirring up the pot, a bureaucratic nuisance.

<li><b>Keep</b> even if the idea of impeaching George W. Bush, having an article on this notable, verifiable movement is <i>not</i> POV.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. Wiki's 'book burners', who can't compete in the marketplace of ideas are at it again. The movement exists. It's well documented. IMHO, AfD nominations like this, and the one on Andy Stephenson are travesties and the ultimate abuse of Wikipedia. Reign this XXXX in before it destroys a great idea.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are people who advocate GW's impeachment, so this article shows what's been attempted so far.

<li><b>Keep</b> As a follower of current events and politics I think this article is most accurately and objectively described as a major campaign theme or party philosophy for an election cycle. My view of Keep v Delete on this is how it likely should be remembered after 2008 (since any of these efforts are moot after 2008).
