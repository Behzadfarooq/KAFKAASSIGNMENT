<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 9 clear "delete" votes to 19 "keep" votes (4 anonymous or probable sockpuppet votes discounted). While that would normally be considered an unambiguous "keep" decision, I find it in direct contradiction to Wikipedia established policy (which was carefully cited below). A few keep voters explicitly expressed that they understood the policy and found reason to request an exception in this case. The majority of keep voters appear from their comments to have voted in ignorance of the policy.</p>
<p>I am going to call this decision as a "no concensus" (which defaults to keep for now). All participants are encouraged to carefully review the relevant policies before voting and certainly before renewing this debate. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:57, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The film will eventually be made, and the article recreated, and untill then it serves as information about cast, etc. Many articles on Wikipedia are about things that have yet to happen, this is no different from the rest of them. <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrange_Goblin_9adb.html" title="User:Orange Goblin">Orange Goblin</a> 22:54, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, WP has many articles about "things that have yet to happen" but it's just too far out to have an article. 2007? Come on. At least let <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_%28movie%29_a01d.html" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (movie)">the fourth movie</a> come out first. There hasn't even been a big media deal about this yet, which is a possible qualification for future events/releases. Heck, they haven't really even gotten started for the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">sixth book</a> yet, let alone even the <i>fourth</i> movie. Information on the cast can be found on the actor/actress's own page, most of which can be accessed through the articles for the other four movies. Not only that, but nobody's officially been confirmed yet, AFAIK, except the director. Sure, we presume <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Radcliffe_e31f.html" title="Daniel Radcliffe">Daniel Radcliffe</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Watson_23a7.html" title="Emma Watson">Emma Watson</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Grint_0421.html" title="Rupert Grint">Rupert Grint</a>, and the rest will be coming back, but we don't know.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I understand the "crystal ball" argument, but I think the fact that this is an inevitable movie in a major series weighs more importantly.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- will remain notable for foreseeable future because of doubts as to whether the major cast will be able to return -- the further the movies slip behind chronological time, the harder it will be for the stars to avoid being overtaken by new, younger (and cheaper) ingenues --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 07:18, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: there will inevitably be information about this film which needs to be recorded and this is the best place to record it. I'm inclined to think that some of the worry about future events is over-blown: the preparation for a major event which fails to happen is likely to be just as encyclopedic as the event itself might have been, and writing the article months afterwards is bound to introduce inconsistencies and inaccuracy. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil</a> | <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhil_Boswell_f2d3.html" title="User talk:Phil Boswell">Talk</a> 09:19, May 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The movie is already in production and has a page on IMDb. Even if the movie isn't produced, its production and the reason for not being completed will be notable enough for Wikipedia. As for such an article being too speculative and too premature, what's the point in deleting it and then having to write it again?<a href="../../../k/o/s/User%7EKostja_51b8.html" title="User:Kostja">Kostja</a> <a href="../../../k/o/s/User_talk%7EKostja_aacb.html" title="User talk:Kostja">(Talk)</a> 12:06, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This movie will definately be made! And the notability outweighs crystalballery. The answer to crystalballery is not to delete, but to edit. I have put a list on the talk page on things that need to be addressed. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 14:27, Jun 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.This film will be made, its just a matter of time. The page can be updated when new information becomes available. <i>69.89.38.36</i></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDb_27b2.html" title="IMDb">IMDb</a> notes that the film is in "pre-production." Therefore, as per the What Wikipedia Is Not wording, planning or preparation is worthy of an article. I'm not voting yet because I'm not sure how reliable IMDb is in these matters. I just offer that for you to consume and think about. -<a href="../../../t/a/d/User%7ETadanisakari_b7a3.html" title="User:Tadanisakari">Tadanisakari</a> 06:45, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)

<li>IMDb isn't always reliable, but <a href="http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org" class="external text" title="http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org" rel="nofollow">The Leaky Cauldron</a> reported on this a few days ago, also confirming that Daniel Radcliffe is almost certainly going to sign on. Perhaps I should withdraw this request. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermione1980_7d5f.html" title="User:Hermione1980">Hermione</a><b><a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHermione1980_21b0.html" title="User talk:Hermione1980">1980</a></b> 13:10, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
