<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prospectus&amp;oldid=39524955" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prospectus&amp;oldid=39524955" rel="nofollow">Prospectus</a> in April, when working on <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_fund.html" title="Mutual fund">Mutual fund</a> and related articles. Such business-topic articles are poorly represented in Wikipedia. Prospectus (a legal/financial document issued by mutual funds, or is filed with the SEC by individual companies) was lumped together in the same article with school prospectus (sent to prospective university students). The latter was unfamiliar to me, as an American. However, I did a google search on "prospectus" and found it was a common term used, particularly in Europe. So, I split the two uses of "prospectus" into separate articles and created a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prospectus.html" title="Prospectus">disambiguation</a> page. I don't know a lot about <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prospectus_%28university%29.html" title="Prospectus (university)">prospectus (university)</a> but think it should be kept, to explain this use of the term as opposed to the financial/legal term. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 03:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to add, a Google search of "prospectus + mutual fund" returns 2,850,000 results, while a search of "prospectus + university" returns 27,500,000 results. So, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prospectus_%28university%29.html" title="Prospectus (university)">prospectus (university)</a> seems like something notable. I don't know anything to expand the article, though. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 04:48, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as dicdef, unless someone expands the article (possibly with the history of prospectus in universities?)--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 03:50, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Clearly notable, but that's not the issue. The article's a stub, but it's more than a dicdef. It would be nice if someone expanded it, but if we went around deleting all our stubs, we wouldn't have very many articles left! --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Mestel_2c0e.html" title="User:David.Mestel">David.Mestel</a> 05:51, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per David.Mestel and Kmf164. College/Universtity prospectus' are well-known in the UK and Europe. I would say possibly add it to articles that need attention as I'm pretty sure there are many users that are able to bring this article above stub status (possibly by a collaborative effort involving <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Universities_a389.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Universities">WikiProject Universities</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">WikiProject Schools</a>). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheJC_69d3.html" title="User:TheJC">TheJC</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheJC_cdb9.html" title="User talk:TheJC">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheJC_fef2.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheJC">contribs</a>) 08:18, 30 Jun 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> definitely notable, and as TheJC touched upon, prospectus' (prospecti?) are mass distributed by universities and private secondary schools. The article also shows potential to elevate beyond stub status, again per TheJC <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 08:52, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - While it's a stub at the moment, this can be more than a dicdef if someone were to go into detail about the sort of things that appear in prospectuses (prospecti?&#160;;-) ) in addition to Alternative Prospectuses that students of some colleges put out. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 09:16, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and rename</b> to something like Prospectus (education), since, as has been mentioned above, documents of this type are not restricted to universities -- they are also used by many other academic institutions, including colleges and private schools. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:48, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but rename per Haeleth's suggestion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems notable enough for mine. Eminent Australian lawyer and President of the Law Society. Lack of Google hits due to the fact that he died in 1987. Besides, the Google hits he does get include references in ministerial speeches at a lecture named in his honour. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 02:46, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Further to the above, I have read an article in the Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society published in 2000. He was the senior partner in Allen, Allen &amp; Hemsley, Australia's leading law firm. In her book <i>The Allens Affair</i>, Valerie Lawson wrote <i>Before the reign of Sir Norman Lethbridge Cowper, Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley was a club. A good, solid gentlemen's club where the door was bolted to all but family and friends. After Norman Cowper swept the dust from the club's corners, the door was thrown open to talent. Aliens became the hub of a wheel, a network, reaching out to the world. Good schools and the right attitude still counted. But what mattered most was hard work and driven talent. Under the reign of Cowper, from the 1930s to the late 1960s, nepotism gave way to brilliance, drudgery gave way to energy.</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm talking about the New South Wales Law Society. Your question would be better addressed to those who said <i>You're suggesting that a president of the Law Society is non-notable</i>, or <i>president of the Law Society is notable</i>. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>You said "he's not president of the highly-notable <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_Society_d4fc.html" title="Law Society">Law Society</a>", but there isn't only one Law Society, as that article says. He <i>was</i> president of the Law Society in his jurisdiction, which is notable. I see nothing to suggest that the people who said this was notable didn't understand perfectly well what "president of the Law Society" means - it is only delete votes that have suggested it could mean anything else, and at least one of those admitted that they didn't know what it was. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 11:27, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There is a video available at the homepage showcasing the features of the game, and Age of the Beast: Special Edition was demoed briefly at the Midwest Gaming Classic on June 3, 2006.

<p>Despite of what the 'Warning' says: Of course I came here because a friend told me that the Wikipedia entry of Age of the Beast might be deleted. And why shouldn't I make my voice heard&#160;?</p>
<p>Some Facts: There is something like a release date set: Though annouced for 2006, a release in 2007 is very likely going to happen. One got to consider it's a game by semi-professional independent programmers, not a big budget major company. There will be a commercial release for SEGA Dreamcast. It's announced as a Special Edition that will peacefully coexist next to the freeware download - but still with a pressed run of estimated 7000+ units.</p>
<p>As others already pointed out, there is a video available showcasing the game in action: <a href="http://www.senileteam.com/downloads.php?d=12" class="external free" title="http://www.senileteam.com/downloads.php?d=12" rel="nofollow">http://www.senileteam.com/downloads.php?d=12</a></p>
<p>Obviously the game is using all original graphics, sounds and music along with an extremely customizable and powerful 2D game engine. To really achieve commercial quality takes a good bit of time for a small group of people, working on the game in their spare time.</p>
<p>It's predecessor Beats of Rage was ported to an insane number of platforms (there even is an AMIGA and Nintendo DS port), and the SEGA Dreamcast version was downloaded several tenthousand times - alone from the website I am involved in (<a href="http://www.DCEvolution.net" class="external free" title="http://www.DCEvolution.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.DCEvolution.net</a>).</p>
<p>Three years after its initial release, Beats of Rage still sees updates (OpenBoR, Linux &amp; PSP port), and there still are several promising projects in the works based on the Beats of Rage game engine:</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It's an engine evolution and spiritual sequel of a game that has had millions of downloads. The video preview has been downloaded thousands of times, and the commercial special edition was previewed at one of the largest classic gaming conventions around as I mentioned above.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just because a game is not mainstream, doesn't make the fanbase restricted. Age of the Beast is one of the most anticipated games in the retro gaming community, and the retro gaming community makes up a large portion of the regular gaming community. The game was listed in the popular UK print magazine Retrogamer in issue number 8 as being one of the most anticipated upcoming games for the Sega Dreamcast. This article should have been tagged for notability instead of being tagged for deletion, because with a small bit of article expansion, acceptable references can be made that will show that the game is notable for inclusion on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaFox_390e.html" title="User:MetaFox">MetaFox</a> 19:51, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I quote: <i>"The Chronicles of Awe is a fan fiction on the Lionhead Discussion Boards. It is writen by a happy senior member named HFB."</i> I think that pretty much speaks for itself; fan fiction is very, very rarely notable, and there's nothing to indicate that this instance of it is somehow exceptional.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see three pages listed at the top, in addition to Guam rivers.

That's the article I'm really here voting to keep; in addition to Mass. islands now that I see it up there.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. There is no real connection between any of the articles nominated other than that they are all lists. The nominations for each should be separate as the debate will be rather disorganised causing possible difficulties for the admins. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 09:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The five lists list things that are certainly finite. Obviously, there is not an infinite number of rivers in Guam nor an infinite number of islands in Massachusetts, so, the lists are useful and can be expanded with further info. <a href="../../../a/f/o/User%7EAfonso_Silva_8531.html" title="User:Afonso Silva">Afonso Silva</a> 11:23, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete All</b> I can't question the lists as being useful or finite to particular editors. I do question the basic notability and encyclopedic relevance of the articles, which I believe is to the point. These articles only exist as lists, since if you stubbed the individual rivers there'd be no reason to have the stubs at all. I have a toolbox that's been very useful to me (and has finite contents), but I don't see how that rates inclusion in WP. (sorry for the belated appearance, I wasn't aware that it was done for afd nominators to also vote on their afds.) <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 15:12, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure I understand your point. Are you saying that there's nothing verifiable or notable about any of the redlinked items in any of the unreleated lists you've proposed for deletion? Or are you saying that there's not content to these lists orther than being lists? I'm afraid your toolbox example does not seem to be very clear; your garage toolbox has done little to help editors on wikipedia, and would continue to be useless if it were included here - are you saying that these lists are also not helpful to finding articles to create and helping editors? There would seem to be quite a bit more to some of these lists than just 'a list' as well; the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_canals_in_the_United_States_0964.html" title="List of canals in the United States">List of canals in the United States</a> is grouped by canal functionality and operating state and also has some notations included as well. Could you please exapnd on your point a little further? I'm trying to understand your position. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 15:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I'm also a little concerned that the discussion here is getting a little fragmented since each list would appear to have different problems; and with the exception of the insular/guam issue - they're all unrealted. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 15:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm saying the articles listed for deletion only exist as lists. There's no notability stated or implied for any of the listed items, except as readers apparently have for them on a personal basis. I point out there's no reason at all to have articles on most of the individual items, they only have relevance as items on a list. And being on a list does not make them notable, nor are lists intrinsically notable. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 15:53, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm still not sure of your point here: 75% of the items in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_canals_in_the_United_States_0964.html" title="List of canals in the United States">List of canals in the United States</a> already have articles which are more than established. I could probably create articles for the remainder that meet the notability standards for geographic locations fairly easily. The list complies with the <i>guidelines</i> at <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTS_2571.html" title="WP:LISTS">WP:LISTS</a>. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of geographical lists along similar lines. Again, what is your guideline for the notability of a list? All items must be notable? Most? Which guidelines are you using? Please don't think I'm being combative - that's not my intent, I'm simply trying to understand where you're coming from.

Wikipedia is meant to be an impartial observer, but with no solid information yet as to what Eon8 is, anything written in this article is mere speculation and conjecture that cannot be independently verified by anyone.

<dd>I really don't think all this waiting business is the way to do things. We don't customarily keep things because they <i>might</i> turn out to be significant; in fact, we pretty much do the exact opposite! As I said, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Restoring the article if it turns out to be significant is a piece of cake. Ain't no thing. Right now, it's just a thing on the web, and not even a thing that everyone's talking about -- sure, it gets some blog action, but there's a reason why "stuff some guys said on their blogs" is not generally accepted as a Wikipedia source. It may turn out to be significant, but it may not. Point is, we don't know, which pretty much underlines the fact that <i>it is not yet significant</i>. The fact that a lot of us are clearly intrigued by it speaks well of these guys' ability to get people interested, but that doesn't make this site encyclopedic material. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 18:48, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Clarification</b> Just to clarify, even if the website does turn out to be sufficiently notable for an encyclopedia, I would STILL strongly recommend as a matter of principle that admins ban the IPs of the creators - at least for a long period of time if not permanently.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> the article is problematic on several levels. Yes, there is a Pseudoepigraphical book called <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Enoch_2b5d.html" title="Book of Enoch">Enoch</a> (which survives largely in Ethopic [Ge'ez] versions); however, no credible scholar refers to this as "the lost book of Enoch." Furthermore, no credible scholar would state that the book "may have been written by the Biblical prophet Enoch ben Jared, who was an ancestor of Noah." These books (the Pseudoepigrapha) were literary works of the&#160;:Hellenistic period.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is a thoroughly referenced article, and requires its own page for the following reasons:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>1. As the article notes, the existing <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Enoch_2b5d.html" title="Book of Enoch">Book of Enoch</a> may or may not be the book referenced in the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_of_Jude_1ffb.html" title="Epistle of Jude">Epistle of Jude</a>.</li>
<li>2. I dispute the assertion that it is "accepted scholarship" that the two books are identical. To the contrary, there's a strong body of evidence that the existing <i>Book of Enoch</i> is <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudepigraphal.html" title="Pseudepigraphal">pseudepigraphal</a>. If so, the lost book and the pseudepigraphal book are entirely unalike. Note new <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> link confirming this position.</li>
<li>3. If the two books are the same -- a question unresolvable by modern scholarship -- the article makes clear the possibility.</li>
<li>4. Moreover, this is a daughter article to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_books_of_the_Old_Testament_e56d.html" title="Lost books of the Old Testament">Lost books of the Old Testament</a>. Redirecting it back to the parent would be comparable to redirecting all the individual entries for Biblical books (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Genesis_35b0.html" title="Book of Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>, et al) back to <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. These books are individually notable.</li>
<li>5. Re: current lack of scholarly links. This is a growing article. Note that it's only a day old. Stub it, if you believe it needs more work, but deleting an article that is already this thorough because it's not yet thorough enough is premature, at best.</li>
<li>6. Finally, if editors wish to discuss the possibility of the books being identical, the place to do that is within this article. Deleting the article makes that exercise impossible. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">The Editrix</a> 09:08, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

None of the links provided suggest that anyone has a serious, scholarly opinion that there is an additional "Lost Book of Enoch" that is different than 1 Enoch. Claiming that because Enoch 1 is <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudepigraphal.html" title="Pseudepigraphal">pseudepigraphal</a> and thus cannot be this so-called "Lost Book of Enoch" is a straw-man argument. Regardless of the true authorship of Enoch 1, the author of Jude apparently accepted it as scriptural and referenced it in his work; not surprising if taken in the historical context of when Jude was written. A discussion of whether or or not there is an additional Book of Enoch that differs from 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, or 3 Enoch is a disscussion for a forum or message board, not a Wikipedia article. I would say redirect to 1 Enoch but since this was <a href="http://www.heaven.net.nz/writings/enoch.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.heaven.net.nz/writings/enoch.htm" rel="nofollow">found</a> in 1773, the title would be a misnomer.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:03, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: By itself, my remark about the article’s title is insufficient for a deletion. However, as Wikipedia already has several articles on legitimate Enochic literature, the title Lost Book of Enoch is misleading at best and sensationalistic at worst.<br />
Please note the following points:<br />
<b>1.</b> If this book of Enoch is separate from the known books of <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enoch.html" title="Enoch">Enoch</a>, and exists only in the short citation found in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/d/Jude.html" title="Jude">Jude</a> 14-15), as <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">User:TheEditrix</a> asserts; then, the book in question is hypothetical. That is, it exists only in theoretical form (the theory being: Jude had a book called “Enoch” that has since been lost).<br />
<b>2.</b> The presumption that Jude had a lost book of “Enoch” is problematic for several reasons. This is because the source cited by Jude is Enoch himself, and not a book. Thus, it remains in the realm of possibility that Jude was citing an oral tradition ascribed to Enoch, or (more probable), that he is citing a book in which the character of Enoch was a major player. The best example of this second possibility is the <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudepigraphical.html" title="Pseudepigraphical">pseudepigraphical</a> book of <a href="../../../j/u/b/Jubilees.html" title="Jubilees">Jubilees</a>, where Enoch plays a role.<br />
<b>3.</b> To state that the historical Enoch “may have been the author” sidesteps not only the above considerations, but also the basic question of whether Enoch ever existed in history (many scholars view the character as a mythical figure). Furthermore, the statement stands in stark contrast to the overwhelming scholarly opinion regarding Pseudoephigraphic writing during the Hellenistic and early Roman periods (i.e. the period of the second Temple of Jerusalem). The production of literature ascribed to biblical characters was commonplace during this time period. Biblical characters (like Enoch) who lived before the time of Moses, became popular “authors” in the third, second and first centuries BCE. While it is safe to say that Enoch is the “traditional” author of a particular text, it is improper for an encyclopedia entry to state that he “may” have<br />
<b>4.</b> Finally, considering that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">User:TheEditrix</a> is dealing with a theoretical book cited only in the New Testament epistle of Jude, it is problematic that no New Testament scholarly works are cited. To deal with a “Lost Book of Enoch” that only presently exists in Jude 14-15, one must begin by examining Jude 14-15. What can New Testament scholarship tell us? In terms of textual-criticism; do all ancient manuscripts of the NT include the Enoch quote? Are there any textual variations? Are there anomalies in the Greek of the NT that would indicate a translation from a Hebrew or Aramaic source? Does the Greek quotation match up with any present Greek translations of Enochic texts known to date?<br />
<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">User:TheEditrix</a>, I am not trying to dissuade you from conducting research into extra-canonical biblical literature (and I hope you find my criticism constructive); however, the article as it stands represents <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and does not qualify as an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../e/m/-/User%7EEm-jay-es_9812.html" title="User:Em-jay-es"><span style="background:#006400; size:2; color:#DCDCDC;"><i>Em-jay-es</i></span></a> 20:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's still undergoing editing and linking, and I'm still adding links to source information, of which there is MUCH. At WORST it's a stub. Not a delete.

<li><b>Comment</b> Based on info at <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Backfire_%28FBI%29_19d2.html" title="Operation Backfire (FBI)">Operation Backfire (FBI)</a> and the external link, the 2006 date is in fact a typo for 2005. However, as I have no knowledge at all about this Operation and don't feel I have any reasonable way of assessing this fellow's notability etc., I'll refrain from casting an opinion as to deletion.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Indeed, a similar article was already merged into this author's own personal page ... <i>by you</i>, right? Weren't <i>you</i> the one who merged this book's page into the author's page? And then you tried to nominate this page for "speedy deletion" and were told that you can't nominate a page for "speedy deletion" on the grounds that it had previously been deleted, unless it had actually been deleted. It hadn't been. It had simply been merged. I don't think a nominating editor can use his/her own previous merging of an article as justification for deleting the article, can they? That's basically just saying, "This page should be deleted so that I can get what I want." And as I mentioned on the talk page, I think this book deserves its own page apart from her other books because this is the one <i>truly notable</i> book she ever wrote. See the third-party source I quote from that mentions this book was top of the Publisher's Weekly list for eleven straight weeks. I think that's pretty notable. None of her other books achieved that kind of success. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 08:05, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

I think it is bad faith on his/her part that he/she has continually accused me of being part of "some advocacy group" or of making money off of ACIM, claiming that these things are the only reason I have any interest in seeing to it that he/she doesn't have every ACIM-related article deleted. This person does not understand that deletion nominations are not the place for resolving disputes over article content. Read his arguments for the deletion of Big Brother. This person seems to be prudish. He/she didn't want Big Brother Season 6 to have an article because he/she didn't think it was notable, all the while ignoring the fact that just about every mainstream major show is allowed a page on Wikipedia.

<dd>Further comment. The article describes a political plan that is only available by <i>applying</i> to receive it via a Gmail address. The article does not describe the plan in any detail. The plan has not been written about in any major media. Most of the linked sources are general and irrelevant. The only place the plan has even been discussed is astroturfing in blog comments. If it exists and is reaching opinion makers, it would have been talked about by now, but Technorati shows no current discussion. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:28, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Further, if you agree this is not an indiscriminate collection of data (and it's really not!) the doubt over verifiability is not in itself a reason to delete. The list can be edited and made better, for example i just added the three book references i quoted above. Verifiability is indeed a problem, as it always is with recent history. Perhaps the introductory paragraph describing criteria for inclusion can be improved with your help? <a href="../../../m/u/j/User%7EMujinga_2c8b.html" title="User:Mujinga">Mujinga</a> 10:22, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't agree with the argument "such and such does not comply with policy, so this shouldn't have to either". As I said, each and every entry has to be verifiable. With most Wikipedia lists the entries have their own article, which should provide verification for inclusion on the list. Almost all of these entries have no article, so the verification must be in this article. I'm in favour of removing the redlinks from those other lists if they have been there more than a few days.</dd>
<dd>The indiscriminate argument could be gotten over with a good introductory paragraph, which I can help with if the article survives.</dd>
<dd>The bottom line though is that without verification, the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states that <i>if an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic</i>. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin1243_1326.html" title="User:Kevin1243">Kevin</a> 10:46, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also don't agree with the argument "such and such does not comply with policy, so this shouldn't have to either". My argument was actually that I don't believe every item on a list needs to be independently verifiable and I gave the other lists as examples, but strictly speaking you are correct on this point and actually for this article I can see that this criterion helps prevent vandalism.</dd>
<dd>As I hoped you noticed, I am busy adding some "reputable, reliable, third-party sources" to the article in a <b>References</b> section. For example, <i>3672 La Free Story</i> has a list of about 100 systems on page 187. We will ignore the systems' own websites for now even though these could be argued to be official sites operating in the same way as artists' websites do and they often contain fotos, writings, music and other documentation. I could add external links which document groupings of sound systems such as <a href="http://www.bass23.org/about.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bass23.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">Brighton Alliance of sound systems</a> and <a href="http://www.freetekno.cz" class="external text" title="http://www.freetekno.cz" rel="nofollow">Czech Free Tekno</a>. Also, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a> states that <i>Another good source is Discogs (<a href="http://www.discogs.com" class="external free" title="http://www.discogs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.discogs.com</a>)</i>, useful here because many sound systems (eg <a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Metek" class="external text" title="http://www.discogs.com/label/Metek" rel="nofollow">Metek</a> or <a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Foxtanz" class="external text" title="http://www.discogs.com/label/Foxtanz" rel="nofollow">Foxtanz</a>)have eponymous record labels. With the addition of such verification I think that the list can stay. <a href="../../../m/u/j/User%7EMujinga_2c8b.html" title="User:Mujinga">Mujinga</a> 11:33, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> (or <b>delete</b> if Tree Biting Conspiracy is right). If someone wants to write a real article about these, nothing is lost in having them start from an empty page. Also, a sonnet is only 14 lines. If you go so deep as to be able to write an extensive article about that, I think wikibooks is the place.

<li><s><b>No vote yet</b></s> on the general series. <b>Strong keep</b> any that have text besides the template and source. I assume all of these are already at Wikisource. The "analysis" link contained in the stubs I visited suggests that each of these articles could be fleshed out. The noteworthiness of each separate sonnet seems beyond doubt to me. Not sure I agree with some comments that say that it would be no harder to write articles about the sonnets if the pages that now contain only a template and the source text are removed; the template and text are indeed a start. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:22, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

It is much easier to work collaboratively on these if the shells are set up and then additional work done. There are 154 to do, and it is much easier to keep the format consistent if they are done in batches like this. And, yes, I expect you will see many of the existing articles grow as the project continues to broaden and deepen.

<li><b>Call me biased, but keep all</b> - I added these sonnet texts myself, and, not unexpectedly, I think they ought to stay. Having the sonnet's text online is better than having nothing, especially considering their significance to classical English literature. It would be embarrassing for Wikipedia to post links to all 154 sonnets, only to have 90% of them completely missing. Some of you may disagree, but my personal opinion of "getting it right," as Tychocat called for, is getting it done right, not getting it done fast. Of course it's not going to be done in a day. No one is suggesting that and I think the very fact that Wikipedia has stub templates implies that some articles are going to start out wanting. I understand that Wikisource already has the same content, but the fact remains that Wikipedia gets boatloads more traffic than Wikisource, and if I were to search Wikipedia for an article on a certain Shakespearean sonnet, I'd rather find the sonnet's bare text than nothing at all. The whole point of Wikipedia is for different people to add, little by little, and slowly expand and improve content. If all I have time to do right now is post the sonnet texts, that's certainly better than waiting for 154 individual people to write 154 individual articles, one at a time. So what if the synopses, analyses, and other encyclopedic content isn't all going to be written <i>en masse</i>, straight away? --Sean Parmelee 19:53, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> for now, good faith stubs. Sean Parmelee, I would suggest focusing on actually turning your stubs into real stubs. I.e. having at least one or two sentences in the body of the article and having some context such as "Sonnet 17 is the 17th sonnet of 154 known <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare%27s_sonnets.html" title="Shakespeare's sonnets">shakespeare's sonnets</a>."--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 21:45, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Here's the deal.</b> Eventually I am going to create articles for <i>all</i> of the sonnets. I usually get about 1 or 2 a day. So, there's really no point in deleting them, folks. <b>Keep them.</b> In a month or two each page will be back anyway. So, if you want to delete them, fine. But I'd rather you didn't because it makes it alot easier for me not having to re-write all of the skeleton. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 22:40, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>So far, Adam's been in the lead on this, the project was his brainchild, but he's had a bunch of collaborators in the project - Sean is helping, I've futzed around with a couple, Stumps and others have added bits and pieces. It is easier to collaborate with the template set up so we can look at the active editing and all kibbitz. Some of these are pretty raw stubs, some are starting to really develop, most are still empty. But a ton has been done in the last month, and I think the activity is attracting a number of new people to WikiProject Poetry. If this sits in Adam's userpages, we lose many of these benefits, and we'd have to completely redo the template to fit the userspace instead of the article placement. So, sticking it in one user's space would be, in my mind, very un-wiki. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 00:32, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - If we can agree to keep the sonnets up, I think a standardized template needs to be established first, and all existing sonnet pages (stub or otherwise) need to be edited to conform to that standard before I or anyone else creates any text-only articles or any full articles. I noticed that the WikiProject Poetry page suggests using Sonnet 1 as just such a template, but I just wanted to make sure, if indeed Adam is going to contribute quite a great deal of time and effort, that he doesn't waste his time using a template that will only be modified later. As a side note, I personally would be willing (and planned from the start) to contribute some quantity of articles detailing the individual Shakespearean sonnets. Hopefully there is some way to coordinate contributors' efforts before there is any unneeded overlap. --00:52, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>K-fo is a commonly used term in the south of Ireland localised to the areas of cork city and Dungarvan, county waterford and hence is a valid entry in wikipedia's library. Few relevant google pages are too be expected as Dungarvan is only a small town in a small county and the term "K-fo", although well known in this region, is still reletavely new so shouldn't be diregarded so easily.

<dd>Firstly, I think people are mistaking this for an article about a website, possibly because of the article's name. It is not - it is about a subscription service/system, which <i>happens to have</i> a website.

<dd>TotalGaming.net's notability rides on the fact that it is a commercially-successful <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_distribution.html" title="Digital distribution">digital distribution</a> systems for computer video games (not something founded with <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venture_capital.html" title="Venture capital">venture capital</a> that didn't actually provide a viable product). It was in production before Valve had even announced their offering, and it has been running for over five years now.

<dd>The game articles that are linked in the text (within the Games section) are there because they were there already.

I used external links for the rest of the games precisely because I felt that was better than creating redlinks on the page for things which had not yet been judged notable by others. On reflection, I've commented these out from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStardock_3b85.html" title="Template:Stardock">Template:Stardock</a> as well - I was trying to be comprehensive, but they just clutter it up.

<dd>I actually split it out from Stardock because it was getting too large, and because it seemed odd to be talking about a company and a digital content system in the same article. I can try putting some of the content and references back in there if suggested for merging/deleting. Some more information about what particular segments of the article people do and do not like (rather than just "original research" or "non-notable") would be helpful for knowing what to keep in that case. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 22:07, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given that you work for Stardock, I think using Stardock sources to write up an article on a Stardock product is too much like <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> for my tastes.

<dd>I would indeed prefer to use non-Stardock sources, but frankly the only ones I could find that had sufficient detail on the mechanisms of subscription were just repeating our press releases, as so many sites do. It seemed better to have an authoritative source for that. There aren't many references on the Steam article that are about the system itself, either - it seems not many people like to write seriously about content delivery systems, just the games that are on them. I've just been told <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Herring_%28magazine%29_0274.html" title="Red Herring (magazine)">Red Herring</a></i> will be bringing a significant review out soon, but it's hardly a source before it's released.

<li><b>What?</b> - I don't think your argument makes a lot of sense. Steam is <s>infinitely</s> more popular. Just because we have articles about one music player (iTunes) doesn't mean "Joe Shmo's Mp3 Playa" is acceptable. Similarly, just because we have an article about one content delivery service, doesn't mean every content delivery service meets WP standards for inclusion.

<dd>Infinitely so? No? Vastly? I don't know, where's the figures to compare? It'd be interesting to know that for TotalGaming.net as well - I have no doubt that Steam has <b>more</b> users, but the proportion that are there just for Half Life is perhaps a more relevant question (the same should be asked for Stardock's <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Civilizations_II_7904.html" title="Galactic Civilizations II">Galactic Civilizations II</a>, of course).</dd>
<dd>In any consideration of the content delivery system as a whole (not just the games part, which was separated out in this article) you need to include all the <i>applications</i> which are provided to <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object_Desktop_2cf5.html" title="Object Desktop">Object Desktop</a> subscribers through Stardock Central (which has used a more rudimentary system since at least 1998; as with one of the first instances of "software as a service"). The games have historically been the "fun" for Stardock, while the apps have been the money. This may not apply so much this year, given GC2's success (beyond our most optimistic targets), but it has up to now.</dd>
<dd>I think that if this article is deleted it would make more sense to merge/redirect the material about the content (what games are on the service, etc.) to Stardock and perhaps add some of the material about the mechanics of the service itself to Stardock Central, as the same system is used for both the games and the applications (Drengin.net was essentially the "beta test" of the system before Stardock switched over the more important applications side of things from Component Manager, the previous delivery system). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 17:14, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The supposition that the Book of the Covenant mentioned in the Bible is equal to what a particular minority of people call the Covenant Code is mere speculation.

<p><b>Addendum to Keep</b>: Please note that this article has been in existence for only a couple of days. It's still undergoing editing and linking, and I'm still adding links to source information, of which there is MUCH. At WORST it's a stub. Not a delete. This AfD is VASTLY premature, as is original proposer's sudden interest in AfDing and Merge-deleting every article I've written in the past week. WAY premature. And way out of line. I could point to 2000 WP articles with less data, and less research. Premature deletion of articles written in good faith is stupendously discouraging, and it's a good way to chase serious, thoughtful, good-faith editors out of the community. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">The Editrix</a> 01:35, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> looking at the sources I'm still not convinced this is verified via <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. I can find just as many sources (if not more) that say that JFK was assinated by the CIA... but that doesn't necessarily make it so. Furthermore one of your sources states <a href="http://www.thelostbooks.com/intro2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thelostbooks.com/intro2.htm" rel="nofollow">[91]</a> "There are those that believe the Book of the Covenant is found in Exodus chapters 20 through 23. There are no authoritative sources for this text." This in no ways suggests that there is a "Book of the Covenant" that was "lost" from the bible and in fact <i>points out</i> there are <b>no</b> authoritative sources for this text. The Hackwriters site mentions this "Book of the Covenant" but never suggests it was once part of the Torah, or added to the Old Testament when it was compiled. Ditto for <a href="http://www.westarkchurchofchrist.org/benjamin/2006/060115am.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.westarkchurchofchrist.org/benjamin/2006/060115am.htm" rel="nofollow">[92]</a>, which mentions the passage from 2 Kings but in no way sources or supports the sections of this article which are not scriptural quotes. <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/lost_books.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.answering-christianity.com/lost_books.htm" rel="nofollow">This</a> just repeats the first source. Unless I missed something <a href="http://www.aishdas.org/toratemet/en_torah.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aishdas.org/toratemet/en_torah.html" rel="nofollow">[93]</a> doesn't even mention the book of the covenant. This makes the whole article other than the scripture quotes, the statment "no copies are known to exist...", and the website quote "...there 'are no authoritative sources' for this attribution...." <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>MERGE</b> with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a>, and <b>Redirect</b> to that article. Reasoning as follows: there were many "X or Y" comments, but sorting them all out and putting the least-destructive option first, I get 6 Deletes and 4 Merge, counting a Redirect as basically a Delete. To my mind, that is not enough of a majority to <i>by itself</i> force a Delete. So then we look to the arguments. Do the Delete arguments win the day? In my opinion, they don't have enough of an edge <i>by themselves</i> to force a Delete. It's very close. There really isn't a consensus; my sense is that Merge is the best solution, with a Redirect since it was mentioned by a couple of commentors and costs little. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 17:52, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Some candidates or campaigns receive so much attention that they are notable, even in losing. That campaign gathered a huge amount of press, not just in the district, but in the national press, which makes it notable. The point is that merely being a candidate (and gathering some local press for being one) is not sufficient to be considered notable, and right now we're seeing a lot of articles for people who have no claim of notability other than that they're running for something. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That is a ridiculous policy and it's unhealthy for democracy. If you consider Patrick Murphy non-notable, then what the hell is notable about Mike Fitzgerald? There are certainly many notable Congressmen, but he's not exactly one of them. Why is Wikipedia arbitrarily deciding that US Congressmen are all notable regardless of whether they've done anything notable but their opponents are not. I especially don't like being told by some British wanker that Federal candidates aren't notable. What do you know about anything American anyway? You can't even spell valour.

<li><b>Keep</b>. For one thing, being a candidate for Federal office in a general election certainly makes someone notable. Second, do we really want Wikipedia to be in the business of deciding that incumbents are notable but challengers aren't. That's not really serving the public.

<li><b>Comment</b> The reason there are so many WP articles for candidates is that they have put them there and we haven't found them yet!

If the candidate wins they become notable by definiton.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that many (probably most) mere candidates are neither credible candidates nor important people. Downticket candidates, sacrificial lambs, and crank third-party or independent candidates don't deserve pages. However, there are surely some major races (in the U.S., governor, Senate, and highly competitive House races) for which a major candidate should be kept. Just a few weeks ago, I was disappointed to find that Jon Grunseth (disgraced 1990 candidate for Minnesota governor) lacked a Wikipedia page, even though he was part of an interesting chapter in Minnesota political history. 14:46, 1 July 2006 (UTC)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bschak (<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschak_7508.html" title="User talk:Bschak">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschak_4a64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschak">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. This is a tough call. Here's my reasoning: straight up on "votes", it's 7-5 delete (including nominator). But if you discount two editors who registered just for this discussion and (to their credit and honor) admitted to being SUCS members, it's 7-3. That's <i>very close</i> to being consensus right there, but not quite. So let's look at the other factors: (1) The article <i>was</i> recently nominated for AfD, and <i>did</i> survive, the closing admin finding no Delete consensus even after discounting puppets.(2) The argument that <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Cox_e02c.html" title="Alan Cox">Alan Cox</a> used the club's network for important Linux development counts for <i>something</i>. That's about it; otherwise there are no strong arguments for a Keep. That there may be articles on organizations no more notable than SUCS is not really germane; this argument is usually not strongly considered by most closers, lest Wikipedia begin a race to the bottom on notability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, (1) I found the previous nom to be so rife with puppets as to be essentially of little or no value a precedent (and thus this re-nomination is in order) and (2) the argument that the club fails <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> is a strong one, and was not really succesfully refuted either here or in the previous AfD. The club <i>does</i> fail <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, I think; the only outside reference cited in the article is a Usenet post. This in my view overrides the Alan Cox connection, which does not seem to be strong enough to carry an entire article -- it could perhaps be reduced to a sentence in the Alan Cox article.</p>
<p>On straight-up counting, I see seven editors out of (an effective) ten suggesting Delete. And I see the stronger argument (fails <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> stated and not really refuted by the Delete commentors. To me, that makes for a Delete consensus. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 19:10, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, I feel that the resulting discussion was not satisfactory, there were too many newbies voting, and the discussion was not properly closed. I'd like to do this properly this time round. The first time I wrote "only have 180 members, making it non-notable. Plus, its in Swansea, which is never a good place to be!" as a reason to AFD it. Which was admittedly a little naïve. Now, I curtail that somewhat, my reasoning being "only have 180 members, making it non-notable". I call for a recognised responsable administator to close the debate. OK, so Deathphoenix, who closed the last discussion, fits the bill.

Other universities actually have their own society list pages in Wikipedia and yet I don't see any of them up for deletion. This deletion nomination is being driven by the same user as last time.

<p><b>Addendum to Keep</b>: Please note that this article has been in existence for only a couple of days. It's still undergoing editing and linking, and I'm still adding links to source information, of which there is MUCH. At WORST it's a stub. Not a delete. This AfD is VASTLY premature, as is original proposer's sudden interest in AfDing and Merge-deleting every article I've written in the past week. WAY premature. And way out of line. I could point to 2000 WP articles with less data, and less research. Premature deletion of articles written in good faith is stupendously discouraging, and it's a good way to chase serious, thoughtful, good-faith editors out of the community. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">The Editrix</a> 01:39, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> - According to the accepted rules of Hebrew transliteration, the pronunciation of this term should be <i>sefer hayyashar</i>. The first word is the common noun in Hebrew for “book”, while the second term (which is probably a verbal-adjective for “be straight / righteous”) is pronounced with an <i>a-a</i> vowel-pattern. Indeed, an article for the <a href="../../../s/e/f/Sefer_haYashar_e3c9.html" title="Sefer haYashar">Sefer haYashar</a> exists in Wikipedia, making EX’s creation of the Lost Book of Yasher redundant. The title that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">TheEditrix</a> chooses, <i>jasher</i>, is the transliteration found in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a>, while the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Revised_Standard_Version_bdd6.html" title="New Revised Standard Version">New Revised Standard Version</a> has the correct form Yashar. However, several issues are raised by Yasher and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">TheEditrix</a> seems unaware of them.<br /></p>

<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> In some Greek translations (the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>) we have the term translated “book of Songs,” which has led many biblical scholars to suspect that this “book,” in fact, represented an oral repertoire of songs. This idea is supported by the fact that the occurrences of <i>sefer hayyashar</i> appear in very archaic Hebrew (typically songs and poems preserved through oral tradition). Refer the <i>Anchor Bible Dictionary</i>, vol. 3, pages 646-647.<br /></dd>
<dd><b>2.</b> If this second lexical item is indeed pronounced <i>jasher</i>, as <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">TheEditrix</a> insists, then it is quite possibly <i>yashir</i>, the 3rd person masculine singular form of the verb <i>shar</i>, meaning “he sings / he will sing” (it may even have been the archaic prefix-preterite form = “he sang”). See also the other interesting translations found in the Aramaic (and Syriac) versions, discussed in <a href="../../../s/e/f/Sefer_haYashar_e3c9.html" title="Sefer haYashar">Sefer haYashar</a>. Over time, this meaning was probably “lost” (to use <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">TheEditrix</a>’s favorite word).</dd>

<dd>This article seems to be motivated by a POV that interprets these ancient sources as lost books that (as “books”) are comparable with the books of the Bible. However, what does the common noun <i>sepher</i> mean in ancient Hebrew? A quick reference to Kohler-Baumgartner’s Lexicon will reveal that it has a wide semantic-range, all indicating a locus of writing. In other words, it can mean “letter,” “inscription,” or “scroll.” It could be written on parchment, papyrus, or potsherd (letters or receipts), or it could be inscribed in stone or metal (inscriptions) and even engraved in plaster. If one follows the prevalent scholarly interpretation of these sources (such as the book of Jashar) as records from either the Temple or palace archives of Jerusalem, how are does one interpret <i>sepher</i>? If these were records from archives of lost institutions, can we call them books in the classic sense of the term? This basic problem raises a whole series of questions:<br />
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>What were they written upon – scrolls, inscribed <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stele.html" title="Stele">stele</a> or plastered walls (see <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deir_Alla_dc0d.html" title="Deir Alla">Deir Alla</a>)?<br /></li>
<li>Did the ancient communities consider these sources “scripture” – as compared with, say, the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a>?&#160;:<br /></li>
<li>Were they written before the concepts of “scripture” and “canon” were operative in the various faith-groups?<br /></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>All that to say this: this article (as well as the other “lost book” articles) operates according to a single POV that interprets them as <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books.html" title="Books">books</a>, in the modern sense of the term, and suggests that they were part of a once larger canon of scripture. <a href="../../../e/m/-/User%7EEm-jay-es_9812.html" title="User:Em-jay-es"><span style="background:#006400; size:2; color:#DCDCDC;"><i>Em-jay-es</i></span></a> 06:46, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am the initiator of this article, so I will not vote on deletion. The term is a neologism -- but one that should be comprehensible. We all know what <i>pseudo</i> means as a prefix, and we all know what a freeway is. If it is a neologism, it isn't that much of one. If someone has a better term, the feel free to re-name the article pending any effort to delete it.</p>
<p>The concept seems valid enough; any highway that despite having perils that cause it to fall far short of the normal expectations of a freeway although deceiving motorists into driving at freeway speeds. The pseudofreeway, as I see it, is a highway different from the "Blood Alley" infamous from the early days of motoring: the twisting mountain road or a mountain road with steep grades that push braking capacity -- especially that of trucks -- past their limits, the three-lane highway with the middle 'suicide lane', the rural highway with 90-degree turns and narrow bridges and no shoulder.</p>
<p>Does it need some re-writing? Of course. Most new articles need significant re-writing to raise them to the quality appropriate for well-established articles.</p>
<p>So go ahead and reorganize the article as you see fit. --Paul from Michigan 17:09, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be more explicit, "pseudofreeway" is something an encyclopedia would cover once it has been researched and described by experts in the field. So if transportation researchers use it as a term of art, or you have DOT documents talking about pseudofreeways, then we could cover it on Wikipedia. But if the concept is yours personally or limited to a relatively small number of people then the material should find a home elsewhere on the web. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 01:13, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(See previous comment regarding "strip-mall") In my current position, I am not a store manager. My reason for creating the article was out of informational purposes, not advertisement. Time and energy for advertising is best spent elsewhere. Why post an advert somewhere where you don't expect revenue to be generated? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthemys_b22e.html" title="User:Arthemys">Arthemys</a> 23:07, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to clarify, <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthemys_b22e.html" title="User:Arthemys">Arthemys</a>, the author of the article, claimed above that he isn't a store manager. Yet, his user page reads "Vermont Computing, Inc., Randolph, Vermont (July 2004 – Present) Store Manager &amp; Infrastructure Architect". I admit to being confused. As to why try to advertise here. It is already your second google hit. That's never a bad thing. And, as all businesspeople know, free advertising is the best advertising. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaner1_0920.html" title="User:Beaner1">Beaner1</a> 01:41, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't know -why- he says he's a manager in his wikipage, but from knowing him and knowing the company (I worked for it a year ago), he is not, and never was a manager.</li>

</dd>
<dd>Instead of attacking them, which I know you're not trying to do, but you're succeeding none the less, how about suggestions in the Discussion page on how to make the page better? If it helps I'll do it myself since I'm not a current employee and haven't been for some time. If you were from the parts of Vermont they service, you'd look at this "discussion" you all are holding with disdain.</dd>
<dd>I realize it needs to not violate the Corporate page, and that it currently is. If I were to go through and make it less... er... violatey (It's a word, I swear), can the AfD be reversed easily since it's not a vote?</dd>
<dd>I think they deserve a page and anything I can do to make sure they have one I'd like to attempt with the communities approval. They aren't quite "mom n' pop" as the next comment down says, far from it. Computer sales and repair are only what they do because they happen to have a retail store front, there's also a large consulting back end.</dd>
<dd>I also have a question. That is: Since you all want things to be cited and what-not, what can we do? I remember there being certificates of incorporation and community appreciation, but those are paper documents. Scanning them would violate the "personal research" clause. What then? Is Wikipedia really so locked-down by their own silly policies that you aren't "good enough" if you don't have web-news coverage to prove it? God forbid the state of Vermont appreciate something without forcing the whole world to know.

<li><b>One Last Comment</b> I think that what it boils down to in my opinion is that local notability does not equal notability on a wikipedia level. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is really the best guideline available. It's nothing personal. It says much good about a company to have two (one current and one former) employee trying to get it placed on Wikipedia. Unfortunately, it also says something about it's notability that you two are the only ones that are voting to keep it here. I wish both of you and the company the best. It may seem that we are being unhelpful. But we, at least I, have no good advice on how to turn a non-notable company into a notable one. It is not so much that the article is written like an advertisement (which it is) as it is that the company just doesn't seem to be notable. Unless there is some evidence of notability that hasn't been presented yet, my vote would still stand.<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaner1_0920.html" title="User:Beaner1">Beaner1</a> 04:34, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The two first links posted are indeed "yellowpage" listings. There are more pages linking to fairwaylife though that are not indexes and not an act of the owners, but they are just links in a list of other noteable sites so maybe they don't count. The third link is very interesting. Its from the Swedish Golf Federations Official website saying "New Golf Portal, some history, talks about current features, the ambitions of the site." The topic of the article is "all about costa del sol" and the golf portal fairwaylife is aparently the only site found worthy of mentioning for that headline. --Widjet 18:03, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I do not know the content of the original article so I can not comment on that.

Also, I do not know if two responses represents a strong consensus from the first afd. I have noticed some anon edits that seem to cut and paste from his website and that could be a recurring issue. There also seem to be less notable people who have their own article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a re-creation of a previously deleted article, deleted because of the results of the first AFD. Should have been taken to Deletion Review, not re-created and put up for a second AFD. Also my view hasn't changed, he is a minor, occasional radio talk show guest at best who has self-published a few books and a bunch of "white papers" and is not notable enough for an article. Somebody keeps copying and pasting blatantly POV promo material to the article and the only other people who seem to be interesed in him are a few critics putting their own POV in. The article has always been a mess of pro- and anti- POV both of which inflate his importance, and is unlikely to ever be anything more. He's just not notable. <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleenupKrew_dfad.html" title="User:KleenupKrew">KleenupKrew</a> 10:31, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I just want to clarify something. I am not a critic of this person. If my edits are POV I will try to adjust them unless someone already has. I just find it fascinating how he is popular with progressives while accused of being right wing. If his claims are accurate, then he is a notable person. If he is a fraud, that in itself seems notable too. As long as there are verifiable facts, whether on the web or through a lexis/nexis search, we can find the truth and have a good, accurate article. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 00:17, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. We don't have explicit notability criteria for places - perhaps a deficiency in the system? However, considering that people are prepared to fight tooth-and-nail over individual high schools and roads, I think it's reasonable to say that neighbourhoods at this scale aren't, at least, obviously non-notable. And it's good to see a reasonably well-put-together article from one of our younger contributors, although I accept that this isn't really relevant. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 23:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: You're right, I'm not aware of any specific guideline to cover neighborhoods. The closest thing I can think of is that this would be considered a minor street, which is generally not notable according to precedent: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Transportation_and_geography" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents#Transportation_and_geography</a>. In my opinion though, the main problem here is that the article is painfully devoid of <i>any</i> assertion of notability or importance whatsoever. Shouldn't it make some kind of claim of importance?

<li><b>Delete</b> I laughed at "this article is now concluded." There is no asseration of notability for this street/neighborhood. It is just merely a description of a normal place. The simplest way to put notability, is to ask: how does article seperate itself from other subjects of similar nature and not be part of the normality. Ways to prove notability, would be uniqueness in structure, population, culture, etc. and/or outside non-trivial coverage. That does not exist for this article and it is just a simple place that isn't yet worthy of recording. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 03:34, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Though I'd adding this for AfD, this is good information and I would prefer to see this <b>merged</b> rather than deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Needs appropriate references and sources, and (in the long term) references to jurisdictions other than the USA, but I think it's a suitably encyclopaedic topic, and that the current content is a good starting point for a more thorough coverage of the issue. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 00:04, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - I can't find an existing article that would be appropriate for merging to, and this is an important topic that has certainly had its share of coverage in the major media. Yes, the article as it stands needs work, but with the recent hullabaloo over things like charging per email <a href="http://www.silicon.com/research/specialreports/thespamreport/0,39025001,39156231,00.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.silicon.com/research/specialreports/thespamreport/0,39025001,39156231,00.htm" rel="nofollow">[123]</a> or the somewhat-related <a href="../../../n/e/t/Net_neutrality.html" title="Net neutrality">net neutrality</a> issue, I can see an article like this being important and informative if done right. Though I can't help but feel <i>"Internet taxation"</i> works better as a title (referring to the act of taxation rather than just the taxes, i.e. the money collected, if you follow me). ~ <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus78</a> 00:28, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. As original author, I observed that the nomination for deletion (really for merging) was made when the first draft was merely a work in progress. I agree it needs more references and sources, and references to jurisdictions other than the USA, about which I know very little. But I agree with above commenters that it's a suitably encyclopaedic topic, and I meant the current content to be a starting summary onto which (I hope and expect) the Wikipedia community will jump with gusto.

<li><b>Comment.</b> As I noted in my nomination, the sole reason I placed this in the AfD is not to have the article deleted, but rather to attempt to find a better place for it, as "Internet taxes" is a rather loose title. I agree with the suggestion to have the article renamed to "Internet taxation." <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Talk</font></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RidG_4a2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Contributions</font></font></a></sub> 01:30, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
