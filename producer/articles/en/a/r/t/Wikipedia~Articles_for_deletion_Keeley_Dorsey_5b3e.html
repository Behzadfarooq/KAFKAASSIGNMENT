<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<p>ONE touchdown all season, 68 yards all season...star players would see that as a bad game. Simply being a player on a third-rate college football team does not make someone notable or memorable or leave a lasting legacy. In addition, Wikipedia is not a memorial. Any time an article is created after the death, there must be a suspicion of that.</p>
<p>Further, it seems this is yet another case of the overvaluation of the input of young and immature editors, who often see the world only through their own lenses and don't seem able to distinguish between a current event and a lasting legacy.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 12:45, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> (after ec) - Well I don't know W. Marsh's real life <i>age</i>, but he's been editing here as long as you and is an administrator...so I wouldn't be so quick to toss around 'immature'. I'd remind you to AGF if you hadn't been here so long. That said, I'm leaning in favor of <b>keep</b>. Herr Dorsey might not have been a star football player, but as in some other cases a bizarre death can make one notable. How many college football players have died ever during conditioning workouts? He has a cite (which most truly non-notable college football players would indeed lack), and Wikipedia is not paper. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 13:22, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The death while it's rare it's not completely bizzare, there has been many cases of a college or pro player die after practice, mainly because of heart issues, etc, which this appears to be one. If it was an heat stroke death then the case maybe more notable but there is nothing a person can do with an heart defect afterworkout. Each college football player has their own college page as well and could be sourced as well. <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaranda_ee94.html" title="User:Jaranda">Jaranda</a> <a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJaranda_87d5.html" title="User talk:Jaranda"><sup>wat's sup</sup></a> 21:02, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yea but it also says <i>Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States.</i> The only claim of notablity is dying. Of cource a sudden death of an athlete makes local news and sometimes that is covered by the AP, my newspaper had only one sentence of his death so it only minor death that made the news for not very long. <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaranda_ee94.html" title="User:Jaranda">Jaranda</a> <a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJaranda_87d5.html" title="User talk:Jaranda"><sup>wat's sup</sup></a> 22:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Frankly I don't think you're reading WP:BIO closely enough, those planks are merely signs that the more important criterion of sufficient verifiability is met, a subject can easilly meet the main criterion without meeting the planks at the bottom. None of those planks have to be met before there can be an article, and that's explicitly said in the guideline. As I've said before the claim of playing for a Div. 1 sports program itself is a claim of notability. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 22:24, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This really is less about Keeley Dorsey and more about W Marsh. Reading his profile he is an 'inclusionist' (i.e., an advocate for having an article on anything verifiable, forget the need for notability). Also, he tends to state half-truths, such as merely playing on a college football team meets WP:BIO when in fact it says something about "on a high level." Oop`s, let's just gloss over those words.

<dd>My uncle played baseball at University of Central Florida, my former baseball coach and science teacher was an All-American in University of Florida, several of my cousins also played college ball same with the local card store owner and several classmates are going to play Division 1, they don't deserve articles though, I'm read WP:BIO many times, if it's claims importance verifiability has to back it up, not verifiability first and notablity after.

<dd>Most of the 150+ newspapers that carried the guy was only one sentence from the AP, ESPN spoke about it for 30 seconds, the death is now forgotten, many stuff makes the news and is forgotten after one day, we don't have articles on the amish girls who died in the school shooting recently or that kid who got stabbed in a New England school today or most tragic fires as they are carried by the same newspapers daily.

However, the only reason why this person was the subject of a non-trivial work is because he died in an unusual circumstance (heatstroke is common, nowadays; but it is still newsworthy when it involves sports players). We should <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a> as the criterion on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> only works for this article because of his death, and his article has no merit otherwise.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The guidelines under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> indicate that playing in a fully professional league is required except in primarily amateur sports (such as many college sports, but <i>not</i> football). I don't think signing a football letter of intent should automatically qualify someone for an article, and inevitably there will be a long spiral down as we debate whether benchwarmers at Division III or NAIA schools qualify. College football players who never play pro football should qaulify only if they achieve All-American status (as was often the case in the pre-NFL era and for some time afterward). There <i>should</i> be an article on mortality issues in college football, with substantial material on the pre-1910 era when dozens of players were dying annually.

<li>Uh no, WP:BIO explicitly says things like "playing in a fully professional league" are not required. That's literally what it says... "just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted" and yet you claim the opposite.

<li>It says that playing in a fully professional league is not required <i>IF</i> the sport is primarily amateur; this was the case for the early years of college football. Exceptions are made (quoting the guidelines) if: "Third-party verification from a non-trivial publication outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity should be provided <b>to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized—meeting the first criterion</b>—as performing in a fully professional league or at the highest level." This <i>specifically</i> refers us to the first criteria, which is: "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." That is clearly <i>not</i> the case with Dorsey; he falls short regarding the first criteria, so the one discussing sportspeople clearly applies. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 01:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. That is what I assume you're arguing. However, that means he passes WP:BIO solely because of his death, since that is why he has multiple non-trivial news articles. Yeah, I used a non-consesus verifiability test above that technically doens't count on WP:BIO. Anyway, if we allow him to have an article and his notability stems from his death, then that could be argued for everyone showing up on the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaths_in_2007.html" title="Deaths in 2007">Deaths in 2007</a> link.

<li>Well, if we had articles on all those people the project would be better for it. As I've said we want more accurate/neutral articles, not fewer. WP:BIO's core criterion doesn't specify a concern about why someone would get non-trivial media coverage, and exclude certain reasons for it, because to do so is subjective and leads to bias.

<li>True, accurate articles are good, I just feel that the line has to be drawn somewhere on what college athletes can be considered notable. I'm actually an inclusionist, so your convincing me to not delete the article is probably inevitable. I went and googled Keeley Dorsey minus died, death, etc. and actually got a lot of results.

<p><b>Comment</b> The three 'sources' listed are all local Tampa area news coverage, and can hardly be said to be a 'published' work.</p>
<p>Elitist theory, including 'bread and circuses,' states that you can keep the people preoccupied with sports and food, and take their money while they're not paying attention. It worked for the ancient Roman empire and it is working for modern-day America. Simple transient news coverage hardly merits an 'encyclopedia' entry. Wikipedia's danger is the same as that of video games: it can become unobjectively time-consuming. For all those who think they might 'save' this article: what a waste of time. No wonder the education of America is in such trouble.</p>
<p>Also, I thought that "Wikipedia is not a memorial." Clearly, had this player not died, there wouldn't have been news coverage. I disagree that because something is in the news, it merits its own article. By that low, low standard, Wikipedia ceases to be an encylopedia and becomes simply a lowest-common denominator. Might as well have articles on oneself at this rate. Come to think of it, I've been in the newspaper on six continents, too many times to count. I guess I merit an article, too. Anyone for starters?</p>
<p>However, the worst part of having an article like this being included is that it makes a mockery of effort. If rushing for 68 yards and 1 touchdown, career, is notable, then dying early, while we ignore someone who might have rushed for 68 yards/game but dies at 76, then what we are doing is simply creating a system that overvalues itself, youth, and current events, while lowering the standards to simply attracting media coverage, transient or no. What is the purpose of trying if simply existing is the new standard? → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 09:06, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
