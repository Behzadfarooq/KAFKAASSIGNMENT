<li><b>Keep</b> - For being on hit national/international TV show for almost all of one season, which would qualify her if she had been an actress with comparable air time. She got a reasonable amount stories about her during her appearance, so there's ample independent sources available. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 08:51, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>We're not talking about being on the Price-is-right for 10 minutes. We're talking about almost an entire season of a hit prime-time TV show. Now, you're entitled to think that's minor, but please don't lump together different things. This is like being a lead actor of TV show for about the same time. We're not deciding if somebody should be notable, but if *others* have found them to be. This person was written about a fair bit, and followed. Perhaps you don't think they should have been, but they were. Hence, they are notable for our purposes. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:09, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was actually talking about the Survivor thing. Sorry for being unclear. I don't think being on Survivor is enough for notability either. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 11:48, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, thanks for clarifying. Can I ask which variant of notability you're using. Here's some different ones I've seen used around here (usually not explicitly stated). Does one of these fit you, or do you have a different approach:
<ol>
<li>Notability means somebody is *worthy* of notice. You don't think she's worthy. Wikipedia shouldn't follow others, but decide for itself who is worthy and who is not. Since being a "survivor" doesn't require talent or substantial contribution to humanity, she's not worthy. By this logic, an unnoticed person worthy of notice is a better article than anybody unworthy, regardless how much attention has been paid.</li>
<li>Notability means other respected authorities in the area have noticed her. She has been found notable by others, but they are not "respectable authorities", and don't count.</li>
<li>Notability means she has been widely found to be worthy of notice, by many sources, and those sources include reliable sources of information which could make a verifiable article. Wikipedia must be a follower, and not a leader. By this, I think she qualifies. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 20:06, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm sure she's a nice person but she fails to meet my understanding of the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. Reality shows, in my opinion, <i>are</i> mere game shows and contestants are <i>not</i> automatically notable. Being one of the cast is a long way from being the "lead actor" of a TV show. The fact that she was a news reporter is also unpersuasive. Reporters are an important profession but no more deserving of an encyclopedia entry than any other profession. We would not, for example, argue that she would deserve an encyclopedia article if she had been a doctor for a few years. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 13:33, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, survivor contestents and news reporters are in the public eye, unlike doctors. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 14:29, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as much as I dislike the show its contestants do indeed have notability especially when the contestant in question is the Runner up in the competition. This person like Richard Hatch or Ken Jennings is considered newsworthy enough that national news would respond if something happened to her and that seems a valid establishment of notability to me.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, despite how boring Survivor is.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:32, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per JamesB3, rob, and Kappa; this figure has been repeatedly televised to an audience of 5,000 or more and it is entirely conceivable that people may want to learn more about this person from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 23:01, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
