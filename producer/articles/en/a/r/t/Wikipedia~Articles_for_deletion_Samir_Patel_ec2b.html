<p>Doesn't seem all that notable. His claim to fame is being a runner-up in the spelling bee. It's arguable if the winners have notability, but the runners up?

<li><b>Delete</b> He certainly has a very good chance at winning the spelling bee, and there are numerous media reports about him in connection with the competition, but he hasn't won the national competition.

<li><b>Keep but completely rewrite</b> First, I have found many articles from reputable sources by searching for him on Google (both under "Samir Patel" and his full name, "Samir Sudhir Patel"). <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/02/AR2005060201924.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/02/AR2005060201924.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> from the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2464605" class="external text" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2464605" rel="nofollow">this</a> from <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> are both about Samir, among other spellers. There are a bunch of articles from Indian sources about the success of Samir and other Indian-American spellers, including the winner when Samir was runner-up. And then, of course, there are tons of major web sites that give Bee results word for word or report on the final rounds. As important as the media mentions, however, is something I've argued a few times before, which is that anyone who competes at this level of the National Spelling Bee- making the final two and high finishes three times- passes the sportsperson criterion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (if you count spellers as sportspeople) by competing at the highest level of their "sport". The National Spelling Bee is broadcast on major networks (ESPN and ABC) in prime time; it is watched by millions of people, and to reach the final rounds of the Bee, a speller must defeat not only 200+ other spellers at the national competition, but millions of others (if I recall correctly, Scripps estimates that 10 million children compete in feeder/qualifier bees, though this of course includes school bees with children that have no aspirations of going further). A speller must put in as much time at his craft as any other competitor (I don't know about you, but I don't want to read dictionaries and study word roots for five hours per day, six days per week), and to finish second place in an historic, nationally-televised competition is enough for an article in my opinion. With all of that said, this article is absolutely terrible and should probably be stripped of 95% of its content. Still, the 5% that remains is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:55, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I disagree. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says <b>a</b> primary subject, not <b>the</b> primary subject, and he is a primary subject of at least two of them. (The 'word nerds' ref starts with the sentence "Meet Samir Patel.") I just added another one where you can tell he is the primary subject from just the title, if that is important. So now there are definitely <b>multiple non-trivial published works</b>. But this is not the only way to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; it also states that competing at the highest level in a competitive activity itself considered notable is a sufficient criterion, which he does. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 19:26, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The most important criterion is multiple non-trivial published works about the subject and not the fact that he competed at the highest level of competitive activity. As <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states "The following criteria make it _likely_ that sufficient reliable information is available about a given person. People who satisfy at least one of these criteria may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available." If he had competed at high level of competitive activity and had no reliable published works about him, then he would not be notable (although that's unlikely as the guideline suggests). I do think that there is sufficient material has been added to the article at this point to change my recommendation. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarfieldian_373f.html" title="User:Warfieldian">Warfieldian</a> 23:38, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
