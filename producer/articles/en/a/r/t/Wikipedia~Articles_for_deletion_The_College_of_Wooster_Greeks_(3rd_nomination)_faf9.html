<p>The result of the debate was that there seems to me to be no consensus; therefore, the result is to keep the article.

However this speedy keep was disputed and after discussion at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> there was a consensus for this to be relisted.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fraternities(sororities and similar are not usually worthy of separate articles, even though such institutions are a part of student life. The presence of this list discourages creation of <i>individual</i> sororities at this college, and as long as all this info is consolidated into one article it doesn't do much harm. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 16:35, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This could be an interesting subject. I know people who went there, and supposedly Wooster didn't have nationals for decades because of a bequest from a former student that had been badly hazed that conditioned the money on no frats. I don't know the exact story, but it did lead to lots of oddities in Wooster Greek life, like no real houses (just halls in particular dorms, usually the bad ones). <a href="../../../a/2/k/User%7EA2Kafir_5330.html" title="User:A2Kafir">A2Kafir</a> 23:12, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Additional comment - the creator of the article, in the first deletion debate, notes that he made a trip to special collections to verify his facts.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. The introduction doesn't establish the <i>point</i> of the article, except that a bunch of things are "mysterious," and it's just a list of fraternities with a few incidents of history thrown in. I would not be opposed to a shorter article that was about history, which cited sources for necessary facts about fraternities instead of listing them all. Honestly, this sort of seems to be a FAQ (or correction of common misconceptions, maybe) about the fraternities at the college, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection of information</a>.

<li><b>Comment (no vote)</b>. I was the person to nominate this article the first time. I go to this college. I am not a Greek student, but have no problem with Greeks. At the time, the reason why I nominated was because the article was both POV and unverified, and, at the time, it seemed like that wasn't going to change. I had no idea where the author had originally gotten his information. Those two problems were resolved during the first AfD debate. I personally have an appreciation for the article now, though there are still problem areas, but I am not voting; I think my attending the school and my interactions with greeks color my judgment too much. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 03:42, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's more accurate to think of it as a "senior thesis" than an "independent study" - Wooster uses IS to mean something different than most places. The IS program has vetting comparable to MA theses, including oral examination and a second reader, and the resulting papers are kept by the library, making them reviewable/verifiable. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:41, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

The current content has improved but it's still not very encyclopedic or well supported. I've already started removing the most obviously inappropriate content.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think some people are very confused about what previous Afds mean. "No consensus" means "no consensus", which means the article isn't deleted at that time. So, no consensus <i>results in</i> a keep. But it does not <i>mean</i> "keep". Also, keep in mind the last Afd was improperly tampered with, in an apparent effort to make it look like a keep. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 00:58, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> "No consensus" means an Afd did not reeach a consensuss. When that happens we keep the article, because there was no consensus to delete it. But it does not mean that there was a clear consensus to keep it -- in many cases it means that there were more people who wanted to delete than to keep, but not enough to form a consensus to delete. And the second AfD was closed before the normal 5-day period was up, in a proceduarally unusual and arguably improper (I argued it on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>) action. I presume that that action was taken because the closer was convinced that a consensus was already clear, and would not change; and that there was no intent to decieve or distort the results. I think it was ill-advised. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:29, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That is utter nonsense. Articles are kept unless there is a consensus to delete. A consensus to keep may be formed, but it's quite irrelevant to the deletion policy, which only cares if there's a consensus to delete. An article does not require and has never required a consensus of editors in order to exist on Wikipedia. More to the point, it can easily be seen that after three AfDs there are few if any good reasons to argue for the deletion of this well researched and compendious article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:49, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course not. Any article that merits inclusion in the encyclopedia <i>will</i> have a clear consensus to keep—if an article cannot get that, then it means that there <i>are</i> some problems with it, at least in the opinions of other users. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 04:36, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>It is quite correct thst a consensus to keep is never required. However, when an article's AfD results in a clear consensus to keep that article would IMO be less subject to a future delete nomination, at least in the short term, and the appeal to the previous afd debate would be far more persusaive if it were nominated. An appeal to a previous AfD with a non consensus result has far less value, IMO, and i think that is the point Friday was making, or should have been making. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:57, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The large amount of information that "is rumored," "likely," or "alledged" [sic] seems to violate the idea that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> "a collection of unverifiable speculation." Trivia such as "Symbol: Steal your Face (???)" seems to violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> "an indiscriminate collection of information." Labeling information about hazing as "fun facts" seems to violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. For example, while it may possibly be a verifiable fact that "[sorority] pledges had to ... write "Peanut" on the butt ... men would then be instructed ... to 'Slap their peanut,'" for editors to label such "facts" as "fun" betrays a certain POV. And "There is a common misconception that the College dosn't have any national fraternities"? I doubt it's that common to have any conception, let alone misconceptions, about fraternities and sororities at Wooster. While I appreciate R._fiend's optimism that attempts to <b>clean-up, move, wikify and verify</b> could save this article, the only info that seems even remotely encyclopedic is that "In 1999 ... the school received national attention when four Kappa Chi members were arrested for hazing pledges by beating them and urinating on them, leading to the eventual ban of the Fraternity." This can be merged with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternities_and_sororities.html#Hazing_issues" title="Fraternities and sororities">Fraternities_and_sororities#Hazing_issues</a>, the rest can be deleted. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 04:17, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. My decision is based upon the page not the previous AfDs: unverifiable, not notable.

<li><b>Comment: a note on verifiability</b>. I can't argue with anyone regarding whether this topic is unnotable or unencyclopedic. Those two are amorphous subjects and everyone has a different view of them. But it troubles me when people say they worry about verifiability. An Independent Study, if you read <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_College_of_Wooster_9877.html" title="The College of Wooster">The College of Wooster</a> article, is not just some final senior paper. It is the second-highest rated senior capstone project after Princeton. As Phil said, it's more like a thesis. I'd like to point out that it's not something a student just writes and hands in and gets a grade. Advisers are involved all the way through; they wouldn't allow unverifiable information to get in. And, as Phil said, it's possible to get your hands on one. I know people would just like to be able to Google this to confirm it, but, as vandals on this site sadly indicate, finding something on the Internet is not a guarantee of its truth. Also, there are plenty of true things that are not on the Internet. And, in conclusion, if you want to help with the verifiability of Wikipedia, go help with <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alanis_Morissette_39bf.html" title="Alanis Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a>, which literally has no sources (compared to this one, which is well-sourced) and probably gets looked at about 500x as much. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_92a1.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M Schedler">★</a> 15:26, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>

<li><b>keep</b> to clarify, yes i created this article. the major source of 75% of the information originaly placed in the article is The Wooster Voice articles on Greek Week 1991 and 1992 published Sept 13, 1991 and Sept 11, 1992 and availible in libraries in Northeast Ohio, special collections at wooster, microfiche at wooster, and from the Wooster Voive itself. The research on the defunct fraternities was done using the Wooster Index yearbooks noted in the article. There is no AfD criterion by which I view this as deletable. Vanity would require me - or anyone who has ever edited the article - to actually be a part of the greek community at that school, which I am not. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a> 23:44, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
