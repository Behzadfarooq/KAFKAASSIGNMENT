<p>IP 172.141.83.47 placed entry on relevant talk page requesting keep - prod moved to AfD as per. My personal vote is a <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedHillian_dc72.html" title="User:RedHillian">RedHillian</a> 12:52, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> what is the reason to delete it? The article has appropriate <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">references</a>, though these could be better. It needs some cleanup and improvement, but its not far enough from a decent article to warrant deletion. The opening paragraph looks like a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">dictionary definition</a> but the inclusion of the film discounts that. It appears to meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability requirements</a> since it is the subject of multiple independent discussions in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and more exist (and should be added). The term is indeed offensive, but Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not censored</a>. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 13:00, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Original prod was from <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angusmclellan</a>, and quoted A dictionary definition but <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nigger" class="extiw" title="wikt:nigger">wikt:nigger</a> in the woodpile already exists and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. I placed prod2 as per original nom. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedHillian_dc72.html" title="User:RedHillian">RedHillian</a> 14:05, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, although the original prod was placed before the movie and recent usages sections were added. Adding these sections makes this article more than a dictionary definition. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 14:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> — the article consists of a definition copied directly from somewhere, and two pieces of trivia. This is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary of idioms. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a> 14:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This appears like a dicdef. Any etymological trivia can be added on wiktionary. I don't agree with Gwernol: there doesn't appear to be an encyclopedia article struggling to get out of this. I'm not of the view that it's offensive, although that was presumably the original intent. The relevance of censorship passes me by. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 14:47, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Sorry, just adding "They made a movie with this title" doesn't mean it's not a dictionary definition anymore. If you feel you can make an article out of the film title, go for it. As it stands, though, it's just a dicdef. (and I kind of wonder why the "Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not censored</a>" defense was brought up when nobody claimed it was offensive in the first place) --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 15:43, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason I brought it up along with a number of other points, was that at the time no reason to delete had been given. I simply ran through all the possible objections I could imagine and pointed out where I believed they did not apply to this article. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 15:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> sourced, encyclopaedic, at least partially not a copyvio (some parts may be). Which leaves no real reason for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:28, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It's hard to address, since no reasonable person could construe this as a dictionary entry. Perhaps it read as such before I first saw it. But it doesn't read like a dictionary entry now - I would have thought "encyclopaedic" covered <i>Not merely a dictionary entry</i>, I must have been mistaken. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:47, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article gives the meaning of and etymology of an idiomatic phrase. That's a dictionary article. An encyclopaedia article would discuss the person/concept/place/thing/event that the phrase denoted. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:42, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This one's hard, but I gotta say <b>delete</b>. Not because it's offensive, but because it comes off as a dicdef - and a poorly formed one at that. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:14, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> an article on the origins of an interesting phrase does not constitute merely a dicdef. -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 12:39, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the contrary: An article on the etymology of an idiom is <i>exactly</i> dictionary article territory. You are most likely thinking that the article cannot be a dictionary article because it isn't a short, 1-sentence long, article. "Short" and "dictionary" are not synonyms. Don't let what one can find in "pocket dictionaries" fool you. An article is a dictionary article when it gives (one or more of) the meaning, etymology, usage, inflections, pronunciations, translations, synonyms, antonyms, homophones, alternative spellings, derived terms, and so forth of a word or an idiom. A <i>non-stub</i> dictionary article can be quite long. This article falls into that category. It doesn't discuss the person/concept/place/event/thing that the word/phrase <i>denotes</i>, which is encyclopaedia article territory. It gives the meaning of the idiom, discusses its etymology, and points to some modern usages, noting the connotations of the idiom. It <i>nowhere</i> discusses important facts that are not disclosed, the concept that the phrase denotes. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:42, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Except this is a phrase, not simply a word. The history of its origins and usage is encyclopaedic. Do normal encyclopedia contain such things? No, but then they are pretty low on Pokemon characters and High Schools.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 19:03, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Dictionaries contain phrases. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 19:47, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Please remember that Wikipedia is not censored, and that the definition explains the term - so while the term is indeed racist, it gives an etymology behind said term. (Regardless, my "delete" above stands.) --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 22:20, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>strong keep</b> It's really quite simple. <b>WP is not censored</b>. Now un-used slang that would now be considered racist is included. In fact , even contemporary racist slang is included, if material for an encyclopedic article can be found. There is much else to say, including comparisons with similar slang in various countries, and a look at likely pre-Google era material should find quite a bit. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:39, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Please stop making that argument</b>. Nobody is saying it should be censored. In fact, it's the keep voters that keep bringing up the censorship issue (making it <i>really</i> hard for me to assume good faith). Simply because we don't censor things doesn't mean that everything potentially vulgar is instantly notable. The issue at hand is whether or not this article is a dictionary definition, or whether the article is notable. I believe that it is, and it's not. Adding a history of the word doesn't make it any less of a dicdef, and while a movie from 1904 is mentioned, there's absolutely <i>nothing</i> about it on the page. This "movie", by the way, is 10 minutes long and there is nearly no information about it over at IMDB (the only source provided for it). --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 03:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have noticed a certain frequency of dicdef as the objection when some topics come into play. agreed it can be more complicated, but I also said that for something used so widely, print sources are findable, and they will add depth to the discussion in the article. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:02, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
