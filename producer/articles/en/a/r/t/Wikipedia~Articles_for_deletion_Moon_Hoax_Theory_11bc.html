Yes, you're right - I suppose you are somewhat guilt in that Broodlinger created this fork. If you had conducted better, he wouldn't create it.

<li>Way too much information to deal with. Once this forked article gets knifed, you could work on improving the real article, if you're of a mind to. However, if you look at the way Broodlinger immediately came in as an attack dog, it was <i>he</i> who violated the rules of conduct, not us... as do most of the hoax writers (many of whom appear to be sockpuppets of each other and/or singularly obsessed with that one article). <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:04, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I agree, hoax writers are not attractive&#160;:-). Ok, sorry, I didn't wish to hurt you. I just wish to say, that more accurate dealing with these hoax writers may be more effective than blind deletion. As for the article itself, I don't mind too much about the subject (I suppose it's more useful to spend time on more productive articles about moon landings), but maybe I will look at this article too. <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrbug_126b.html" title="User:Drbug">D<b>r</b> B<b>u</b>g <i>(Vladimir V.

<dd>Nothing (except that with these 6 G$ Russians were close to make a moon landing, and therefore Russian space engineers don't doubt that 30 G$ were quite enough for NASA to make a successfull moon landing).

<li><b>Keep</b> I read Broodlinger`s explanation for this page in the discussion page under "Starting fresh". Makes sense. Wikipedia should have an article about what Moon Hoax Theory is, the different theories, period. For instance there were no crater under the lunar lander and no dust on the landing pads. We do not need a long (and unconvincing if I may say so) explanation on why there should be none in this article. Response to the hoax theory could be done in a separate article, for instance by changing the name of the original "Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations" to "Rebuttal of Moon Hoax Theory". Trying to get consensus on the original "Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations" is not working very well. I am not even trying after seeing how other believers in the hoax are treated. It is like trying to paint a picture, with some trolls laying it on the floor, jumping on it with dirty boots, and giving it back. No, think this page is a better try for Wikipedia.

<dd>The reply of Algr and Wahkeenah illustrate my point in an excellent way. Groundless and rude accusations of me beeing a sockpuppet. Far out reasoning (helicopter??). "There are no hoax theory". Hey Algr, the hoax theory says that pictures of astronauts allegedly on the moon was taken in a studio setting on earth. Anyone expect me to use my free time to achive consensus with rude people you can`t reason with? No, the hoax believers and the Apollo fans just don't get along to well. Apollo fans are in clear majority, and they are making the article of what the hoax theory is about. Their target is not to describe the hoax theory to readers, their target seems to be to discredit the hoax theory. And Wikipedia get an awful article on the subjeckt. No, hoax beliver are better suited to describe the hoax theory, Apollo fans are better suited at criticizing it. There could be a page for both, as described in my comments above.

<dd>Your <i>only</i> "contributions" to wikipedia in your 5 or 6 months have to do with this page, so it is reasonable to conclude that you're a sockpuppet. And it is the hoaxsters who are the rude ones, as they refuse to discuss anything. They constantly rail about the article being "biased", when their real agenda <i>is to present a biased page</i>, giving only their "side" of the story. Or <i>several</i> sides. "The" hoax theory is an incorrect characterization. First, because there are several, not just one; and second, because their only "theory" is their suspicions, because they have no actual evidence, just questions, which can easily be knocked down by explanations that are consistent with science and technology, and within the context of the historical record of Mercury-Gemini-Apollo. That by itself doesn't prove Apollo is true, but it introduces reasonable doubt into the hoaxsters' arguments. The article <i>does</i>, in fact, try to explain what the hoax "theories" are. It <i>does</i> present the claim of some (but not all) hoaxsters that the landing stuff was done in studios on earth <i>despite the lack of any evidence of that claim</i>. If anything, the article gives <i>too much</i> credence to the hoaxster side. The hoaxsters complain about the article, but every suggestion to "improve" it boils down to presenting a one-sided view. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 10:44, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The goal of an article about the hoax theory is to describe it, not judge it. The "Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations" article has lots of arguments against the hoax which may be "original research or unverified claims", something to avoid. If a telescope could show detaljed pictures of the alleged landing sites, that would be dependable and verifiable arguments for the article. But let us avoid "original research or unverified claims", with links to strange hoax-rebuttal internet sites. Axlalta 14:13, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We've tried multiple times to convert it into an article which describes the hoax theories in accordance with the NPOV policies (particularly without giving the hoaxers opinions undue weight and in a similar manner other pseudoscience articles). When we do so, the Apollo-deniers revert it back to the current mess. In any case, this isn't the place to discuss the problems with the "Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations" article, they have no bearing on a blatant PoV fork. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 14:25, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>User Axlalta, whose lack of righteous indignation lends further credence to his being a sockpuppet, also must think we were born yesterday. It is very difficult to <i>fully</i> "describe the hoax" without bringing up the questions the hoaxsters raise. But user Mark Grant is right, that discussion belongs on the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations_8812.html" title="Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations">Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations</a> page. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 14:53, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I see from your page that you're sensitive to this issue, understandably so. Several of these user ID's have written <i>only about this subject</i> despite being on here for months. Their phraseology, as well as their approach (making edits without discussion and then turning around and accusing us of same, and generally "stirring the pot" and name-calling, and then whining when the tables are turned) are similar. And their curious lack of righteous indignation when the sockpuppetry subject comes up does nothing to counter the suspicions. Mind you, I'm not accusing, I'm just raising questions, based on the telltale signs pointed out in the wiki guidelines. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:14, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
