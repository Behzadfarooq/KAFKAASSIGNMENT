<li><b>Keep</b> Why should this be deleted?!?! I believe you owe me an apology.

You poor form is not in keeping with Wikipedia's standards. You have been warned.

<li><b>Keep</b> of course we should keep this. It is quite famous. I see no reason to delete this article. On the contrary, the more articles, the better. I am quite surprised, unpleasantly surprised, by Pinchas' actions in trying to get this article deleted.

<li><b>Semi-related Comment</b> Daniel575, is the title of the article correct? Should it be "Medrash Shmuel" or "Medrash Shmuel (yeshiva)". I'm not familiar with the subject and don't feel qualified to make a decision on it's status, thought you might have some insight into the title though. In addition, I think the nominator is looking for some sources to verify it does exist, perhaps since you are familiar with the subject you could add a couple to help <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> it. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrunkenSmurf_f5fc.html" title="User:DrunkenSmurf">DrunkenSmurf</a> 20:53, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>PinchasC, perhaps note should be taken of the fact that Dev920 thinks every school with over 300 students in it should have a Wikipedia page.

<dd>I agree with Dev. We should have an article on every school. We should have an article on every TREE in SIBERIA, for that matter. The more the better! Well, as long as the articles are of some quality, of course. We agree on that. We don't want 100 million articles all consisting of just one sentence. For the Midrash Shmuel yeshiva, we can definitely write a real article. The Jewish editors can try to find alumni who may be able to prive some more information. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> | <small><i>(talk)</i></small> 01:07, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm changing my vote to <b>keep.</b> This article is decidedly not-notable in its present state. It needs to be expanded upon so as not to be anything other than an advertisement for the Baal Teshuva wing's website. At present, it should be deleted. However, Wikipedia policy (though I imagine it didn't have Yeshivot in contemplation when it wrote its rules) supports keeping articles about post-high school educational institutions. In a way, a Yeshiva is just that. I state my objection to the blanket rule that Wikipedia has adopted. But rules are rules. --<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 16:54, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><strike>Weak</strike> Keep <strike>or Delete</strike></b> While wikipedia does not have a clearly stated notability test for schools, the basic guildlines (outlined here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Schools" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Schools" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Schools</a>) state that post-secondary school's are considered notable. Is a yeshiva, which is a location for advanced study of the Talmud, considered to be post-secondary education? If so, then keep.

<li>This yeshiva is a place where those who finished high school and usually also college study. It is for those 18 years and older. Most students are around 20 to 25 years old, others are 'professional' students, who are married and spend their whole lifes learning. So I assume you'll go for a keep. I almost changed your vote accordingly, but I leave that up to you. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> | <small><i>(talk)</i></small> 01:07, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> because wikipedia tends to keep all schools. My consern is that there is a lack of notable sources about many school. I doubt that there have been any papers or newspaper articles about Medrash shmuel (or almost any yeshiva for that matter).
