<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. The article is important and encyclopedic. VfD is not the place to complain about POV disputes. As far as I can see, this article desparately needs <i>sources</i> to resolve the disputes.

<li><b>Very very very strong keep!</b> The subject of the article is <i>extremely</i> important: the discrepancy between what is known about HIV/AIDS by the scientific community and what is believed by the general public is enormous. And, while Senator Frist doesn't seem to know the difference, an encyclopedia has an obligation to make that distinction. Most of the points in the article ought to be unquestionably verifiable, as long as editors are willing to do a little legwork. The POV and technical issues (like where to say HIV and where to say AIDS) can be cleaned up, but this article needs to stay. I would, however, recommend a <b>move</b> (with an appropriate redirect) to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_misconceptions_about_HIV_and_AIDS_98d6.html" title="Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS">Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS</a> or somesuch to avoid the informal (bordering on incorrect) usage of the terms "myth" and "urban legend". - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara">Che Nuevara, the Democratic Revolutionary</a> 21:37, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - If you are going to lead into a statement with <b>FACT:</b>, you better be able to multi-source your data. I think it is an excellent informational article on an important topic, however, I have to agree with Ryan Delaney that it is not encyclopedic. I would like to see a re-write that includes COMPLTELE sources for ALL statements. If the source was <i>Pasteur et al., 1864</i> it would be fine, however, most of the sources are difficult to confirm without full names, publications, etc. And does it have to look like an 11th grade health class pamphlet? -<a href="../../../a/w/y/User%7EAwyllie_7418.html" title="User:Awyllie">PlainSight</a> 02:46, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>; Well, "Kaput and Zosky" does serve up a fair amount (roughly 6k) of hits. Question is of course if it is a hoax or not. If not, I would vote keep based on the apparent popularity of the cartoon.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Celsius (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Celsius_b615.html" title="Special:Contributions/Celsius">contribs</a>) , at 2005-08-22 02:33:04.</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not unverifiable, just as-yet unverified.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The page contains claims about "Hohobans." The claims are unfortunately unreferenced. There is no actual verification of the existence of the Hohoban, much less any verificatory source that suggests notability sufficient for inclusion in an encyclopedia. WP accepts stubs, but these have guidelines; WP is under no obligation to accept unreferenced, unverified claims, especially those which are in all likelihood hoaxes. Should a claim of authenticity be made via Tony Sidaway's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kaput_and_Z%C3%B6sky&amp;oldid=21534298" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kaput_and_Z%C3%B6sky&amp;oldid=21534298" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> or Lucky's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Hohobans&amp;oldid=21540869" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Hohobans&amp;oldid=21540869" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> posts on the related Talk pages, my vote to delete shall remain almost certainly unchanged; simply because something purpotedly exists should not by any means be taken to suggest it automatically deserves mention in an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Speedy merge and redirect</b>. You definitely had the right idea, Boycottthecaf, but an article can't be redirected once it's deleted. A deletion removes the article space entirely, not just the content. In this case, just perform the merge and make the <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nermal.html" title="Nermal">Nermal</a> page into #REDIRECT [[Garfield]]. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 02:51, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's not imaginary; nor is it a neologism, as the term existed in the 80's.

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I don't have a clue what this is. It appears to be a fictional accounting of a large scale gang war of some kind.

<li>Don't Delete This is not a fictional account of a large scale gang war. That would make for an interesting book though. This is an actual account of a massive multiplayer online game. While I should be the first to say that this is not your normal history, it is in fact a history of a sort. And with a player base of around 50,000 people this would give them the opportunity to visit Wikipedia and to enjoy something of interest to themselves. Thankyou for considering not deleting this peice of online history.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, please note that Wikipedia is not a hosting service. If you indeed have a base 50,000 regular players, a condensed article on the game itself might be useful at Illuminati X, but this is not the place to put a summary or account of an RPG game's history. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:03, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yo Pierce, I just wanted to say I wasnt laughing at the necessary nature of the game or whatever, just the interesting randomness of the events "Emergence of The Bots..." etc. Also I wasnt trying to criticize you or anything, I play MMOPG's and I think the battles are f'in dope I just meant to say that you should edit the article so that it talks about how you had a huge war in your game, talk about what game, how many participated, who participated, the significance etc. If you do that you will get a Keep vote from me and probably others too, atm this is too personal, and personal research-ish to stay on here my man, it wont fly with the others. I just meant to give advice and not hate or sound hostile, readin my comment I can see how that might be interpreted but it wasnt my intention dude, sorry. Keep it wiki! -Wiffle0rz 09:21, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Right, this is a fun one. I'd never heard of a band called <i>Koldfusion</i> despite knowing the Oxford music scene pretty well, so resorted to the dreaded google. Only music related hits I got were for 'Kold Fusion' - who have a stubby allmusic page and one electronica/dance EP release, on <a href="http://www.theorchard.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.theorchard.com/" rel="nofollow">the orchard</a>. So, in short:<br />
- Koldfusion seem to fail <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a><br />
- Kold Fusion also seem to fail <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, having only one release on a 'digital label'<br />

<li><b>Keep.</b> This listing is partly my fault, and I apologise. I left it as a minimal stub, thinking wrongly that <i>Professor Emeritus</i> would be sufficient proof of notability, which in Australia it possibly is, but in the US people we would call Senior Lecturer or Associate Professor seem to be able to use this title automatically after retirement, so in hindsight what I left was a deletable sub-stub. I then got involved in NPOV discussions and didn't get back to expand it, but others now have (thank you).

<li>You seem to be confusing a street with a place. A street is just infrastructure. The 56th Street article does a much better job at detailing the actual street.

<p><b>Comment</b>, do you people really think that someone would have the patience and time to write a lengthy and detailed article about just any old street, unless it was an important 'landmark'? I see no reason for people to want this article to be deleted. The author of the article is clearly trying to illustrate the importance of a street which is considered to be of some significance in Tsawwassen, British Columbia. No one should judge this article simply because they have never heard of it nor seen it. I'm sure there are many of you who don't know what the Blarney Stone is, but if I told you it was a mere rock that was of historical and mythical value to the people of Ireland would <b>you</b> all vote for that article to be deleted? <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 03:04, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Counter-Comment</b>, I realize that many people define their sense of space through their local street system. However, this does not make sreets places in themselves. The vast majority are no-man's-land in which no life can exist on them for very long. Yes, some streets have grown culturally important and evolve a life of their own and these deserve <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway.html" title="Broadway">articles</a>. (But) secondly, streets are not notable because what they are associated with. Would I be notable if I had Bill Gates and Michael Jordan living on either side of me? Are streets notable because of a notable business or landmark that exists on their flanks? Thirdly, nobody goes to a street. Streets are the means to achieve an end, and not an end it itself. If you told me that every sinlge citizen of that town used that street twice a day, I would say "Hey, that street should be mentioned in the <b>town's</b> article." If you can muster enough information on the street (that is relevant, on-topic and not duplicated in the town's article) to make the town's article uncomfortably long, then it would justify its own article. The point I'm making? The contents of this article should be moved to the town's article because it is locally important (in terms of access and infrastructure) but means nothing to the rest of the world. Btw, I thought the Blarney Stone was just a great pub in <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastown.html" title="Gastown">Gastown</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 05:36, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>OR, to start with, and the conclusions are inherently flawed. If there were some way to count the number of edits from each specific country in all Wikipedias and compare that with the country's populations and internet penetration, you might have some acceptable research. But this one is so fatally flawed by false assumptions that it is next to worthless. It assumes, for example, that no one from one country can speak a language which is not that country's primary language. That no Americans speak Spanish, for instance, and that no mainland Europeans speak English. This assumption is so clearly false as to render the statistics meaningless. How many English Wikipedians do you know not from "English-speaking" countries? Hell, there are a dozen of more English <i>admins</i> that are not from "English-speaking" countries (Joy, for instance, and Ahoerstemeier and Wilfried Derksen, to name just two more).

<dd>Let me clarify something else--- I agree with Paul August and DS1953 that of course Wikipedia growth will be haphazard and therefore it will frequently happen that some towering figure in field F has no biography while lesser figures already have theirs. Of course, the solution then is to write the missing biography! But again, I think a good biography should not leave the average reader with serious doubt about whether or not the subject of the biography is suitable for inclusion in the Wikipedia.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 23:30, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Paul, just to clarify: my concern is not really with possible Slavic boosterism (no-one has exactly come forward to explain the origin of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Slovenian_mathematicians_1d0d.html" title="List of Slovenian mathematicians">List of Slovenian mathematicians</a>, but comments from a few users seem to support my guess that some math person active in the Slovenian wiki decided to tranlate a list there into English and port it to this one, without really thinking through the implications), but with making the math pages less useful as an <i>encyclopedia</i>. The discussions you pointed me at leave me unimpressed; I simply don't think they are relevant to the special needs of the math students (at all levels) whom these pages <i>exist to serve</i> (in my opinion). Wikipedia is not paper? The point is, Wikipedia can be <i>better</i> than paper (as an encylopedia), in fact, it could be so good (as an encyclopedia), that it's worth trying to make it as good as it can be!---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 08:54, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>None. Your website is not notable, it does not pass the Alexa text and there are thousands of other podcasting sites that do not have articles here. And from the admission above that the members of the site created the article, that is clearly vanity.

<p>Your arrogance and lack of flexibility will be your demise... and when do you see so much talent and creativity on a youth network? That's rare-- podcast directories have no spark.

<p>Listen, my jerk roommate won't stay the hell off of my computer. All of this is really pissing me off. I just wanted to make an entry about a site I felt deserved recognition. There are plenty of other personal sites (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_Page_In_The_Universe_fa9e.html" title="The Best Page In The Universe">The Best Page In The Universe</a> Homstarrunner) that have had entries put up.

<dd>Part of the job of being a professor is to be an advisor, so that part is not notable. So his claim to notability, according to you, rests strictly on co-founding a newspaper.

<dd><i>Part of the job of being a professor is to be an advisor, so that part is not notable.</i> - That is a non sequitur, as it is dependent on how you evaluate things in the first place. Part of the job of being a professional baseball player is playing baseball. Besides all kinds of Pokemon cruft, Wikipedia includes anyone who plays any sport professionally, mostly people of no interest except to the fans of that particular team. This, admittedly, is rather convenient, as it avoids most VfD discussions over sportspeople, so I don't really want to change it. But, to use CH's comparison below, I do not consider a baseball hall-of-famer to be anywhere close in status to somebody winning a major, international scientific award like the Fields Medal. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 05:28, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was not meant seriously. My main motivation in these VFDs so far is that unless a person is just super-famous, they should have some particular reason for being on Wikipedia, so their bios aren't orphaned. If there is an interesting math result that would link to their bio, great. Otherwise, there should be some particularly compelling reason other than "there's already a lot of junk on Wikipedia".

<dd>It's not clear that publishing 80 papers alone makes one notable. I've seen C.V.s cluttered with scads of nonsense or almost identical "papers", even in math. No idea about this man's C.V.; I'm just saying that this <i>alone</i> is a worthless criterion for math biographies. Really, evidence of widespread recognition of significant work is the touchstone. There are plenty of ways to validate that criterion, e.g. by checking for mention in good review papers, in relevent textbooks (using common sense; very recent work probably won't be in the textbooks yet, e.g Wile's theorem took several years to make it into a proper textbook), etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the lesson which is emerging here is that non-mathematicians should be circumspect about creating math biographies; if you can't convince the <i>math literate users</i> that the subject is mathematically notable, then unless you're writing about someone who achieved notoriety in a non-mathematical context, expect the article to be proposed for deletion repeatedly.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 08:35, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Romanm, I'm glad you enjoyed (apparently) taking the course, but if you really meant to imply that "he was my professor once" is grounds for notability, I doubt very many would agree with you! Founding a now defunct newspaper in Slovenia? Might be notable enough for the Slovenian language wikipedia, but is that really notable enough for the English language one? How many newspapers have been founded around the world in the past two centuries?

<dd>That's right, I certainly never had any doubt that he exists, that his uni exists, that he works there as a professor, or the other facts of his life as given in the article. My problem is that no-one has told me why any of that information is sufficiently <i>interesting</i> to belong in an encyclopedia article. The only cure is for someone to describe a clearly interesting/important mathematical result clearly enough for me to agree that P has done something sufficiently notable in mathematics (or for some other good reason) for these mundane details (that he exists, where he went to school, where he works) to possibly interest a general audience in an English language encyclopedia. Again, my problem is simply this: I don't think it should happen that after reading a Wikipedia biography, a general reader has no idea why anyone would think that the subject is sufficiently notable for such a biography.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 07:12, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I am not a specialist in this field, and after having a brief glance at your presentation page, I actually believe I know about graph theory much less than you do. Still, even though I have a rather high oppinion about your credentials, I don't believe the decision on whether to keep or delete a biography should be left to an individual's "feeling". We do need an agreed-on set of criteria about what qualifies for a matematics biography and what does not. And, unless I am wrong, we don't have it yet. Furthermore, as I argue below, I believe that the question you have opened concerns more the organization of articles in a usable manner rather than the sole existance of articles. Cluttering the Wikipedia might indeed be felt as a problem when you browse the article. Often, however, you simply search for a particular article, either using Google or Wikipedia search function. There, having more articles are a clear bonus. OTOH, I would speculate though that the ratio between searching and browsing the English Wikipedia is higher among non-native speakers of English, who often just try to find a particular article rather than browse a category. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterlin_b101.html" title="User:Peterlin">Peterlin</a> 08:46, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Without clearly defined rules, I wouldn't have the guts to call <i>any</i> professional in <i>any</i> field "non-notable". There are of course many possible ways where to cut the list, e.g. a theorem is named after him/her, is a recipient of Fields Medal, is the editor of a major scientific journal (what is a "major" scientific journal? measured by its impact factor?), has published an important scientific monograph (what is an "important" monograph?), won a tenure, earned a PhD, etc. Any criterion is equally legitimate, if it is agreed on. Wikipedia not being limited by paper, I would vote for a wider coverage rather than a narrower, but this is just my oppinion. But first of all we need an agreement about who does qualify as "notable" and does not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With English being a modern <i>lingua franca</i>, I believe that the "English" Wikipedia should strive to serve as a reference aimed at an audience wider than Americans, Englishmen, Scotsmen, Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders put together. English Wikipedia continues to grow and mature not only because of the contributions of native English speakers, but also because of the contributions of other peoples around the world. I am also not sure there is a consensus about which topics are interesting and important enough for the English speaking readers to be included in the English language Wikipedia. The argument doesn't hold even if the English language Wikipedia <i>would be</i> limited to native English speaking world. We probably all agree that articles in geography, zoology or botany describing topics not present in the English speaking world should remain in the English language Wikipedia. What is so different with biographies of foreign nationals? I am actually surprised by these cleansing tendencies in the English Wikipedia. Personally, I would be delighted to have short biographies of all American professors of mathematics along with all American professional baseball players in the Slovenian Wikipedia, and the only problem concerning this I percieve is that probably nobody is willing to write them up.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterlin_b101.html" title="User:Peterlin">Peterlin</a> 13:44, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Peterlin, I <i>agree</i> with you that the English language Wikipedia is also the default lingua franca encyclopedia, and should strive to serve students and people all over the world. My concern is precisely that allowing unlimited cruft, <i>particulary in the math pages</i> to clutter up the encyclopedia will cause it to become unusable. Specifically: there are enough truly "notable" mathematicians to populate categories like <a href="../../../a/l/g/Category%7EAlgebraic_graph_theory_0592.html" title="Category:Algebraic graph theory">Category:Algebraic graph theory</a> with a dozen or more biographies. I feel that we need to keep the number of articles in each category to a few dozen at the most, but I hate to think of creating an even more complicated category tree than is already forced upon the math editors by the complexity of our subject. This is why I say that we can't get away with applying rules which originate in the sports pages everywhere, certainly not in the math pages.</dd>

I still feel that the case has <i>not</i> been made that the remaining two individuals are anywhere near notable to require a biography here. They might well be notable enough for the Slovenian wikipedia, but what about the Urdu wikipedia? The Finnish wikipedia? Are they notable enough for these, or for the English/lingua franca wikipedia?

<dd>I think I understand your concern. But I believe that it mostly concerns the organization of lists and categories, rather than the existance of the articles itself. It is completely clear to me that all the profesors of mathematics from around the world can not fit onto, say, a List of Mathematicians. The same goes for the categories. I believe though that with introducing a proper hierarchy a biography list can still remain manageable. I agree with you though that we don't want <a href="../../../a/l/g/Category%7EAlgebraic_graph_theory_0592.html" title="Category:Algebraic graph theory">Category:Algebraic graph theory</a> being cluttered by thousands (I am wildly guessing the number of people working in this field) of biographies of researchers. But I would move them to a separate subcategory within this category, say Category:Researchers in algebraic graph theory or simply Category:Algebraic graph theorists, then, once necessary, subdivide this category alphabetically, by country, by field of work or by some other means. There can be of course also some wiser way of organizing categories – from the usability point of view, there is probably some maximal depth of hierarchies that should not be exceeded without harming the usability of the Wikipedia itself. As for your other question – I cannot speak on behalf of the Urdu Wikipedia, but I certainly wouldn't mind having the content of Urdu Wikipedia – including the biographies of all Pakistani professors present there – translated to Slovenian and appearing in Slovenian wikipedia. With a proper organization, I don't believe they can harm anybody. Considering the number of people fluent in both Urdu (the situation with Finnish is a little better, but not much) and Slovenian, I don't consider this a realistic option, though. In fact, the most likely way for Slovenian Wikipedia to ever get some potentially interesting article from the Urdu Wikipedia is that the article is translated from Urdu to English and published in the English Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterlin_b101.html" title="User:Peterlin">Peterlin</a> 08:46, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Peterlin, yes, I think we agree on many points. You are right, I have no objection in principle to mindless lists, I just want to be sure cruft doesn't adversely affect the experience of readers who really need to find some information here. Of course it occured to me that one can try to handle this by moving cruft into tailor-made "cruft categories", but my objections to that are:
<ol>
<li>it is all too easy for vandals to move cruft right back, in fact to move articles arbitrarily. You probably know some robovandals are doing just that; so far, this hasn't been a huge problem in these pages, but it's worrisome because even the small amount of this which has happened so far has clearly been a real headache for the admins.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>to whom would the task of this endless subdivision of mindless categories to organize all the cruft fall? Why, to those who care about not impacting the experience of serious students, namely you and I! I don't have time to spend doing that, and you probably don't either.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Unless "cruft control" can be automated (potentially dangerous, since recognizing cruft might sometimes require expert judgement), I still think it's only a matter of time before everyone sees cruft as a serious problem. Maybe participants in the Math Wiki project should set up a page to discuss formulating an "official policy". I am still a neophyte in such things, so I don't really know how policy issues are handled here.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 11:18, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm... just noticed that "Tomo" might be short for "Tomaz", as in "TP". I have no reason to think "Tomo" is TP, but this raises another point about mathematical biographies. The Wiki guidelines apparently do allow people to write their own biographies, so long as the article is factual/NPOV, and so long as the subject clearly meets the "notability" criterion. (As I think we've seen here, this criterion might be too imprecise, and setting the bar too low might cripple Wikipedia as more robovandals become active here, simply because the more articles exist, the harder it is to organize them, keep track of them, e.g. move them back when WoW moves them. So even if "Tomo" really were TP, my principal objection would not be to "self-promotion", but to <i>failure to explain why TP is notable</i> to mathematical audience which presumably includes the users most likely folk to be browsing <a href="../../../a/l/g/Category%7EAlgebraic_graph_theory_0592.html" title="Category:Algebraic graph theory">Category:Algebraic graph theory</a>. <i>The current article makes no case at all</i> that will impress we hard-nosed "show me" mathminded users, so, please, Tomo, fix up the article to explain why TP is notable. And why not write a biography of White? And improve the biography of Tutte, someone we all agree is a truly notable figure in math history?

<li>lukewarm <b>keep</b>; the citation in Cameron's review suggests that Marusic is an accomplished research mathematician whose work is recognized as useful by an international authority, which I guess convinces me that M "plays in the major leagues". Although I have to say that there must be dozens more who fit that bill, just in this one field. We need to always ensure that category pages never list more than perhaps a few dozen articles. If we had hundreds of pages on algebraic graph theorists alone, we'd have to have an even deep categorization tree, but I hate to think of getting any more specialized than the topic "algebraic graph theory" already is. Math is complicated enough without letting foolish prattle about "precedents" from the sports pages, for gosh sakes, mess up the experience of math students who could otherwise benefit from this encyclolpedia. The problem is that the more we <i>try</i> to include, the longer it will take for Wikipedia to achieve a more balanced coverage, which is <i>absolutely neccessary</i> for Wikipedia to be a really useful and reliable resource for anyone who needs to find information about some mathematical topic. I mean, c'mon, we need to employ some intelligence here. Clearly standards appropriate for sports fans can be inappropriate and even <i>disastrous</i> in more intellectually challenging pursuits. Math is not really very comparable to sports, and helping people find and absorb information about mathematical subjects calls for very different organizational principles than writing the sports pages.</li>

<dd>For the benefit of latecomers: yes, I started this VfD, and yes, I did change my vote (see discussion below). Originally I wrote: <i>Delete or else expand the biography to explain or at least describe a notable theorem or whatever. In lieu of that, Marusic has no preprints listed on the <a href="../../../a/r/x/ArXiv_671d.html" title="ArXiv">arXiv</a> and I've certainly never seen any papers by him, hence my nomination.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Looks like this article will survive, but <i>it should be rewritten</i> by someone who actually knows M's work, or at least knows algebraic graph theory. I don't really want to take the time myself, but it seems that while I doubt there can be very many Slovenian mathematicians in the world, some of them happen to be Wikipedians (and might even have written or contributed to this article), so I urge them to dig up some papers by M, bone up, and <i>add to the article an explanation of the substance of at least one clearly interesting and important result of Marusic.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, my bottom line is that I think that every mathematical biography should include a description of at least one clearly notable mathematical achievement of the subject. Let's drop the silly sports analogy at this point because it is clearly not serving our purposes here. <i>We want Wikipedia to be a valuable encyclopedia for a wide audience</i>. Those who come here searching for sports statistics may well have a legitimate need for articles on every major league baseball player from the beginning of time. That all inclusive umbrella might be appropriate in the sports pages, but <i>it is not appropriate in the math pages</i>, whose readers consist of students who need to get good information quickly about a subject which is inherently difficult, confusing, and daunting to newbies. We can't drive them away by allowing unlimited cruft in the math pages. Rather, we must above all guide them to good information which is genuinely useful to them. Among many other things, this means good categorization, which in turn means: no cruft. <i>Cruft must be strongly discouraged in the math pages</i>.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 21:56, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It may be the premier science prize in Slovenia. The question is if that makes it notable. Has anyone outside of Slovenia ever heard of it? A Google search indicates to me that the answer is no.

<dd>Quick translation:</dd>
<dd>prof. dr. Dragan Marusic - Zois prize for scientific achievements at the field of graphy theory and algebra.</dd>
<dd>Dragan Marusic, professor at the pedagogical faculity at the University of Ljubljana, is one of the leading slovenian mathematicians, and is also known around the world. His main area of scientific work is algebraic graph theory, where he explores the symmetries of graphs and the workings of finite groups on combinatorical objects. He is the founder of algebraic graph theory and the theory of permutation groups in Slovenia, where he has taught a group of co-workers which is now well known around the world.</dd>
<dd>The main scientific opus lies with the research into half-transitive graphs and their classification. The sequence of his work on this area reached its apex in the accurate description of transitive permutation groups with their mirrored orbits of length two. This enables the description of orbital graphs of length four and the complete characterisation of the stabilising crossings. This deep and important result got a wide response in the world. Professor Marusic also achieved important results in other areas such as Hamilton paths and cycles in Cayley graphs, and in the research of half-symmetric graphs. He has published his results in 52 original scientific papers in international journals, from this there were 32 articles in the last seven years. His work is often cited by other authors, and he has presented his work at various international mathematical conferences and foreign universities.</dd>
<dd>prof. Marusic is one of the most visible researchers in the field of finite groups on graphs. His research work is characterised by deepness and a well of ideas, and the findings of totally new methods at solving problems. His results on half-transitive graphs have opened new ways of development on that area. Much of his work presents a lasting contribution to the knowledge of mankind.</dd>
<dd>(I apologise for any errors or possible mistranslations of mathematical terms (I'm going to FMF this fall). Based on this I'd say keep, but I will not vote.) 193.77.153.149 16:39, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow, thanks much, 193.77.153.149, whoever you are. This is very helpful, and gives us a much better idea of what this Zois award is all about. The sentence <i>He is the founder of algebraic graph theory and the theory of permutation groups in Slovenia, where he has taught a group of co-workers which is now well known around the world</i> clearly means the Marusic has <i>founded the Slovenian school of algebraic graph theory</i>, meaning that before he came along, this wasn't being taught at the graduate level and research in this subject was not done in Slovenia. I'll take the Zois award committee's word for this, since this claim certainly seems plausible.</dd>

<dd>From the time I spend trying to promulgate the Joy of Math here and elsewhere, it should be obvious that I take my hat off to anyone who is a successful and accomplished educator, and I acknowledge that far fewer can teach at the graduate level than at the undergraduate level, because to supervise doctoral students of your own you must have enough ideas for yourself as well as for your students. Founding a school of subject X in your native country is a significant accomplishment of which anyone should be proud. However, with all due respect, hundreds of professors could credibly teach graduate students the basics of algebraic graph theory, and there must be dozens of mathematicians who could supervise doctoral students in this field, so I am not sure that (in the baseball analogy), we are really out of the minor leagues yet.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well-written award citations usually state the most important reason for the award first, and I take this to mean that the Zois award was given to M primarily in recognition of his service to the developoment of mathematical research in Slovenia. At this point, I observe that since this came up, I noticed that the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Slovenian_mathematicians_1d0d.html" title="List of Slovenian mathematicians">List of Slovenian mathematicians</a> apparently first arose in the Slovenian language Wikipedia, and then someone, mabye 93.77.153.149, translated this list into English and put it here. Now cross-fertilization between the various Wikipedias is obviously a good thing, but I also think that some sensitivity is appropriate to whether a translation of everything which is appropriate/timely/important for the Slovenian language Wikipedia is important for the English language Wikipedia. Going the other way, guessing that say Cricket is not a popular sport in say Finland, translating pages on cricket from the English language encylcopedia into Finnish is probably a waste of time; anyone who can translate English to Finnish should be translating the math content articles&#160;:-/ And going the other way, translating any good articles on indubitably interesting Finnish mathematicians (I can think of a few) into English.</dd>

<dd>32 papers in 5 years could be very impressive output, or not, since it is an apolitical fact that the quality of journals varies very considerably even in English, and it is true that the highest quality work does tend to appear in the major journals in the major mathematical languages (English, French, German, and a few others; the roster is generally agreed upon, although it has changed over time, as you would expect is probably becoming less eurocentric, and I stress that I am not denying that important papers have appeared in more obscure languages like Ukrainian, and that I am not denying the possibility that important papers are appearing right now in some of the many languages which very few "Western" mathematicians read). My point is that it is not clear from this figure along that everyone would agree that M is a truly major player in the international mathematics scene. Again, I am now convinced is a major player in Slovenian mathematics, but I don't think that alone would make him a notable person in the English speaking world.</dd>

<dd>I happen to have read some of the literature about <i>Hamilton paths and cycles in Cayley graphs</i> a few years back, so I know that Peter J. Cameron is a leading authority on permutation groups in the international mathematics scene who has written a recent survey paper which I happen to have right... (mumble, mumble). Ah-<i>haaaa</i>!!! Here we go, Cameron does cite Marusic's paper on vertix symmetric digraphs, and one other. Ok, 2 out out of 104 papers. OK, at least some of M's papers are internationally known and recognized as significant. What we need now is a recent survey of algebraic graph theory... Hmm... I am not finding one on the <a href="../../../a/r/x/ArXiv_671d.html" title="ArXiv">arXiv</a>, although we all know that some extremely valuable papers are never listed there, including the one by Cameron I just used. The books I mentioned are too old to take account of any recent work by Marusic.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, bottom line; the article should have been written by someone who actually knew enough about M's work to describe his work, and anyone who knows that much would probably know the literature sufficiently well to be able to judge its importance. At this point, I am convinced that Marusic is an active research who has done some good work, so he must be a competent mathematician and a dedicated teacher. I guess I could change my own vote to an abstention or even a weak keep, if that is allowed.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 20:52, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

For my own voting, I assume that college professors fall into a type of bell curve and that the "average" includes the middle part of the bell. You can't really put a percentage on it, but as I apply the test, it would not be limited to the top 2 or 3% of professors nor would it sweep in 49%, but rather somewhere in the middle. I think any professor in any country that receives national recognition, like the Zois prize (whatever that may be) must certainly stand out from the "average professor". Finally, though this is an English language encyclopedia, we need to be careful not to concentrate our <i>coverage</i> in favor of English-speaking areas. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 14:40, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I notice that you avoid my question above: if an individual is above average for a Slovenian professor, but is well below average (or at best average) internationally, are we supposed to lower the bar for this individual to be in Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> 16:34, August 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I didn't see your question above. My personal answer would be that I would <i>not</i> knowingly lower the bar to admit a professor whose qualifications are sub par simply because the poor quality of academics in his country makes him notable among his own peers. Obviously all of this is very subjective, however. The fact that a professor from a small country may not have as many English language papers published, or even present as many papers in total, as a comparable level professor at a publish-or-perish American university does not necessarily mean than his contributions are less notable. For my vote, receiving a national prize will generally tip the scales in favor of keeping the individual in a vfd vote. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 17:12, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, stop, let's not go there, because nobody is implying that Slovenians are less capable than other folk. Lots of academics get some kind of award at some point during their careers, so just getting an award by itself doesn't mean much. I think Chan-Ho is just saying that this particular award might refer to a limited pool. I.e. if there are only 100 Slovenian mathematicians, and if (as I guess) this award only goes to Slovenian nationals, then <i>by itself</i>, the fact that M has recieved it might not imply that he's very notable compared to an international award for which the pool would be the tens of thousands of active research mathematicians around the world.

<dd>The useful evidence is not the prize citation, but the keywords which led me to look at a review paper by a mathematician who's work I know and admire (and who I know is an internationally known authority), Peter J. Cameron, where I found that PJC does indeed cite the work of Marusic. The award itself probably doesn't mean much at the international level; the citation in Cameron's revivew is much more impressive. What the heck, I'll change my vote to a weak keep.</dd>

They are likely to be math students, and unlikely to be Slovenian or to know personally the subject.

<li>You're right, my stated reason was a little flip, but my point was that I think it's <i>inherently</i> a man page, I can't really see how it could ever be properly encyclopedic, without duplicating too much information that would more properly be (and already is) on a central, non-particular-implementation-specific <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff.html" title="Diff">diff</a> page. <a href="../../../u/m/m/User%7EUmmit_38d5.html" title="User:Ummit">Steve Summit</a> (<a href="../../../u/m/m/User_talk%7EUmmit_97c6.html" title="User talk:Ummit">talk</a>) 02:25, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

I suggest the answer to the following question as at least a guideline: "Did anyone else care enough about the software to review it?" In cases of software products that would probably be universally considered notable, such as <a href="../../../p/k/z/PKZip_1a6d.html" title="PKZip">PKZip</a> or <a href="../../../p/c/_/PC_Tools_6d1b.html" title="PC Tools">PC Tools</a>, that is the case, as such products have many reviews in computer magazines and the like. However, for this package I haven't yet located anything other than simple reprints of the "blurb on the side of the box" (sometimes thinly disguised, and mostly as product descriptions in on-line catalogues). You <i>might</i> be able to sway editors' opinions, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Nisnevich_abd5.html" title="User:Alex Nisnevich">User:Alex Nisnevich</a>, if you can locate reviews of this package, to show that people have actually considered the software notable enough that they have written and published articles that focus upon it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:55:50, 2005-08-22 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure this can be the sole criterion for determining the notability of software (and I don't think you're suggesting it should be). We have articles on a lot of traditional Unix system software, such as <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff.html" title="Diff">diff</a>, <a href="../../../d/d/_/Dd.html" title="Dd">dd</a>, <a href="../../../c/m/p/Cmp.html" title="Cmp">cmp</a>, <a href="../../../l/s/_/Ls.html" title="Ls">ls</a>, <a href="../../../m/v/_/Mv.html" title="Mv">mv</a>, <a href="../../../c/p/_/Cp.html" title="Cp">cp</a>, even Unix system calls like <a href="../../../m/m/a/Mmap.html" title="Mmap">mmap</a>. I'd be surprised to find a serious review of <a href="../../../c/p/_/Cp.html" title="Cp">cp</a> somewhere ("All those of you who thought 'cat foo &gt; bar' was great, wait till you try 'cp foo bar'! A++++++"). --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 04:12, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Prepare to be surprised. You might not find a <i>review</i>, in the magazine sense of the term, but you'll find that for those programs, people indeed <i>have</i> "written and published articles that focus upon them". People write "<a href="../../../u/s/e/Useless_use_of_cat.html" title="Useless use of cat">Useless use of cat</a>" articles about <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_%28Unix%29_14b9.html" title="Cat (Unix)">cat</a>. If you look at the references section for <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff.html" title="Diff">diff</a> you'll find that there's an <i>entire book</i> on that command. People have actually written <i>teaching courses</i> that focus on on <a href="../../../c/p/_/Cp_%28Unix%29_bcd4.html" title="Cp (Unix)">cp</a>, <a href="../../../m/v/_/Mv.html" title="Mv">mv</a>, and <a href="../../../l/s/_/Ls.html" title="Ls">ls</a> (<a href="http://www.batky-howell.com/courses/datasheets/products/funds_pf.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.batky-howell.com/courses/datasheets/products/funds_pf.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> <a href="http://www.bluestarlearning.com/linux_training_ln1.aspx?classid=4680" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bluestarlearning.com/linux_training_ln1.aspx?classid=4680" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="http://www.linux.org/lessons/beginner/l6/lesson6c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.linux.org/lessons/beginner/l6/lesson6c.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>). And, yes, if you look at the references section of <a href="../../../m/m/a/Mmap.html" title="Mmap">mmap</a> you'll see that people <i>have</i> written programming guides that focus upon it, too.
<p>The fundamental point is that people, independent of the original author, have actually considered the software notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works of their own that focus upon it, be those works magazine reviews, teaching courses, books, programming guides, or other commentaries. So, for example, if someone had written a book on <a href="../../../e/x/a/ExamDiff_fdf1.html" title="ExamDiff">ExamDiff</a> for <a href="../../../o/27/r/O%27Reilly_Media_64bd.html" title="O'Reilly Media">O'Reilly Media</a>, or a teaching course that specifically addressed it as a topic, then those would be arguments that could be used to sway editors' opinions towards keeping an article on the subject. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:41:25, 2005-08-23 (UTC)</p>

<li>The current page looks like an advert to me still, or part of an advert, the "Technical details" section often found in online ads for software. The presnece of a list of 'features" simply screams advertisement to me.

<li>This article is a discussion of the various different combinations of stadia and feet, remen or nibw tthat either make Eratosthenes calculations work or not work. Just because Egil lacks the knowledgebase to see the value in this discussion doesn't mean it should be deleted or redirected. Its too much info to put in the main page and properly focused on just what it says it is focused on.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is <b>not</b> about a specific, distinguished-from-others-by-the-Eratosthenes-name variety of the units of measure called stadia. Rather, it is known that Eratosthenes used stadia of some sort or another, and that he got the number of 250,000 (probably not 252,000) of them in the circumference of the Earth. This article is speculative stuff about possible theories which would fit that 250,000 to 252,000 and make it very close to modern values for the circumference of the Earth, and make it part of some system supposedly hardwired into the human brain or something like that. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 13:51, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
