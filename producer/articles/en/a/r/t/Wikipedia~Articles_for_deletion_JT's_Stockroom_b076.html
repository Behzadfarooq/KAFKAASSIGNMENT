<li><b>Keep</b> -- this entry deserves to exist in the same way that it would be mentioned at a museum. i used encyclopedias as a kid in order to research topics, their history, etc... if you wanted to research the origins of the sex toy industry, and this couldn't exist on wikipedia, you'd have to take everyone's word for it based on what is on their commercial websites. isn't this supposed to be an unbiased source of that information? i think the entry should exist. i think that there is not enough information on here yet, but that's what's great about wikipedia. its entries can be improved with time.

The statement about being the first sex toy company online (and also one of the oldest e-commerce companies of any kind) is true and verifiable. You can search on deja.com for the original company name, JT Toys, and you will find references dating to May of 1990. <a href="../../../j/t/40/User%7EJt%40stockroom.com_a31e.html" title="User:Jt@stockroom.com">jt@stockroom.com</a></li>

<li>We are a 15-year old internet company. We're well-known and highly regarded within the alternative-sexuality communities we serve, and have aspired to a high ethical standard for as long as we've been in business. As a result, I've become accustomed to a warm reception 99% of the time when we reach out on the net. In this case, I simply assumed that since there were so many entries for companies of all kinds (including adult ones) that starting an entry wouldn't be a problem. Others would be free to edit or add to it. But it seems people object to having an entry for my company, and we don't really want to be where we are apparently not welcome. So I'll offer no further comments or argument. <a href="../../../j/t/40/User%7EJt%40stockroom.com_a31e.html" title="User:Jt@stockroom.com">jt@stockroom.com</a> 10:06, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Let me assure you that it's nothing personal, and we don't mean to be hostile. It's just that we deal with dozens of deletion requests per day, so we tend to be a little short-spoken about them. It happens quite often that people create pages about their own websites or small companies, in order to promote them or simply to have a page here. I'm <i>not</i> saying that you did just that, but it is generally assumed that if you (or your company) are famous, someone else will write an article about you. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:45, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The company allegedly serves a pretty wide community, not just some narrow niche for toenail-fetishists.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a reputable company and they were pioneers in the early days of online commerce. I found them online in the early 90s and still have one of the very first catalogs. It was sent to me via email after I found them in different bulletin boards I visited. The Stockroom has always been a good source of quality toys. I think they should stay.Trab 8:57am, 5 Apr 2005 (CST)

<li><b>KEEP</b>: The Stockroom really is the oldest adult toy company online (started back in the time when .gov and .edu were the only networks). I think this gives it historical value and a reason to be listed on Wikipedia. As far as BDSM, Fetish, and the history of Sex Toys and the Internet go, the site would be incomplete without at least making reference to this trailblazing company. - Juli Crockett, 9:16am 5 Apr 2005</li>
<li><b>Provisional Keep</b> If this information is verified, then this is notable sex toy company and thus encyclopedic. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 16:47, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>: The Stockroom is a fixture within the BDSM community, and has been since the beginning of the internet. They help BDSM/fetish/kink groups in countless ways, and have been a pillar of the community. They strive to educate people, and present a beautiful aesthetic which you don't see on the newer "sex toy" sites. They seem to work hard to be more than just a company selling the best BDSM products, they care very much about the community they serve. - JH 9:46AM 5 Apr 2005

<li><b>Keep</b> and I'll add that it needs additional writing or a re-write so the copy feels less self-congratulatory. Yes, this is my first Wiki Edit. I was also contacted by a friend telling me the Stockroom was up for deletion and I disagree with that choice so I've decided to comment. I use Wiki daily but haven't feelt comfortable editing - it's clearly not my forte. <b>BUT!</b> It's true that the Stockroom was a pioneer in selling sex toys online and most importantly, they made readily available BDSM basic supplies early in the game. While many of you may not be familiar with the BDSM world and how the internet has greatly changed the way we traffic in this business, I am quite familiar. I can say, although not encyclopedically, that The Stockroom has had a major effect on bringing BDSM into the glowy light of our computer monitors and basically out of the dungeon. Sex and the internet are tied to one another and it's quickly becoming true that BDSM and the internet are nearly inseparable - certainly if you're working as a professional Dominatrix, as I am. JTs is rather crucial to the BDSM industry and with their attractive catalogues, website, and ability to create catalogues for both men and women, they have really cleaned up the image of BDSM and made it more accessible and a lot safer for those looking to experiment. The impact that JTs and its imitators has on Joe Blow From Idaho is astounding - the dark and mysterious objects fantasized about secretly now have pictures, descriptions, improvements, and are at the fingertips and available for experimentation from the comfort of the home. I think that's important. Just like books and DVDs - or Cloisonne Boxes on Ebay - I believe the effect is there. The tools of the trade were exceptionally hard to come by in the 80s and earlier and there was very little variation - by opening the online doors for BDSM and sex toy sales it really brought the business up several notches as well as private interaction. It's hard to put this in terms I feel are best for shorthand and Wikipedia, so I'll stop. In my experience the impact has been felt in a prfound and positive way and if you have questions I'll be happy to try to answer those specifically. (I've 12 years in the business and 6 more privately before that time). I do think the entry needs re-working but not a full deletion. M. Violet 05:25, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> For the reasons given above by Mviolet. Notable, in its context. Article needs serious editing for NPOV, though.

<li>This company's alexa rank is currently running in the 40,000s. Looking at the history, alexa rank has been highly variable but never better than 20,000. $5 M revenues makes this a pretty small company. While there are no hard and fast rules for companies, these are smaller than we generally keep. I'm a bit skeptical of the claim that they were first to sell to this niche via Internet and changed the industry. There were anonymous mail order companies before. Finally, the fact that the article was started by the founder counts against it. I believe the logic behind <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">no autobiographies</a> applies here as well. I have to vote <b>delete</b> for now but I'll look at the article again toward the end of the discussion period to see if Mviolet's edits can change my mind. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:08, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b>. Don't you remember the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">no original research</a> thingy?

<li>While your sarcasm is irritating &amp; smacks of what is distasteful about online "community", I agree that I don't have verifiable sources for their affect on the industry other than experience &amp; observation. Reading the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">No original research</a> article, we're back to square one of their being original sellers of sextoys online (provable) &amp; the rest is experienced opinion. Which is all I'm offering - another side to this reactionary delete-fest. I'm just here to give perspective on a company &amp; industry I'm familiar with and others are not. M. Violet 23:35, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Experienced opinion" is exactly is out of place according to the policy in question. As for sarcasm, didn't I say "welcome"? It means that I have nothing against the topic itself, nor against the contributor.
