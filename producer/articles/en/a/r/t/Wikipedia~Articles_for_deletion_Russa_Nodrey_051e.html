<dd><b>Comment</b> You might want to take a look at some of the other articles in <a href="../../../r/e/d/Category%7ERedwall_characters_98ae.html" title="Category:Redwall characters">Category:Redwall characters</a>. She's actually a fairly important character in the book she appears in. Frankly, I'd rather see most of these merged into a List of Redwall Characters. I don't think they each need their own article. However, at the moment they all seem to have their own stub articles. If she's deleted, then most of the rest should be. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 20:37, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Slightly irrelevant comment</b> She does matter in subsequent books; she dies in the Long Patrol and a baby is named after her. This baby (grown up) is the hero of the next book.</li>

<li>This looks suspiciously like a walled garden to me.

<hr />
<p><b>Idea</b> I've been thinking about the Redwall articles for a while. The <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redwall.html" title="Redwall">Redwall</a> series is a massive series of books written by one Brian Jacques. There are nearly 30 books in or related to the series (this includes a cookbook, and several illustrated picture-books). It is a hugely popular series among people my age (I was 6 when the first book came out in 1986) and younger. There are movie and tv-series spin-offs from this. They are aimed at older children.</p>
<p>Right now the treatment of Redwall on Wikipedia is a little disorganized and haphazard. There is a article on the series as a whole; articles on each and every book in the series and on most of the companion books; articles on each of the important characters from the books; and articles on each major location in the fictional universe. I don't believe there is a wikiproject to coordinate the treatment of these articles.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't think that having isolated articles on each character is a good way to go about doing this. Like I said earlier, I think a good idea would be to merge these articles and consolidate them in list form. Currently my thinking is a main List of Redwall Characters with sections for each book. As the information is moved from the characters individual article to the appropriate section of the list the character article should be turned into a re-direct. I was thinking cut-and-paste moves for the information as the history of who wrote the stuff would remain at the re-direct page and history merging sounds like something only an administrator can do and it seems like it would be a pain in the butt for the administrator stuck doing it. Characters would be listed in the book in which they first appeared, with notes refering the reader to the proper section for subsequent books. Books would be listed in order of their writing, as they don't necessarily follow chronological order.</p>
<p>This would leave a lot of re-directs, but the information would be consolidated in one place and would be easier for readers to find and comprehend and easier for editors to maintain.</p>
<p>I can get started on this later tonight, but if I'm going to do this it would be counter-productive to delete this or any of the character articles at this time. Moreover, I can't do it all by myself as I haven't read the books that come after <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triss.html" title="Triss">Triss</a>.</p>
<p>I'll propose a wikiproject to clean these up at the main series article and see if I can get some help from other interested parties. Anyway, those are my thoughts at the moment. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 14:35, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was 5 in 1986 and have positively never heard of this series. (I was in the Soviet Union at the time, which may explain it...) Nevertheless, being that it is my heartfelt desire to rid WP of all crufty-cruft, I would be pleased to join this endeavor. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 14:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
