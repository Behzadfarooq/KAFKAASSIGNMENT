<li>Delete, possibly speedy. Doesn't even give a definition! <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a> 00:23, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, it originated from an MMO for crying out loud. It does however give a description, in that it says it's a misspelling of awesome. So it's probably like the "<a href="../../../p/w/n/Pwned.html" title="Pwned">pwned</a>" ("owned") misspelling, but has a FAR smaller spectrum. Or, at least, I've seen <a href="../../../p/w/n/Pwned.html" title="Pwned">pwned</a> endless times on gaming sites, but I've never seen Aswom. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 00:56, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Over a span of half an hour shortly after the article was created, various IPs vandalized the page, resulting in 12 reverts. The article was listed on speedy deletions, and was then deleted. It was re-created by one of the earlier culprit IPs. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 02:16, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>delete</b>. This page is poorly formatted and not written as an encyclopedia style article (i.e. neutral pov, provide knowledge rather than claims). However, some of the comments below are also a little unfair, or without support. I think if someone writes for example; "complete nonsense" they must give reasons why it is complete nonsense. Again, why does it sound like a "failed university essay" or "This is neither fringe theory nor nonsense, it's just what happens when someone thinks they understand advanced physics from reading "pop" sources".</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
In particular, this last statement above displays an alarming ignorance of the work of Dr Milo Wolff, who has had a distinguished career as a professor of Physics. See; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_Wolff" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_Wolff" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_Wolff</a></p>
<p><br />
It seems to me that the point of an encyclopedia is to present knowledge, not people's opinions, yet what i read below (see bottom of this page) seems to be opinions (they do not provide reasons for their criticisms). Having studied philosophy, physics and metaphysics for the past ten years, there is clearly a lot of historical knowledge that supports the Wave Structure of Matter, most particularly the foundations of philosophy and metaphysics (dating back to the Ancient Greeks and Indians) and their realisation of the dynamic unity of reality. The following quotes from Aristotle, Leibniz, Kant, Bradley, Brentano, Faraday, Maxwell, Nietzsche, Lorentz, Einstein, Schrodinger and Bohm are important in this debate;</p>
<p><br />
"Metaphysics is universal and is exclusively concerned with primary substance. And here we will have the science to study that which is, both in its essence and in the properties which, just as a thing that is, it has. ... That among entities there must be some cause which moves and combines things. ... There must then be a principle of such a kind that its substance is activity." (Aristotle, Metaphysics, 340BC)</p>
<p><br />
"Reality cannot be found except in One single source, because of the interconnection of all things with one another. ... I do not conceive of any reality at all as without genuine unity." (Gottfried Leibniz, 1670)</p>
<p><br />
"Natural science (physics) contains in itself synthetical judgments a priori, as principles. ‚Ä¶ Space then is a necessary representation a priori, which serves for the foundation of all external intuitions." (Kant, Critique of Pure reason, 1781)</p>
<p><br />
"We may agree, perhaps, to understand by Metaphysics an attempt to know reality as against mere appearance, or the study of first principles or ultimate truths, or again the effort to comprehend the universe, not simply piecemeal or by fragments, but somehow as a whole." (Bradley, 1846-1924)</p>
<p><br />
"A three-dimensional (spatial) world is infinitely more likely than any of its alternatives." (Brentano, 1838-1916)</p>
<p><br />
"I cannot conceive curved lines of force without the conditions of a physical existence in that intermediate space." (Faraday, 1830)</p>
<p><br />
"In speaking of the Energy of the field, however, I wish to be understood literally. All energy is the same as mechanical energy, whether it exists in the form of motion or in that of elasticity, or in any other form. The energy in electromagnetic phenomena is mechanical energy." (James Clerk Maxwell, 1876)</p>
<p><br />
"Greek philosophy seems to begin with a preposterous fancy, with the proposition that water is the origin and mother-womb of all things. Is it really necessary to stop there and become serious? Yes, and for three reasons: firstly, because the preposition does enunciate something about the origin of things; secondly, because it does so without figure and fable; thirdly and lastly, because it contained, although only in the chrysalis state, the idea&#160;:everything is one. ..That which drove him (Thales) to this generalization was a metaphysical dogma, which had its origin in a mystic intuition and which together with the ever renewed endeavors to express it better, we find in all philosophies- the proposition: everything is one!" (The Greeks' by Friedrich Nietzsche, p159)</p>
<p><br />
"I cannot but regard the ether, which can be the seat of an electromagnetic field with its energy and its vibrations, as endowed with a certain degree of substantiality, however different it may be from all ordinary matter." (Hendrik Lorentz, Theory of the Electron, 1900)</p>
<p><br />
"According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time. But this ether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of matter, as consisting of parts ('particles') which may be tracked through time." (Albert Einstein, 1928, Leiden Lecture)</p>
<p><br />
"Physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially extended (as fields). In this way the concept 'empty space' loses its meaning. ... The field thus becomes an irreducible element of physical description, irreducible in the same sense as the concept of matter (particles) in the theory of Newton. ... The physical reality of space is represented by a field whose components are continuous functions of four independent variables - the co-ordinates of space and time. Since the theory of general relatively implies the representation of physical reality by a continuous field, the concept of particles or material points cannot play a fundamental part, nor can the concept of motion. The particle can only appear as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high. (Albert Einstein, Relativity, 1950)</p>
<p><br />
"When forced to summarize the general theory of relativity in one sentence: Time and space and gravitation have no separate existence from matter." (Albert Einstein, Ideas and Opinions, 1954)</p>
<p><br />
"What we observe as material bodies and forces are nothing but shapes and variations in the structure of space. Particles are just schaumkommen (appearances). ... The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist. ... Let me say at the outset, that in this discourse, I am opposing not a few special statements of quantum mechanics held today (1950s), I am opposing as it were the whole of it, I am opposing its basic views that have been shaped 25 years ago, when Max Born put forward his probability interpretation, which was accepted by almost everybody. ... I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it. ... The scientist only imposes two things, namely truth and sincerity, imposes them upon himself and upon other scientists." (Erwin Schrodinger) (Some of these quotes are from 'What is Life, unsure of rest.)</p>
<p><br />
"The notion that all these fragments is separately existent is evidently an illusion, and this illusion cannot do other than lead to endless conflict and confusion. Indeed, the attempt to live according to the notion that the fragments are really separate is, in essence, what has led to the growing series of extremely urgent crises that is confronting us today. Thus, as is now well known, this way of life has brought about pollution, destruction of the balance of nature, over-population, world-wide economic and political disorder and the creation of an overall environment that is neither physically nor mentally healthy for most of the people who live in it. Individually there has developed a widespread feeling of helplessness and despair, in the face of what seems to be an overwhelming mass of disparate social forces, going beyond the control and even the comprehension of the human beings who are caught up in it." (David Bohm, Wholeness and the Implicate Order, 1980)</p>
<p><br />
These people are not crackpots, they are some of the finest minds in the history of human knowledge, and they all recognised that the 'particle' conception of matter cannot describe physical reality (the current paradigm). However, there are crackpots out there that write on both the particle and the wave structure of matter (WSM), and I believe there have been some bad examples of this at wikipedia in the past relating to WSM. I hope over the next year to present a more balanced and well supported voice to this discussion, and to present knowledge to Humanity that clearly does explain and solve a lot of the current problems of modern physics philosophy and metaphysics founded on 'particles' and 'fields' in 'space-time'. Thus I am suggesting that this article be deleted, not because I have any problems with the Wave Structure of Matter, but because i don't think the article is of a suitable encyclopedia standard.</p>

In ending, as i see things, it is important to realise that truth is not democratic. As Tolstoy wrote; "Wrong does not cease to be wrong simply because the majority share in it". Likewise, I am pleased to see that wikipedia is also not democratic. For knowledge to advance it must be founded on the accepted methods of Science (deduction from principles in harmony with knoweldge from senses), and a careful understanding of the history and evolution of knowledge (particularly the subjects of physics philosophy and metaphysics). As a philosopher I take this responsibility of correcting errors in human knowledge very seriously, and believe that wikipedia / encyclopedias play an important role in this process (as the famous french Encyclopedists, Diderot et al, realised).</p>
<p><br />
I also realise that some people may claim that the WSM should not be permitted on wikipedia because it is 'original research'. However this is not the case. As above, this dynamic unity of reality (which the WSM explains) is an ancient idea that is central to all Science and the evolution of western knowledge from the renaissance on (with the introduction from Persia of the works of Aristotle, Plato, etc.).</p>
<p>I actually think that the main source of criticism is based on the natural human tendency to cling to existing ideas, no matter how absurd they become. As Galileo, Darwin and Planck wrote;</p>
<p><br />
"I wish, my dear Kepler, that we could have a good laugh together at the extraordinary stupidity of the mob. What do you think of the foremost philosophers of this University? In spite of my oft-repeated efforts and invitations, they have refused, with the obstinacy of a glutted adder, to look at the planets or Moon or my telescope." (Galileo Galilei, Dialogues Concerning Two World Systems, 1600)</p>
<p><br />
"Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine. But I look with confidence to the future to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality." (Charles Darwin, from 'Structure of Scientific Revolutions', Thomas Kuhn)</p>
<p><br />
"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it." (Max Planck, Scientific Autobiography)</p>
<p><br />
Sorry for such a long polemic (hope people find it as interesting as I do though!). But I think this discussion is important, and often there are no glib easy answers, it takes careful consideration based on substantial knowledge to make wise / just decisions (as i see things).</p>

"And though the philosopher may live remote from business, the genius of philosophy, if carefully cultivated by several, must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society, and bestow a similar correctness on every art and calling." (David Hume, Treatise Concerning Morals and Human Understanding, 1737)</p>
<p><br />
"It is the duty of philosophy to destroy the illusions which had their origin in misconceptions, whatever darling hopes and valued expectations may be ruined by its explanations. ... and thus to prevent the scandal which metaphysical controversies are sure, sooner or later, to cause even to the masses."

<p>seems that this isn't the same as the actor Bob Biniak, and if anything he should have precedent over the core namespace, but this guy doesn't seem very notable. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 09:02, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, just because you are not a skateboarder and do not know of him, does not mean that Bob Biniak is not notable. He was apart of an influential skateboarding team in the 1970's who redefined skateboarding as it is today. Even when you put the name Bob Biniak into IMDB, it comes up with the skateboarder over any supposed actor by the same name. As you can see: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1121951/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1121951/" rel="nofollow">Bob Biniak IMDB profile</a> whilst looking at the names list for Biniak doesn't even turn up this supposed actor either: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?q=biniak;tt=on;nm=on;mx=20" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/find?q=biniak;tt=on;nm=on;mx=20" rel="nofollow">IMDB names page for Biniak</a>. I suggest if you submit something for deletion, you actually know what the article you're deleting is. And if the persons name is supposedly the same as someone elses, make sure you get the other persons name right before saying 'it takes precedent'. Or if this person exists, then you put Bob Biniak (actor). <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordhart_cd4a.html" title="User:Lordhart">Lordhart</a> 10:16, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>First off, the matter of precedence. It's always the most important person who takes the namespace on WP. Always. Look at <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Clooney_caa0.html" title="George Clooney">George Clooney</a>. There is no other, so it doesn't say "actor" beside, nor would it if there was another. It is always the less important same-name person who would be shoved aside, not the more important one just because they are an actor.</li>

<dd>I may not be a skater, but I'm not a movie buff either. 59% of WP content I've never heard of but it doesn't mean I automatically deem it unworthy since it hasn't reached my ears. I'm not predjudicing, I'm just basing it on Google. The very first Google hit is for a musician(?), the rest of the first ten for an actor, and it's not until the second page that I see a skater. Upon closer inspection, the actor references <i>are to the same man</i>.</dd>
<dd>‚ÄîBUT this does NOT change the course of this Vfd! Notable or not, this article is written as fluff, and doesn't tell the reader anything useful at all. Indeed it is very vague and even confusing. When I first read this article, it gave NO impression that it was about a skater at all, because it lists surfing, golf, etc. just as frequently as skating, rather than showing that skating was the more important career (and indeed got him a movie role). It talks just as much about golf as anything else. Nothing in this jumped out at me and said "hey, this guy's a skater!", merely that he took part in many varied sports. No focus at all, merely bits and pieces. Classic fluff content right there.</dd>
<dd>It is written in a very fluffy, very vain way. ANY and ALL fluff articles should be Vfd'd as soon as they are noticed, whether they're about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Campbell_d7cd.html" title="John Campbell">John Campbell</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Holmes_3002.html" title="Paul Holmes">Paul Holmes</a>, it doesn't matter. Fluff must go, whether it's about a noteworthy person or not. Either the content is revised or it is deleted, ready for someone else to recreate properly at a later date.</dd>
<dd>But if you wish to rewrite this article yourself to be less fluffy and more skatey (boy that sounds silly), please feel free to do so, and I will change my vote to Keep.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, you sound very angry about this being up for Vfd... which is just ridiculous! Come on, I'm merely trying to help make WP a better place, and even though I'm wrong, so what? Does it matter? Are you <i>that</i> offended that your skating idol has been put up for Vfd just because he's got a crappy article? If so, do your duty as a fan and rewrite it! Do him proud!

<li>Just to clear up, i'm not a fan, and i'm not a skater, but I do know of certain skateboarders as my older brother was an avid skater in his youth. It seemed that your only reason for deletion was because the article didn't describe an actor (even though you've clearly stated now that you were wrong and that it is indeed this person). I'm not offended, but you should have labelled it to get extended or cleaned up if anything, not just deleted because you made a mistake with names or whatnot. I would edit it myself if I knew more about his life, but the most I know is that he was apart of the Dogtown Zephyr skate team of the 70's. Others who have more knowledge about him may have more to add though. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordhart_cd4a.html" title="User:Lordhart">Lordhart</a> 15:13, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You seem to know a lot about this man. If you want this article to be kept, please rewrite it so it doesn't sound so vain and chatty. Then I (and maybe others) will reconsider the previous vote. Remember, we're not voting on what *could* take up this namespace, only what *is* here right now. An article on Bill Gates would be deleted if it was as chatty as this. It's not the potential, it's the content right now. If this is not rewritten it will be deleted, and someone at a later date may choose to recreate it properly. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 23:01, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

It wouldn't make sense to have a separate vote for the image and then find out the core article wasn't deleted. Or would it?

<li>Comment: since the founding of Wikipedia, more and more websites have been cloning our content. Upon investigation, many of the results are pages like that, or blogs, or "stuff in Deakin area" pages, or such, rather than wider-area pages.

<li>A couple of general comments:
<ul>
<li>Anyone wishing to create categories to assist those studying particular subjects (i.e. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Law_Students_Association_1edd.html" title="Australian Law Students Association">Australian Law Students Associations</a>) has a difficult task when the subject articles are lost inside larger articles.</li>
<li>When possible, articles should be tightly focused on the subject. The tendency to merge disparate subjects into loosely organized articles reminds me of hobo stew‚Äîone may throw everything into one pot, but it can be very hard to swallow and harder to digest. -<a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 14:36, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Or it can be a rich tapestry of context against which the detail can be more easily or more completely understood. (The argument about categories does not win me over. Articles are for the benefit of readers. Categories are for the benefit of articles. Not the other way around.) <b>Merge and redirect</b>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:17, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I guess we disagree on this. To me, the Deakin University article would not be enhanced by including specific information concerning an independent student society; such as society membership qualifications and society sponsored competitions and social events (I noticed that the DLSS article ignores <a href="http://www.dlss.org.au/functions/pub-crawl/" class="external text" title="http://www.dlss.org.au/functions/pub-crawl/" rel="nofollow">pub crawls</a> and <a href="http://www.dlss.org.au/functions/booze-cruise/" class="external text" title="http://www.dlss.org.au/functions/booze-cruise/" rel="nofollow">booze cruises</a>). And the DLSS subject would be degraded from linking with other articles (internal anchors don't work real well in Wikipedia, especially in longer articles), as well as eliminated from categorization. Nor, for the same reasons, do I think the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deakin_University_Law_School_a5c2.html" title="Deakin University Law School">Deakin University Law School</a> should be merged with Deakin University. To me categories are not article enhancements‚Äîthey are just another kind of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">navigational aide</a> for the user.

<li>Comment: Unsure. <b>I don't think this article is about a particular person at all.</b> My reading of it is that it is about a particular grammar, a way of referring to previous poster(s) to a thread, and I think we'd need someone active on Japanese BBSs to say whether this is encyclopedic. I guess in the absence of that we could argue from the silence that notability has not been established, but I notice <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">the contributor</a> does list Japanese as an interest. I found the article interesting and well written, if a little obscure. Hmmm. No vote as yet. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 15:05, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is true, but I think that the fact that this "forum character" isn't even supposed to represent a real person makes him/her/it <i>less</i> important than if it did, if anything. One thing I take into consideration when voting on forumcruft articles is this: <i>Would this subject be recognisable or of research value to those not involved with the forum?</i> For example, many famous memes started out on a message board somewhere, but are known to the rest of the world as well. Conversely, an article on "Admins on WienerBoy348's Local Dial-Up Chat BBS, 1987-1988" would be of interest only to those mentioned. Our current subject seems pretty much isolated to one forum, and thus probably not article-worthy. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 17:12, Apr 23, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Still unsure. I mainly wanted a reality check, as it seemed that the nominator hadn't understood the article at all, nobody seemed to have picked that up, and the only person involved yet who understands Japanese seems to be the contributor. We have an article on the forum in question, so perhaps merge and redirect is the way to go, but it's a lot of information to add. Hmmm. Still no vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 17:54, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> This article isn't about a specific person (and I'm not sure how it could be interpreted that way), it's about a common cartoon character found on the biggest BBS in Japan, and also found in several Flash cartoons. At least two guide books have been published (dead-tree, not merely e-published) on the 2ch cast of characters. This article was created to accompany <a href="../../../g/i/k/Giko_Cat_717c.html" title="Giko Cat">Giko Cat</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mona_%28ASCII_art%29_8842.html" title="Mona (ASCII art)">Mona (ASCII art)</a>, two other common 2ch characters, which have articles on the Japanese wikipedia as well. I wouldn't be averse to merging them all into an article on 2ch AA characters, but I think there'd be too much there to merge into the <a href="../../../2/c/h/2ch.html" title="2ch">2ch</a> article itself (and List of 2ch Boards has already been broken out), and the interlanguage links would be lost. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> ‚Äî <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 07:06, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (yes I finally voted). We seem to have no expertise in Japanese language or culture here, but on the evidence we <b>do</b> have so far, I say this is encyclopedic. Assuming that, it's an excellent short article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 12:20, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

This is notable in the same way that <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_Coward_6d9e.html" title="Anonymous Coward">Anonymous Coward</a> and <a href="../../../b/1/f/B1FF_2690.html" title="B1FF">B1FF</a> are notable; not as handles of real people, but a combination of a generic title and fictional character.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This character is an essential part of 2ch culture which has progressed beyond the status of a meme and is now a cultural icon, along with Mona, Giko-neko, and Shii. Compare the universal recognition of these characters on 2ch to relatively unimportant ones that fill the thousands of entries in the 2ch AA Daijiten which are mere memespawn to be forgotten between copy-pastes. 2ch is enormous, quite possibly the largest forum on the Internet, with millions of new posts every day, and over 700 separate boards. Just because you don't speak Japanese isn't a reason to write it off as unimportant. Also, there is no good reference for information on 2ch in English besides Wikipedia and some random forum posts scattered across the web, but there are hundreds of thousands of sites about 2ch in Japanese (Google gives almost a million for "2ch"). I would not oppose moving this article into a single "2ch Characters" article. Also, searching for 1„Åï„Çì would be better than 1-san because the latter is only a romanization. ‚Äî <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Crippen_b05d.html" title="User:James Crippen">Ts'√©iyoosh</a> 09:45, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, since I forgot to actually specify my vote before.

<li><b>Delete</b> Not to be insulting, but pointing out mathematical quasi-factoids sounds like a pretty lame excuse for a stand-up act. What, did the monologue on long-division not play well in Peoria? Was the screed on floating-point to integer conversion a washout in Walla-Walla? Has the routine on topological transormation tanked with tossing tomatoes in Tallahassee?

<p>The author apparently wants to make a "soft redirect" from article space to category space. I changed it to a real redirect, but got reverted. As far as I know real redirects are unproblematic from an article to a category; the just don't work from one category to another.

<p>this article violates all sorts of wikipedia standards, but it was created to assist in donation efforts. in its creation, this article was meant to be temporary - and now it is time to delete it. although relief fund-raising continues, it has fallen off, and wikipedia *must* get rid of this article which violates all kinds of policies and standards. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 19:58, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>That is why the VfD is here. We have no clue where it is used (which is probably a small area), when it started or anything along those lines. Someone mentioned on other VfD's that when this or other type articles are picked up, many mirrors of Wikipedia pick it up, so this word appears on their severs. And other than those listings, there is nothing else out there. Though me and a few others agree that this is a tasteless term, we cannot include it here since it is a local term used by a term people (which is denoted by the term neologism). <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 03:51, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is not a neologism in any real sense.

<p>My apologies for the strange naming of the page; it appears the first VfD was never properly archived. When this page was last up for deletion in October 2004, several people who voted keep at that time said that it would be legitimate to bring this article up for discussion again if John Kerry lost the election.

<li>But isn't it better to have the sysop/admin delete the page and the images in one fell swoop, rather than having a separate report for the images??? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 00:21, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps, but articles with images that would become orphans after deletion of the article aren't really all that common on VfD.

<li>It may still be considered original research, but it would be better if you have permission. Note that the original VfD did not mention any copyright violation, but other concerns.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Actually, the fact that the idea has worked in the past doesn't mean it's not crackpot. It's still a proposal...it's still an attempt to look into a crystal ball...both are against Wikipedia policy. So even if its not a copyvio, it should still go bye bye.

<li>Again, this is not a do or die issue. Even if it isn't a copyvio, it's a proposal trying to look into the crystal ball and Wikipedia doesn't want that.

<li>It's well on its way to deletion, nearing its fifth day on VfD, without a single keep vote.
