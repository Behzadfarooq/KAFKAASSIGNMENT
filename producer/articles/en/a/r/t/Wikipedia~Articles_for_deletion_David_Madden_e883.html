<li><b>Comment</b> I've already commented on this in the main article but I feel this also bears repeating here. Whether or not the encylopedic nature of an article is in dispute does <b>not</b> mean it's an excuse to goof around and pretend this is an Uncyclopedia article. We do have to maintain a certain professional standard in our article writing, and certainly avoid inserting biased opinions meant primarily to mock instead of inform. Like I alluded to, there's Uncyclopedia if you want to goof around that badly. Also, I think someone should add a clean-up tag (maybe that would be more appropriate than a VfD tag?) User:24.9.10.235</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. He's already broken <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Walsh_9c27.html" title="Tom Walsh">Tom Walsh</a>'s record (two, actually). If we delete his article we might as well delete Tom's and merge with the main <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a> or <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a> article then, going by the logic by some here. User:24.9.10.235
<ul>
<li>Well you can't break a record that's already been broken; it doesn't work that way, or else I would have broken the 1880 land speed record on my way to breakfast this morning. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:05, 20 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to your logic, Wade Boggs' (whose about to be inducted into Cooperstown in a few days) entry should be denied because he never has done anything truly exceptional, or John Elway or Dan Marino should be removed from the Hall of Fame because they've never done anything truly Earth-shattering such as Terry Bradshaw's Super Bowl winning record (hell, Marino has <i>never won a single Super Bowl!</i>). For that matter, according to the same logic Tom Walsh's page needs to be verified for deletion too, since Madden (let alone Jennings) have proven it's hardly an insurmountable figure (let's face it, it's only <i>seven games</i>). The reason why it <i>is</i> an important <b>milestone</b> is because this is only the second time that record has been surpassed (although I personally believe it will hardly be the last) but for now it's at least as notable as Tom Walsh's old record.
<ul>
<li>Nope, I'm just saying he didn't break a record, which is true. And, indeed, I'm no great proponent of Walsh's page either, but (like it or not) he did hold a few records, which Daveyboy has not done. And if old whatshername had realized that the Ode to Joy was not 70 minutes long (no matter how slow its played) Dave would be yesterday's news already. I'm not saying he won't be the next big thing in game show contestants; I'm just saying as of now he isn't. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:08, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>He may not have broken any records yet but for the time being he's a notable player and it looks like he'll surpass the 15-game mark many people have mentioned as being the threshold allowing him an article. Once again, according to your logic many notable people should be ignored, a logic I frankly find to be ignorant at best. Think of it this way; if he does manage to win $1,000,000 in non-tournament winnings he'll still probably become a 'cause celeb' and yet still be about a third from Jennings' total winnings. Because the new records are so insurmountable, I think we shouldn't be so hung up on them.
<ul>
<li>Nowhere did I say he <i>needed</i> to hold a record to be notable enough for an article, I merely said a record would likely justify one. My main point is that the Walsh comparisons were flawed because Walsh was both a first and a holder of three records (and even his notability is somewhat questionable in my book); Madden doesn't fit either of those criteria. Maybe he will soon warrant an article, but I don't think he has yet, and he certainly didn't when this article was written. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:25, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To tell you the truth I've been kinda waivering between "keep" and "delete" myself, but I think we can give Madden the benefit of the doubt and keep it for now. I don't think it will be too much longer for him to gain noteriety (he's only $200,000 away from half a million; that may seem like quite a bit but it took him only, what, two weeks to get $200,000?), and if he falls short we can always delete later. Or whatever the Wikiministrators decide.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Why don't we just give this situation the benefit of the doubt? After all, it would be much easier to decide to delete the article if he loses on tomorrow's episode, for example. Why jump on it now if the possibility exists that he may become noteworthy later on? In fact, David only has to win once more to tie the previously-held record of wins prior to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a> which was <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Walsh_9c27.html" title="Tom Walsh">Tom Walsh</a> who was the first contestant to win more than 5 games when the 5-game rule was eliminated. asert 04:04, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Nothing here really. If he actaully approaches anything like Ken then we can create an article on him. This doesn't say anything anyway. Alex uses the K-word once in a haphazard remark and everyone thinks this guy's on the way to win 70 more games. I think a good test will be to see when and if he's mentioned outside of the show (and internet forums on the show). After Ken won about 12 games or so I think it was, Letterman started talking about him, as did others. Doesn't seem to be happening with Dave yet. All this "chronicling the next Ken" was all over wikipedia the moment he lost, and nothing panned out there.

<li>Comment: Tom Walsh probably shouldn't have an article either. I guess he does only because he was the first player ever to appear on a 6th show, which had basically nothing to do with him, but everything to do with a change in the rules and good timing. (Well, not <i>nothing</i>; he had to win a bunch of games, which isn't trivial, but not exactly encyclopedic). He also held several Jeopardy records. Madden is only 70 games and about 3 million dollars away from holding one himself. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:27, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP!</b> Have you guys ever even seen David on Jeopardy? Won't it ever pass your [thick] skulls that eight consecutive days is a rare occurrence on Jeopardy? In fact, this is the third time it's happened, with Tom Walsh and Ken Jennings before him. He might even be the next Ken Jennings, but he already <i>is</i> the next Tom Walsh! He <i>is</i> notable! Besides, I checked the deletion policy and this article can stay, according to it.

<li>"Rare" is not "encyclopedic". I could do all sorts of rare things. 8 appearances on Jeopardy will not be so rare much longer as people are no longer cut off at 5 games. In fact, the 5 games limit had only been removed a short while before someone exceeded it by 15 times. As I said, Tom Walsh held 3 records, Dave is <i>nowhere near</i> even one. When he gets his record, he'll get his page. In fact, I'd like to make a Game show records page as place to cover these contestant stubs (like Walsh) as well as some of the info on Ken's page about records he's held. The only problem is that other than Jeopardy and Millionaire and a few others I'm not entirely sure where to find such information. And to cover all, or most, game shows it would be quite a substantial endeavor. If anyone else likes this idea let me know and maybe we can work on it. The best I can see Madden getting is a runner up for most Jeopardy (regular season) appearances if he gets that far. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:59, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Last summer, when Ken Jennings was at the peak of his popularity (middle of last July), he had <b>over 23,000</b> hits on Google (for ' "Ken Jennings" Jeopardy ') and 914 Google News hits. ' "David Madden" Jeopardy' has 118 hits on Google, and 0 Google News hits. Ken Jennings has an article because he transcended his genre. Now people are going "9 games? Who cares!" Tom Walsh has an article because at least a modicum of normal people cared about his 7 wins. Dave Madden is still <b>not notable</b> in the context of his newsworthyness, meaning he really does not deserve an article in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">OntarioQuizzer</a> 09:45, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP:</b> 9 games is an impressive streak on Jeopardy, and whether or not he has Google news results (he has one now) has little to do with noteworthiness.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Madden is currently notable only to Jeopardy viewers, but I think this vfd is premature. Why don't we wait and see how long he makes it? If he's eliminated soon and thereby becomes nonnotable, we can always delete the article. If he wins a lot and becomes noteworthy, we won't have to come back and recreate a deleted article. As it is, his chances could go either way.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Barely notable in the realm of Jeopardy! translates into not notable for encyclopedic consumption.

<li><b>Keep</b>. What's the big deal? Isn't this wikipedia thingy supposed to have _everything_ in it? David's a geek who is doing right by himself, and deserves any minor fame he achieves. Besides, he keeps winning and will probably finish the season, and you'll have no choice anyway. Ted from Ontario. 20 July 2005.</li>

<dd>Comment: What Wikipedia Is Not -- Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of notoriety or achievement. David's notoriety is the subject of the discussion. --<a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">OntarioQuizzer</a> 12:28, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment: Is this user related to Jordan? I really hope he hasn't started meatpuppeting. --<a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">OntarioQuizzer</a> 10:33, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No I am not related to Jordan, we are both inclusionists though and as inclusionists we are working to keep articles, see:<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Inclusionist_Wikipedians/Members" class="extiw" title="m:Association_of_Inclusionist_Wikipedians/Members">m:Association_of_Inclusionist_Wikipedians/Members</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Inclusionist_Wikipedians" class="extiw" title="m:Association_of_Inclusionist_Wikipedians">m:Association_of_Inclusionist_Wikipedians</a> -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerktar_9195.html" title="User:Derktar">Derktar</a> 19:10, July 21, 2005 (UTC).

<dd>Thanks for the clarification -- I noted both of your last names being Elder and figured I should ask. --<a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">OntarioQuizzer</a> 02:02, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I can't say I'm opposed to the idea, but I just want to point out that Jeopardy! goes on its annual 6 week summer hiatus after tomorrow's episode. Meaning that he'll be at about this level until early September. --<a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">OntarioQuizzer</a> 03:43, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I think this debate should have ended by now. He has won 14 in a row which is double that of Tom Walsh. If he is not worthy, then Walsh certainly is not as well. I would say the standard should probably be 10 in a row. As a long time Jeopardy fan my guess is that only 1-2 people per season of Jeopardy will accomplish that feat.</dd>
