<li><b>Keep</b>, it is currently only a stub. How can the article be developed if it is attacked and shot down as soon as the stub went up. It takes <b>time</b> to attract interested, knowledeable persons who can make valuable contributions. Modern scientific research into this topic is in it's infancy, even though it was known to the ancient Greeks and other ancient civilizations. Modern science isn't going to embrace it overnight.

<li><b>Comment</b> Some who have voted keep here and at the Institute vote are basing their votes on the existance of the DVD narrated by James Earl Jones.

<p>If this discussion is about the article about THE PERSON, then I would suggest it be kept. If the pseudoscientific theory his "Binary Research Institute" doesn't deserve a place at Wikipedia for being original research then the article about that theory deserves being deleted, but not the stub about this guy. The same about article the film "The Great Year". Now I'm a registered user (BattleTroll)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. If the crackpot theories were encyclopedic, Cruttenden should be mentioned on them.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, this is obviously a <i>bad faith</i> nomination. These delitionist attitudes are unbelieveably oppressive! The rabid, visceral comments reek of hidden (or not so hidden) agenda and ulterior motives. Why are they are trying <i>so hard</i> to silence and suppress. It's suspicious. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthian_7789.html" title="User:Earthian">Earthian</a> 16:01, 27 September 2005 (UTC) <small>User registered on September 27 and made contributions only to this and related AfDs. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Earthian_5eec.html" title="Special:Contributions/Earthian">Special:Contributions/Earthian</a></small>
<ul>
<li>People are included in an encyclopedia because of a degree of importance, not because of personal vanity. Instead of crying "Oppression", why don't you list Walter Cruttenden's achievements? <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 17:20, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no reason to list his achievements, they are readily availble on the net for all to see. They were included in the articles, with links, and you deleted them. The fact that you feel the need to stalk me and add the stupid disclaimer above to my contributions in the deletion pages only further proves my assertion that these three nominations you made are in <b>BAD FAITH</b>. Why are you so afraid of Walter Cruttenden, his Binary Research Institute, and the film they produced that you must work so hard to censor them? You vandalized the articles, removing other people's contributions, you hang here 24 hours a day making sure your supress any information that appears. I am no longer suspicious, after reviewing your history here, I am <i>certain</i> that you have hidden agendas and ulterior motives. Furthermore, if one were to apply the unbelieveably strict standards you are setting up for these three articles to all the articles on Wikipedia, half the articles would be deleted immediately, and on further consideration, few of the other half would survive. They'd be lucky if 10% of the articles survived. I repeat, this is <b>BAD FAITH</b>. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthian_7789.html" title="User:Earthian">Earthian</a> 17:38, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conflict of Interest - Question</b>: should the person who nominates articles for deletion also be making changes to those articles? In this case, <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Pilatus</a> has nominated these three articles for deletion - Walter Cruttenden, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_Research_Institute_cb5f.html" title="Binary Research Institute">Binary Research Institute</a>, and The Great Year - and has made extensive changes to them. In most of his changes he leaves behind typos and grammatical errors, broken links, and straggling headers (i.e., after he's removed everything that was under a header), not only messing up other users' work but leaving the article in much poorer shape than it was before. He also deletes extensively, and removes categories and stubs aggressively. He goes in after anyone adds anything to an article and removes everything the other person contributed. He seems to be working to <i>increase the chances for deletion</i> of the articles. In light of this, it would be appropriate, in order to avoid this obvious <b>conflict of interest</b>, for the person who nominated the articles to refrain from modifying them until the decision has been made? <a href="../../../s/y/u/User%7ESyug_2b31.html" title="User:Syug">Syug</a> 21:06, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Most articles up for deletion are not judged upon the quality or quantity or their content, but rather the appropriateness or notability of the topic. Any edits that Pilatus may have made to the content of the article are irrelevant, for he cannot make a worthy topic unworthy by bad grammar or misspellings. <a href="../../../o/s/w/User%7EOswax_0a10.html" title="User:Oswax">Oswax</a> 21:47, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
