<dd>The purpose of the list isn't to provide information on real orangutans, it's to follow how orangutans are used in cultural artifacts of whatever sort. The purpose of the list article, aside from being entertaining, is to be a serious resource for someone researching or studying or wanting to be educated about how orangutans are depicted in popular culture. That can be a serious topic, which in turn justifies the article in a serious encyclopedia.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 06:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>.The implied criticism by the nominator needs addressing very carefully. <i>This isnt how Wikipedia should be working</i> - good to see the idealism, but practically every animal that exists on wikipedia has enthusiastic watchers of tv culture, obscure books and pc game culture providing unalphabetically added - ad hoc- poorly written lists of information. Very few articles appear to incorporate reasonable sections regarding explanation or context of the popular culture context (then the large questions 'whose popular culture?' arises as well)</dd>
</dl>
<p>On the basis of this nomination, it might be that every article in the category 'Animals in Popular Culture would need to go through similar process - and then after that - every animal that is listed in wikipedia probably has had a similar addition. The issues that arise from one and which have a consequent precedent set for almost every animal article in wikipedia - are (a) do the enthusiastic watchers of t.v. culture and obscure p.c. games have adequate warning that their moments of genius in associating their favourite with an animal with a wikipedia article have some avenue now implicitly cut off? (b) have editors who either watch or maintain (but not Own) of course - articles about animals - to be warned and aware of popular culture articles about to be have forced merges? I strongly suspect apart from Rat - which seems to be living happily in both worlds for some odd reason - many editors find popular culture sections offensive and out of place.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(My emphasis - as most seem to be missing the point) - <i>I believe this aFd is out of place</i> - and the issue - as it affects at least two categories and potential edit wars regarding merges over a number of articles - should be levered higher - and perhaps a wider view needs to be made of the whole range of articles which have been created - and the overal fate of the nature of the '..in Popular Culture' tendency and habits need to be broached higher up the food chain rather than this one article...<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">Satu</a><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">Suro</a> 10:47, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete or keep - NOT merge</b>. The <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orang_utan.html" title="Orang utan">Orang utan</a> article should be a serious encyclopedic article on orang utans. THis on the other hand is a list of junk that has nothing to do with orang utans. One of the most common criticisms of wikipedia is it's (lazy?) over-emphasis on pop culture. Like all the other useless pop culture trivia list, does anyone really think that a mention of the video games in which orangs appear is (a) encylopedic or (b) actually assists us in understanding orang utans? The answer is surely 'no'. The insistence on such lists in serious encyclopedia articles is a serious blight on wikipedia. Me thinks it's got more to do with bored teenagers (who actually know nothin about orang utans - or whatever other subject) wanting to list their favourite cartoon or video game. 'Orang Utans' and 'Orang Utans in Pop Culture' have nothing to do with each other. However, although i think it is a junk article, i can live with it's existence <i>IF</i> it means that the junk doesn't get into the orang utan article (as it does for so many other topics). Once the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Opera_House_ea14.html" title="Sydney Opera House">Sydney Opera House</a> article had a list of the most obscure films and TV shows in which it had appeared - the list was half the article. Let's put a stop to this rubbish please. Or, if we must keep it somewhere, at least keep it seperate to the real articles. Can that be our compromise? <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 11:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Except they tell us nothing about Orangutans. Apparently they use orangutans as villians. Orangutans cannot be villians, it is completly inappropiate to suggest that any animal is in some way a villian. Orangutans are orangutans and the article should be about describing them as such. Sure this sort of infomation is quite appropiate for an Animals in literature article or similar, but should not be merged back into <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orangutan.html" title="Orangutan">Orangutan</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 00:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> this particular article should be judged by itself, for it is much better sourced than the majority of "in popular culture" articles. The role in almost all the works cited is significant--sometimes central, as in Poe. I see no reason to accept or reject all animals in popular culture articles as a blanket policy--some have enough material, and some don't. This is one which clearly does. It even talks about the uses in general a little, and is not just a list.

<li><b>merge</b> to a new Apes in popular culture, per <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDorisH_254b.html" title="User:DorisH">User:DorisH</a> above, or otherwise <b>keep</b>. I think <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">User:Noroton</a>'s argument further above that these articles are useful for research is valid and hasn't been refuted. I think the point made on the talk page that this article was created to avoid a war over content on <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orangutan.html" title="Orangutan">Orangutan</a> should weigh in its favour. This article's not at all exhaustive, but I haven't received the memo that all Wikipedia articles must now be either complete or deleted. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 16:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
