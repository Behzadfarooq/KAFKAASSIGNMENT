<li><b>Do Not Delete! Keep!</b>. How can a team has played teams from southern California to Rhode Island and Canada not be notable? The Claremont Braineaters is a club team that might not be varsity in the sense of the word as it applies to Duke Blue Devils basketball, but the Claremont Braineaters has members from all colleges and succeeds more than any varsity program. The fact that the Claremont Braineaters is a Division III school and still placed 26th amongst so many Divison I schools is notable. To delete this article would be to say to all Wikipedians that because a few people may not understand or have even heard of ultimate Frisbee that an article cannot exist, that's wrong. What if someone from Australia or Eritrea had never heard of hockey, should that mean that the Montr√©al Canadiens' article should be deleted? Maybe the UPA does not have enough money to start a ridiculous professional league where people play for the money. Ultimate Frisbee is pure love of the game, and the Claremont Braineaters embody that. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Dan37205</a> 4:10 AM EST, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable club team, and the comparison to the Montreal Canadiens is just amusing, bordering on ludicrous. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:13, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Ok then, what about the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Devils_%28Duke_University%29_5adb.html" title="Blue Devils (Duke University)">Blue Devils (Duke University)</a>, are you going to get that article deleted? <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Dan37205</a> 4:30 PM EST, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thousands of people attend every single Blue Devils game. They are routinely broadcast on local radio and television, and even occasionally nationally. Your frisbee club compares with that, how? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 21:10, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. There are over 22,000 ultimate players who belong to the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_Players_Association_fe94.html" title="Ultimate Players Association">Ultimate Players Association</a>, that only includes people who are registered and play in serious club or college tournaments in the United States, that does not include the other thousands of people around the country who do not play serious ultimate frisbee. College ultimate Frisbee is also televised, on <a href="../../../c/s/t/CSTV_80ae.html" title="CSTV">CSTV</a> and its website, <a href="http://www.cstv.com/sports/c-ultimate/cs-c-ultimate-body.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cstv.com/sports/c-ultimate/cs-c-ultimate-body.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cstv.com/sports/c-ultimate/cs-c-ultimate-body.html</a>, where you can watch the semi-finals and finals of the womens and mens College National Tournament of years past. There is also extensive coverage of ultimate Frisbee with the <a href="http://www.UltiVillage.com" class="external free" title="http://www.UltiVillage.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.UltiVillage.com</a> crew who produce films about special club and college tournaments and posts daily clips from tournaments around the country. It's true, college basketball and Duke are especially popular, and a lot of people do watch it, but that is mostly because of basketball being around for over 100 years and it catching on. Ultimate Frisbee was not truly developed into leagues until the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially for college ultiamte Frisbee. Also, the Braineaters are notable to thousands of people. A film that was made called "I Bleed Orange" which can be seen at <a href="http://www.Ibleedorange.com" class="external free" title="http://www.Ibleedorange.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Ibleedorange.com</a> was a mockumentary of the team with the most Nationals wins, the Santa Barbara Black Tide who made a film called "I Bleed Black" the trailer for which can be seen at <a href="http://www.Ibleedblack.com" class="external free" title="http://www.Ibleedblack.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Ibleedblack.com</a>, and that "I Bleed Orange" has been seen by ultimate players in Israel to Hawaii to the States, Europe, you name it, which would suggest that Ultimate is also popular in other countries. Not surprisingly countries such as Australia, Finland (where the 2006 World Tournament was held), the UK, Germany (where a world-famous offensive formation was created), Japan, South Korea, Canada, Venezuela, Spain, Italy (home of Paganello, the largest beach ultimate tournament in the world with over 100 teams) to name a few all have large ultimate and Beach Ultimate progams and communities. Ultimate Frisbee is to me therefore notable, just not televised and consumed by the mainstream television watchers, and thank all that is good for that, who have ready access to such programming as the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Blue_Devils_d7b9.html" title="Duke Blue Devils">Duke Blue Devils</a>, which according to their article also includes their tennis team, track and field, golf, women's rowing (no men's crew? tsk tsk, not like Claremont Stags, Athenas, or Sagehens have one either), not just their very popular basketball team. For that is the basketball team not guilty by association? The Claremont Braineaters are known by many and their players and alumni are known around the the States and the world, mostly in the past for their antics, but recently also for hard play all over the frisbee world, to me says that they are notable. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Dan37205</a> 7:45 PM PST, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
