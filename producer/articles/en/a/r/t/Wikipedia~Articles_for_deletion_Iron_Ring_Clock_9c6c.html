<li>I don't know if I agree or not with that statement, but the fact is a lot of editors believe that to be a valid reason for inclusion and there is no set policy per se that defines the notability of any given object.

<li><b>Delete</b> Nicely written and illustrated article, but appears to be written by one of the subjects, and the "iron ring" incorrectly is claimed to be the "worlds largest" when there are larger ones on every large turbine or old locomotive wheel, and when it it actually made of stainless steel. These quibbles aside, a couple of mentions in the campus paper are not enough evidence of notability.

<dd>Hi Edison, please check the article's talk page for a longer response to your comment there re the use of the term iron ring; I would have responded here but I saw your post to the talk page first. The term 'iron ring' as used in the article does not refer to just a <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring.html" title="Ring">ring</a> made of <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a>, which is (I believe) a justified use. Please see the article on <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_ring.html" title="Iron ring">iron ring</a> for more. If you have a citation for a larger <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_ring.html" title="Iron ring">iron ring</a>, then please put it forward. I have already mentioned my opinion on google hits in my response above. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurtonpe_6ce9.html" title="User:Burtonpe">Burtonpe</a> 15:58, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am an engineering student at McMaster University and The Iron Ring Clock has become part of our legacy. My friends who come to visit from other universities were impressed when they saw it. I use this wikipedia site as a means of promoting my school and yes, the biggest <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_ring.html" title="Iron ring">iron ring</a> I have ever seen or heard of. I have even had a professor use the clock as an example in a lesson on gear trains.

<li><b>Keep</b> As a co-creator of this piece of student art I (obviously) agree with the thought that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is a perfect froum for an article. The posting was not intended to be self promoting (as noted above) but merely an informative article on the history of this piece. If it was intended to be self-serving the original author would have likely included his name more than once (at the bottom, as one of the creators). The project has been cited in the City of Hamilton's news paper two, if not three times (copies of these articles can be posted if proof be needed) as well as student and University news. As for the debate regarding the largest iron ring - we've been through this. Read it again (<a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Ring_Clock_00c5.html" title="Iron Ring Clock">Iron Ring Clock</a>) in the context of the fact that the ring is largest representation of the Iron Ring worn by Canadian Engineers. I would love to see a larger one, but frankly with what we had to go through to have this one made I doubt it's likely one exists. The <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Ring_Clock_00c5.html" title="Iron Ring Clock">Iron Ring Clock</a> is a one of a kind piece of art. It is unique to McMaster University and, frankly, deserves to have this one, short article available in the public domain.dunkshows <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dunkshows (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dunkshows_1e01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dunkshows">contribs</a>) 2006-11-30 17:11:35 (UTC)</small> <small>— dunkshows (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dunkshows_0ce2.html" title="Special:Contributions/dunkshows">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>keep</b> Having previously been heavily involved with the McMaster Engineering Society I can testify to the clock's importance in introducing new engineering students to the McMaster culture and showing them what they can accomplish. The clock is seen by thousands of people everyday and is often remarked upon, by students and faculty both, as being an interesting and unusual piece that promotes McMaster.

And as to the COI issues: there are mentions of design drawbacks of the clock which seems to rule out strict vanity. Sections might need cleanup "Future plans" is a boarderline WP:Wikipedia is not a crystal ball violation and the detail given to the construction methods and design team may be excessive. I'd say 'weak' keep based on the boarderline notability and writing issues. Oh, and to the author, just because wikipedia has worse isn't a reason to save this one. Your arguments weren't bad, but they also didn't assert a grounding in wiki policy to keep the articles. The number of people that see the clock and mention it unfortunately isn't verifiable, and isn't really a source of wikipedia-defintion notability (a lot of peopel see the donut stand on the corner of North and Oakland too, and it's very distinctive architecturally, but it hardly deserves a wikipedia entry (donutcruft?)). If the design award can be proven, then that's the strongest argument in my book, as would non-trivial articles or mentions in notable press, heck, even the thesis paper the designers wrote, if published in a reputable journal would go a long way.129.89.68.218 22:36, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - seems a bit self-serving to me right now. When and if it is written up in some scholarly journals, then it can return. Alternatively, if kept, consider merging it in to <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMaster_University_8276.html" title="McMaster University">McMaster University</a> until it is noteworty enough to go solo. I looked for scholarly citations (not newspapers) in a graduate school library, and have yet to find the reliable resources I like to see. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 13:06, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If Wikipedia were restricted to only articles which were written up in multiple 'scholarly' sources found in graduate school libraries, then many hundreds of thousands of articles would be up for deletion along with this one.

<li><b>clarification request</b>: Which user do you mean copysan? I think it isn't unreasonable to expect that from the user if he's writing about something he was involved in. He did make full disclosure of his potential conflict of interest and has been generally acting in good faith. If he can steer clear of POV issues I don't see why that ought to be an automatic impeachment of his credibility. That said I agree with Kessiewonder that the existing writeup is a bit self-serving and might be toned down. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 07:31, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Sources</b> I've taken a pic of the award certificate for the Canadian Society of Mechanical Engineers competition in which the clock came 2nd, you can see it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Iron_Ring_Certificate.JPG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Iron_Ring_Certificate.JPG" rel="nofollow">here</a> or in the article; still hoping to scan it tomorrow at work. I know that this is not exactly an iron-clad source, but hopefully you will believe me when I say I did not spend my weekend creating this certificate. I think that this certificate, plus the articles in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hamilton_Spectator_8f5f.html" title="The Hamilton Spectator">The Hamilton Spectator</a> and the Toronto Metro, in addition to all the McMaster literature (calling these sources 'college newspapers' or 'student newspapers' as above is incorrect), are sufficient to show notability. The MacEngineer especially is an Alumni publication, with little to no student input and a predominantly off-campus circulation. I believe they certainly address the (legitimate) comments above regarding the broken link to the CSME award and the need for multiple, independant sources. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurtonpe_6ce9.html" title="User:Burtonpe">Burtonpe</a> 04:25, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
