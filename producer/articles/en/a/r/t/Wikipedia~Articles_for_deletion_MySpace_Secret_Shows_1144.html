<p>I was going to mark this as a speedy, but then I reconsidered and instead added a {{notability}} tag. The author removed the tag and rewrote the article so that it reads more like an advertisement, and left a note on the talk page telling people not to "vandalize" the article. While this could be real, it looks suspicious. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 01:38, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless third party references can be produced to establish the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> of it. The idea that "it is notable for bringing great bands to small towns" is subjective in more ways than one, and isn't in line with any of our notability criteria. <font color="CornflowerBlue"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo_0662.html" title="User:Leebo">Leebo</a></b></font> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo_c104.html" title="User talk:Leebo"><font color="#B22222">T</font></a></sup></small>/<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leebo_addb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leebo"><font color="#B22222">C</font></a></small> 01:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Let me start by saying this is not an advertisement i just like the idea of secret shows and i think it should have a wiki. Secondly as some of this may be subjective, which can be changed, it is all from the MySpace Secret Shows page. Lastly why would u delete a perfectly good article just because it needs some touching up. After all the more articles the better and i assure you all of this has sources even the qoute: "it is notable for bringing great bands to small towns" is from the official page. P.S. myspace secret shows IS real. o ya and sry for deleting the notice i was just mad u (or someone else deleted the page b4 it was even finished. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartini833_929d.html" title="User:Martini833">Martini833</a> 02:01, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b> Nothing to suggest notability. Saying they're notable for bringing bands to small towns is more like an opinion that some facet of notability that is actually attributable/verifiable. Non-notable. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 02:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well it's definately notable for more reasons. It has <b>famous</b> bands. Over 38 shows and has been running smoothly for more than a year. It is definately as notable as any event in the music scene and saying that it's not because they are "secret" is just like saying things that haven't come out yet and are not announced shouldnt be on wikipedia.. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartini833_929d.html" title="User:Martini833">Martini833</a> 02:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>Just because a band is notable doesn't mean that everything they participate in is notable. And yes . . . if something hasn't come out yet and is not announced and there is no information about notability, it should not be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 02:10, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK if you can give me three logical reason why this is NOT notable instead of trying to counter everything I say then I will admit it is not notable and you can take over. And by the way if i dont think it's logical than sorry no way is this article being deleted without a "notable" (hahaha used ur word) reason. Anyway i worked so hard on it and it is my first full fledged aricle so could u find out the facts (or just read the article cus the facts are all there) youll see that this is no advertisement and it is all *(dare i say) notably correct. BTW this was really hard to do with the wikipedia code i wasnt familiar with so...... STOP ruining a perfectly good article. And again the more articles the better (as long as they have facts which you can cjeck out here www.myspace.com/secretshows.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartini833_929d.html" title="User:Martini833">Martini833</a> 02:16, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>I realize it can be a bit difficult to get used to Wikipedia guidelines and I'm sorry if you feel as if people are giving you a hard time. However, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> provides some really good information about how to determine whether things are notable and it says <i>"A topic is generally notable if it has been the subject of coverage that is independent of the subject, reliable, and attributable."</i> Can you find any sources, other than those affiliated with myspace.com, that identify this group of shows as notable? Nobody doubts that this is a real group of shows. However, the standard for Wikipedia is not truth, but attribution and notability. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 02:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for not taking my above comment angrily. But anyways other sources can be found. But i couldnt just do that right now. I'll do that in some time. But why would you want to delete it. Check the sources. And if you could find others that find it notable that would be nice.

<li><b>Comment</b> if this was not notable then why would i look it up and realize no one had written it and be kind enough to do a well written (non advertising) esssay on it.

<p>How about this. From Wikipedia w/e "WHY DON'T YOU" you're the one that cares... and i think you know this by now MySpace Secret Shows is real and the article is fine. You just don't have anything else to do but delete things because it probably makes you feel good. How about u delete your ****ing profile and leave a good article (in this case myspace secret shows) alone. GAH you got me to tht level were im p***ed off. Thnk you</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Leebo is actually trying to help you by letting you know what you can do (add sources) in the next five days to reduce the chances of this article being deleted. I know that it can feel a bit overwhelming to be in the middle of this right after creating your first article, but try to keep a cool head. As for the other article you mentioned . . . the fact that other articles with similiar faults exists doesn't give any article a free pass. We judge each article individually. You have the next five days to improve the article. I've seen situations before where people have changed their opinions on an article after amendments were made to it. If you feel this strongly, why not channel your energy into improvements rather than tussling with other editors here? <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 03:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I read the article. First off, your argument that it's not "secret" when "secret" is in the title isn't convincing. It also doesn't matter, there's plenty of articles on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">secret things that aren't really secret</a>. The issue is, there's no independent press whatsoever on this. Supposed I put these words on my page, I found out about a show, and came back with "Oh, okay, these are real, keep them". That still wouldn't be enough, since to pass <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, you need independent, third-party sources. A newspaper article, a web post from a reliable site, a peer-reviewed journal, what have you. Something beyond a forum anyone can post to. The issue here is not whether it's true or not. The issue is whether it can be verified independently. As the article stands, it can't. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 21:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
