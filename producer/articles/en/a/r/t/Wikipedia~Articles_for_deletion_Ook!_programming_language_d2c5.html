<li><b>Keep</b>. It was invented as a joke, but it was a good joke. I first learn about it from Wikipedia and it made my day. Everybody (mostly professional software developers) I showed this page liked it too. By the way its description as Turing-complete is correct. Also, article is well written. --Vlad1 05:41, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Being a good joke is not a sufficient criterion for getting an article (or I'd be off to write The Priest, the Minister and the Rabbi walk into a bar...). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 17:58, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Additional comment. This is an article with long edit history and multiple contributors. Wikipedia contains several articles of this type, see for example COW_programming_language, but Ook_programming_language seems to be the most detailed one among them. The article does not contain any incorrect or unverified information, and it is a good and amusing read. To those who want to merge, may I suggest a principle: if it is not broken, do not fix it. You cannot merge it with<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Morgan-Mar_dac8.html" title="David Morgan-Mar">David Morgan-Mar</a> (which is a shorter article than this one) without either loss of information, or having the combined article look ugly.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Wikipedia is not paper. David Morgan-Mar's languages ought to be regarded as subpages of his page. So the question is: Would his page be too long if all content about his langagues was merged to his page. I feel the answer is yes. At any rate, this is clearly a matter for his article's talk page. Maybe merge all to Programming langauges of David Morgan-Mar? <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 12:52, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, and redirect to DM. It's just a trivial translation of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainfuck.html" title="Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a>. If that deserved an article, I could make a program to generate an infinite number of Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 17:57, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Although these are clearly "jokey" languages, each of them is, in some way, illuminating, and I can quite easily imagine these languages being discussed in a classroom environment. <a href="../../../o/o/k/Ook.html" title="Ook">Ook</a> shows in an amusing way that a Turing-complete language can be superficially very simple, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chef.html" title="Chef">Chef</a> explicitly draws on a common teaching metaphor, and so on. I fully agree with <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a>'s point that people don't use these languages to write actual code, and that they don't break any new ground. These languages are useless for programming, but useful for the light they shine on their underlying concepts. If the general feeling is that these articles are merged into some larger whole, I wouldn't mind too much, but keeping them as separate pages isn't killing any extra trees, so for now I'm minded to vote Keep. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 20:44, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: please stop renominating articles just because you have failed to have them deleted or because you don't understand the contents: repeated nominations have been in the past seen as disruption. Furthermore, the point of an encyclopedia is not to look up stuff you already know about: the point is to discover stuff you <b>didn't</b> already know. It should therefore come as no surprise if the content of an article is unfamiliar or even looks stupid.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> if everything had to be deadpan serious, a lot fewer people would use Wikipedia. I wouldn't. (note, anon addition by 213.222.35.125: <b>first edit</b>)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Because this is similar to other joke languages like <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainfuck.html" title="Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> or Malboge does not mean it should be deleted. It is still funny and we need fun. (note, anon addition by 195.6.25.114: <b>first edit</b>)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Even though it's not used for serious work, it's still a perfectly valid, Turing-complete programing language. (note, anon addition by 194.144.31.172: <b>first edit</b>)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: It doesn't violate any of the "grounds for speedy deletion" criteria; and if usefulness were a required feature of every article, Wikipedia would be a lot smaller!

<li><b>Keep it.</b> I didn´t knew what was Ook! until I read it on <a href="http://drupal.org/node/56815" class="external text" title="http://drupal.org/node/56815" rel="nofollow">Drupal</a>. Those guys told the community that they wanted to migrate from php to Ook!</li>
</ul>
<p>It is nice to know that when you are told about something, you can always read more about it here, at wikipedia. Ook! is a joke (I don´t care if it is a good one or a bad one), but <b>it exists</b> and that´s the important thing here. Why deleting it? Wikipedia is not (or shouldn´t be) a Judge, it is just an encyclopedia. <b>If it exists, it should be here. Period.</b>.

<li><b>Extremely Strong Keep</b> - I saw a reference to Ook! but did not know what it was, so i looked it up here. Yes, Ook! is a programmer’s joke. It is also part of our culture. This article is informative, well written, accurate, and referenced by other sites. Just because some may find it irrelevant, offensive, or fail to find it amusing doesn’t mean others won’t find value in it. The suggestion it be deleted is preposterous. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>; it is not limited by the number of articles. There is no harm in having such entries and no reason to remove useful reference material; Wikipedia would be diminished by such a loss. We shouldn’t even be having this discussion! – T.O. Rainy Day 1 April 2006 <small>user's 4th contribution</small></li>

<li><b>Save the baby Ooks!</b> - Yes, OF COURSE this is a joke language. So what? The <a href="http://drupal.org/node/56815" class="external text" title="http://drupal.org/node/56815" rel="nofollow">Drupal page</a> mentioned above lists code written in this language. That page links to this article. I got a chuckle out of the Drupal article and followed that link to learn more about the language. Isn't that what encyclopedias are for? If the article had been removed, I would have clicked on a dead link. How would that have made my day better? The next thing you know, we'll start deleting articles about comedians who tell bad jokes. <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGeary_3a1d.html" title="User:Geary">Michael Geary</a> 01:57, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or merge with Brainfuck. Ook! is not a different language from Brainfuck. —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 06:33, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Ook!. It is one of only a few joke programming languages that are widely enough known in the computer science community to deserve WP articles of their own.<br />
Note that the nominator of this article has also nominated Chef and Whenever for deletion, and has apparently merged the nominations with this one. This is wrong. Chef and Whenever are not widely known and would be good candidates for merging into David's article, while Ook! is notable and deserves its own. Perhaps someone would be kind enough to separate the nominations appropriately? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:57, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extremely Strong Keep</b> OoK! and Chef. I find all these esoteric languages interesting (especially Chef); They have a certain beauty. As someone said, <i>if it's not broken, don't fix it</i>. I don't know what would be gained from the deletion of both articles, and believe that they are to big to be in sections of their author's article. On the other hand, the article about <i>Whenever</i> is just a stub, and could be moved. <span style="font-color: blue"><a href="../../../f/i/p/User%7EFiP_20ec.html" title="User:FiP">F</a></span><span style="font-color: red"><a href="../../../f/i/p/User_talk%7EFiP_1312.html" title="User talk:FiP">i</a></span><span style="font-color: blue"><a href="../../../f/i/p/User%7EFiP_20ec.html" title="User:FiP">P</a></span> 14:52, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect. This is not an inherently interesting programming language, because it's similar or identical to Brainfuck. A single paragraph in the author's article will suffice to explain the language.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 03:28, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Extremely Strong Keep</b> - So what if its similar? It is a programming language, albeit similar, but it's an excellent article, and I was just looking for it; thankfully I found it! Putting it under 'David Morgan-Mar' is nonsense, it would make his page hugely long and complicated. 05:30, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Offhand? <b>Keep</b> almost any article whose edit history is long and varied enough that it is obvious we have enough interested editors to keep the article accurate. This criterion is less contentious than "notability" and does almost the same job. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCristofani_92da.html" title="User:DanielCristofani">DanielCristofani</a> 07:49, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Clear <b>Keep</b>. A couple of minutes ago, I remembered having read about Ook! several years ago and checked to see if we have an article on it - which should serve to demnonstrate that even articles on joke languages can have some research value. Wikipedia is not paper, and we don't gain anything by deleting these articles (I could live with a merge and redirect, though - but outright deletion is out of the question). -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 10:34, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
