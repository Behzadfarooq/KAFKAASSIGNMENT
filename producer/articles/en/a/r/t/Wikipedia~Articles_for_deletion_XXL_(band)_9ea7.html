<li>Primary notability criterion: have they been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable secondary sources independent of the band? If yes, add references ot the article.

<li>They're notable for the nature of their failure on the contest, kind of a Macedonian, oh, what's that engineering guy from Cal who sang so badly on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">Idol</a>? I've seen unkind references to them and comments about them over the years in places like Italian Vogue (maybe Spanish Cosmo?) and French newspapers--not sure, but European magazines. There might be more information in Macedonian. They're a bit of a European in-joke. I don't know anything about them, really, but they are the sort of small bit of information people should be able to come to an web encyclopedia to find out what folks are talking about, as they are still mentioned years later, when other losers are not remembered. I feel fairly certain that with some digging from a good editor a credible small article could be made up. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 16:22, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> They're notable enough, if not for reasons they would like to be noted. Still, Guy's points on the attack portion must be heeded, and this must be removed until and unless there are credible sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> regarding the potential attack-status of the article, I've now cited John Kennedy O'Connor's book in which he makes the (tongue-in-cheek, I believe, given the way in which he talks about a number of other acts) suggestion that the dancing was worked on to the exclusion of the vocals. Obviously that's "sourced POV" at best, but at the very least it's now sourced. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:20, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, while it really should have at least one reliable source to confirm its notability, there are loads of articles like this which are not nominated for deletion, probably because more US users are familiar with them. Deleting this smells like US-centrism to me. It should however be noted that Matrix17 has canvassed this vfd on a bunch of user talkpages in a not entirely neutral manner, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALucy-marie&amp;diff=119764748&amp;oldid=119577892" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALucy-marie&amp;diff=119764748&amp;oldid=119577892" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 18:05, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That's never an argument for keep, that other articles are just as worthless. Please, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">User:Mackan</a> start nominating "the loads of other articles just like this" if you feel they should be deleted, rather than voting to keep this one just because the others are not put up for deletion. This group should stay, because they do have an awkward sort of notoriety, mostly European, admitedly sad that Guy hasn't heard of them. But if there are articles more deserving of being deleted, please propose them for deletion instead of arguing because they exist other crap should be allowed to exist. Also, Matrix didn't canvas me, exactly who did he/she canvas? I notify folks if I know they are interested in an article, and the science folks have a bulletin board which announces science topics up for deletion. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:41, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
