<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> the daily sports report. I have no idea what the justification is for articles about utterly routine results of sports contests. Shouldn't this be in Wikinews or something? Thousands of sporting contests are played every day all over the world, but for some reason English cricket matches are considered notable. I think maybe this should be one of the Centralized Discussions and not just individual AfDs. There is absolutely nothing encyclopedic about a report of a minor sporting match. We're not talking about the FA World Cup or even international test matches here. -- <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 18:56, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is becoming seriously annoying. We have had many discussions over this. I can recall five off the top of my head. The end result was "no consensus". I simply cannot believe people are still nominating them. Perhaps they are just ignorant of what has gone before. If so, allow me to summarise. These articles are not going to last forever. Shortly, at the end of the English cricket season, they will be merged into relevant articles. In the meantime, they are being transcluded onto various other pages so we have <i>something</i> on these pages. This accounts for the odd formatting. Thus they will not stand forever as articles in their own right. On the other hand, it's true, it's verifiable. Why delete? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 19:43, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sigh. Perhaps the fact that you are getting lots of AfDs on this matter is a sign you are doing something wrong? The idea of keeping temporary articles on something that are later merged and deleted is definitely non-standard practice. One thing to do is to keep them on temporary pages outside of the main wiki space. I struck out my delete vote, but please think about these things next time. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 20:17, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe it's a sign that what we're (sorry, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> and <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> with our support) doing is controversial and unusual. Non-standard, certainly. But <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">what's so wrong with that</a>? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 20:27, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Besides, where would we "ask for permission" to do such a thing? It's a wiki. There's no one holy god to ask permission for every single gritty thing we want to do. If we did it on the Village pump, people might argue that "oh, not everyone reads that stuff" and list it on AfD anyway. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 20:50, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really being critical, and definitely IAR, I agree. You can probably avoid all these annoying AfDs from people who aren't up to speed if in the future you put them in a temp space, e.g., User:Sam Korn/Northamptonshire v Somerset 29 June 2005. It is very unusual for articles to be created in the main space with the expectation that they will later be deleted -- hence all the delete votes from people who think it's a permanent article.

<li>Cheers. Trouble was, we actually did that originally, and it gave problems with mirror pages such as answers.com, so they were moved into the main namespace.

<li>Would you argue that the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_eb85.html" title="2005 English cricket season">2005 English cricket season</a> is non-notable? If so, sorry for wasting your time. If not, then these articles are valuable in creating the pages on the 2005 English cricket season, since it eases the strain on editors and creates good summary pages from different perspectives, as I have outlined above. Some might come here to see how the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty20_in_England_in_2005_0918.html" title="Twenty20 in England in 2005">Twenty20 Cup</a> went, others would perhaps have an interest in how Somerset's season were. That's how these articles are structured - and just FYI, <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECricket_b112.html" title="WP:Cricket">WikiProject Cricket</a> were planning to merge them into the consistuent articles once the season was over. 19:46, 18 September 2005 (UTC) <small>(<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Vimes_177e.html" title="User talk:Sam Vimes">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sam_Vimes_afdf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sam Vimes">contribs</a>) 19:50, 18 September 2005 (UTC))</small>

Effectively <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECricket_b112.html" title="WP:Cricket">WP:Cricket</a> is creating an almanack that will, in time, exceed <i>Wisden</i> in depth (though probably not renown).

<li><b>Strong delete</b> I fail to think of any possible argument to keep it.

<ul>
<li>We've rehearsed the Wikinews thing endlessly over and over in all the previous VfDs on this same set of articles. If I can borrow your quaint phrasing, did you even heard about respecting previous consensus? --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> <sup><a href="../../../n/g/b/User_talk%7ENgb_2abf.html" title="User talk:Ngb">?!?</a></sup> 14:15, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So why these articles weren't transwikied to Wikinews? They'd like them there very much. Problem solved. Cricket fans can do their original reporting and Wikipedia gets free of this POV ridden stuff. Also there was never a consensus on keeping these articles. Ask any Wikipedian not affiliated with cricket what he thinks about it? He'll probably say: original reporting, not suited for Wikipedia. And he'll be right. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 14:54, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, they wouldn't like them very much, because of licensing problems. Unless the writer of the articles (well, ok, me) agreed to license the articles in the public domain. As for "original reporting"? The <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy</a> is: "The phrase "original research" in this context refers to [...] data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication'". The data it is based on is published in a reputable publication, and even linked to in the article. Of course it has to be rephrased and put it in a new form, otherwise someone would slap a copyvio on the page! As for "ask any Wikipedian not affiliated with cricket what he thinks about it" - that's how TWO successive VfDs have ended in keeps, with many votes from people not even on WP:Cricket? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 15:10, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think this may reveal one of the reasons we're having difficulty reaching consensus either way on this issue.

Also, I have a feeling that some matches in the 2005 season will be talked about for many, many years to come (see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_2005_Ashes_4595.html" title="The 2005 Ashes">the 2005 Ashes</a>, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 18:35, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
