<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>. The count was 27-25 keep, counting 2 Redirect comments and 1 Merge All comment as Deletes. With this many commentators, raw totals take on greater importance in determining consensus, in my opinion. No way am I going to close this as a Delete with that many Keep comments. On the other hand, neither numbers nor strength of argument is enough to make this a clear straight-out Keep. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:22, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know how to Multi-Delete, but I want this to be an AFD for all the suspects. It should be deleted because, while notability has been established, thats all we have. If any extra details become available they should be dealt with within the article on the plot. Havinf this one line of text pages for all the suspects serves no obvious purpose.

It's well-referenced, and there are no grounds for deletion within the policies.

<li><b>Comment</b> Having a model as half sister and a politician for a father aren't notable points, even that article boils down to one item of "being arrested", which is not worth an article in itself. I would also dispute that it's well referenced, I do not regard "a newspaper reported that an unnamed neighbour said" as very reliable, for example, expecially as <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> required "high quality references". Also, "more information is likely" is very crystal ball. Failing notability, WP:NOT, and WP:BLP concerns are all grounds for deletion based on policy.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. There is no reason to create stubs for everyone arrested as long as they haven't even been charged. There names are listed in the main article, which is more than sufficient - and in many countries it would be a violation of privacy laws to publicly name people before they have sentenced, let alone not even been accused (i.e. charged) for anything. What if it turns out that all or most of them are totally innocent? Would anyone of you who say "Keep" like to have your own name forever linked with a false arrest on one of the most read websites in the world? As many people always think that a mere arrest means that a person must have done something, this could very effectively ruin the rest of your life. So, as a compromise, let's keep the names in the main article but delete the stubs. The fact that Slimvirgin has managed to put together a tabloid type gossip article more suited for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_e3a1.html" title="The Sun">The Sun</a> about one of the arrested persons is no reason to keep it. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 14:24, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom and above. This is Wikipedia, not Wikinews. This is not supposed to be a news database. These suspects are not encyclopedically notable enough for their own articles at this time. There's no need for in-depth profiles on them.

Maybe re-list those who are turned loose. But I have a funky feeling those are going to be furiously argued to be kept because obviously they prove the evil scheming police keep arresting the wrong people&#160;:-) <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 16:45, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reluctant Keep</b> All of these eventually can/will be filled out with more information, and at the least are fine as valid stubs.

<li><b>Delete all</b> the only claim to notability is being arrested/charged, which is not sufficent for individual articles, even if more "padding" is added to lengthen them. They may become notable in the future, but wikiepedia is not a crystal ball, neither is it a news outlet. Also, as is common in breaking news stories, newpapers report comments by relatively unreliable people ("A neighbour/friend/eyewitness") which are often sensationalist, and later retracted/overridden. Wikipedia should not be in the business of repeating gossip immediately without allowing a reasonable time to elasp and check whether it was unfounded or not. As an encyclopedia, we should act like one with calm, measured, and unhurried actions, and not act like a tabloid newspaper trying to get the "scoop". In short, by failing notability, WP:NOT, and having WP:BLP concerns are all be grounds for deletion based on policy.

<li><b>Delete all</b> On BBC Radio 4's World Tonight news programme yesterday evening (21 Aug 2006), a criminal lawyer expressed concerns that media coverage and speculation would make it difficult for the suspects to have a fair trial. If you think the suspects may be guilty, you'll agree that a fair trial is essential for them to be convicted and sentenced; if you think they may be innocent, you'll also agree a fair trial is essential so they can be released. Strongly disagree with expanding the pages now: whether they are innocent or guilty, second-hand speculation based on flimsy media reports ("neighbours said he looked a bit shifty") doesn't help the suspects or the aim of justice. At the moment, the pages are too minimal to be of any use... and anyone who wants the suspects' names can get them elsewhere. It would be more appropriate to list them if they are actually convicted. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusswann_0ff9.html" title="User:Marcusswann">Marcusswann</a> 13:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all, morons!</b>: It is very important to keep record of the acts of this fascism and manipulation of the public mind towards the real 1984. Would you keep the records of the Jews murdered by Goebbels around? I think so. The tired argument that this is not encyclopedic relies on the empty argument that this space we are working in is anything like the ridiculous hardbound volumes of drool hoisted upon us in our youths by "experts" who "knew" more than we, as a collective consciousness, did. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolon67_7a0d.html" title="User:Holon67">Holon67</a> 14:42, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
