<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Of the 7 keep votes (discounting duplicate votes), one was "it's edited a lot", two were "but this article was kept", three were "it's interesting", and one was "it's been around for over a year". The (12) editors arguing 'delete' made arguments related to its inherent POV, citing <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, a lack of sources (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>), and the subjectiveness of the subject and its title.

<p>Crufty, unsourced list with the nebulous criteria of "famous" and "failure". Famous is a vague criteria - many of the examples in this list are not famous. <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_7J7_fbb8.html" title="Boeing 7J7">Boeing 7J7</a>? Unnamed VSTOL aircraft? <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summerland.html" title="Summerland">Summerland</a>? Failure, actually, is the more problematic criteria. Is the M-16 a failure because it was initially deployed wrong (though it is now a resounding success). Is ALGOL a failure because it declined in popularity? In many cases this has turned into a condemnation of unsuccesful technologies. The criteria is subjective and ultimately ,unencyclopedic. I have also separately nominated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_famous_successes_in_science_and_engineering_aaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of famous successes in science and engineering">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of famous successes in science and engineering</a> <a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 22:18, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Failure to conform to NPOV is usually remedied by editing, Mmx has shown serious judgement failure in the past. He has appointed himself final arbiter of truth on the F-14, see talk on <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14.html" title="F-14">F-14</a> even though he refuses to recognize any citations contrary to his POV up to Janes Defence, and a VP of Grumman. He has simply followed a link at the bottom of the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-111.html" title="F-111">F-111</a> page, from the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14.html" title="F-14">F-14</a> page, and is simply another example of removing material from the WP without justification. This page is obviously well trafficed and edited, and of use to many people. WP states that deletion of information which does not improve WP is vandalims. In my opinion, this is exactly what Mmx1 is attempting to do. Please do not support this behavior.--<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 14:05, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't see a big distinction from a list of failures.

<dd><b>Comment</b>Disaster has a tighter definition in terms of loss of human life (apparently the list defn is broader). And as the link indicates...it's getting very vague. Every airline crash is apparently considered a "disaster". I would call that list a "disaster." What constitutes a "failure". Is wikipedia a "failure"? Can I list individual wiki pages I consider bad on the list of technological failures? If you can offer a definition we can live with, great. Since I doubt you can, I voted delete.
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> See the Wiktionary entry for <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Failure" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Failure">failure</a>, definition 1. No need to redefine a word that is already perfectly well defined. If you want a real challenge, try getting a consensus on the definition of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enotability_75cc.html" title="WP:notability">notability</a>.&#160;:) Entries that are non-notable should be removed from the article, but the article itself should stay, since it does contain many notable entries. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 01:09, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Sure, the word has a definition. But it's a pretty shitty inclusion/exclusion criteria.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Dryguy, the maiden voyage of the Titanic was a failure, but calling it an "engineering failure" IS POV, because you can just as easily blame human error for the accident.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I didn't realize Titanic was on the list. I only meant that to illustrate that failure is not neccesarily POV. Wether it belongs on this particular list is another issue. It doesn't affect the validty of entries that are truly about science or engineering failures. (Titanic probably qualifies, since one of the problems was failure of the designers to include enough lifeboats - that was a tragic and notable failure of engineering, but I digress). <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 02:01, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep (cleanup)</b> - while I voted delete for List of famous successes in science and engineering, I will give weak support for keeping this article. It's not essential to Wikipedia, and may have some problems <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>-wise, but it's always interesting to find out about the scientific or engineering projects that generally <i>weren't</i> so successful (it's not so interesting reading about successes, as most people, for obvious reasons, know about them anyway).

<li><b>Comment</b> Ditto. I was interested to read in this list about (e.g.) <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a> that, "after much hype, claims of success proved false". Simply a glib POV pronouncement. Success/failure (see my above comments) are too vague to provide a workable article topic. There are several <i>commercial</i> failure lists in WP, since commercial failures can be verified. Several prototypes are listed here as failures. Prototypes are a normal step in a design process, they are not "failures" if they do not reach production stage. <a href="../../../v/2F/s/V_STOL_5145.html" title="V/STOL">V/STOL</a> a failure? Seriously? The list - literally - goes on. This is just POV original research, with inclusion ungrounded in WP policies relating to verifiability and reliable sources. The criteria are so broad that anything can be crowbarred into the category, so cleanup will not help. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 13:14, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s>Strong Keep</s> Isn't it WP policy that deletion of information without improving WP is vandalism? Mmx1 has shown bad faith in revert many edits on the F-14 page without justification, even with cited. He has refused to accept any citation up to the VP of Grumman nd Janes Defence. Deleting tnis page removes significant information not contained in other articles, and removing this on the basis that declaring something a failure would logically also neccesitate the removal of all the flop pages, computers, movies, education, and the like. Stop this madness now. It just ticks me off how many wiki people simply run around kicking down other peoples sandcastle. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 14:00, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I believe it's an interesting page, and I really don't see the POV problem. Cleanup might be appropriate, but the concept is fine.

<li><b>Keep</b>: In my (admittedly brief) time with Wikipedia I have become progressively more frustrated with the phenomenon of premature and/or frivolous AfDs. Apart from the time and effort they consume, and the lack of respect that they show towards the originating editors, where is the virtue of strangling articles at birth?

<li><b>comment</b> It should be noted this is evidence that this request for deletion is merely the extension of the edit war from the F-14 / F-111 page. I am the editor in question, I am responsible only for the SST and F-111 sections, both are easily verifiable as having been identifed or called failures. All of these mentions are based on verifiable sources, and I have already revised many of them to include sources of the mention of people who thought they were failures. It is a WP principle that no article of value which can be revised should be deleted. It should also be noted that Mmx1 has shown very poor judgement in retaining his POV that the F-14 was never designed to be an air superiority fighter, I have presented many sources, up to and including the VP and F-14 test pilot of Grumman and Janes Defence, and since he has no acceptable citations, he is free to revert any edit, since all edits are therefore unveriable except by him. It would be tragic if these articles were deleted merely as a tactic by an editor who is not qualified to revert or delete any material from the WP without detracting from its value. And Mmx1, go deface and destroy somebody else's pages. The majority of this article was created by hundreds of other editors who may see their work vanish without a trace because you believe the F-14 wasn't a dogfighter. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 15:42, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> inherently POV - what's "famous" and what's a "failure"? And the way scientific development works, todays failure could be tomorrows success.

<li><b>Comment</b> The current disclaimer in the article stating "Inclusion in this article can not be used as an objective judgment of whether a project was or was not actually a failure by any particular criterion" pretty much sums up the case for deletion. An admission of the intrinsic unencyclopedic POV nature of the list. I personally don't think this list can ignore WP policy simply by stating "this list ignores WP policy". --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 14:19, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Whether a project failed or not is or can be objectively determined and is thus not POV. What makes it famous is its size or importance, which can be POV, but not any more so than any other article on WP. This is a very useful article which has been here for well over a year, and has been nominated AFD as a result of a content dispute. This is no reason for an article of long standing to be deleted. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 15:19, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, take that Mmx1. Let that be a lesson to you tha AFD is not simply another tool to revert an editor you do not agree with. It's simply mind boggling that Mmx1 believes that if I had a hand in the F-111, and SST, and and had citations for both, that would be grounds for throwing out the entire page and work of hundreds of other editors that built it. He would simply toss this article and its newly created opposite twin to the delete happy wiki-wolves. If Wikipedia had ebay feedback, you'd have so many negatives your nose would be bleeding by now. WP will create policies to protect against editors like you, and there will be justice in the end. Jesus is watching you. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 17:25, 5 July 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I hope I am not speaking only for myself when I say, I could not care less about Wiarthurhu/matador300's dispute with the nominator of this AfD, and certainly do not see any reason for that editor to bring this issue up three times in this discussion, when there are clearly problems with the article that are not being addressed, and when on-topic comments made here have basically been ignored. I object to the user Wiarthurhu posting on <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlainster_af05.html#They.27ve_killed_the_List_of_famous_failures_in_science_and_engineering.21_You_Bastards.21.21" title="User talk:Blainster">Blainster's discussion page</a> that "The wiki-thugs are all voting to delete the page", then using that editor's vote to yet again waffle on about the nominator. I would prefer comments to be restricted to the issue of this article's obvious deficiencies. I have seen absolutely nothing of any substance that can save this fatally flawed piece of POV-riddled original research from deletion. I woulda thought user Wiarthurhu/matador300 would at least have made some vague effort to address the concerns voiced here. The silence is deafening. Have the balls to call us "wiki-thugs" to our faces at the very least, but please don't cower beneath the skirts of buddies to prop up this POV/NOR nightmare. Thanks. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 18:46, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The record will show that this editor was a contributor to the Famous Failures article long before either of the two disputants showed up there. I am not a supporter or ally of either of them.
