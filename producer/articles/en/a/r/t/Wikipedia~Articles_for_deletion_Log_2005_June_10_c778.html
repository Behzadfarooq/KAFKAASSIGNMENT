<li><b>Comment</b> -- I made the page Neutral-Point-of-View, so it's more "factual". However, it seems to be one of those "high school bands" as I'd call it, since their official site is Tripod. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker">MessedRocker</a> 00:14, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The original author also modified <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horrorcore.html" title="Horrorcore">horrorcore</a> to add a list of bands (including Wiked Wood and Playaz Lounge Crew, both on VfD today) of which none appear on <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Music_Guide_0e49.html" title="All Music Guide">AMG</a> (the change has since been reverted). --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien">Dachannien</a> 00:55, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The fact that someone so obviously intimate with the band has so little to say about them suggests how non notable this entry is -<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantym_71d6.html" title="User:Phantym">Phantym</a> 04:37, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Leave Article</b>. Wiked Wood is a well known underground horrorcore group in Philidalphia, PA. I was actually the one that put them up with a bunch of other great underground acts from this genre. Someone did not look up their facts right about Wiked Wood, because if they had they would know that Wiked Wood has a huge fanbase and also is shown love by horrorcore fan sites such as www.realjuggalettes.com, www.hallsofillusions.com, faygoluvers.net and many others! Playaz Lounge Crew is actually in the underground psychos contest held by Psychopathic Records and is considered to be the top contender and on their way to becoming one of the biggest things in horrorcore!

<li><b>Mild Keep</b> While I wonder why something self-described as "underground" could have an entry <i>anywhere</i> as anything other than historical or sociological note, this is a group with it's own web site and following. So what if I've never heard of them and never would - this is not a paper encyclopedia and not restricted to what lots of people know. As to "notable" - I've seen it said that something is notable if it's in Wikipedia and it is here so it is notable: i.e. it requires a better reason than "not notable" to be removed.<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnorre_e9eb.html" title="User:Snorre">-Snorre/Antwelm</a> 14:25, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I don't think that U2 would care if they were mentioned here, because they're well known.

<li><b>Weak Keep - Comment</b> This article was around for over a year with at least an additional 25 lines or so extant in the earlier versions. These effectively were a TOC, but at least gave a reader a sense of what was in the book. As such, the article is something of a book review. If you're gonna vote, take a look at the truncation four or five versions back. I think this needs a <b>clean</b> or possibly an <b>attention</b>, but delete seems a bit overdone as this seems to be more a case of sloppy or overzealous editting to a standard that need not apply for such a narrow focused topic. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fabartus</a> 03:08, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd argue that tables of contents and back-cover-type summaries are better done by other sites - perhaps Amazon. If that's the only neutral thing to say about a book (reviews aren't designed to be neutral), then I'd argue they're unencyclopedic. Some books have plenty to say about them, such as the context of their production or the influence they've had; think <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bell_Curve_a590.html" title="The Bell Curve">The Bell Curve</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Grapes_of_Wrath_ebd9.html" title="The Grapes of Wrath">The Grapes of Wrath</a></i>.

<li><b>Delete</b> at best, this is highly specialized topic that is unlikely to amount to much more than gibberish to the non-engineering/mathematician reader. In effect, it's a <b>technical DicDef</b> that fails in clarity. In my considered opinion as an Engineer, the cited <b>VSM</b> article, tho' better written, should probably accompany it, for same reasoning. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fabartus</a> 03:43, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, but for a different reason. I don't mind specialized articles; its just that this one is so incredibly poorly written. And mind you, it was written by the very same person (Dominik Kuropka) who wrote the journal article in 2003. If the original author can't be bothered to state their claim clearly, why should we bother? <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 04:27, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Expand, a weak keep</b> I have tried to clean the article up a bit, so that it is at least parsable. I certainly wouldn't shed any tears over it if it fell off a cliff, but at least it might be worth keeping long enough to see if someone can expand it. -<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantym_71d6.html" title="User:Phantym">Phantym</a> 04:54, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../v/e/c/Vector_space_model.html" title="Vector space model">vector space model</a>. As far as I understand it, the vector space model is one of the traditional models in information retrieval, and definitely deserves an article in Wikipedia. The topic-based VSM seems barely notable, but it is published in conference proceedings, so we can mention it in the VSM article. I doubt that lack of clarity is a reason for deletion. <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> 09:34, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../v/e/c/Vector_space_model.html" title="Vector space model">vector space model</a>. I haven't messed with serious math at greater than high school level for over twenty years, but this article and the accompanying references are quite clear and informative about their subject matter. You transform a document into a series of multidimensional arrays ("vectors in a multidimensional space") which can then be manipulated algorithmically by just about any automatic filtering method ever invented. The reference paper provides a codable schema and some simple examples in SQL to enable similarity metrics to be computed on documents. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:22, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

And of course Jitse is correct about "lack of clarity" not being a valid (i.e. consensually accepted) reason for deletion.

<ul>
<li>So, Wikipedia allows neologisms from some celebrities but not from others depending on the level of fame achieved by the celeb? Ms. Sweetnam is in fact very well known. She's had a top 40 hit in the states, her album has sold very well considering it's a debut, and her videos have gotten good airplay on Muchmusic and YTV Hitlist. Also, she's a much better speaker than Bush and is obviously much hotter. - I don't have a name
<ul>
<li>Yes. Isn't fame, after all, the metric of notability? If I were to curse out the pope tomorrow morning, no one would care. If <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a> were to do so, people would be incensed. Why?

<li>Comment: There is no such thing as "speedy keep" because keepiing is the default. Improper listing requires no votes at all. The nominator should unlist it on VfD, but even if he or she doesn't, it's rather meaningless unless folks don't read the votes and vote delete anyway. Jumping in to vote "strong keep" and "speedy keep" just looks like finger wagging, which is not very nice. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:52, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the clarification. I've seen speedy keep in use, and my intention was certainly not to finger wag, just to get it off VfD asap, to save space.

<li>On the contrary, <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD</a> describes <i>speedy keep</i> as: "a (rarely used) shorthand for 'Keep this article and close the discussion now'. A voter who votes 'Speedy Keep' thinks that the nomination was an improper one that was made purely as vandalism." I don't think that Kappa and Scimitar believed Denni's nomination was in bad faith, so speedy keep doesn't apply here, but it <i>does</i> apply in other cases. Perhaps this shorthand could use some further clarification in <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD</a>? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>–∏<small>D</small>—è<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 23:26, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Homonazi seems to be a term of abuse which is used by nearly no one. It gets 75 hits on Google: fewer than most mispelled words, and fewer than many other nologisms.

<li><b>Delete or speedy delete</b>. Text of article right now is as follows: "A "homonazi" is a term of abuse which is used by nearly no one. It gets 75 hits on Google: fewer than most mispelled words, and fewer than many other nologisms. Since it is a made-up word, it has no definite meaning, but the person who put it in Wikipedia wants you to think it means a militant homosexual who has an irrational hatred of heterosexuals-whatever that may be. The term, said person purports, was first heard in general speech and observed in newspaper correspondence about 2003 or 2004. In actuallity it seems to have been made up by some dittohead, who imagines it to be a parallel with the term of abuse conjured up by his hero, Rush Limbaugh, namely feminazi." Sounds like the author's asking for it to be deleted. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 04:21, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Germaine Hitler's latest edit of this article leaves it in a state whereby it only acts as a personal attack on both the anon writer, and...Rush Limbaugh?

<li>Eh? The bit that I think you're referring to reads: <i>In actuallity</i> [sic] <i>it</i> [sc. the term] <i>seems to have been made up by some dittohead, who imagines it to be a parallel with the term of abuse conjured up by his hero, Rush Limbaugh, namely feminazi.</i> If that's an attack, it's an attack on the creator of the neologism, not the writer of the article -- unless of course they're identical (which wouldn't surprise me). But I don't think it's an attack. It's a criticism and speculation, and probably shouldn't be there for those reasons. Viciousness level: zero. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 12:58, 2005 Jun 10 (UTC)

<li>Yes, there is. For one thing, how do people know what they're voting to delete if you've replaced the content? On Wikipedia, replacing an article's content with your own opinion is called <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>.‚Äî<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 15:51, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a mixture of the wrong and the simplistic, Wahoofive. While replacement of encyclopedic content with mere personal opinion is bad and arguably vandalism, the VfD template says <i>You are welcome to edit this article</i>. And people can know what they're voting to delete by clicking to look at it; if they worry that the content of the article may be unusually volatile, they're always free to specify the version that they're voting to delete; and they should always specify the reason(s) for deleting it. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:03, 2005 Jun 12 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: It is unverifiable. All the article establishes is that some dude wrote a script and that MS bought it. How many scripts are bought in a year that don't ever get made? Note that this was not bought by a studio, but by Microsoft. There <b>is no movie.</b> There is a <b>desire for a movie.</b> Imagine what it would have been like if someone had written an article on the <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (movie)</i> back in 1990. After all, a script had been written, and, what's more, the rights had been sold to an actual studio. When did the movie actually come out? 2005. It's just happy feet to think that this is unlike any other crystal ball article. Delete until the thing actually exists.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have added to the article. In my view, the fact that the film is a Microsoft developed project clearly makes it notable. Microsoft has reached a tentative agreement with 20th Century Fox and Universal Pictures and the project represents the first film project associated with Microsoft is a notable fact. The crystal ball rule should only apply when there are serious doubts about verifiability and/or notability. There are 57 news articles on Google News currently about this project. <a href="http://news.google.com/nwshp?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ncl=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,16734,00.html%3Ftnews" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/nwshp?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ncl=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,16734,00.html%3Ftnews" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> as at the time of this vote indicating both the presence of verifiable information and notability.

<p>I've fallen into the trap of making articles when others exist, it can spawn different versions of articles as we've seen.

<li>Yep, that's easy to do. Sometimes the wiki search helps, but I find my bookmark to use google better. Now, if I can only remember to use it. Oh, this problem also happens when different editors put the same data in different articles. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 06:24, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have recreated this article (didn't see this talk page). I wiki-linked his name on the ESRI article and the link just redirected back to ESRI (odd, unexpected behavior). Anyway, he has been instrumental in the development of Geography (academically) and GIS. I think he ought to have a separate article, distinct from ESRI. So, I'll keep what I have written.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 11 "delete" votes, 6 "keep" votes and 2 people who abstained. The article was moved (to correct a typo in the title) and edited during the discussion. One of the keep votes was conditional on a "major rewrite" but was made <i>after</i> the rewrite had been accomplished (which implies that the rewrite may not have been sufficient). Reviewing the history, the rewrite strikes me more as copyedit and formatting that the major overhaul requested by the "delete" voters.</p>
<p>I am going to call this one as a "no concensus" which defaults to keep for now. If the article is not substantially improved in a reasonable period of time, it may become appropriate to renominate the article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:34, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've never seen Wikipedia's systemic bias so nakedly demonstrated. GNAA, if it's famous at all, is known only as a bunch of Slashdot trolls. This group made headlines and has been noticed by UCB School or Law and the National School Boards Association, and the founder has spoken at the California Republican Assembly's anniversary convention. There's no comparison. HSCA is one organization an ordinary person might in fact have read about in a newspaper and want to know about. GNAA is not even well known to anybody who sets his Slashdot filter to a reasonable level. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:09, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This sounds like special pleading to me. We're not making value judgements about the achievements of an organization, we're deciding whether it's reached the level at which it is of interest to more than a few people. We know that UCB School of Law and National School Boards Association are tracking this organisation. We also know that Bueler shared a podium with a Republican Congressman, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Tancredo_2130.html" title="Tom Tancredo">Tom Tancredo</a>, at the California Republican Assembly's 70th anniversary conference in April, in his role as founder of this organisation.

<dd>I agree that Kappa's rewrite ahs improved things immensely. I've now removed maundering nonsense like "called the "flower of life" because it contains a number of other shapes within its deceptively simple pattern", and commented out the unsourced quotation (even if it stays, something should be said about whether there's any truth in it at all, which I doubt).

<p>I count 13 "delete" votes and 9 "keep" votes (2 new users, 1 unsigned vote discounted. The delete voters clearly cited Wikipedia policy which explicitly states that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a list of links. The keep voters argued that this is merely a "list of ..." article and we have a precedent of accepting those articles.</p>
<p>One could argue that this is a drill-down article from <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">Podcasting</a> - that it provides examples which expand upon the text of the article. Reviewing <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">podcasting</a>, I note that it already has a few examples in the text and, further, that the podcasting article is not so large that additional examples would be burdensome to that article. <a href="../../../p/o/d/Talk%7EPodcasting_146e.html" title="Talk:Podcasting">Talk:Podcasting</a>, however, explicitly talks about the difficulty that they have had keeping the article from turning into a linkfarm (and, incidentally, provides several additional opinions supporting the perspective that a list of links is inappropriate in Wikipedia).</p>
<p>Looking at the current version of the article, I am compelled to agree that this is a list of links, not a list of encyclopedia topics. Every item in the list is linked externally. None are linked to Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>I am going to exercise my discretion on this one and decide in line with the stricter reading of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Notable or historically significant podcasts should have a Wikipedia article written on them <i>first</i> and then be linked directly into the <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">Podcasting</a> article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:59, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Addendum: I am explicitly keeping Talk:List of Podcasts because some of the facts presented on that page were relevant to this decision. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:04, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This isn't the point of an encyclopaedia. If you aren't convinced by that, also note that it would be impossible to have a meaningful list of podcasts now, you might as well have a list of 'popular TV shows' or 'popular bicycles'. Check 08:24, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If i read <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">podcasting</a> and want to find out more, i can go to list of Podcasts and learn what it is first hand. People expect more from wikipedia these days than just an old-fashioned encyclopedia. Wikipedia is used as a place to kick of one's investigation of a topic, and a list of podcasts complete or otherwise helps people investigate the podcasting topic. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 02:05, 2005 Jun 14 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If we're going to delete this list, then we need to delete all other lists on Wikipedia. We can't be selective in what listings we delete and which ones we keep. Do a search on "List of" and you'll see all the various lists that Wikipedia has. I think Wikipedia has the best chance for a NPOV listing of useful and/or entertaining podcasts that places like Google or other Podcast directories just can't compete with. And plus, it's very useful in discovering podcasts that search engines won't have listed. <a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoahK_3884.html" title="User:NoahK">Noah</a> 01:48, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I quote "There is nothing wrong with adding to an article a list of content-relevant links; however, excessive lists can dwarf articles and detract from the purpose of Wikipedia." That is why the listing of podcasts was removed from the main article... so it doesn't dwarf the main article.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> But i also thing there should be a Wikilink...</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It provides a valuable illustration to the article; why not simply add a title/subtitle explaining it as such? It's the equivalent of adding a movie poster to the article about a movie, except here, the poster is a little too large to be appended to the actual article page. Throw in a disclaimer saying that this list is by no means a comprehensive list but simply one meant to be illustrative, and I think it's a fine addition. <a href="../../../j/s/o/User%7EJsomethingk_323e.html" title="User:Jsomethingk">jsomethingk</a> 01:14, 17 June 2005</li>

<li>There is no sound basis for keeping an article with the title "Japanese Fascism:the bases to conduct at Japanese Nationalism". None. The following articles already exist, with coherent titles and content: <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_nationalism.html" title="Japanese nationalism">Japanese nationalism</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meiji_period.html" title="Meiji period">Meiji period</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taisho_democracy.html" title="Taisho democracy">Taisho democracy</a>, <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupied_Japan_22ca.html" title="Occupied Japan">Occupied Japan</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_War_bded.html" title="Pacific War">Pacific War</a>. Those articles <i>already exist</i> and can be added to and edited. Extract any useful content from this article and add it there. I don't think it is incivil, hurtful, or intolerant to state that these articles do <i>not</i> come close to an acceptable standard of writing or organization, whether they're two hours old or two years. Nor does that suggest bad faith on the part of the contributor or that the pieces themselves are worthless: there is indeed potential in the content. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen-w_c1ef.html" title="User:Ben-w">Ben-w</a> 23:41, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC).</li>

<li>Hmph, well I've just been reading a book about the archaelogical search for evidence for any truth behind the legend of the Trojan War, and in it it says the idea of Hellenism didn't emerge until the fifteenth century - before that, Greek monks habitually crossed themselves at Plato's name, that 'Hellenic Satan'. Hellenism meant pagan, you see. Of course, it never happened because the Turks took Constantinople in 1453, Athens in 1456 and Morea in 1460. Given that the Byzantines were actively hostile to Pagan Hellenism, then, this doesn't appear to be an appropriate term to use. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 18:15, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>????? KEEP THIS ARTICLE! I am the original editor. I Have no idea what provoked you to consider this for deletion. " You reasoning suggests there is a anglo-centric nature of the internet, it is not my problem if you cant find a decent link. Despite this little upset I would like help in getting maps showing the Empire. Other than that this article should link to Ottoman, Roman, Byzantine, nad perhaps Late Byzantine.</p>
<p>The reason it was called Hellenic is because the Greeks felt that Hellenic was no longer a term for Pagan or atleast the roots of Paganism and Hellenism were lost. They felt proud to be still Hellenes and as such reverted in teh late 1200 to calling themselves as Greeks or Hellenes. There should be no argument about their CHristianity at this stage in history, afterall they stood alone in 1453 against the Wave of Ottoman Turks and the Islamic Flood that would take the rest of Europe. Its not included in any other topic because you deleted its occurance from said topic please do not do that.</p>
<p>Because the term is a historical term ie like Byzantine is a historical term it should not be expanded much because it is really the official Roman Empire. That is why there should be a links from Roman EMpire to this phrase Hellenic Empire 1204AD if we consider the 4th crusade as the point where it was only Greece and Anatolia making up the Roman Empire. However, I put it a few years ahead for several and many other reasons it is up to debate.</p>

<li>Well, I haven't voted yet, I just stated that I wasn't aware, from what I know of the history of that time, that what the West now calls the Byzantine Empire was calling itself anything other than the Roman Empire (and don't bother telling us that the west had called it the Greek Empire, that was because they wanted to appropriate the title of Roman Empire for themselves). A Google for "Hellenic Empire" in .edu sites suggest that Western historians are more likely to consider that means Alexander's (ie. most of the mere 16 hits). I'm not sure what provoked the question about Christianity, the book I had at hand seemed to suggest they were devoutly Christian, hence their distaste for the pagan past of the area. But put bluntly, if this term is almost never used in the English language in the sense used here, why should Wikipedia start, unless there is some documented evidence that the people genuinely did refer to themselves as a Hellenic Empire? <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 22:29, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I also haven't voted, but <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenism.html" title="Hellenism">Hellenism</a> refers to the period of around 232 BC - 50 BC, when Alexander the Great's <i>empire</i> disintegrated into the Ptolemies, Seleucids, Antiochans, and Macedonians. When I hear "Hellenic empire," I think immediately of <b>redirect to hellenistic empire or <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenism.html" title="Hellenism">Hellenism</a>.</b> Otherwise, what we have is "Greek-speaking empire," which is not really definitie enough to discuss in political terms. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:21, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, a search of "Hellenic Empire of Byzantium" returns 23 hits -- great, not very helpful, although at least these few are known to refer to the so-called Eastern Roman Empire. Sadly, college was several years ago, so the room-mate is not immediately available. What is important here is that the Greeks, who call themselves Hellenes today, label whatever Empires they can "Hellenic" as an expression of their patriotism. I don't think they make the claim that Byzantium widely called itself "Hellenic," but it didn't widely call itself "Byzantine" either -- as suggested, the people thought of themselves as Rome of the East. However, present-day Greeks do call Byzantium the Hellenic Empire (if our ranting contributor establishes anything, it is this), and might search for such here. Until a native Greek (willing to sign his talk contributions) comes along with cites to expand "Hellenic Empire," I suggest a <b>Disambigulation</b> at Hellenic Empire that says that the term may refer to either the Empire of Alexander or the Empire of Byzantium.

<p>As I mentioned it is an important time period different from Alexander the Greats "Hellenistic Empire". The Only place in former Greek lands in Europe that was not over-run by enemy forces was the location of Athens known as Hellas. During the ROman Empire this area of the Greek peninsula was called Hellas. In many historical accounts after the fourth crusade the term "Hellenes" starting to be used in reference to the area and to those last inhabitants of COnstantinople during the final siege 1453AD. The last emporer of the EMpire adressed his people as Greeks or Hellenes. So this is an important period in terms of cultural shift. So the term simply refers to either post fourth crusade 1204AD - 1453AD. Or it can also refer to when the empire simply consisted of Greece and Constantinople. It is a different period to the rest of Rome and should not really be included in the main topic of the Roman Empire even if it is infact the final stage or last existance of that empire.</p>

<li>That's because the so-called "St. Andrew's group of schools" merely describes a group of affiliated schools. It is not one educational institution, the same way <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_b6d5.html" title="Anglo-Chinese School">Anglo-Chinese School</a> actually dosent exist as one insitution either.

<li>Hmm....not really. SAJS's principal is Mrs Wai Yin Pryke. SASS's is Mrs Belinda Charles. SAJC's Mrs Lim Chye Tin. SAJC's new campus is still being constructed as we speak, and currently is located away from the other schools. We have other affiliated schools moving to neighbouring sites, but that dosent mean the school has merged into one. For clear definitions of the status of Singapore schools, it is far better to refer to the <a href="http://app.sis.moe.gov.sg/schinfo/index.asp" class="external text" title="http://app.sis.moe.gov.sg/schinfo/index.asp" rel="nofollow">School information Service of Singapore's Ministry of Education</a> page instead, because so long that these schools are listed seperately there, they are still officially considered seperate institutions.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 19:01, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, I goofed on using the term "principal" but the rest is true. Perhaps the head of SAS is still termed "warden"? Anyway, it's not necessary for the physical schools to be merged for the there to be an article on Saint Andrew's School. Furthermore, <a href="http://www.saintandrewsschool.info/index.cfm?GPID=15" class="external text" title="http://www.saintandrewsschool.info/index.cfm?GPID=15" rel="nofollow">Page 4</a> of the <a href="http://www.saintandrewsschool.info/index.cfm?GPID=12" class="external text" title="http://www.saintandrewsschool.info/index.cfm?GPID=12" rel="nofollow">history of Saint Andrew's School</a> and others show these schools all developed from the same institution. We have verged from the focus of discussion of this page. My point is that SAS page would be the site of merger of SAJS, if necessary. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 20:08, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I understand your concerns, but this phenomena of schools sharing the same heritage, or having split off from the same institution, is still not unique enough to warrant special treatment, at least in the Singaporean context. We do have several schools with different school names, yet are closely affiliated, and it is not always practical to lump them together (for eg, my former sch, Montfort Secondary School, is affiliated to St. Gabriel's Secondary School and Assumption English school, along with the associated primary/junior schools. What shall we call this unified entity, then? In addition, all these schools are Catholic schools, which are in turn affiliated to all other Catholic schools in Singapore. Where do we draw the line?). I personally feel that each school should have its own entry, provided they have substaintial material which are encyclopedic.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 20:25, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

Huaiwei, I understand what you are talking about there, but the 3 schools were originally one school ever since its founding (1862) until the 1970s or 80s when the 3 schools then split. So in essence, they are actually the one and the same school. This is not the same as brother/sister school affiliation (eg St. Andrew's and St. Margaret's) or affiliation by religious movement (Fairfield Methodist and Paya Lebar Methodist) or branch schools (Anglo Chinese School (Independent) and Anglo Chinese School (Barker Road)).

<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be an element of extreme immediatism here. Even the original article as VfD'd was an article and gave the school's name, type, location, head teacher's name, a list of teachers and helpers, and a list of classes and clubs. Not bad for preteens, as Kappa says. The article only needed a little cleanup, a task which has been undertaken by Kappa, DoubleBlue and CalJW. The article now contains the Casualty reference and summarises the OFSTED report. It's now a very useful article about this urban primary school and a good refutation of the claim that school stubs are unencyclopedic. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:02, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know that you and many others consider these additions improvements, and I always admire users who vote to keep and actually make efforts to improve the articles in question, but I do not see these improvements as substanative. Adding more facts about a subject and improving an article can be two very different things. An encyclopedia is supposed to sift through the facts and summarize the important aspects of a topic, not just collect random bits of factual information. This article now has more information, but it still does not provide information that makes it a useful contribution to an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 17:26, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no problem with your perception that the article isn't worth keeping and the improvements are nothing much. What concerned me was solely your description of the votes to keep as "knee-jerk reactions" and the suggestion that it was the duty of responsible editors to delete the article. Actually that isn't even consistent with our <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a>. While I can accept that an article may appear to some to be beyond hope, your comment didn't seem to allow for the fact that other editors do not share your view of this particular article and, making an honest effort to improve the article, don't deserve to be treated with disgust or disdain. We may differ in our opinions, but we are all working towards the same end. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:38, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>After discounting the anonymous and extremely new user votes and the probable troll vote, all the remaining voters either abstained or said "delete". However, two of those gave confusing comments that the article should be "deleted and redirected" to Jerry Griffin. Reviewing the two articles, I find them to be related. The Dr. Jerry Griffin version appears to have been created by a cut-and-paste move by the anonymous author of Jerry Griffin (who has made no additional edits to either article since).</p>
<p>The only <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verified</a> fact in the article is the statement of authorship. The book does not have a separate Wikipedia article (and with a current Amazon sales ranking of 1,205,305 probably should not). Reviewing the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>, I can not convince myself that an author of a single book of this stature (and with no other claim to notability or other mitigating circumstances) meets the recommended threshold for inclusion.</p>
<p>I am going to call this decision as a "delete". Further, I am going to consider the Jerry Griffin version as "an associated sub-page" and delete it as well. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:28, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Really? If someone puts out a book through a novelty press and gives a copy to the Library of Congress, that makes then notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia? 128.122.129.4 22:54, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, but his was <i>not</i> a vanity press book. It was published by a division of Greenwood Press (a publisher with over 18,000 titles in print) and is still listed by major booksellers 14 years later (it was released in 1991). The vast majority of books never make it beyond the second printing. I think that makes him notable enough for a short article (which this one is not). <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 00:47, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. A small hint might be in order here. In May and June the rate of nomination of school articles for deletion tripled, with two editors accounting for two-thirds of all deletion listings--in effect, those editors by themselves were responsible for the massive increase. Such an aggressive campaign tends to put one question foremost in people's minds: do schools belong on Wikipedia? And this is the answer. Yes, schools belong on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:55, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course schools belong on wikipedia, but every school? Hardly as far as I am concerned. I believe you, at least, are reading the articles and not just following dogma, but I believe many keep votes are registered by users who are not taking into account any specifics. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 08:18, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. There may be one or two voters to whom that is true (I don't recognise every name here) but if you look at those voting keep at least <s>three</s> four of us have not only looked at this article but improved it. Most others voting have worked on other school articles in the recent past. I am not seeing evidence of robotic voting here, it looks like a heterogeneous bunch of people who do happen to sincerely care about these articles and work to improve them. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 08:26, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Most of Bruno's writings aren't commercially available (yet). Would this article be more acceptable if I created an archive of his public-domain works?</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a nice thought, but I don't think so - he hasn't achieved notoriety to the degree where people would be wondering about him and trying to learn more about him on wikipedia. <i>When</i> and <i>if</i> he achieves a level of academic notability to warrant his works being considered substantial, he belongs here. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.126.231.163 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.126.231.163_6976.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.126.231.163">contribs</a>) 22:33, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC).</small></li>
<li>Think of it this way: I can write as many papers as I want, and put them in the public domain. Until they are accepted, however, with some level of academic accolade (or perhaps notoriety), they are in no way different than the writings of any other student. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 22:30, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>So one needs to publish works commercially to be accepted and/or relevant? Need I remind you that this very wiki is noncommercial and open-source?

<li><b>Delete</b> -- doesn't appear to be notable. (A comment on the conversation above: It's not the role of Wikipedia to inform the public about what <i>should</i> be deemed relevant -- indeed, such an approach would be a clear violation of the NPOV policy -- but rather to report what is already considered to be relevant or noteworthy. Furthermore, if Bronosky <i>is</i> already notable and deserving of an article of his own, the article certainly doesn't tell us why. Neither does Google; searching for '"Bruno Bronosky" philosopher' yields a total of zero hits; replace 'philosopher' with 'philosophy', and you get a single hit, to an audio Bible... where someone named Bruno Bronosky is not an author but a random internet reviewer. Of course, Google isn't necessarily the best research tool for something like this, so maybe he <i>is</i> notable... but until he is shown to be, I'm going to have to vote for deletion here, and I'd imagine the same goes for most of us here.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 20:05, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. 22,600 results from Google when I searched for "beeramid" tonight. These structures are very common and well-known. Though it <i>may be</i> on the encyclopedic/Wiktionary edge, it appears to be notable/non-trivial, and non-neologic. Some external links were added the same day it was nominated. I admit, this was my first article; though it was the lack of an article for such a well-known phenomenom that actually moved me enough to stop using Wikipedia as a reference tool alone (as I had been for the last 3 years) and start making contibutions. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurtyWilly_0548.html" title="User:DurtyWilly">DurtyWilly</a> 05:10, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
