<li>I'm sick and tired of reverting this into a semi-sane state. First of all, the persistent Brown's-gas-fans should decide for themselves, whether it has spectacutar properties different from oxyhydrogen:
<ul>
<li>(a) Same properties: No need for separate article, short mentioning of rare synonym with strange connotations at <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxyhydrogen.html" title="Oxyhydrogen">Oxyhydrogen</a></li>
<li>(b) Miraculous properties (e.g. <i>The quantity of hydrogen and oxygen atoms produced is in accordance with traditional electrolytic theory, although the volume is not</i>, or <i>Transmutation of Radioactive Materials</i>, or <i>creates ten times more Brown's gas than normal electrolysis systems do</i>): Pack your Brown's gas generator, give the next major university's chemistry department a visit and receive your Nobel prize soon.</li>

<p>As per the "verifiability policy" it clearly says "Self-published material may be acceptable when produced by a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field", and Material from self-published sources, and other published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources in articles about the author(s) of the material, so long as: it is relevant to their notability; it is not contentious; it is not unduly self-serving; it does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject; there is no reasonable doubt as to who wrote it. ". I feel that I am within the guidelines of the "verifiability policy". Please talk with me if you feel otherwise, and I guarantee that I will work with you to maintain the utmost credibility, reliability, and integrity of Wikipedia's policies.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I see no evidence of a "well-known professional researcher" in these self-published sources. Moreover, you left out " These may be acceptable so long as their work has been previously published by reliable third-party publications." I see nothing to indicate that this is true here.</dd>
<dd>The points about using self-published sources in articles about the author(s) clearly does not apply here, since this article is not about any author; it's about a gas. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETengfred_5c80.html" title="User:Tengfred">Tengfred</a> 00:19, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article no longer lacks reliable resources. Note that I have added many items in the "references section". The Korean manufacturer in particular is a company filled with Phd's and reliable resources, and while their English is not optimal they are capable of getting their points across. Please refer to these "references" prior to considering this article for deletion. These companies substantiate all the properties of Brown's Gas that are now posted. I have also added in text citations to help better substantiate the claims in this article. One addition that must be made is a citation for the "perpetual motion" claim. Now that a reference section has been added, it is only right to show the reference for such an obsurd claim. Note that all the companies in the references section don't even adress the notion of perpetual motion because it is truly something that should not even be considered; the term obsurd is overwhelmingly appropriate.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I still se no reliable sources in the article. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a> says "Caution should be used when using company or organization websites as sources. Although the company or organization is a good source of information on itself, it has an obvious bias." Also, the section on physics articles in the same page, points out the importance of using peer-reviewed scientific publications. As far as I can tell, there are no such sources in the article. Right now, the article is a mess of controversial claims, with almost no inline citations and a pile of obviously biased sources. From <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a> again: "Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence". It is possible that a coherent article can be written per <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a>, and if so, that article might be useful.

<li><b>comment</b> There will never be exceptional evidence for using Brown's Gas in an over-unity fashion because it is impossible; <b>I have addresses this bogus claim with the "note"</b>. I would remove this blatentlt erronious claim due to its impossiblity, but it is crucial to document all prevailing stereotypes about a scientifically straight forward technology. As for the "semi-rational" claims, these are not totally outragoues. These claims are reasonable, and highly substantiated by the videos sections where users can observe the claims first hand; Brown's Gas can be visually seen behaving in a novel fashion as compared to Oxy-Hydrogen or a pure Hydrogen flame. Also, the reliable sources policy says "take caution", it dousn't say that the references cannot cannot be used because they are company websites. Also, the fact that multiple website, and multiple companies exists across the planet establishes a greater level of credibility as compared to if only one website or only one company was listed. <b>Please note that I have clearly distinguished and defined Brown's Gas production as compared to Oxy-Hydrogen production and pure Hydrogen production; the method is obviously novel.</b> <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Nseidm1</a> 08:19, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes the claims might be exceptional, which is why I have placed them in sections title "over-unity claims", and "semi-rational" claims. The section "properties" is a section that is based on measurable phenomena. Such a section its not biased, as they are intuitive and rational inclusions based on observable and measurable properties, hence why the section name is "properties". It's ok for a topic to be controversial, and have controversional claims, the reason this article is now informative and un-biased in because the claims that are controversial are marked as such. <b>The main reason this article should remain is because I have specifically clarified the exact difference in how to produce Brown's Gas as compared to Oxy-Hydrogen and pure Hydrogen.</b> The difference is clear and distinction is well defined. Brown's Gas is clearly a separate phenonema as compared to Oxy-Hydrogen and pure Hydrogen; the unique production method dictates so. I still support <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Nseidm1</a> 07:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> Note that the Oxy-Hydrogen article does not have any references other than another third party source. Even considering such a lack of references the article remains. The point is that an article does not have to have an overwhelming amount of references to still be considered a credible article. I would argue that the most important aspect of a credible article is how rational and how objective the text is. In the case of this article, there are many points of view considered, and the text specifically considers the dubiousness of the claims. This article is objective, rational, and references real companies that are researching, patenting, and marketing <b>common ducted electrolytic technologies.</b> <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Nseidm1</a> 10:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is now clearly in compliance with Wikipedias deletion policy and therefore should remain. As for the tone of the article, I agree that others should be participating and contributing to establish better compliance. The lack of contribution, especially on the part of all that want this article deleted, highligh the opinionated bias and unsubstantial reasoning used in attacking clearly established credibility. <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Noah Seidman</a> 05:24, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Additional Comments</b> Administrator please take note. The reference of "hoax" and "fraud" are mere terminologies and are not inherently substantive. Individuals that utilize these terms do not make any citations and they have no substantiation for their claim other than their own <b>opinion</b>. Opinions are not enough of a reason to discredit the novelty of a phenomena that is clearly distinct from Oxy-Hydrogen; the distinction has been defined specifically within the text of the article; Brown's Gas is clearly produced in a novel fashion as compared to Oxy-Hydrogen, and pure Hydrogen for that matter. The attacks on rational statements, that are obviously logical, are inconsistent with the substantiation required to discredit the phenomena of Brown's Gas. Please also note that the BEST Korea Company and Arizona Hydrogen Company, both cited in the references section, are multi million dollar companies that have overwhelmingly mainstream clients. Arizona Hydrogen Company sells products to NASA, Ratheon, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, GE and Motorola. BEST Korea Company is laying the foundation for fuel consumption on the Korean peninsula as the distribtuion of liquid fuels is impractical as compared to on-site generation. <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Noah Seidman</a> 14:41, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You mention that Arizona Hydrogen Company sells products to NASA, Raytheon, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, GE and Motarola. Could you provide a citation where any of these companies, including Arizona Hydrogen Company make any claim about the existence of Brown's gas? --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 21:59, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In this edit, Nseidm1, states that Arizona Hydrogen Company does not produce "Brown's gas". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pjacobi&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=89879711" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pjacobi&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=89879711" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Odd he should use them as a mainstream reference, since even he agrees they have nothing to do with Brown's gas. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 22:30, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In answer to the above, the Brown's gas folk say that generators made by Arizona HydroGen produce Brown's gas, even though Arizona HydroGen says nothing of the sort. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 22:35, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
