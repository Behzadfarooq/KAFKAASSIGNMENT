<p><b>Delete</b>. A minor character in the Austin Powers canon. While major characters like Austin, Evil, Nigel etc are notable enough for their own articles, characters like Alotta Fagina are just jokes and aren't that notable. I am also nominating the following related pages because for similar reasons in that they aren't notable enough for their own articles. They're minor characters who serve to tell a joke.</p>

<dd>No, but I can provide 'true' and 'verifiable' information about them. And, since Wikipedia aims to sum the world's knowledge, I don't see why my cats should be left it. And yes my cats do have funny names...Cocoa and Thumbelina, to be exact. However, I am being fecetious as you might guess.

<dd><b>Comment</b> All of those sources only have passing references to the Alotta character. The first two are just comparision lists, of which Alotta is one of many. The latter two are generic <i>Powers</i> reviews which just happen to mention Fagina. Psychonaut makes refence to a lack of "any independent sources on the character which give more than a passing reference" earlier, and it applies here.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 02:12, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't agree that these are all passing references. Several discuss the parody of Pussy Galore, which is to me the most notable part of this article. The others confirm that this is not original research by an editor who watched the movie.

<ul>
<li>The first two are just lists comparing similar names, of which Alotta Fagina is one of them. The third article has one sentence that reads "In dated and unapologetically sexist '60s-style, Austin Powers can't claim Pussy Galore, but does boast Alotta Fagina, a cleavage-heaving role assumed by Fabiana Udenio". Ebert's review states "And, of course, those who remember Bond's adventures with Pussy Galore will be amused by his female antagonist this time, the sinister Alotta Fagina (Fabina Udenio)." So for both of those articles she's only mentioned briefly in passing.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 21:36, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I also took a look at the references and have to say that they are about as passing as one can get. They amount to about two sentences that deal directly with this character.

<li><b>Merge</b> (although most of the truly important information is already there) with the film in which she and the others appear. That the characters verifiably appeared is a fact, but not one that requires an article. Comparing anyone's notability with that of a randomly-selected individual is also not a compelling argument. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:57, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It appears well-written and informative. If merged with other "minor characters" the result will be too long and I see no reason to trim down what has already been written just to keep some deletionist happy. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteresdom_770d.html" title="User:Interesdom">Interesdom</a> 13:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, it won't. The more fancruftier sections like trivia and quotes will probably go but the main article itself is no more than a paragraph long and probably won't be trimmed.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 21:25, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> - as per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, this is a minor character and should be merged into the main article. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 17:14, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to main article - minor characters with minimal screen time, they are important to the film, but I can't see the benefit of an individual article for each one. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 20:42, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> or merge; the importance of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Powers_25dc.html" title="Austin Powers">Austin Powers</a> series confers notability here, and there are some (marginal) references. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 21:42, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> character names are at least appropriate for a redirect, and I have no objection to the content per se.

<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b> A part from people saying they like it it doesn't pass WP:FICT. She is a very minor character and the majority of the article is trivia and quotes. All of which can and should be removed in the merge.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 01:40, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not all characters from a major movie are notable. She had something like 10 minutes of screen time and she only appeared in the first Austin Powers film. Given that it should be easy to fit any relevant information into the article on the movie itself.
