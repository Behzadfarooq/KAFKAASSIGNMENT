<p>Non-notable fancruft. The references section being bigger than the article rings alarm bells. Contested prod. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 08:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. The fact that it has references is grounds for deletion now? We have an entire <a href="../../../d/u/n/Category%7EDungeons_%26_Dragons_standard_creatures_e8b5.html" title="Category:Dungeons &amp; Dragons standard creatures">category for Dungeons and Dragons creatures</a>, and all of these things are verifiable by sources whose authority within the D&amp;D context is impeccable. Personally, I'd prefer that this be merged to the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyr.html" title="Satyr">satyr</a> article, since the D&amp;D satyr is obviously derivative of older mythology; but then we'd see complaints when gaming material showed up in those articles and they began to be listed in D&amp;D related categories, so separate articles for D&amp;D related critters may be for the best. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A stub, absolutely, and in needs of expansion, but I can't see a need to delete. I'd be happy with it merging to <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyr.html" title="Satyr">satyr</a> but given the complaints mentioned above, I guess it needs its own article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete pending independent references</b> The references are not <i>indepedent</i> of the fictional source itself, and the article provides no real-world context or analysis. This would seem to fail to meet guidelines for minor characters in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a> (and in essence minor monsters in D&amp;D are the same as minor characters in fiction). I should also point out that this same complaint probably applies to a number of monsters under <a href="../../../d/u/n/Category%7EDungeons_%26_Dragons_standard_creatures_e8b5.html" title="Category:Dungeons &amp; Dragons standard creatures">Category:Dungeons &amp; Dragons standard creatures</a>, most of which only have references from the fiction itself with no outside references to establish real world notability for purposes of WP:FICT. Thus while I'm an avid D&amp;D player, I'm not conviced this article follows the guidelines and should probably be merged into a "list of D&amp;D standard monsters". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, that might have problems as there are lots of creatures in D&amp;D. Listing them all would lead to a rather long list, and while there are some, like Beholders and Owlbears that I think are unusual enough for coverage, I suspect this one wouldn't have an article if not for its mythological derivations. Though it does make me wonder if maybe List of D&amp;D creatures derived from mythology might be a worthwhile list. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True, it would be a long list article, or possible a couple of list articles, of minor characters/monsters, but that's still preferable to a large number of actual <i>articles</i> about minor character monsters with no references outside of the game itself. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:30, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, as far as it goes, there are relatively few monsters of D&amp;D I'd suggest having articles, as most are not iconic enough to really matter, and possibly some directory concerns with a listing of D&amp;D monsters. That might be something outside the scope of a general purpose encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The fact that there are similar articles probably just means that those articles probably should also be discussed in afd also. I do agree that the articles should be handled relatively consistently. So if this article is deleted or merged to a list, then it makes sense to do the same for the other articles. If this article is kept, then it makes sense to keep the others. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:02, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> — I'm a D&amp;D fan of old, but putting up pages on the individual monster manual creatures seems a tad trivial. There are a lot of these D&amp;D creature pages (per <a href="../../../d/u/n/Category%7EDungeons_%26_Dragons_standard_creatures_e8b5.html" title="Category:Dungeons &amp; Dragons standard creatures">Category:Dungeons &amp; Dragons standard creatures</a>), so they are about equally notable (or not) and should be treated with a consistent policy. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 21:16, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Firstly, I really don't think that a trivial fan poll run by Wizards of the Coast, the creators of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> on the official <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> website really counts as an indepedent source, especially as the satyr came 6th. If it had come first, it may have some bearing, but not there. Secondly, nobody can change their vote, as AfD isn't a vote.

Furthermore, a satyr in D&amp;D is nothing more than the legendary creature represented in terms of the D&amp;D game system.

<dd>Actually <i>external</i> notability has not been established within the article. The only references are from D&amp;D rulebooks themselves. To establish notability outside the game, though, you would need published references external to the rules that talk about satyrs in D&amp;D. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:30, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To give an example of what I mean, compare this article to the <a href="../../../b/e/h/Beholder.html" title="Beholder">Beholder</a> article that Shimeru mentioned above. D&amp;D Beholders are mentioned in published sources outside of the D&amp;D game rules, and even have appeared in some popular media or been the inspiration for some non-D&amp;D related creatures. By contrast, it's not clear from the Satyr (D&amp;D) article that the D&amp;D version of satyrs has any notable mention outside of the game rules. So the level of notability for the Beholder extends beyond just the game rules compared to this article about the Satyrs. So <a href="../../../b/e/h/Beholder.html" title="Beholder">Beholder</a> probably does meet <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFiction_b036.html" title="WP:Fiction">WP:Fiction</a> guidelines, but this article about D&amp;D satyrds probably doesn't. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:37, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"The Ecology of the Satyr" from Dragon #155 is a non-rules article that discusses the satyr, and is also not in a rule-book.204.153.84.10
<dl>
<dd>That's an interesting question. Is <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_%28magazine%29.html" title="Dragon (magazine)">Dragon magazine</a> actually a publication that is independent of D&amp;D? It is an official source magazine for D&amp;D, and devoted mainly to D&amp;D rules, adventures and source material. Should a magazine devoted almost entirely to D&amp;D be treated as a source for purposes of showing <i>real world</i> notability outside the game? <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:08, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>At the time, Dragon was still published by TSR, if I'm not mistaken. It's one of the pre-eminent publications on D&amp;D, and should certainly be a reliable source, but I don't think it's an independent one in this case. I could be wrong, though, as I don't have the issue in question to check. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. Is it actually a rule that independent sources are required to "prove" notability? If so, how many are required? One? Two? Five? I have seen suggestions that editors should try to provide them, but not that it's a requirement for inclusion. 204.153.84.10 22:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not <i>necessarily</i>, but it's actually a somewhat trickier question than it looks. All that's needed to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. If none of the sources are independent, they are all effectively primary sources. This is acceptable if no extraordinary claims are being made (those would require stronger sourcing). However, it's easy for articles based entirely on non-independent sources to fall into <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">bias</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which is one reason secondary sources -- independent sources -- are stressed. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">Notability</a> suggests that the article topic should be the primary subject of "multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." This is, however, a guideline, while the earlier ones are policy; therefore, there's more room for flexibility. As my general rule, if notability is being questioned, I'd want at least one truly independent source among those listed -- if there's one, it's easy to imagine there might be more. Two or more would be even better, of course. Is there anything anywhere outside of D&amp;D/TSR/Wizards of the Coast publications that talks about satyrs as they're presented in D&amp;D (not merely as the mythical creature)? If so, that would be an excellent source. As it is... it's not unknown for an article to be founded entirely on non-independent sources, but it's not exactly ideal, either. <i>Dragon</i> may be judged enough, but the article would be stronger if a wholly independent source (or several) supported it. I hope that answers your question. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 10:18, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Of course, all of this <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholasticism.html" title="Scholasticism">scholastic</a> wrangling over various policies and guidelines is interesting, in a way. My understanding is that primary sources are perfectly valid sources provided that the article simply describes what's in the primary source. Secondary sources are needed only for analysis or interpretation, and I see little of that in the article at issue. As to notability, the <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">Pokémon test</a> is a perfectly valid analogy here: D&amp;D critters are notable for the same reasons that the several species of Pokémons are. As to whether there are secondary, independent sources that discuss D&amp;D satyrs as opposed to other satyrs - since the concept of satyrs predates D&amp;D, this would be a matter of interpretation that's hard to judge. (Need a secondary source for that.&#160;:) (There are instances where the D&amp;D mythology added non-traditional elements that were borrowed from nameable sources, and that found their way into later works: the D&amp;D <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll.html" title="Troll">troll</a> is an example.) - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:18, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but the reason we need the sources specifically about the D&amp;D version of the creature is that the article is specifically about the D&amp;D version of the creature. Nobody's suggesting that <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyr.html" title="Satyr">satyr</a> should be deleted. The base question here is: Do we have enough material about satyrs <i>as they specifically pertain to D&amp;D</i> to sustain a separate article? My feeling is, we don't, and this would therefore be better left to a subsection of satyr or <a href="../../../f/e/y/Fey_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29_1d07.html" title="Fey (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">Fey (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</a> or Satyrs in popular culture or something similar. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 09:45, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>An alternative view would be that the majority D&amp;D monsters are just as non-notable as the majority of Pokémon, the Pokémon test is a mistake and as such this article should be deleted. That's the view I subscribe to&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 17:37, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To reply to the comment about the WP:POKEMAN essay, note the essay is merely a discussion of why some Pokemon monster articles are kept. However, one could argue that Pokeman monsters also frequently have cross-media references outside of the game itself, since they appear on television or films for example. Also note that the essay is not a clear defense that <i>all</i> the pokeman monster articles should be kept. It correctly states that there are currently articles for all the pokeman monsters, but note that many of these articles have not been reviewed in afd. It's certainly possible that a broader review of Pokemon monster articles could result in some of them being deleted. for lack of suitable references or meeting <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I added some independant references. It isn't really that hard to find them with a bit of googling. They may not be the best refs in the world, but refs do exist. Let this page live, and more refs can be found. Delete this page, and it's back to sqaure one if the page is recreated. This is our best chance to have a well cited D&amp;D satyr page, let's take it. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 18:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> - No reason to delete it just because of what you think of as missing references. If that is indeed your problem, just ask for them to be added, don't start a VFD. Also, I really think the word fancruft is used too often as an argument for deletion of these kind of articles, so much that it has nearly lost its meaning. Keep and improve, or merge with the Fey article. --<a href="../../../i/f/r/User%7EIfrit_9704.html" title="User:Ifrit">Ifrit</a> 03:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: the burden is on editors wishing to add or keep material to show such references exist. Nobody has yet shown there is a single independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> that makes a non-trivial mention of the <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> satyr. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 08:27, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
