<p>I feel that this article would be best suited as either an entry about the documentary (in which case it should be treated the way that sort of entry typically is) or it should be moved into the Conspiracy Theories section ( in which case an entry should be made about what the theory is and how the documentary explains the theory).</p>

<p>Whats next? deleting anything to do with the jewish holocaust? denying vietnam happened? covering up the the protests in tiananmen square? when did wikipedia become a censorship agent against the freedom of speech and a moral point of view? By the people for the people seems to becoming a passe phrase nowadays and really meaning keep the people ignorant and feed them enough garbage until they believe what they are told.</p>
<p>9/11 eyewitness gives an alternate point of view that seems to have scared the living daylight out of a lot of officials! why? have they come a little too near to the truth?</p>

<p>All that america stands for is freedom and to cut out part of out history even if its not one of out greatest moments is wrong there is no way to get rid of all the contriversial issuses in this world.

<p>To the newbies: Votes go on the main page, not the talk page. Crusading is frowned upon and generally makes you look like an idiot. The proper phrasing is <b>Keep</b> -- you can tell an AfD newbie because they invariably use "Do not delete" instead, and newbies do not get the same weight as established editors. Sign your posts with four tildes to get a signature. Any questions? <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 19:18, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> I don't know who is deleting. I am trying to get the page to be less pov but the edits dont stay. Thank you for that information. Your page is great, but it will take some time for us to figure all of that out. Why is it delete instead of rewrite? Thank you. 911 Eyewitness 20:42, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's too late now(and it doesn't look like it would've mattered), but in case this ever goes back up, I'm gonna post here what I was in the process of writing right as the vote ended:</p>

<p><i>Because it is available for free on google, information about the film is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge thus allowing the film itself to count as verification under Wikipedia policy.

<p>The point of wikipedia, from my perspective, is a body of knowledge that is amendable by anyone to get the best account of whatever the subject is. This however, is a highly problematic subject. If you want to twist this entry as the truth, than this is not the forum for you to preach in. If you want to write a well laid out article about the points on either side of this issue (and without bias), than by all means keep the entry. However, just like after 9/11 after people defamed the entries for Islam and anything else related to the middle east, be forewarned that there are people that will revise and amend the entry. Whatever stance you have on this issue, you HAVE to categorize this as "Conspiracy theory" because this is speculative, and this subject should be written just like the other conspiracy theories in this database...without bias and without a spin.</p>

<p>Many people try to explain a catastrophe by putting it in terms that they can understand. They look at the evidence and because the presented facts don't fit in with their conceived notions of what can or should happen they, through an internal process, filter and edit information to fit their ideals. Basically, this is what is happening to this guy. He feels that the buildings could not have collapsed the way they did. Ergo, the government *must* have been involved to drum up support for a 'war on terror'. There are a couple of problems with this - aside from the fact that it was the basis for a movie already (the long kiss goodnight). 1) If the government had a hand in this they wouldn't have made it a 'controlled' demolition. If they wanted to rile the public up they need to maximize the damage - not minimize the impact by dropping the building into the basement. Maximum impact for a government conspiracy would have the building fall over and take out as many buildings and people as possible. 2) An explosive demolition of the building could not have been hidden. Have any of you people seen Discover Channel documentaries about controlled explosive demolitions? There are wires all over the place. You couldn't use wireless either - too much interference to ensure effective timing of the charges. Additionally, columns have *huge* amounts of explosives, wrapping, and other material around them in order to make the shaped charges actually effective. How woudl this have been hidden? Also a significant amount of prep work is also involved. It is likely that someone would have noticed this. 3) So many people would have been involved with this that it would have been impossible to keep it a secret this long. Its tough enough to keep 3 people from talking how are you going to keep every one of the dozens, if not hundreds, of people that would have to be involved from talking? 4) The videos *clearly* show the collapse of the buildings starting at or very near the point of impact. So now you have to argue that the pilots were actually so well trained that they could have flown the plane directly into a predetermined spot on the building - even though all of the evidence we have argues against them having any real skill. Additionally, you need to argue that somehow the explosive charges they used would have been able to survive the impact and the fire so that they could go off at the right time. 5) The statement that the fire would not have been hot enough to melt steel is correct. However, no one has said that the steel had to melt - it only had to get hot enough to allow a weakened structure to deform. Once the deformation started retaining bolts, joints, and other critical structures would have started to fail. No 'melting' is actually necessary to produce a catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>Basically, in order to call this entry 'factual' you have to make wild assumptions, ignore certain physical laws, and ignore critical evidence. Since the point of an encyclopedia is to present *fact* and not fantasy this entry should be deleted.</p>

<dd>The article was about a movie. I too believe that 9/11 conspiracy theories are a bunch of hooey, but to keep POV out of this, it should have nothing to do with what that movie was about. Star Wars is not factual and it has a Wikipedia entry. That said, this film was deemed non-notable(which is a valid reason for deltion) and the article has already been deleted. No need to debate what happened at 9/11 since this is the talk page for a film(and one that has already been removed from Wikipedia at that).<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 02:20, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
