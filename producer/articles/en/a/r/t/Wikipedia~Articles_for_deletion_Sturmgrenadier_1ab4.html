<li><b>Comment</b> so why has nobody ever heard of it? did this club ever win anything significant, like <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjas_in_Pyjamas_b482.html" title="Ninjas in Pyjamas">Ninjas in Pyjamas</a>? if not, its non-notable, as there are thousands of other gaming clubs that have won more than this one. and 800 people is large? messageboards need 10000 members to be considered at least notable.
<ul>
<li>I've heard of them, not only that I've played with/against them. <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjas_in_Pyjamas_b482.html" title="Ninjas in Pyjamas">Ninjas in Pyjamas</a> I've never heard of though. So if your criterion applies fairly, then we should vote to delete that article as well. Obviously SOMEONE has heard of them, and for those who have not, well that's why we have articles in the first place, is'nt it&#160;;&gt;. And why, when in doubt I believe it is usually better to err on the side of KEEP. BTW, you should learn to SIGN your comments, that way they will carry a bit more weight, even if your arguements may carry none:&gt;--<a href="../../../r/2E/d/User%7ER.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29_1bea.html" title="User:R.D.H.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just because you haven't heard of it, doesn't mean no one has. (Don't forget the USA Today article.) Sturmgrenadier participates generally in games that are <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> or otherwise persistent worlds. There are no tournaments to win. It is also not a <i>message board</i>, as it fields organized units in the games in which it plays. The public portion of the forums is not a significant part of the unit and it makes no claims to being a "gaming community", a gaming news site or a professional "clan". --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 17:53, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>so it hasnt won anything. its not professional. its a bunch of schoolboys playing videogames. despite the article calling it a "an online gaming syndicate" and "gaming clan", its not, in fact, a community or clan. all good reasons why its not notable.
<ul>
<li>I'm no great fan of gaming clans of any stripe having articles, but that's a misrepresenation. (I have my own clan, thank-you-very-much, and am about 20 years removed from being a 'schoolboy'.) <a href="../../../a/e/v/User%7EAeverett_b346.html" title="User:Aeverett">You can call me Al</a> 19:05, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>i understand its sad when your precious club is deemed irrelevant by the outside world but please note its nothing personal &amp; there is no objection to hosting your club's website on the user space instead.
<ul>
<li>You are correct, I did contact them. Destinova is the only one who is part of Sturmgrenadier. He, Chronosphere and I are from Sturmgrenadier. The rest are folks who have written gaming articles, voted on VfDs or otherwise shown an interest in this kind of article. I don't think any of them (except Mel, who was the admin handling first VfD) have ever edited this article and I am certain some of them had never read it before this. While I did ask all of them to comment, I did admonish them to think about what was best for Wikipedia. I assume shining a light on this article will either improve it, or send it the way of the dodo (sp?). You are <i>more than welcome</i> to contact others and shine a bigger light on this article.

<li>I think its perfectly acceptable to contact others who've one has made acquaintance with while working in this Wiki to take a look at a VfD and render their own opinion.

I am explicitly not going to vote on this AfD, not just because of the possibility of appearance of collusion, but also because I simply don't have time today to give the article-and-deletion-debate the attention they deserve. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 18:38, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Nor am I a SG member. I have my own gaming, mafia family-House Of Painful Enlightenment, thank you. But I have played Day Of Defeat with SG on their servers many moons ago. I found them to be a very together crew who ran a good, fun shop. I'm not easily impressed by online gaming groups in general, but they made a good impression on me. Habap merely asked me to come take a look and give my opinion. So I did. He did not ask me, nor any of us, to vote to keep.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Firstly, I will note that I don't think it's a good idea to do AfD campaigning from either side of the argument; it really does affect your ability to think in an unbiased fashion.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Someone's been overdosing on the Christmas crackers; we're into Holiday Folly season. To be serious, though, for a minute: there are several reasons why this article does not belong in Wikipedia. Some are on stylistic grounds. Some are on promotional grounds. Some are on significance grounds. I'll try to go through all of them without breaking into my usual <i>sine</i>. First of all, the claim that they had this big article in USA to-day seemed dubious to me, so I checked it out. A case of googlum ad nauseum, the only references of its having been mentioned are in the same claim, repeated so many times with slight variants: 'do you want to be a part of a group that was recognised in USA To-day?'</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>By reading above, I found that the 'article' was a mere stub, if you will. It's given as an example. That does not reflect on the site's quality. Nor on the site's cultural impact. It just means that they used Sturmgrenadier as an example of a gaming syndicate. Like they might use Mr. Boer as an example of a farmer, or The Blue Café on Elwright Street as an example of a business. It does not classify Sturmgrenadier as remarkable. A proper article might.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, this Wikipedia article is highly one-sided and self-promotional. There is no counter-view. It is written with bright rose-coloured glasses, as you would expect. It is not encyclopædic to rhapsody about people coming to-gether on the internet. Promoting games syndicates should not be encylopædia activity. Wikipedia should be here to inform about the general consciousness, and about contributions to thought; a bunch of gamers on a site is not exactly general consciousness, nor is it a contribution to thought. Information on 'clans' on Wikipedia has been wiped out before. Although Wikipedia does not operate on a binding precedent basis, there is clear foreagreement that Wikipedia is not a promotions hall for sites such as these. The only reason that this has survived, compared to the other articles, is the slyer way in which this was written, and the fact that a whole support group, enlisted by one of the key writers of this article, props it up. I have to say that such campaigns debase the whole system of Wikipedia as a consensual zone. Anyhow, to return: there is not much original invention at all. It's all about playing games that they never even made in the first place. It provides no new knowledge; riding on the coat-tails of someone else's work is no original contribution to the world as we know it. I have nothing against people meeting up, and talking about games. That's cool by me. But you're having a vitsln if you think it merits a page. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">iinag</a> 23:51, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: With all due respect, out of the few edits to Wikipedia that you have made, there's only one-- an anti-monarchist merge request about the Queen-- that has <i>not</i> been about Sturmgrenadier. To say that your vote is that objective is pushing it, since you would hardly vote against something that you helped to create. Also, although I'd say that this cliquery to get past the system and save your self-promotion is rather petty, I can't see why a bunch of Wikipedians from a wide strand of backgrounds coming here to oppose nn self-promotion is 'fascetious [sic]'.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedians, with a 'wide strand of backgrounds' were also involved in the previous VfD which ended in a non-consensus. The original VfD was started by a disgruntled former member with a vendetta. Yes, very petty. I agree with another wikipedian above that nobody cares about Gaming Clan Drama (tm), so that should be looked past. The fact remains that these are ad hominem attacks, driven by facetious motives and jealousy.

<li><b>Delete</b> First, let me respond to Destinova1 and others: the prior VFD (the mere fact that it was a VFD and not AFD lets you know it was at least a few months ago) was closed as a "no consensus", which means it didn't have a conclusion, let alone a forever binding one. And even if the consensus had been to keep, that would not be an eternal "get out of jail free" card against future deletion nominations any more than a deletion closure would forbid people from ever recreating the article (in a form that was not substantially identical). As such, the prior VFD's outcome doesn't mean diddly squat - or at least, you shouldn't let it. Anyway, as for the article/topic itself, props to iinag for the eloquence. Also, let me point out that in addition to a meaningless reference-in-passing in a USA Today article, it has currently "no ranking" at Alexa for sghq.com, and in the prior VFD, both Alexa rankings cited were lower than the ranking at which Alexa itself tells you the rankings are based on so few hits that actually trying to compare rankings is just guesswork. Finally, 800 may be large for an online gaming "clan", but 800 is hardly a large number as far as the total online gaming population... especially if it's spread among "several countries all over the globe". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 00:18, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The <i>USA Today</i> entry didn't support the case for notability, unfortunately. I'm not thrilled with the possibility of a bad faith AfD, but in the absence of evidence I have to assume good faith. Leaving that and the campaigning aside, I see a run of the mill gaming site/group that doesn't have anything to distinguish itself from other such groups. It's not a reflection on the site or the people in it, but I think a site has to at or near the top of its genre to merit a Wikipedia article. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 00:19, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The fact that I need even to vote is utterly disappointing. Whether it's a club you belong to or not, this sort of vanity garbage doesn't belong on Wikipedia.

<li>weak <b>Delete</b> The article in my view needs more information to show readers why this particular gaming clan is notable. The article says "These events were reported in an article in <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">June 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>." It would really help if the External Links section linked to that actual article, or if that sentence had a link TO the USA Today article, just linking to USA Today's article here doesn't establish notability. (assuming the article doesn't just mention the clan without saying much else... heck, I've been on local TV morning news shows several times and that doesn't make me, or the club I was promoting, especially notable, I don't think) Further the tempers seem to be running a bit high here on both sides... calling people schoolboys won't win votes, nor will lashing out at others presenting reasoning against (or for) retention...

<li>My summary <b>Comment</b>: On the one hand, I'm disappointed that the article is considered unworthy. On the other hand, it's good to see that normal users who know nothing about it (the original VfD was due to "Gaming Club Drama" <sup>TM</sup> as noted early on in this process) sat down, read the article, checked Google, looked for information and considered whether it was worthy. That (removing my sometimes emotional nonsense) gives me faith in Wikipedia. I think the balance is that notability is not established. If at some time down the road, verifiable notability can be established, someone will probably write a new article.

<li><b>Delete</b> as per idonthaveaname, though I don't like how I was made aware of this. There's a lot of passionate discussion here that should be taking place in the talk space for this article and not cluttering up the project page with all of this juvenile infighting. Zzzzz was in error by campaigning for votes on this article, but the end result is that many people took a hard look at this entry and found that it wasn't as notable as some thought.

<li><b>Keep It</b> I completely understand what the game is all about, and it seems to be well-written. Just leave it and move on. Perhaps some of you should join an online game rather than spending your free time trying to have articles deleted from Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Hehe, where's Mel Ettis now? Delete, I've strongly campaigned for the deletion of this article for months now, but I backed off because Ettis was defending this article with a strong bias. Nice to see it got revived. All I can say is just because it's in USA Today does not mean it's notable. Also, due to the fact you have to pay to be in this group, this can be considered a Commercial Advertisement. --Tykell 21:07, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
