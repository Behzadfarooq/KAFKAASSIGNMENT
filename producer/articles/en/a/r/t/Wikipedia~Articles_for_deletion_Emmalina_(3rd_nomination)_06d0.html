<dd>Not really analogous. In the real world, politics are central to the workings of the nation. Politicians played key roles in something very important, so they are notable and worthy of encyclopaedic reference; in contrast youtube is... well... a website, and not exactly central to the world. Being involved with youtube is hardly being a government official. GassyGuy 06:29, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><s>My point still remains - just because you stop doing something that you achieved notable coverage for doesn't mean that you automatically become non-notable. In any case, there is enough precedent on WP to make this sort of argument unfounded.

<dd>Perhaps, but, the point is, just getting press coverage isn't the same as establishing notability in the first place. I, too, have gotten press coverage, but good luck finding my article, which also doesn't belong here. The point being made is that, if having some press coverage is all that can be said to support keeping the article, it is unlikely to be worthy of inclusion in an encyclopaedia. I'll also note that the presence of even less worthy articles does not justify the keeping of this one. GassyGuy 06:37, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, WP is not just about the present, but it is also <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminate collection. She got a little press for being momentaraly popular on a website. Big deal. By your logic, anybody who receives any press is automatically notable. Right down to every minor criminal who is locally newsworthy.

<dd><s>Perhaps, but it does give notability to the prominence of internet memes on YouTube. Perhaps some (but not all) of this information would be better served on a "Notable YouTube memes" page which is there to establish YouTube memes that have made significant coverage in particular countries. That would make this page defunct but the new article would serve YouTube's notability and not Emmalina's.

<li><s><b>Strong keep</b> if not <b>Speedy keep</b> - Wikipedia is not just about what is fashionable. Emmalina received significant coverage in Australia, probably almost as much as lonelygirl15 in the US. Whilst that doesn't make her extremely notable in itself, it certainly does point that way. I ask the person that started this - what makes this not notable now compared to other AfDs? You must remember that Wikipedia is not just about what is present, even if it is not a static encyclopaedia. Other YouTube users are arguably less notable than Emmalina was, and yet we still keep their articles. This is a pointless vote by an unsigned troll and the request by the subject does not equal deletion. It should be kept. I would, however, support a merge to a Notable YouTube users page if that were suggested.

<li><b>Delete</b> Finally, someone nominated this crap again. I don't know whether the subject of an article is allowed to vote for it's removal, but I don't particularly care. I don't want it here.

<dd>Some have received coverage via incident reports in papers, but does coverage in a newspaper automatically make a person notable? GassyGuy 02:28, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What else exactly would you use a measuring stick? Notable people--even if notable for a time--get in the press. Notable once, they merit inclusion. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 03:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Basically, I'm saying that, while not having any press coverage at all may be grounds for deletion, having some isn't automatic grounds for inclusion. Do you really think everyone who has an article in the special interest sections of newspapers should be included here? This is a basic summary of what happened: She had some videos on Youtube that people watched. She got hacked. It got a bit of coverage in minor newspaper sections. The end. It's not really the sort of thing that belongs in an encyclopaedia. Press coverage might make it a borderline case, but really, there's little to push her over into celebrity status. Think of it this way - every paedophile who gets caught and convicted by <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perverted-Justice.com_ab76.html" title="Perverted-Justice.com">Perverted-Justice.com</a> will have people on the web reading their story and also get newspaper coverage of the conviction. Does that establish encyclopaedic notability? (Note: I apologize to Emmalina for using the example of criminals in comparison to her, if she is reading this. I do not mean to imply that she has done anything at all to be held in a negative light. It was just the only other case I could think of that involved extensive website coverage and minor newspaper coverage.) Anyway, I think I'm rambling, so I'll quit trying to explain myself and let the AfD carry on its normal course. GassyGuy 07:53, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article is focussed on events that happened on the Internet. You know, the World Wide Web. It's not surprising or special in the slightest that it was covered (by what, ONE media company?) in a country other than my own. <a href="../../../e/m/m/User%7EEmmalinaL_ee5d.html" title="User:EmmalinaL">EmmalinaL</a> 05:42, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, her 15 minutes are up. I concur with GassyGuy, having a brief period of press coverage doesn't automatically equate to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:51, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> This happens all the time on YouTube. Videos enter top lists and get a lot of views over some time especially if it's covered by media. The problem is she just got hacked and that was more the reported news than her as an influental Internet personality. How about just covering the event as e.g a blurb for notable YouTube events in the YouTube article? I can not even agree with the article's main premise about her becoming a "virtual star". -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthgrove_5a5c.html" title="User:Northgrove">Northgrove</a> 22:20, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Update</b> - Good idea. I've put a shortened version of the article under Notable YouTube memes (a subpage of the main <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> page), which derives its notability from YouTube (as it is YouTube that makes the publicity out of people) rather than they being notable in themselves (let's face it, this article wouldn't be here without YouTube). Some of the articles were too long so they can have their own page, but this one is not worthy of its own page - but a small mention under that article is more appropriate.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's this kind of mentality "I don't know who this person is, so his or her article must go" that makes me wince. Just because you don't know about it doesn't make it a good reason to delete. Hbdragon88 22:26, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
