<p>Unsalvagably POV article. The term "yellowcake forgery" gets only 265 Ghits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22yellowcake+forgery%22&amp;num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=PdW&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=300&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22yellowcake+forgery%22&amp;num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=PdW&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=300&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, practically all of which are from Wikipedia itself, Wikipedia mirrors or left-wing blogs. The title itself is an NPOV violation, as are the opening paragraphs, both of which treat the "forgery" as settled fact, even though the UK still insists to this day the documents were accurate. In any case, the article is largely a laundry list of data points that don't provide any direct evidence to back up its accusations, and are in some cases self-contradictory. I believe Wikipedia should have an article about the yellowcake incident, but this article is so hopelessly one-sided that I think it's best that it get an official <b>delete</b> consensus so that a new one can be built from scratch; any attempt at major editing to this one will just lead to POV-based rv wars. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 18:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is absurd. This is not what AFD is for. First, try editing the article in the normal process. You say you'll get hopeless POV battles, but you haven't tried. Are you saying here that others are POV, or yourself? If other's that's pretty much the ultimate violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> considering you haven't discussed it at all over there. If it is a POV-battle, then you take it to RFC or to mediation. This is simply not a valid delete reason, and the nomination is an end-run around standard Wikipedia procedure. You have <b>not</b> placed a POV tag on the article. You have <b>not</b> made a single edit on the talk page. You have <b>not</b> specified a single POV complaint other than the title, which is now changed (it was verfiably a forgery anyway, so that wasn't even a good reason). Also, if we're AFD'ing things for NPOV, how long do you expect your own personal re-write to last before it gets AFD'd? What exactly are your credentials that you think AFD should "endorse" <b>you</b> personally for a re-write, as seems to be your rationale? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 04:02, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, I don't think the UK stands behind these documents.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Before posting this, I attempted to find an actual statement from the Blair government saying anything along the lines of "Nope, we were had," but I couldn't find one. If anyone can find such a statement (and I mean a real statement from the current UK government, not an allegation from some mid-level hack), I'll be happy to scratch that line from my nom. The article's still hopelessly POV regardless, sadly. I spent a half hour trying to figure out a way to fix it, and couldn't come up with one that I didn't think wouldn't end in a nasty edit war. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 18:47, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

It would be better to edit this into a better article than to delete it and create a new article from scratch. I can't see why a new article on the same subject, even with a new title and a new creator, would be immune to the edit wars predicted for this one. "Yellowcake incident" is probably a better title than "Alleged attempts by Iraq to buy uranium from Niger" which pretty much represents how it was described in the press.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 00:00, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oops. I guess it is not controversial so far as Bush and most opponents of his policies are concerned. Who does that leave still denying it is a forgery? Any evidence the British still claim the documents are genuine, despite the reported anachronisms? The <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butler_Review_bb12.html" title="Butler Review">Butler Review</a> by the British on prewar intelligence says "the forged documents were not available to the British Government at the time its assessment was made.” So it seems hard to find any government still claiming the documents were authentic. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 04:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> One point is that forgery is a crime, and without either a conviction or a confession from the individual alleged to have committed the forgery it's best just in the legal sense to avoid the word "forgery". Some American government droid saying the paper is a forgery is not proof that it is. A sworn confession from the specific individual who put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) might be. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic">Charlene.fic</a> 12:39, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This document has been described as a forgery by the White House Press Secretary as well as the British commission cited above.

<li><b>Keep</b> (but clean-up, or even rewrite as per Aaron). As the article says, certain documents "proving" that Saddam Hussein's regime tried to purchase yellowcake from Niger turned out to be forged. Hence the current name is appropriate.<br />
OTOH, the article should make it clearer that there is other evidence for that attempted purchase which has not been discredited. (For one presentation of some of that evidence, see <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2148995" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2148995" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2150433/" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2150433/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. See also <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_C._Wilson_74b3.html" title="Joseph C. Wilson">Joseph C. Wilson</a>'s report to the CIA.) Hence the current content needs lots of work from some brave editors.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not too sure what to do, but I think if this is closed as keep, it should also definitely get the {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-afd_a8e3.html" title="Template:Cleanup-afd">cleanup-afd</a>}} template placed at the top by the AFD closer. I'm torn between opining delete and cleanup-afd. The article looks like a <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> violation as a synthesis to make a point, rather than being the balanced, encyclopedic portrayal of the subject that it should be, which makes me almost ready to opine that deletion is the right answer. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 20:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Would you mind listing a <i>specific</i> NPOV violation on the talk page over there. It's one thing to assert that they can't be neutral. But you haven't even taken the effort to point one out. These supposed hopeless POV problems don't leap off the page at me, so specifiying a few for discussion before condemning the article is not too much to ask I think. As to OR, I see many citations to mainstream news sources, so identifying a few parts which are OR would also be helpful. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 05:05, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep:</b> I hate deleting an article for NPOV violations. The better course is nearly always to edit it into shape. Although GRBerry sounds convincing. I'm willing to help in recrafting it. There are some complications here:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The Yellowcake forgery was a forgery, and that's not POV, that's just fact.</li>
<li>Some statements were made by the Bush administration saying that Bush's comments on yellowcake from Africa shouldn't have been put in the State of the Union speech (those White House statements need to be exactly sourced, I don't think they are in the article, but I do think they came from the White House spokesman). Despite the fact that the Bush administration said it made a mistake, there's plenty of evidence on the record indicating no such mistake was made and Bush's comment in the State of the Union message was accurate. This is a confusing situation and the article, because of constant POV pushing within it, just makes it more confusing.</li>
<li>The Butler report does reject the idea that the yellowcake forgery was what British intelligence relied on. That needs to be high up in the story, now it's near the bottom.</li>
<li>The article has a statement casting doubt on the Butler report. No original research, please. Just cite someone else casting doubt -- and then be ready for cited statements in support of the integrity of the Butler commission.</li>
<li>The larger point about Saddam's regime and yellowcake is whether or not he was trying to get it. There needs to be a statement up high saying that there are assertions that he was trying to get it and those assertions are independent of the forgery. Perhaps this whole article should be merged into a larger article about that. In the long run, the yellowcake forgery may not be notable enough for an article of its own, although I think it is at this point (and probably for as long as we're in Iraq).<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:52, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per the NPOV issue. I would like to say keep but I would be kidding myself to believe after surviving an AfD that the editors holding the article in its current form will simply allow it to be rewritten in a less POV manner, then it wouldnt serve its purpose would it? I think this should be added possibly to other articles however covering reasons given by the administration for gonig to war, or broken up and inserted into the appropriate larger articles, but its current state is misleading and I have seen too many articles on AfD with promises to fix NPOV violations just to have those same authors not change the article because "it passed AfD, so its fine" --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 12:20, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure what to do here. The article should definitely be moved and at least partially rewritten but I'm not convinced that deleting and recreating is the best approach.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I renamed it for npov; trivial to fix so certainly not an AFD issue. But, the topic is absolutely without question notable. This nomination borders on the absurd. Extremely well-cited. Could use some polishing, which would be a much more constructive use of time than debating an AFD on a clearly notable topic. Nominator even concedes notability, with "promise" to re-write his own version. Umm, that's a new use for AFD. States it is hopeleslly POV, but has not even placed a POV tag on the page, and <b>has not even made a single edit to the talk page</b>.

<dd>We will not be able to write an article about the <b>"Niger Uranium Documents"</b> for <i>decades</i>, until those documents are declassified. We can and should have an article about some of those documents, because there is plenty of information on the public record. The documents in question (1) came from Italian intelligence, (2) stated that Saddam's regime had tried to buy yellowcake from Niger and (3) were later exposed as forgeries. Hence <b>"Yellowcake forgeries"</b> is an accurate title. That some people attempt to tar all the intelligence regarding Saddam's attempts to acquire Nukes with the forgery brush is not an argument for deleting this article.</dd>
<dd>OTOH, this article is currently in a bad state, and needs lots of POV and OR removed.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, the documents were forged, as acknowledged by the Bush administration and the British government, and yes, the forged documents were about yellowcake from Africa.

<dd>Thanks for that link, csloat. Can we put that in the article?</dd>
<dd>I see my preceding comment wasn't clear enough. Western intelligence agencies have lots of "Niger Uranium Documents", only a few of which have become public. It is impossible to write a good article about those that are still secret, but we can write one about the ones which are now public — which were forgeries about yellowcake. (BTW, I've seen speculation that the forgeries were a simple but lucrative confidence trick, inspired perhaps by <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigerian_419_scam.html" title="Nigerian 419 scam">nearby confidence tricksters</a>.)

<dd>Agreed, this stuff should be in the article. I'm not sure what other "Niger uranium documents" you're referring to; unless we want an article about the history of uranium transactions from Niger but that really isn't what this article was ever about. It's about documents that show that Iraq tried to purchase uranium from Niger in the leadup to the Iraq war, that were cited as evidence that Saddam sought such uranium. Since Saddam didn't seek such uranium, no such documents exist, and the ones that do exist are obvious forgeries. There are no other classified documents that I am aware of on this matter. (It is true Saddam sought such purchases in 1981, and there are probably documents about that, but that was never what this article was about). There is a little side show about the Butler Report that some conservatives apparently still harp on about, but the consensus of opinion among experts looking seriously at this issue appears to be that it is a bunch of hooey. Certainly I haven't heard of anyone suggesting that there are other Niger uranium documents lurking somewhere that show that Saddam was actually seeking uranium from Niger all along.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 06:58, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
