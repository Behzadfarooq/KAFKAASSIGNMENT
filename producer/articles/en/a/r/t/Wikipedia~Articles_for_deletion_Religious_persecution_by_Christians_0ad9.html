<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Handle persecution according to the religion of the victims, because it's more salient than the religion of the perpetrating regime. Grouping by persecutors is problematic because their motivations are not necessarily religious (the regime may not have an organized religion) and those responsible may actually be a more diverse body of powerful individuals, both in terms of religious and other interests. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 03:14, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These are valid themes, and the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a> article may survive VfD. Note that incidents by a group may permit events against minor groups to be listed that otherwise would not be covered. OTOH, this is just a stub, and the whole series needs a lot of work. Also, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Jews_5375.html" title="Religious persecution by Jews">Religious persecution by Jews</a> is not viable at this time since there is not a community of people willing and able to have it be anything other than an anti-semitic rant.

<li><b>Comment</b> The persecution of any identifiable group by any other group is valid historical reportage. This article needs <b>Help</b> and a solid effort to <b>edit</b> and expand it. In fact, I may take a crack at this personally, and invite any suggestions and help that you as wikipedians can offer. Certainly attrocities have been commited by almost any identifiable religious group, excused by their own belief in a superior ethic or mandate from a preternatural force. In fact, the lack of this kind of behaviour is so exceptional in human society and civilization, it warrants nay it BEGS a separate article " <b>Major Religious Groups Who Never Persecuted Other People</b>". That would be a tough one to research. Good luck! <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 03:52, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> persecution by Christians is a known fact of history. I was surprised this article is so short, as Christians since Constantine I's reign to the present day have persecuted non-Christians in many different forms. Christians have persecuted Pagans, Jews, Muslims, other denominations of Christianity, atheists, and others throughout their almost 2000 year history. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> 04:54, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is perhaps a noble idea, but these articles are <i>already</i> POV OR disasters. WP editors have enough problems dealing with prickly subjects as it is, without <i>making up</i> new ones. Any religious persecution by or of religious groups should be discussed in the articles that concern each religious group. Making up this series does not serve any purpose I can see, except to stir up animosities. If this series is kept, I foresee recriminations and accusations and the like leading to a dozen RfArs within a month. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 16:50, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> all three, the template, and everything else related to this project. It's just a bad idea, destined to piss off everyone at the same time. In wiki articles describing specific, documented historical events, I would support having a "religion X persecuted group Y" kind of analysis. But trying to create a general "people persecuted by religion X" topic is the wrong way of doing it, and extending it to all religions and atheism, while it may seem neutral in theory, will only serve to attract the ire of everyone at once. This topic will turn into an endless edit-war and flame-war, with each side claiming to be absolutely right and the only one backed by historical evidence; a little like what happened with the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> page. Furthermore, like Michael Snow pointed out, making a "persecution by religion X" topic implies that religion X is a harmonious monolithic group with a single clear agenda; there is no religion on Earth for which that is true. Trying to group all actions of all sects and sub-groups of religion X over millenia under a single "things done by religion X" topic is a gross oversimplification of a very complex situation. <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22 July 2005</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> -- despite what other pro-<i>delete</i> people have said about POV and edit-wars, if W~paedia is seen as biased, especially towards a "Christians can do no wrong" line, then there will be edit-wars on <b>every</b> page, by those who know Christian sinners. <b>Keep</b> and then audit it weekly to remove the cruft, spam, and hate-mail.

<li>#REDIRECT all these Persecution by . . . articles to homo homini lupus est or delete them all.

<li><b>Delete</b> and delete the others in the series. These will be magnets for POV (as Mustafaa said), but that is not the only reason to delete. The real issue here is the precision of the term - "Religious persecution by ____" does that mean persecution by members of that religion against anyone? By the religion itself (and under what interpretations)? By any member of the religion against another religion as a whole? Is all of history covered? Is nationalistic persecution the same thing? Would the <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedwabne_massacre.html" title="Jedwabne massacre">Jedwabne massacre</a> be religious persecution by Christians against Jews, or a case of anti-semitism?

<li><b>Keep</b>. No idea why this and the other articles were listed for deletion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 03:49, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - this should be dealt with by Religious persecution by Roman Catholics, or by Quakers or whatever group... as SlimVirgin said on the Muslim one up for deletion it's a POV magnet. I would have no problem if this was a disambig page called Religious persecution by Christian groups that linked to persecution by sects, that seems reasonable. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 16:20, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
