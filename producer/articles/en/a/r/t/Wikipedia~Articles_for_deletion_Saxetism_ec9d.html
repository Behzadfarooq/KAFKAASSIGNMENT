<li>Shadownoel 02:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)"Not verifiable?' "Possibly made up?" like that doesn't sound like 2 or 3 major religions i know. Christianity, give me one reliable source other than a 2000 year old book. Same with Islam/Judaisms. Before you go bashing my religion, think for a sec. Your just saying that your better than me. And this is the first post on the internet, so there is no source online with which to verify it. If you don't like that, just go away. If you delete this, you MUST delete those pages as well.</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> The issue of verifiability doesn't apply to the content of the religion but to that of the article. For example, the following statement would be acceptable in an article on Christianity: "Christians believe that Christ was ressurected." The following statement would not be: "Christ was ressurected." In the case of this article, the statements in it cannot be verified, but the statement "Christians believe that Christ was ressurected" can be. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 03:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I assure you, I am not trying to censor you at all. To quote from the primary <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guideline, and as such expand on my nomination, <i>"a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself"</i> (emphasis maintained). Christianity, Buddhism, and the like have been the subject of such works. As for the verifiability, it is one of the three core content policies, the other two being <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>, and writing from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. Additionally, the threshold for inclusion within Wikipedia (from <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>) is "<b>verifiability, not truth</b>" (emphasis maintained). That means since the material within the respective religion articles can be verified by editors using <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, the respective articles merit inclusion. Additionally, <a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> really sums it up. It's the verifiability of the content of the article, not the religion. Have a most wonderful day. <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyraVixen_2190.html" title="User:KyraVixen">Kyra</a><sub><a href="../../../k/y/r/User_talk%7EKyraVixen_ac0e.html" title="User talk:KyraVixen">~(talk)</a></sub> 04:21, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I think you may be missing the point. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a web space provider (there are plenty of free providers though). It has content standards that have been well explained, unless you can assert notability (more than existence) you can't have a page it is as simple as that. It has nothing to do with religion, Christianity et al get pages not because we believe they are fact, but because they are major religions with millions of followers and more importantly countless pieces of literature from which to source an article. No one is bigoted here, no one is trying to stop you from spreading your message, the only thing people are trying to do is insure the quality of Wikipedia, not looking at a particular page as you suggest we do is not a solution. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<li>And you have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to back this up, right? <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 07:33, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have seen these small groups a few times in my world travels over the past few years. They are a very interesting brand of people, but I assure you this is not a fabricated religion such as <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastafarianism.html" title="Pastafarianism">Pastafarianism</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jordangg40 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jordangg40_6e66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jordangg40">contribs</a>) 21:47, 11 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li>Well, since Jordangg40 has donated to their annual fundraiser, then I think we must keep this article. Sincerely yours, <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">The Most Sarcastic Person in the World</a> 02:26, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Halter410 02:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC) I dont see how u can say that any religion has a reliable source to "back it up". And if you really think that a 2000 year old book suppsedly written about the son of god is a verible source you need to get your old faculties checked.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> You might want to read the comments above, many of which explain what it means for a religion to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. It doesn't mean what you think it does. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 02:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>We don't need proof Christianity is true to include it. Just proof it exists. For the record, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bible_5d21.html" title="The Bible">The Bible</a> is waaaaaay older than 2000 years. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 03:14, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>72.134.152.244 04:02, 13 February 2007 (UTC) Here bigots, a site. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/calfour267/Saxetism.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/calfour267/Saxetism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/calfour267/Saxetism.html</a> Our source is there, now stop bothering us because of our religion!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Boy, can members of Saxetism read? If you want to game the system by creating sources at least read some of the policies so you can create a source that meets requirements, I am not going to mention the policies but they are listed ad nauseum above. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

</dl>
<p>Shadownoel 04:23, 13 February 2007 (UTC)All of those requirements have been met. It would be very cool if you didn't just assume that whoever made that page was wrong, but actually read the posted rules above.</p>
<p>Shadownoel 04:27, 13 February 2007 (UTC) btw, this page is very cluttered...but off topic. About the tone being not encyclopedic: What, so we have to use a ton of "thy" and "thines" and "shall" and "smiteth" for a religion to be true. Please.</p>

<dd><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is all I have to say, geocities sites aren't reliable sources. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J. Leivick">Daniel J. Leivick</a> 04:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>66.74.101.230 05:07, 13 February 2007 (UTC) good thats all you have to say? Then keep the rest of your coments to your self and leave us alone.</p>
<p>and ok, yes, the bible is older than 2,000 years, but the part thats pertinent to Christianity is 2007 years old or less. Shadownoel 05:46, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great; then just as soon as Saxetism achieves such a history, it will undoubtedly be notable enough to include in Wikipedia4K. In fact, we can even be charitable and include it before that as soon as it publishes a book, develops a detailed website that is referenced by a third party, or has one of its members interviewed in printed media. And that's just the bare minimum to avoid <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>. Until then, it is unverifiable, and should not be included on this site. Deleting the entry is not a judgment upon the beliefs of individuals, so enough with the <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soapbox.html" title="Soapbox">soapboxing</a>; even if the editors took the information seriously, their discussion here reflects their desire to simply uphold the policies of this website. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 20:58, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
