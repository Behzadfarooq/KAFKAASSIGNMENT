<p>It appears that I keep being unfairly blocked from editing anything in the Wikipedia with my registered user name, <i>Art Dominique</i>, due to ill-fated actions taken by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a>, in reference to the Wikipedia's <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven.html" title="Kven">Kven</a> article. The talk pages reveal that the user <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> has been engouraged to his actions by the user <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a>, apparently for the following reasons:</p>
<p>The user <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> unsprotected the <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven.html" title="Kven">Kven</a> article in question - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kven" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kven" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kven</a> - with a history notation "22:32, 22 March 2006 Splash (unsprot: weird reason to protect and it's been long enough anywa)", after the article had been sprotected by user <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a>, whose reasoning for his action indeed was very, very strange.</p>
<p>Despite of many pleas for him to do so, the above mentioned user with "weird reasoning" - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a> - has not provided sources for his claims in the Wikipedia's <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven.html" title="Kven">Kven</a> text or on its discussion page. His claims presented are not - to our knowledge - supported by known historians and/or other scientists. Instead, the views presented are contradicting those of known historians and other specialists on the related fields, as has been proven on the <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven.html" title="Kven">Kven</a> discussion page.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the users opposing the views of <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a> have provided their own distinguished sources on another Kven text page version and the Kven discussion page as well. However, without presenting sources of their own and without discussing their claims, <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> keep reverting the Kven text into a text version by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a>, which includes his unfounded claims, not supported by science. Furthermore, the sources offered on the bottom of that text version do not agree with the views/claims presented. The given sources have been carried on from the contributes of other editors. Thus, this is a clear case of <b>misrepresentation</b>.</p>
<p>Below are just a couple of examples of the serious shortcomings of the Kven text version by <i>Fred chessplayer</i>, which the user <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> appears to have blocked several other users from correcting, or from reverting to a version with valid credited sources and accurate matching information, approved by historians. The following exact quotes are from the currently standing Fred chessplayer's Kven text. The quotes of <i>Fred chessplayer's</i> claims are followed by correct information (the sources offered in <i>Fred chessplayer's</i> own text version agree with this correct information, but not with the claims of <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a>):</p>
<p><br />
<b>1.</b> "Kvens (alternate spellings: Cwen, Kven, Kvæn, Kveeni, Quen) were a historical group of people that lived in the coastal areas around the Gulf of Bothnia, part of today's Finland."</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There is a wide consensus among historians, that large areas of today's Northern Sweden, particularly the areas around the Gulf of Bothnia, were also part of the historic Kvenland.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Thus, the historic Kvenland areas are not only a "part of today's Finland", but also a part of today's Sweden, and - according to some historians - also a part of today's Norway, and even a part of today's extreme Northwestern Russia.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
<b>2.</b> "Possibly, Kvens referred to all Finnish people. (Suomen historia (History of Finland), page 27, Jouko Vahtola, Professor of Finnish and Scandinavian history. )."</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On the above mentioned page, Professor Vahtola does not claim such a thing. He only says that in 870 AD the "Kven" reference made by the Norwegian explorer "Othar" was - perhaps - meant to refer to Finns in general. On this page, he is not discussing any of the other historic references to Kvens, and their nature and/or meaning.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Professor Vahtola himself indeed has - in his books - made it clear that Kvens are a separate group within the Finnish/Finnic people, and that the term "Kven" - used for instance in various historic texts - has usually not referred to the Finnish people in general, but rather to a special historic group/tribe of people. There is a wide consensus about this matter among historians.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
<b>3.</b>"In literature, the first known occurrence of the Kven in the Account of the Viking Othere, a chronicle in the time of King Alfred the Great in the 9th century AD."</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>According to the distinguished Kven expert, the Professor Emeritus Kyösti Julku, the first known reference to the Kven people in literature was made by the Roman historian <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaius_Cornelius_Tacitus_1cb9.html" title="Gaius Cornelius Tacitus">Tacitus, Gaius Cornelius</a> in</i> Germania <i>in <a href="../../../9/8/_/98.html" title="98">98</a> AD.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
<b>4.</b>"Before the 8th century there are scarcely any remains of the Kvens."</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On the contrary: The archaeological evidence of agricultural settlement on the Finnish side of the Gulf of Bothnia is strong before the 9th century, and it gets weaker as the Viking Age advances"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Some of the less important peaces of information in the currently standing Kven text version is correct, thanks to the contributions by users other than <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a>. Much of the current text, however, is not correctly reflecting the opinions of the utmost experts of the Scandinavian and Finnish history, nor does the currently presented information match the views of the sources and references offered on the current Kven page.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the text version of "16:20, 18 April 2006 Ppt" provides valid information with matching distinguished sources and references, including a couple of exact quotes of the wordings by known Kven experts, etc.</p>

<p>That article reveals serious wrong doings by two Wikipedia users, similar to the wrong doings which user <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo</a> himself has been caught of participating in at Wikipedia's <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varangian.html" title="Varangian">Varangian</a> page.</p>

The user <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo</a> did not provide reasons for his action.</p>
<p>The user <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo</a> has continued these type of radical actions, without reasoning or any conversation. Today he did it on this administrators' page. Thus, <b>can someone now put an end to his ilfated tactics and behavior which do not belong to Wikipedia</b>.

<p>Please be assured that I am not trying to take sides in your dispute on the Kven article. I am simply trying to separate a relatively uncontroversial topic (today's Kvens) from what is apparently a very controversial topic (the history of Kvens that preceded today's Kvens). I don't want to get into the historical Kvens controversy, which seems a little specious to me anyway, but I do feel strongly that today's Kven minority in Norway deserve a complete (but obviously cross-referenced) article on their distinct history, culture, and life. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 12:06, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
