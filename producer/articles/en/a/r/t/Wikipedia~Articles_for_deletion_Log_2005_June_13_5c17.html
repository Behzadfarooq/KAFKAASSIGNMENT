<li>To answer your question, the article is redundant of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Canada_f2ef.html" title="Monarchy in Canada">Monarchy in Canada</a>.

And it's actually not "unusual", in all other cases where a monarch has been monarch of more than one country (including the cases of previous British monarchs), we've had a single biographical article.

<li>Just to note "someone functioning as the monarch of two separate nations" is an extraordinarily common phenomenon in European history. The Spanish thrones were run separately, but ruled by a common monarch, from 1516 to 1713 or so; the English and Scottish thrones had the same deal from 1603-1707, and the English (and then Great British) and Irish thrones from 1539 to 1801. The crowns of France and Navarre were united from 1589 to 1620; the Holy Roman Emperor also held all the various Spanish thrones, the various thrones of the provinces of the Netherlands, the Free County of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily, and the Duchy of Milan form 1519 to 1556; the King of Poland was also Grand Duke of Lithuania for most of the period between 1386 and 1569...do I have to go on? 05:28, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True. However, the Commonwealth is unlike any other legal entity in history. It combines personal constitutional sovereignty of a Monarch over 16 nations, without any nation claiming privilege over any other, and with an extensive legal framework governing each nation aimed at protecting it from any pretense of forming an Empire. I don't think your point is a bad one altogether, but the Commonwealth Sovereign today is unprecedented in some meaningful ways. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:23, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First, as below, some consider "Monarchy" to refer to the Crown as distinct from the reigning invidual Sovereign. Second, the Commonwealth is a legal creature unlike any Empire before. El II is personal Sovereign of 16 nations. I oppose 16 articles on Elizabeth II. I wonder about adding a Queen of Canada article to discribe the Sovereign's role (as an invidual) in Canadian life. Monarchy in Canada might then refer to the legal concept of the Crown, and the complex web that binds Canada to the Commonwealth. On this question, I can't decide, but I have put some thought into it. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:04, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I've tried to point out several times, the fact that the queen is personal sovereign of 16 countries is not unique at all. Up until the French Revolution, <i>most</i> monarchs had multiple, completely separate titles.

<dd>As I've said above, while multiple realms combined under one personal sovereign are not uncommon in history, El. II's position is unique legally. The Commonwealth is unprecedented post-imperisl legal construction, in which the personal sovereign absolutely disclaims any imperious intentions, and takes pain to cast herself as Queen of each land. It is also true that Elizabeth is special in that she is not an object of history yet, but a reigning sovereign. We offend the current form of the states presently existing if we do not do justice to her various roles. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 03:57, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Elizabeth II is not Queen of the Falkland Islands, as the Falklands are a British Crown territory not an independent nation. Also, Queen Victoria would not need seperate pages, as during her reign all British colonies were under the one British Crown, and even British Parliament. Since 1931 the situation has been completely different as the Crown is now one body operating distinctly within 16 seperate <i>independent</i> countries, making Elizabeth II one Monarch who acts disctinctly as Sovereign of 16 nations. gbambino
<dl>
<dd>Her Majesty is Queen of all Her Realms and Territories. The Style "Queen of the Falkland Islands," a territory, is merely disfavored, not incorrect. I'd suggest "The History of the Reigning Sovereign" as a subsection in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Canada_f2ef.html" title="Monarchy in Canada">Monarchy in Canada</a>. The Crown and the Reigning Monarch <b>are</b> distinct, I agree, but are related enough to justify sharing an article if the distinction is made clear therein. My concern is that one or the other of Her Majesty's Realms should not receive privileged treatment before the rest. I dislike Queen El. II of the UK, for this reason, but that name is a necessary practical compromise with a basis in history. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 03:29, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This still doesn't address the facts that a) Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada is a seperate role, with a seperate history, to hers as Queen of the UK, and b) by the Statute of Westminster, the UK is not a more important Realm than any of the others. Also, what happens to the previous King of Canada, George VI, and what will happen with the next monarch, Charles III? gbambino
<dl>
<dd>So you are suggesting we have 16 different Elizabeth II articles then? AndyL 03:53, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps, yes-- it may depend on whether there is enough information to warrant the creation of a page. Though some pages would be longer than others, New Zealand compared to Belize for example, there could indeed be 16 different pages relating to the Queen's 16 different roles and the history attached to each Realm. This would be accurate, and fair (as Xoloz points out, there is a problem with giving the UK a privileged position above the other Realms). The size of the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_Canada_dbf4.html" title="Elizabeth II of Canada">Elizabeth II of Canada</a> page alone confirms that Elizabeth II really does have a distinct history as Queen of Canada. There is no reason why it would not be the same for Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, and other Realms. gbambino</dd>

<dd>I understand your concerns, Gbambino. UK law states that none of Her Majesty's Realms is privileged. I wish I could rename the main article to simply "Her Majesty Elizabeth II," but this is not practical, given the Monarch's historical ties to England (and thus, the UK.) Sixteen articles, sadly, would risk discriminating against some of Her Majesty's Realms that are less powerful globally. I am afraid that the best solution is the one I suggested earlier. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 04:19, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Okay, this area of policy is a mess.

You could <b>Rename</b> this Queen of Canada, and have separate sections for Crown/Personal Monarch. This defeats the problem of 16 Elizabeth -- while she does have a distinct role in every Realm, too much information on her person would be redundant.

<dd>I'm not wholly opposed to "Queen of Canada", but it seems to be a convenient yet temporary solution only as there has so far been only one King of Canada (George VI) and one Queen of Canada (Elizabeth II). When thinking ahead I wonder what will happen when Charles III (should he choose that name) ascends to the Throne-- there will then be two Kings of Canada in history; George VI and Charles III. Which will the "King of Canada" article be assigned to? Of course, this situation is some years off, but none-the-less is something to consider.</dd>
<dd>Also, if there is already a "Queen of Australia" article, a "Queen of New Zealand" article, and there is to be a "Queen of Canada" article, will there then be a "Queen of the United Kingdom" article as well? gbambino

<li>This argument serves as another illustration of the fallacy of this article. This kind of "confusion" is common practice in the numbering of monarchs in European history. Just consider one of the examples given above: <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_9d99.html" title="Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor">Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor</a> = Rudolf II of Bohemia = Rudolf of Hungary = Rudolf VI, Archduke of Austria. It's always the same person.

<ul>
<li>If you wish, see my extensive comments on why Elizabeth the II is not quite like historical figures. In sum: The Commonwealth is a unique legal creation, a product of post-imperial thought. Though many rulers have had multiple domains, none has ruled under a constitutional system that so thoroughly disclaims imperial pretention, and has extensive codified laws aimed at making sure no one Sovereign realm takes precedent over any others. Also, Elizabeth lives, and is not a dusty historical figure; she has many subjects who cherish her, and who care deeply about her role in their countries. At the same, I think 16 articles on one person is redundant. As above, I have voted to move this to <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_Canada_6d4d.html" title="Queen of Canada">Queen of Canada</a>. Each country deserves an article on their Queen, and her position, but Elizabeth needs only one article in her name, with her personal bio, etc. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 04:52, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><small>No, this is an attempt to interfere with the vote. You have appealed to people who hold a certain point of view (they belong to the Monarchist League, after all) who are not Wikipedia editors. That is clearly an attempt to sway the vote in your favour.

<dl>
<dd><small>Be careful to get your facts straight before making accusations. I never once appealed for a vote, and, in fact, never directed anyone specifically to this 'vote' page. I'm sure anyone reading my words will be aware of that. I asked for input and help regarding all the articles related to the Monarchy here, specifically stating that factual arguments were needed, and bias was to be avoided. Indeed, I asked for assistance because of the onslaught of Andy's edits, almost all goverened by his deeply republican POV. And lastly, anyone can be a Wikipedia editor, including members of the Monarchist League, whether that suits you or not. gbambino</small>
<dl>
<dd><small>Of course they can. There are numerous monarchist editors here. The issue is bringing in people who are not regular contributors to Wikipeida for the purpose of getting your way on a particular issue. Your characterization of Monarchist League members as being people who are knowledgeable about the monarchy, and republicans like AndyL as being ignorant of the monarchy are not helpful. Monarchists and republicans <b>both</b> have a point of view. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 16:38, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>What precisely is a "regular contributor"? How many times does one have to edit here before their points are respected? "Don't bite the newbies" but don't take them seriously either? This isn't an exclusive club. There are debates going on here which need input from people who are educated on the Crown. Certainly, republicans can also be educated on the Crown, and if they can provide factual arguments, then that is perfectly fine, regardless of whether I agree with republicanism or not. However, what is of concern is that AndyL is actively editing almost every page dealing with the Crown and Canada, and his arguments for a good number of his actions are guided by an ignorance of the institution, and a lot of baseless republican POV arguments which I've heard before. As is completely clear, POV holds no place here, only fact. I did not call on monarchists to bring their POV (in fact, I specifically discouraged it), but rather only to bring knowledge and facts to the debate. I only happen to know monarchists who are well educated on the Crown. If anyone would like the input of a knowledgable republican, please invite them over. gbambino</small>

<dl>
<dd><small>I can't stop someone from 'voting' here, but I most certainly did not ask anyone to. As I said, I never even drew anyone's attention to this page. And again, what's wrong with outside opinion? It's already been established that 'newbie votes' hold less weight than those of regular contributors. But really, the votes here don't concern me. Whether this page stays or goes doesn't concern me. What is important is that Wikipedia deals with the Crown, the Sovereign, and her relationship in and with her Realms, in the most accurate and correct manner. That's what the debate about this page was supposed to deal with. gbambino</small>

<li><small><b>Strong Keep</b> -- The fine points of merging such an excellent body of writing into a single article is enough to make me shudder - the resulting document couldn't possibly have the easy flow and high style this exhibits, and would ignore the fact that such a monarch is indeed two rulers inhabiting the same body.

If it's done too hastily, you end up with limping dijointed text. Chronology which intermixes key events for diff nationstates, and possibly repeats of things like the article <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleship</a> which commented <b>no less than three times</b> in the space of a screen page on the 21 kt speed of the new steam turbines for the original <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Dreadnought_c19b.html" title="HMS Dreadnought">HMS Dreadnought</a> — I'd be far better editing time fixing something like that, than picking on this excellent effort.

<li><small>A telling point on a <i>merged</i> output product. Another, similar but disparate arguement can be made for keeping a <i>brief <b>historical name</b></i> article as many editors are careless and/or ignorant that many such have <i>their own chapter of history</i>. Take a look at <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalian.html" title="Dalian">Dalian</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/s/Lushun.html" title="Lushun">Lushun</a> for instance -- each name there (and a host of redirected alternate spellings) represents an era in history that such an merged article <b>obscures in the <i>format</i></b>.</small></li>
<li><small>This is not an exact parrallel, but I want a Wiki where one can type (or websearch) using a name in a published book, magazine or other critically edited work by an author of note to find the right information. e.g. Tsushima, Tsu-shima, Tsu Shima, Tsu-Shima are all alternative forms of the same islands/Battle, but which historian was I reading to finally stumble across Wikified Tsushima. It matters not, they are all equally valid, but <i>many such names are being lost</i>. Worse, Wikipedia is becoming gradually decoupled from the extant voluminous body of historical references that have their own contexts.Redirects are fine, but whose to say the Monarchy won't someday be split into seperate ruling Queens? Not I. My Crystal balls not that good.</small></li>
<li><small>More to the point, if someone on the web is searching for Freda the Queen of Canada, I suspect more than a little, they are searching from and concerning an interest in her August Majesty's Canadian History, and care not at all, or only a little about her other titles.

<dd><small><font color="#006666"><font color="#FF6600"><font color="blue"><font color="black">I agree with your points that this is a complex issue for many to deal with, let alone Wikipedia. That one crown operates as a legal institution distinctly yet completely equally in 16 separate countries, and that there is one sovereign who has a personal history in, and relationship with, those 16 nations, is a situation which is is unique to history, and a little difficult to understand at first. Add to this the points that the Crown over the Commonwealth Realms is no longer purely British, yet has no official name either, as well as Wikipedia's existing standards for the naming of monarchs, and it becomes clear that with no precedent it becomes a complex matter to organise and explain accurately in an encyclopaedia. 16 "Elizabeth II of (insert Realm)"s may not be a viable solution, but that eliminates <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a>. Merging the information contained in <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_Canada_dbf4.html" title="Elizabeth II of Canada">Elizabeth II of Canada</a> to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Canada_f2ef.html" title="Monarchy in Canada">Monarchy in Canada</a> ignores the fact that there is a distinction between the institution of the Crown in Canada and the actual person who is Sovereign of the Crown, which is correctly handled in the split between <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Monarchy_6f85.html" title="British Monarchy">British Monarchy</a> articles.</font></font></font></font></small>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> that an article on a song should typically be more than a short list of facts, but I think there is certainly a legitmate interest in some songs (like this) that have a history beyond a single artist or medium.

For example, if this particular song was performed by six other artists but their versions were never popular, I don't see that we add value here by mentioning the appropriately forgotten versions. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 05:33, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>It is definitely not a copyright violation to include the chords the way you have done. Copyright only covers the author's actual expression. For example, to quote a passage from a book you would need to rely on "fair use" because you are using the author's own words. If you briefly summarize the author's book in your own words, that simply does not violate his copyright. There are obviously areas in between, but your listing of the chords clearly is not even in the grey area. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 14:13, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

It is being updated regularly, and growing into a more acceptable article. Remove it from the 'Deletion' page until it is finished. Then make your judgements. Perhaps after the page is finished, we can decide whether to break it up and move the information to other articles. At this time it is easier to upload this stuff to this article. The article can be fixed in more minor ways, such as the title, after it has been completed in some acceptable form.</li>

<li>When it comes to schools, I am neither a "deletionist" nor an "inclusionist" -- I may never vote on one. I think it'll be quite sad, though, if Wikipedia <i>expands</i> to include more articles of questionable notability because of a rise in sarcastic/"cutting-off-the-nose-to-spite-the-face" votes. I suspect this strategy will only result, eventually, in all <i>teachers</i> being included, because I'm sure many "inclusionists" would rather <i>add teachers</i> then <i>delete schools</i>. If some voters formerly inveterately opposed to schools <b>honestly believe</b> that school inclusion is logically irreconcilable with teacher deletion, then so be it. In all earnestness, however, and without personally impugning anybody, I have to wonder about about the sincerity of votes so cast. Are sarcastic votes <i>bad-faith</i>, and if so, may they be stricken? I only ask the question. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 07:01, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it was your average school teacher yes I would have voted delete and I normally do. IMO associate professors and some professors are borderline at best - they are slightly above your average school teacher. I guess it raises the question of whether people who vote Keep for all schools are voting to make a point rather than voting on merit? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesBurns_5f2a.html" title="User:JamesBurns">JamesBurns</a> 09:36, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Inclusionists" do vote to make a point. They think schools are notable. This is a debatable issue on which they have good-faith convictions. A sarcastic vote here is potentially different. If one <b>really believes</b> in a high bar of notability, but votes contrary to that belief for other reasons (eg. I don't like the guy who voted X, so I vote Y, even though I really believe X), one would be voting in <i>bad faith</i>. I am not saying this has been done, because I don't know anyone's motivations, but there is a prima facie case for wondering whether it might have happened here, so I raise the concern. I do understand your reasons, and was not wishing to question any specific vote. I only want to point out how counterproductive sarcastic votes might become if they rise in popularity. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 09:56, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We need to be consistant, don't we? If every school is kept, then why aren't the teachers? They certainly have as much notability as the schools they teach at. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 22:49, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)

<li>That is an argument, and if you really believe that, vote away. I must say, though, I find it an extremely unwise argument. I think most agree that the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Mint_8ce3.html" title="US Mint">US Mint</a> is unquestionably notable; every employee is not.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Just because schools are by definition notable, doesn't mean the teachers are. For one, everyone in a town or city might know about a school (in a medium sized city that is around a quarter of a million people, notable enough for me), but they likely won't be able to name the headmaster or teachers. We have companies on here, but we don't list all of their employees. The same should apply to schools, unless the teacher is noted for something.

Since that article is being kept, based on the voting, merging it makes no sense as it's already in that article. Redirecting it makes no sense either, unless you make it an disambigulation page pointing to other dirty euphemisms. If it's no longer in the <i>Drum wrench</i> arty, it takes away about half the content therein. So all a WOT to me.

I am only submitting the idea. If you only knew how difficult it was for some to keep this article on here as NPOV as possible during its early development.

<li><font size="-3"><font size="-3">Oh by the way, the VfD listing is not a joke. Press releases indicate Bremer allegedly criticized the newly elected Bush administration back in 2000 for not doing enough "home-land securitying".

<li><font size="-3"><font size="-3">Which is, again, <i>not</i> a reason for deletion. If you don't like the POV, fix it yourself, or slap a {{pov}} tag on it. You seem to have done some research on this subject already; why not apply it to the article? There's currently no discussion on the article's talk page about the issues you raise (unless they've been archived or removed, forgive me if that's the case as I haven't the time to go through the talk history) so it seems to me that no effort has been made to fix the article. Bremer is an important figure and warrants an article – why do you want it deleted? If you brought it here just to get more eyeballs on the article, this is the wrong forum, as you can see from the responses. Listing it at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> would be the way to go, IMO. </font></font></li>

<p><font size="-3"><font size="-3">I'm the author of the entry for Samsø Højskole", and I must say I'm a bit dissapointed about this discussion. When I heard about the idea of Wikipedia, I cheered because I thought that it was a worldwide compilation of information, where everybody with valid information could make an entry. (Granted the entry could be better, but I will try to expand it in time) On this school we have Sweedes, Norwegians, Estonians who are all trying to fight a problem with weight, and my initial reason for the entry was to inform people all over that there is a place where you can get help. We do not limit our service to danish people, we see this as a very important piece of work to reduce health problems in the world. I am a teacher at this school, and I do not think of this as an advertisement, this is meant as information and help to those who might want to consider a lifestyle change. If I enter a search entry in Wikipedia, I would like to get as much relevant information as humanly possible, and that's what I want to provide..</font></font></p>

If we had that many articles, the thing would be unsearchable, so we only have articles on the ones that are notable.

Edits to articles by Argyrosargyrou have been attempted, but they have only led to immediate reverts by Argyrosargyrou or one of his sockpuppets, followed by seemingly incessant back-and-forth revert wars. Argyrosargyrou will not discuss his edits, and he is not willing to compromise or seek a consensus. He will only accept his way, with only the wording he chooses, and the words he chooses are not encyclopedic at all. And in those cases, I think it's better not to have an article at all, than to have an unencyclopedic, sometimes factually incorrect, one-sided POV rant by perhaps one of Wikipedia's biggest trolls. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 23:00, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</font></dd>
