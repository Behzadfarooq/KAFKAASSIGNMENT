<li><b>Strong Keep</b> . Firstly, there are two spellings of the name but the most commonly used one is Cindy. Article is notable as it's the first dolphin to marry a human, thus makes it notable enough for wikipedia.

<li>The human married the dolphin, but did the dolphin marry the human? A human marrying or claiming to marry a dolphin is notable only for its unusual form of stupidity. Since human stupidity is so common though (in all forms), I don't think we need to add it to Wikipedia which is about the sum of human knowledge. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 21:09, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It’s irrelevant whether the dolphin agreed to the marriage because the marriage is legal in Israel. It is the first marriage to be legal between a human and a dolphin anywhere in the world, that itself makes it notable enough for wikipedia regardless of the morals of it and the human’s stupidity.<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 14:25, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The concept of marrying a dolphin is utter nonsense. To rephrase it as "a dolphin marrying a human" is even more nonsense, since it indicates some kind of voluntary act on the part of the dolphin, which we can never verify because we cannot talk to dolphins. If this stood as an article, then someone could get an article by marrying their dog. The only thing notable about that is the petty stupidity of the human, which doesn't deserve a Wikipedia entry, but an entry in a place for mentally challenged persons. Besides, this sham is a mockery of the intent of marriage, which is companionship and reproduction, and raising children. A dolphin and a human could never be married. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 17:06, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> “Besides, this sham is a mockery of the intent of marriage, which is companionship and reproduction, and raising children.” Does that include gay marriage?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Different cultures have different beliefs. As you’re from Pennsylvania, I’m trusting that your steretypical culture (not nessessarily you) is against gay marriage. Similarly, some cultures will find marrying a dolphin unusual but acceptable. So to justifiy a speedy deletion based on your culture’s beliefs is to ignore other cultures. My culture finds arranged marriages wrong, should anything accosiated with arranged marriages be excluded from wikipedia? No.</p>
<p>I’m not denying that marrying a dolphin isn’t absurd, but surely it’s absurdity is one of the first real signs that marriage is becoming less important and is gradually become a mockery. In which case, the article IS significant.</p>
<p>Someone who is still at school might have an assignment based on the changing attitudes towards marriage (I’m pretty sure it’s a common subject for students taking Religious Studies to write about), this article would come in useful as it would show a change in attitudes towards marriage.</p>
<p>This article sums up the changes in attitudes towards marriage during this month. Britian’s first gay marriages have taken place and to top it all off a British woman has marriaged a dolphin in Isreal. Surely, signs of change should not be dismissed as asburdities and not included. Similarly, Rosa Parks actions during the civil rights movements were seen as “asurd” but they proved significant in the civil rights movement. Thus asurdity shouldn’t be a reason why something should be deleted.</p>
<p>At the moment those believing that the article should stay may be outnumbered but we have the stronger argument to keep the article against those who want it deleted. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 18:39, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Still Delete</b> I am not going to get into a big editorial debate with you about the meaning of marriage. My comment was taken from the basic definition of marriage, from college Sociology 101 (functionalist view). You might then state (somewhat correctly) that Western Sociology has a traditional Christan bent, but the elements of that definition of marriage have been accepted by the vast majority of human cultures (Christian and non-Christian and pre-Christian) throughout history. Gay marriage and alternative defintitions of marriage are only recent. If you want to write an article about alternative forms of marriage, or add a modern section to an article about marriage, go ahead, but using this "article" is not the way to do it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now, as to my comment, it was meant to be taken literally as follows. First, a human and an animal of any sort, let alone a dolphin, cannot reproduce because they are not of the same species. It's part of the basic definition of a species, look it up, from high school Biology 101. Second, it's highly unlikely they could share a "marital companionship." And if they cannot have children, it's not likely (even if they "adopted") that they could raise children. How could a dolphin participate meaningfully in raising human children?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I don't see how you could quantify arguments for keeping it stronger than arguments for deletion, especially after admitting to the absurdity of this article. Your stated reasons why the keep arguments are stronger begs instead that you write or contribute to an article about alternative forms of marriage, or modern marriage, they don't necessarily argue strongly in favor of keeping this particular article <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 19:09, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I found out about this story from doing a Yahoo News search. Newspapers in India and it was featured in the UK paper "Mirror." While I question the sanity of the woman, but if this is deemed a hoax later on, we can still probably write about this and how the hoax was carried out. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Smack Back)</a></sup> 02:48, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Fifteen years ago when I was working in a grocery store, I saw a headline that I will never forget, because it was so absurd: "Vampires in the US are dying of AIDS!" Should I write an article about that? Maybe an article about absurd tabliod headlines? I mean, I question the sanity of whomever wrote that headline (clever insanity I might admit), but does that merit a Wikipedia article? <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 03:15, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>But it wouldn't deserve a separate article by itself, and that is what I am saying. If you want to somehow add the story that a human married a dolphin to a page about modern marriage, that's fine I guess.

<li>I don't think you realize the absurdity of what you are saying here. You are apparently saying that if a government recognizes it, the article is notable and should be kept regardless of anyone's ideas of marriage. While I agree that this debate is about whether to keep the article and not about the definition of marriage (and I only mentioned it earlier to show the absurdity of the whole concept, but I also told Englishrose that I would not engage in an editoral war with him here over the definition of marriage), a government in acknowledging such a marriage would be applying a definition. Further, you are then saying that if a government recognizes a marriage, it's a marriage. That is nothing but a backdoor argument to the "alternative marriage" agenda/POV that Englishrose was trying to introduce here. Further, the legal complexities introduced by such recognition would be just mind-boggling, and obviously you have not thought it through. For example, if the human dies, does the dolphin get his/her pension? And how is that handled? The whole matter is just absurd...but I digress. This debate is <b>only</b> about whether to keep this article or not, within the definition of "encyclopedic" used by Wikipedia. It's not a debate about the definition of marriage or government recognition of such. If the marriage has verifiably been recognized by a government, then it is probably notable, and should be <i>carefully</i> included in the article to establish it's notability and then the article for deletion debate is over. However, my sense here is that Englishrose, the author of the article, has it here for another reason, he has an agenda and is trying to use this article as a means to advance alternative definitions of marriage, and this is why I have resisted and voted for deletion of this article. Englishrose and his cohorts should not be allowed to use Wikipedia as a soapbox for alternative forms of marriage arguments, or to try to backdoor their way into it by introducing this absurd and non-verifiable article about an alleged first inter-species marriage. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 18:02, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I’m feeling quite angry with that comment. Firstly, in most simple terms- Cindy The Dolphin = first dolphin to marry a human = significant event = notable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><i>“However, my sense here is that Englishrose, the author of the article, has it here for another reason, he has an agenda and is trying to use this article as a means to advance alternative definitions of marriage, and this is why I have resisted and voted for deletion of this article.”</i> ---Oh come on that is absurd, just because I qeustioned your defintion of marriage does not mean that I wanted to advance alternative defitinions of marriage- I would have contributed to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> article, I don’t. In fact, the only personal agenda is that I have a fondness to write articles about famous animals or animal like creatures, see <a href="../../../h/27/a/H%27Angus_the_Monkey_10e6.html" title="H'Angus the Monkey">H'Angus the Monkey</a>.</p>
<p><i>“Englishrose and his cohorts should not be allowed to use Wikipedia as a soapbox for alternative forms of marriage arguments, or to try to backdoor their way into it by introducing this absurd and non-verifiable article about an alleged first inter-species marriage.”</i>---Firstly what cohorts? I have no alignment with anybody who has voted in this article apart from sharing the belief that this article should be kept. Secondly, the article is verifiable as it has been reported by a large amount of news services. Thirdly, I’ve never made any alligations about it being the first inter-species marriage…although I persume it is the first inter-species marriage involving a British citizen.</p>
<p>In future, I think you should think carefully before you make false-alligations about my intentions as this can be considered as a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attack</a>. I think you should comment on the content and not the contributer and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> . <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 20:14, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My questioning your motives for writing the article is not a personal attack. I have read your page, and it does not fit any of the examples given on the page. I didn't call you any name, insult you, or make any slurs on you. I made a reasonable statement about what I think are your motives here. Though you might try to make that into an attack on the contributor rather than the content of the article, it is really a discussion about the content of the article. Now, if you want to "go there" your classification of my comments about your motives as a personal attack are nothing but a weak attempt to minimize my arguments, rather than actually discussing and responding to the arguments with intelligent arguments. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 20:55, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Simply having an article that documents that this event happened does not push POV in either way. The reader is left to draw his own conclusions about the "marriage." Now assuming this is indeed legal and recognized by Israel (a big assumption, I must confess), it would be remiss of Wikipedia to omit the story. That the state of Massachusetts permits same-sex marriage is a fact and does not imply that Wikipedia endorses the act. If this just turns out to be someone who's a bit daft and a minister or whatever that felt like humoring this woman, then it's a non-event and deserves to be deleted. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 07:57, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: To the closing admin, I request you process two AFDs together (this one and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Tendler_3b25.html" title="Sharon Tendler">Sharon Tendler</a>). They are essentially articles on the same item. Also, text has been moved from one to another.

<li>Comment: It's now been verified (with a citation in the article) that the "bride" concedes (what should be obvious), that there's no legal signficance to this wedding. So, with no government recognition, or claim of it, nothing slightly signficant happened here. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 09:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as not encyclopedic. <s>The legal status has nothing to do with it,</s> [I]t's simply another "humourous news story of the day" and doesn't belong here. Send to Wikinews, maybe merge into Wacky publicity stunts involving beastiality or something, but doesn't need its own article.

<li>Putting dolphins to the side for the moment, I suggest if somebody entered into a entirely new type of marriage, that never existed in the country or the world, and it was officially recognized, that would certainly be notable and encyclopedic. Non-official unique relationships on the other hand, are rarely notable, no matter how strange or bizarre they may be. So I think you're wrong, the legal status is very signficant. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:21, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
