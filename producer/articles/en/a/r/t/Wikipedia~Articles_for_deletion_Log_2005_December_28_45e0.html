<li>Okay, the basic point (stripped of any attempt at humour) was that, with a well-written nomination, you don't <i>need</i> to (and <i>shouldn't</i>) make a "vote" on a separate line, let alone point out that you're the nominator. AfD is not supposed to be a vote, and doing this just increases the perception that it's all about the tally. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 15:33, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Note: Ahh, the irony of the creators of technology for removing other technology abusing technology for advertising, abusing another technology for advertising&#160;:) While I agree the motive behind creating this article is obviously advertising (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AdwareAlert&amp;oldid=15659462" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AdwareAlert&amp;oldid=15659462" rel="nofollow">initial revision</a>), we do keep more prominent anti-spyware software such as <a href="../../../a/d/-/Ad-Aware_7574.html" title="Ad-Aware">Ad-Aware</a>. adwarealert.com has Alexa rank of 55,247, borderline notability. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> 05:09, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't trust Alexa much, but that number seems supportive of notability... Looking at the history, there seems to be some POV warring between the company fans (minions?) and those that want to point out that this product is considered rogue by some... getting past that, there is a fair bit of info that could be gleaned from the various versions and put in. Enough to take the article to Featured status? Probably not, but a decent article.

<li><b>Comment</b> before you decide it's linkspam and vote that way I suggest going through the history. For example this version is not linkspam: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AdwareAlert&amp;oldid=31732421" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AdwareAlert&amp;oldid=31732421" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, nor is the 2nd one after it, or the 4th one, etc. The anons keep restoring it back to an advert, but the versions where it is not just an advert (particularly this one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AdwareAlert&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=31791545" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AdwareAlert&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=31791545" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> do seem potentially encyclopedic, if a bit thin. I guess if there is no way to stop the revert warring, then yes, delete it, but wouldn't it be better to have a useful article there? I already "voted" above, so this is just a comment. I also tried to put some of the content back.++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 04:15, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry for the misinformation. Please don't be offended by the use of the word MTV Generation. It's only a name, which may have nothing to do with the Strauss and Howe generations, but it has been used to describe a group of people nonetheless. I have changed the article so that it is not a generational gap, but a cusp encompassing the tail end of X and the beginning of Y, but not a separate generation. This is verifiable in:&#160;::::<a href="http://www.youthspecialties.com/articles/topics/family/multigenerational.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youthspecialties.com/articles/topics/family/multigenerational.php" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and <a href="http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=156" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=156" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>

But I plan to refer to the MTV Generation in passing not as a generation, but as a description of the influence of MTV on this group of people within the article. r430nb</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> i am sorry to say because r430nb is trying but its just that you source statistical facts that have no point or are irrellivent, the sources are about drug statistics from a certain period not about the MTV gen per sey.

<li>Fabhcun! Part of those articles do acknowledge a gap or a cusp, which is not acknowledged by Generaiton Y and X pages in wikipedia. So, if I change the name so it is not a generation, but a cusp, would it still be ok?</li>

<dd><a href="http://www.youthspecialties.com/articles/topics/family/multigenerational.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youthspecialties.com/articles/topics/family/multigenerational.php" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> says There is one other group that's important to mention. The "Cuspers" are those who are born in the transition between generations. If you couldn't neatly place yourself in any of the above categories, then you're probably a Cusper. 1943-1947, 1962-1967 and 1978-1982 are each considered transition times. Many people born during these cusp periods identify with the generations on either side. Often, Cuspers feel like they belong to neither and belong to both. This population caught in the middle can play an important role in ministry. They are generationally bilingual. They can act as translators and ambassadors between the generations.</dd>

According to Martin, "the problem with longer definitions is that they're too huge" -- in other words, they cover too much societal change. This analysis puts the Gen-Y teens of the early 1990s into a unique buffer zone between X-ers and Millennials.</dd>
<dd>I'll remove the drug section.</dd>
<dd>Again I appreciate the suggestions, you're good. Ok, I made the changes, but I'm still waiting on the question about: 1. the name change from a generation to cusp? (as that will cause a redirect) 2. Will you change your vote after I do it? r430nb</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> if it can be cleaned up. There is a lot of data there but it lacks coherency. Is the huge list of bands actually necessary, for example?

<dd>Thanks for the help Lar! I removed the list of bands, but I plan on putting one or two examples of each musical type.
<dl>
<dd>No worries. BTW r430nb, it is not necessary to respond to each and every comment from everyone expressing an opinion, especially if you're just commenting on their comment... that can make these quite long and hard to follow for the "closing admin". What may work better is to try to address all the concerns in one <b>comment</b> that you tack on the end of the discussion, instead of individually. Hope that helps. And thanks for signing your comments, it's hard to remember to do it every time but it really helps if you do. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 16:20, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now, but revisit in a while. This article needs a scythe taken to it: the phrase "MTV generation" has some currency and deserves documentation, but there is no need to list every band, every film and every other cultural influence here; these are already covered in the articles for <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, so much of this is redundant. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:01, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks, but if every cultural influence is moved out, what should I keep? The list of bands has been moved over to the talk page for the article. Then, for the hard subject of the the phrase "MTV generation" I can't find a source matching it to the specific dates mentioned, like he said up above and that it describes a gap between X and Y. So, while I like the term MTV generation, it doesn't match the specific group we're trying to get. This term overlaps with any teenager born anytime who is influenced by MTV. The only claim we have to it is that we were born around the time it first came out, like how Generation Y has always been surrounded with computers and they don't know about a time before that. Believe me, I don't want to change the name "MTV generation" but to comply with Wikipedia, I have to change it to match the sources or else it's deleted. I hope this doesn't change your vote. r430nb</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: since it appears there has been a ton of edits to the temp article, someone will probably need to merge the page history from the temp article to the main article to prevent the contribution history from getting lost.

<li>I think it's emminently fair.

<li>We are prepared to accept any good-faith article which adequately defines a verifiable and established school, the way wikipedia accepts the same thing for towns, villages, universities etc. Why would we be ashamed of that? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 19:53, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, we don't use the same standard at all. Villages are judged by a much lower standard. An article on a village of about 80 people with limited verifiability, and little known about it was speedy kept recently, despite nobody knowing if it was actually a legal entity (it appeared that it once was, but wasn't anymore). Schools lacking verifiable information (or lack of confirmed official status) have been deleted (with me and other inclusionists voting delete). Notice <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Centreville%2C_Lennox_and_Addington_County%2C_Ontario_63d0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Centreville, Lennox and Addington County, Ontario">here</a> comments like "<i>All real places are notable</i>". Of course, I don't see many people challenging such statements, even though, keeping all real places would involve an awful lot of unsourced articles. If this article lacked the verifiability that <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centreville%2C_Lennox_and_Addington_County%2C_Ontario_ff8b.html" title="Centreville, Lennox and Addington County, Ontario">this</a> did, I would probably vote to delete (or at least wait to find more verifiable information before voting to keep). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 21:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Good faith does not equal good sense. I could write a good-faith article about my local Wal-Mart, which exists, is verifiable, and contributes to my community. Yet no one would be surprised to find this article appearing on AfD and falling to defeat. Good sense says that this Wal-Mart is cut out of the same bolt of cloth as thousands of others, which can also be said of schools. Inclusionists seem to miss the point (likely because they haven't seen the inside of a school since the millenia ago they graduated) that all schools are essentially the same and that noatbility is not the norm but the rare commodity. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 02:08, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>JJay, when will you figure out that if everything is special, nothing is special? We need more articles on Canadian schools like we need a fungal infection. I'll tell you what Wikipedia needs - it needs some decent articles on the arts and the humanities. This has been the biggest criticism leveled against Wikipedia's balance of content by the press I've read. But no, we piss around with these subtrivial articles on schools and pretend we are being encyclopedic. I would love to have a page hit counter; my guess is that pretty much the only people who read these pages are their authors.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Femocracy seems to be a neologism without a large foothold or a consistent meaning. Further, most uses do not refer to the gender-exclsuive system this article does.

<p>I wrote the article and believe it is important both as a stand alone piece and agree that it should be linked into the other more general article. This is a concept which is unofficially under development between high ranking participants in each country. Why would you ever delete it? It is an important and separate concept than the general political dialogue between the countries, which should refer to it. Yes, it can be improved and I will make efforts to do so later. I cannot understand why anyone would want to stop the blossoming of such an important initiative for 1.3 BN people. Also, please note that the movement is unofficial and should not be given higher accord, lest its own chances of success be reduced. Thanks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then I strongly suggest a rewrite ASAP to bolster your contention before the article gets merged or deleted. It needs Wikification as well. If it's an official policy of one or both countries, references to that effect are necessary here. As it is, it still reads as someone's pipe dream or critical essay (both of which are not permissible in Wikipedia). Also, you overestimate the importance of Wikipedia when you write <i>I cannot understand why anyone would want to stop the blossoming of such an important initiative for 1.3 BN people</i> as it is more likely that the number of people who read the article will be in the thousands (if that much), not the millions. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 22:27, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was a consensus to <b>delete</b> from article space. But it appears that Taryn85 is Nigel Clarke.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have helped write a book. The book is entitled "High Availibility Networking with Cisco". If you Google on my name "Nigel Clarke" and the words "security", "IETF", "craftedpackets" or Cisco you will see many return results. Why do I have to be the top Google hit to get listed on Wikipedia? I am also a freelace writer and photographer. Google on my name and "boxing" and you will see many articles and interviews that I have performed. One thing that I find odd is that EdwinHJ's entry which clearly a vanity page is not marked for deletion. Why is that? Maybe the administrators don't think my profile and skin color match. In addition, to answer Quarl's comment about the book, I am one of the contributors of the book and my name is listed inside as a contributor. Vincent Jones is the author, but I assited in writing the book and I believe I mentioned that in the article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaryn85_3437.html" title="User:Taryn85">Taryn85</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/r/User_talk%7ETaryn85_524f.html" title="User talk:Taryn85">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Taryn85_9f8c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Taryn85">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As a representative of Anime Punch/ Armageddicon I would like to give my two cents on the issue.<br />
I think considering that club pages are not acceptable, the events of those pages are clearly not valid either. For that reason, deleting the Anime Punch page is perfectly acceptable.<br />
<br />
At the same time, I feel that the Armageddicon page should remain intact as it is a separate event that is staffed only in part by the Animate! OSU club; and although it is still young, has notable aspects to it within the realm of conventions. Considering the number of on wikipedia <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnime_conventions_b490.html" title="Category:Anime conventions">other conventions that have articles</a>, I do not think it would be inappropriate for Armageddicon to continue to exist. --69.133.7.146 00:31, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with the representative from Anime Punch and feel that this con should recieve coverage on Wikipedia, because other small conventions such as <a href="../../../i/k/a/Ikasucon.html" title="Ikasucon">ikasucon</a> (for example) are listed. On the other hand, it is unecessary for there to be two articles for what appears to be one anime convention. Instead of deleting these two articles I suggest that it should be merged into one article (like: Anime Punch: The Armigeddicon ), just like the how text box on the Armigeddicon page reads.--<a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilworms_3769.html" title="User:Neilworms">Neilworms</a> 00:34, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> for the representative of Anime Punch: I have speedily deleted the three articles by association; if the convention becomes notable enough in itself, you can of course recreate it, though I'd probably wait until it's not so young and can be shown to be notable and popular by some independent means (for example, coverage in a local newspaper, citing attendance figures). Otherwise it will be most surely be nominated for deletion again. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<p>"Revolution" is a bit silly, when practically all computers from the start used digital audio, and most synthesizers used for music remained analogue. Also, this article is inaccurate - the <a href="../../../m/o/s/MOS_Technology_SID_a2ef.html" title="MOS Technology SID">Commodore SID</a> was largely digital (all waveforms were digital), and really only the filter was analogue (and remained practically external to the chip, IIRC). The Amiga sound chip was the first digital chip used in a computer? Absolute nonsense. I could name ten others predating that by half a decade just from the top of my head. I know that inaccurate information should be rewritten rather than deleted, but when there was no real digital sound revolution it seems silly to have this article at all. <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWMarsh_2c5a.html" title="User:WMarsh">WMarsh</a> 09:02, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Okay, it's not designed for playing samples from memory, but the article doesn't say this is a requirement - in fact, it's hard to tell <i>what</i> the article is saying at times, or what the supposed revolution was (another good reason to just get rid of it).

<li>How do you know that the Guardian author is even the same guy??? The Guardian article was <i>about</i> bloggers, but nowhere do I see the author identify himself as a blogger. Crabtree is a very common last name, and James is one of the most common first names. His supposed claim to fame is that he's written about Iraq, so the relevant Google hits should mention "Iraq" along with his name - but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=zWt&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=%22James%20Crabtree%22%20iraq&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=iw" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=zWt&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=%22James%20Crabtree%22%20iraq&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=iw" rel="nofollow">only around 600</a> do. Hmmm...well maybe some list his writing about "anbar" provence but not "Iraq," (Only 2 do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Z6v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+anbar&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Z6v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+anbar&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>) or perhaps the city of "Fallujah" (Only 7 do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=A7v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Fallujah&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=A7v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Fallujah&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>) or even his home town of "Austin" Texas (Only a little over 300 do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=nSb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Austin&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=nSb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Austin&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, and I'm not even sure all of these are about the same guy). (Note - I excluded "Iraq" for all of those searches to avoid duplicates of hits from the original search.) But at any rate, even a non-noteworthy blogger would be likely to have a whole lot more relevant Google hits than this Crabtree guy does - given the nature of blogs and their ability to create a lot of redundant Google hits. So I have yet to see anyone give any evidence that this blogger's inclusion here is anything but vanity! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 22:01, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Interesting - I hadn't noticed such a reticence. I find the media loves sensational stuff about gays and lesbians (i.e. all the hooplah about the marriages last year in the states and in the uk now with elton john and all). And transexuality can be even more sensational for the media - particuarly female-&gt;male, which is less common. If media coverage of such things was really so unusual, then wouldn't LGBT websites around the world be talking about Ayden Scheim and how extraordinary it was that he got such media coverage? And wouldn't this result in hudreds if not thousands of google hits?... <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 01:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm a "unique local activist" too, and I've been interviewed by local print and broadcast media on a number of occasions over the past ten years or so - even had a personality profile done in a local paper. And I know a number of local activists here and in other towns who can say the same. But I don't think all that adds up to notability on the Wikipedia level. In a wiki about my town I probably would be deserving of at least brief mention (as would some of my friends), as would Ayden in a Toronto wiki. But neither of us are notable enough to have a Wikipedia bio. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 01:20, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The <i>one</i> TV show that I see she was featured on is <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_Cuts_d1af.html" title="Rough Cuts">Rough Cuts</a> - a reletively minor CBC weekly program which doesn't yet have a Wikipedia article, and which gets a little over 10,000 Google hits. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=B1n&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22rough+cuts%22+cbc&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=B1n&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22rough+cuts%22+cbc&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> Now the show is certainly certainly notable enough that it would deserve a Wikipedia article, but it's certainly a much less well known show than say <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dateline_NBC_0e7d.html" title="Dateline NBC">Dateline NBC</a>, which gets almost two million Google hits. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Dateline+NBC%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Dateline+NBC%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> My point is that the show is not notable to the point where someone appearing on that show one week (in Scheim's case with two others) automatically becomes notable. I'm not even sure that someone who was featured one week on Dateline NBC as an example of some phenomenon they were discussion would automatically become notable, but they'd have a stronger case. Also, I don't see any good reason why the Google-test shouldn't apply here, as this person is not historic and is not from outside the Western World. It's really hard to see how a young Canadian activist would have less than 200 non-Wikipedia Google hits if he were notable. Another test I would apply is would anyone who had not met Ayden Scheim in person and did not live in his area be likely to be motivated to start a Wikipedia article on him? And I have yet to see any evidence that they would. And judging from the edit summaries at the article, it's pretty clear to me that it was written by people who know Ayden. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 04:02, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I <i>know</i> that I am not important enough to warrant a Wikipedia entry, so one of my benchmarks for inclusion is someoen who's had more media exposure than I have, it's as simple as that. You can't verify my media appearances for the same reason I can't easily verify the media appearances of the subject: they are transient. Andy Warhol said that everyone is famous for 15 minutes - does that mean everybody should be in WP? The problem here is continuing verifiability, notability is just shorthand for describing someone who is likely to remain in the media spotlight for long enough to ensure that something other than a single current event is verifiable (like candidates for political office, most of whom lose, and many of those are never heard of again). Once the media lose interest (assuming they haven't already) then everything subsequent becomes <i>completely</i> unverifiable instead of only unverifiable by anyone not in the area. As far as I'm concerned we should wait at least a year before adding an article related to any single current event, to see what the perspective of history might be. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:40, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I reiterate: Have you been featured in two nationally televised documentaries? If not, I expect you will stop distorting Mr. Scheim's record and withdraw your comments above. I would also appreciate it if you stopped talking about your supposed media appearances. Your claims about google hits are not relevant unless you provide a link. If the hits relate to some blog you maintain then they will be discounted. Mr. Scheim is not a current event, he is an activist. There are newspaper references on him dating back four years. Futhermore, I do not judge any bio by the media's interest or lack thereof.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I don't understand why it is a problem keeping articles like these. I take "non-notable" to mean "not notable AT ALL". Certainly this person is notable. I think people should be saying "Not notable enough". Otherwise, it can sound like the things of note that a person does are not important. I will assume good faith here and assume that this is not the intent of the people saying "non-notable". Personally, I think Wikipedia should have many thousand small articles about the mildly notable people of the world. Some of these people will become more notable, in which case we can say it was in Wikipedia first. Others will drift off into obscurity. In future decades a small handful of people digging for information about obscure mildly notable people will find a paragraph or two about them here on Wikipedia. Won't they think highly of us. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 01:53, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. I cleaned up the article as best I could with the information available.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - While I did not start these articles, and would not have done so until the actual albums/projects were near completion, I have basically written all of the articles and provided all of the information for the existing and close-to-completion albums done by OverClocked ReMix (i.e. Relics of the Chozo, Kong in Concert, Hedgehog Heaven, Repercussions of Fowl Lamentation, Rise of the Star, The Dark Side of Phobos &amp; Chrono Symphonic), as well as other popular fan and licensed game arrangement albums (e.g. Bound Together, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_American_Album_6cd2.html" title="The American Album">The American Album</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Very_Best_of_SEGA_5c22.html" title="The Very Best of SEGA">The Very Best of SEGA</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_OneUps_Volume_1_75f1.html" title="The OneUps Volume 1">The OneUps Volume 1</a> &amp; <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenogears_Light_7ec7.html" title="Xenogears Light">Xenogears Light</a>). These AfD nominations are all substantially in-progress arrangement albums of popular video games and video game series and, IMO, are not merely cruft. I can assure you that those articles will have full information on them, and obviously will have to work to build these AfD noms into suitable stubs now while the albums are still in progress, much like the Summoning of Spirits album which was in this group of articles but not nominated. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 22:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>At present, each of these projects exists as a few work-in-progress remixes between people who meet in a single topic on the OCR boards and probably over IRC. At the moment, they are cruft, they are advertising. There's nothing to these articles but the same template text you've applied to the other articles (I don't mean that as an insult, I just think that substituting "Sonic the Hedgehog enthusiasts" into already formulated text used for other articles does not itself create new articles). At present, there is nothing at all unique about these articles. The released/close to release albums each have their own backgrounds--these projects have no backgrounds. They are not sufficiently developed to have them. They're just carbon copies of one another. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vague.html" title="Vague">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 07:46, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, I have used a template of which I have written other articles regarding these types of projects. The resulting information is no less genuine, because these projects are all created under the same circumstances. There's no reason to come up with synonyms for 10 different articles simply because using a template isn't unique. I don't think that's necessarily a requirement for articles that are clearly presented as stubs until they can be expanded with even more information and specifics.<br />
As for "not having their own backgrounds", each of these albums have different backgrounds/concepts of what they aim to accomplish that I'll be more than happy to add in the coming days. Again, these are stubs and are not gonna have all of the information presented immediately/at once. Basically I'm arguing that there's enough substance that is simply not yet presented that justifies leaving these to actually develop. Personally, I'd say that these stubs should remain and be allowed to expand. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 08:32, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not debating whether the template makes the information genuine or not--I'm debating whether there's any information here at all. There are what, six unique words in the entire article? And even if there is information, who is it here for? No one who is not already following the project has an interest in these proto-albums. It is here solely to appease the fans who want it here. And that's no reason for an article. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 10:54, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm not sure if OCRemix albums really need their own entires anyway, but entries for albums that haven't even been released yet?

<li>Just a quick extra note - there are even more of these stupid articles: Summoning of Spirits, Chrono Symphonic. They're all kinda hard to find as none of the "in progress" ones are actually linked from the main <a href="../../../o/v/e/OverClocked_ReMix_d57a.html" title="OverClocked ReMix">OverClocked ReMix</a> page (although there is a template on the induvidual album pages). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 11:15, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - OCR projects that aren't completed yet don't need to have Wikipedia articles. The people in charge of those projects can make the articles after they've finished and released their albums. The only one that I'd like to keep around is the Chrono Symphonic one, because that's due for release in just a few days, but even if it does get deleted, the entire raw form of the article (with all the markup) can be copied into a text file to be posted at a later date, when the album is released.&#160;;) I'm in agreement that articles about unreleased albums that have little substance to them are pointless advertisements; and this is coming from the guy in charge of projects at OCR. In any case, I've posted about this at OCR to try and curb any future abuse. Darkesword 18:02, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Since I am sort of a transport/communications guy I am always concerned about seamlessness in social technical systems (turns out that people don’t like to catch a bus to catch a bus, etc.). So when there I am in Wikipedia, it is my I am sure quite silly desire to be able to one click to, say, a word that the author has pointed up as a possible key to a message. Or a quote such as this. Which only goes to show you how naive one can be. Thanks so much for putting me into the picture. (But I bet that this seamlessness will come about sooner or later, and probably sooner.)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I might add that as I blunder around here, there is a bit more to it than may meet the eye. I have a long time interest in creating and supporting knowledge building mechanisms for public policy decisions and actions, and that at least in part via [Self-Organizing Collaborative Network]s. So, perhaps not surprisingly, we are looking at ways of integrating the Wikipedia into a number of our groups work projects under [The Commons]. My hope is that our use of it will turn out to be useful to others in turn.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I originally speedied this after tagged by another user. I did so because I didn't consider a claim basically saying "this guy's really famous!

<li>An 'activity percentile' of 98% on sourceforge does not indicate that the project is significant. That number for your project is influenced by exactly three things:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Number of CVS commits in the last 7 days</li>
<li>Age of the latest file release in days</li>
<li>Number of days since the last project admin login</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>To get an 'activity rank' of 98% for a project, all one needs to do is log into SourceForge once every few days, have recently released a file, and commit to the CVS repository a couple of times. It says nothing about the popularity of the project or the meaningfulness of it.</dd>
<dd>That said, <b>delete</b>. The project has been downloaded a staggering <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=146061" class="external text" title="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=146061" rel="nofollow">306 times</a> since its first release in August 2005.

<p>While I appreciate your feedback on how insignificant this page apparently is when compared to the magnitude of other items within the encyclopaedia, I do wonder to myself what does qualify? Having a look at the category's of Free audio software &amp; SourceForge projects I am still a little confused as how this is any less significant than the least significant already there? --OpenSebJ 23:10, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>My comments (and my 'delete' recommendation) are not meant to be insulting. It's just that there has to be a line somewhere between Apache and Joe's File Renaming Script such that projects on one side are included, and projects on the other side are not. Google (while not the end-all of search engines) records 'about 41' hits for the term 'OpenSebJ', of which 16 are 'sufficiently unique'. Of those, 4 are sourceforge mirrors, 7 are posts by you under the username 'opensebj' on some forums, 2 are your website, and one is the sourceforge project page. That leaves just two pages, one of which seems to be a mirror and one of which appears to be a gateway page. No one but you appears to be discussing this project at all. No one but you appears to be using it. While I wish you the best of luck with the development and promotion of this project, I just can't say that it has garnered enough interest at this point for an article here. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Deken_ff24.html" title="User:Stephen Deken">Stephen Deken</a> 01:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Another good point is that a lot of the stuff in Wikipedia at any given moment should not be there. If AfD'd, I'm sure a lot of those SourceForge projects there would be deleted with clear consensus. --<a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgamemnon2_ee6b.html" title="User:Agamemnon2">Agamemnon2</a> 09:29, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I am sorry if this edition of the link is against your policies, i must admit i didnt read them before i edited this. You can verify all the info just like you verified the "planescape torment" translation exists, or the newly released vampire bloodlines or lots of others at clandlan.net/academia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is the English wikipedia, but in practice the English wikipedia is used as a source for articles in other languages, and sadly this has resulted in "English forms" proliferating in other languages, where they are not appropriate. Of course it isn't useless. It is a useful resource, esp. when so many wikipedians are unable to give early and high medieval Scottish kings their proper ethnic names. For these reasons and others, I vote to keep the article. - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 14:10, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sure, but I think the original Gaelic names should be listed in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monarchs_of_Scotland_b1e9.html" title="List of monarchs of Scotland">List of monarchs of Scotland</a> and the articles themselves. Having a separate page for them serves no purpose at all. - ulayiti <font color="#226B22"><small>(talk)</small></font> 14:17, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, there are three different forms to be included; the medieval native Scottish forms, the modern Gaelic forms and the modern Anglicizations: might be a little messy, unless someone makes a decent table. On the other hand, the Gaelic article can perhaps be updated in future with more in depth discussion of medieval Gaelic, English and Continental names, Gaelicization, Latinization, Francization, and Anglicization. My own view is that all pre-12th century Scottish monarchs should have names in their <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Irish_language_d10d.html" title="Middle Irish language">medieval Scottish</a> form by default. This is increasingly the trend amongst Scottish medievalists in any case. The age of the King Duffs and Malcolm MacKenneths is coming to an end. Although sadly few Anglophone wikipedians are reflecting this yet, you cannot say that Anglicized forms are the only forms used in the English language. Moreover, the medieval Scottish language has no wikipedia of its own. I guess my views are compatible with a merger though, as my concern is not so much with modern Gaelic forms. - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 14:38, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>conditional merge</b> -- true, the information obviously belongs in the Gaelic wikipedia, but it also belongs here: <i>not all of us read Gaelic and so we'll be lost there.</i> As far as en is concerned, including the information in the articles is all well and good but it doesn't replicate the usefulness of a list; neither do parentheticals after the names at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monarchs_of_Scotland_b1e9.html" title="List of monarchs of Scotland">List of monarchs of Scotland</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yesterday you put a notice asking us to do some cleaning up in the Network page —no warning at all up to then!-and we immediately responded with some cleaning up, to find today an AfD supported by the well known duo of the Liberal Democrat and the anarcho-CAPITALIST who seem determined to delete any trace of the Inclusive Democracy project from their “Encyclopedia”, because they are afraid of new concepts. And of course they were immediately supported by other administradroids who are much more interested in such important topics as the World of Darkness, creationism and retaining the status-quo than in a new Network promoting a new social project. Wikipedia is all yours folks! We do not care about you because you confirmed all the accusations being published at the moment in the world press about the bias and unreliability of this joke Encyclopedia, and we will help as much as we can to help all those who do not know what is going on here about how entries are selected and de-selected and the ‘expertise’ of so-called administradroids who in the last instance decide what should appear here and what not! The field is in your favor and you call your rubberstamp gang, when the game gets too tough, to power play with the illusion of neutrality and objectivity. Wikipedia is a failure in progress.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If notability for Wikipedia is measured by Google hits then this could well explain the low quality information it provides for which it is justifiably criticised by the world press. You should better however concentrate on such items like the bios of Hollywood stars and football players (or the other important items mentioned by another user above) and forget everything else! This would surely expand enormously the number of Google hits you get. As regards vandalism, I wonder why comments by an administrator above that “the group is unknown to anybody outside its own membership” do not cosntitute vandalism of the worst kind, apart from revealing the political bias of an anarcho-capitalist (i.e. someone who wishes to restrict the powers of the state in order to leave the market--namely the law of the jungle-- completely free to destroy all the weak in this world. How he is so sure of this—unless of course he asked the likes of the people he frequently meets in Hilton, Sheraton and the like! 10.55: Dec. 29, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No. Vandalism of the worst kind might include saying "Mr. Fotopolis was involved in the Kennedy assassination" when there is no evidence to support the claim. If you see no difference between those two statements, you might be unable to objectively contribute to this discussion. Also, you might consider not making attacks based on the content of my user page (which has existed, without complaint, for a greater period of time than the article being discussed).

<li><i>Unless you are joking (which I doubt) YOU ARE LYING.

And as regards the silly argument on publications that the Greek branch "publishes a newspaper and a magazine'</i>. Those might mention the party every once in a while, don't you think?", the International Netwpork for Inclusive Democracy publishes, apart from the on line International journal on Inclusive Democracy, a printed three monthly journal in Greece, an occasional paper in New Jersey and many other publications in the form of books stc. Those might mention the network every once in a while, don't you think? Finally stop the slanders against us because they simply make your so called neutrality even more ridiculous. Nobody from the network has vandalised this page or any other page for that matter AND YOU KNOW THAT. Such tactics are simply against our principles and they are the tactics that others use, particularly your friend Paul Cardan and his various sockpuppets.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ulayiti, I guess the truth hurts. That's why you deleted the comment at your page. By the way Quantum mechanics is not a new concept, except maybe in your mind, of course. Your page was not vandalized, but briefly psychoanalyzed. However, we haven't heard from any administrator about tracing the pornographic vandalism at our page.

<li><b>Comment</b>No surprise that a well known notable and international figure like David Boothroyd, who deserves his own extended entry in Wikipedia, could not accept non-notable entries like that of the network! 11:50, 29 Dec.2005</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Vanity</b> FreakofNuture is resorting to vanity ("my page has existed longer..."), as well as ulayiti ("my user name gets 38,600 hits"). FreakofNurture, is the vandalism of which you speak the fact that you spelled Fotopoulos incorrectly? The assassination which you refer to was actually a vandalization which occurred and stayed on the pages of wiki for several months, when Seigenthaler was accused of being involved in the assassination. It doesn't say much for the reliability and expertise of information of the administrators at wiki. Anon (in itself unreliable)has stated that Boothroyd is so great, but does not provide anything notable he has invented. You always try to manipulate the field of play. User:john sargis 7:56, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, and only your organization has found it offensive so far. I thought this would hinge on my chess match record, but you've dug deeper by discrediting me on the basis of spelling errors.

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<dd>Why have my earlier comments disappeared from this discussion? Anyway, as I said, <b>Keep</b>, because he has been elected to a public office, that already makes him noteworthy. Besides, he has an interesting blog on his site, which is more what can be said of several other councillors, who were decided to be kept in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Manchester_councillors" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Manchester_councillors" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>. Even the article about Stephen Tall now contains more information than most of thos articles.

<li>I'll keep that in mind in the future; I'm not sure if I've participated in a page delete discussion before. I realized after typing in the recommendation for a merge if there was an issue with the page that it was actually a bot, but I was really just concerned with avoiding a delete of what could be a useful page for people studying this aspect of the workplace, so I left the comment as it was. I have no problem with putting a footnote about this topic on some sociology page if that's what people want. But I do think it is wrong to misuse the deletion policy because, whether intended or not, it can amount to censorship of the diversity of information available via wikipedia. I'm not 100% sure I understand all of the criteria behind deletion, and I know some people on wikipedia are deletionists and kind of want to run around deleting things (maybe not quite what deletionism is all about. . . ), but my personal impression is if the content serves a valid informational purpose, it shouldn't be deleted; particularly where, if there was a compliant that the subject doesn't deserve a seperate page, the protocol recommends just putting it into a subsection of another page.</li>

Since the criteria for authors is only 5000 readers, I have to give him the benifit of the doubt that he's hit that with 4 books (especially given that 3 are still available new).

<li><b>Delete</b> inaccuracy can be fixed, redundancy per other articles is harder to overcome and (the clincher for me) since this article has nothing independent to say, a category would do the job vastly better without dozeins of redlinks to maybe-never-notable bands. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:29, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm guessing the inaccurate information is borderline cases: I didn't see any clearly inappropriate bands in the list, and several that are clearly good calls. Having lists like these helps avoid bloat in main articles, and the quality cure is finding clear crieria and insisting on sourcing for claims. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 17:54, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>A few alternative bands that are not grunge, such as The Smashing Pumpkins, are on there, and several <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-grunge.html" title="Post-grunge">post-grunge</a> bands are on there as well (which are not technically grunge). The only good calls I see there are those already on the list in the grunge article. The list there is only of those that were prominent; all others are left to the grunge category. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 01:23, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll call some borderline cases: Smashing Pumpkins is often classified as grunge, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jesus_Lizard_1f5d.html" title="The Jesus Lizard">The Jesus Lizard</a> as well, <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killdozer.html" title="Killdozer">Killdozer</a> (not on either list), <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toadies.html" title="Toadies">Toadies</a>. What's the criteria for inclusion or exclusion: maybe Chicago bands don't count because they were part of a different movement? Having a list side by side with a category makes things easier to police, and liosts are better for characterising the fringe of a movement. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 01:45, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those bands that are often misclassified as grunge have been disputed before at the grunge article. We came to a consensus that they were not grunge, and that they did not belong on the list there. With that in mind, they should not be in another list claiming that they are grunge. And as far as I can tell, the list doesn't help; it only contradicts the article and category, confusing readers as to which one is telling the truth. And, once again, post-grunge bands do not count as grunge. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 23:19, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article about <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Luiz_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero_7a5a.html" title="José Luiz Rodríguez Zapatero">José Luiz Rodríguez Zapatero</a> is very long, but, in spite of that, it does not contain all the information about the subject. That is only natural as there exist printed biographies on Zapatero with more than 400 pages. As it is evident, an article equivalent to 400 pages would be too long, specially as there are a lot of users who do not want to know "all" about Zapatero. That's why I created the "extended" articles, like this, long ago: to place information that is not so important but can be very interesting for journalists, ambassadors, university students specialized in foreign relations and so on. As far as I know, the Wikipedia is for everybody, not only for the "average" user.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When I create the articles nobody complaint, in fact, as can be found in the archived talk, other users accepted the change. In fact, when I divided the article I commented on the talk page my decision and nobody showed any opposition. One day, SqueakBox came to the article and substituted them with redirects to the main article. He did not ask the opinion of the users who have worked in writing and improving those articles. He did not care about making very interesting information inaccessible to others. Well, he never justifies his deletions, although the rules of the Wikipedia recommend to take everything that is deleted to the talk page and explain the decision. That is especially serious as he has spent a lot of time already and he knows what he does is a pure attack against other users. He enjoys those attacks. When other users ask him why he has deleted his contributions even though he has never contributed anything useful he simply insults them: you are a POV warrior, you are a spammer, you are a disgrace for the Wikipedia, "your" article is very bad, "your" article is a pile of cr**p, "your" article is a "disgrace" (it is worth noting that he uses "your" in an individual sense even if dozens of users has worked hard in an article he has attacked). For months nobody has been able to edit the article on Zapatero as he removes everything that is added. Once, he removed a sentence by another user 15 minutes after it was introduced. That user had never before edited nothing but SqueakBox claim he was a POV warrior, so breaking the Wikipedia Policy about assuming good faith.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The redirection was never accepted. It is stupid to substitue with a redirect an article called "Zapatero's foreign policy". Who can search something like that if he/she does not know previously that it exists? It is absurd. However, SqueakBox could impose his abusrd decision because he spends all day long connected to the Wikipedia, what allows him to behave like a bully. He never uses logical reasons and, if you try to protect an article recovering the damage he has done he reverts it again insulting you by the way. I dare to recover the real articles he has destroyed because he has been scared away by the administrator Katefan0. This user blocked the main article on Zapatero. SqueakBox had caused an edit war because he introduced mistakes on purpose. For example, he changed European Union for European union, and paid no attention to anybody when he was told that was an evident mistake. When Katefan0 asked all the users to expose his point of view on the "conflict", SqueakBox dissapeared as he is afraid of administrators as they can punish his bad faith. Against an administrator is useless to spend ten hours every day in the Wikipedia. To play bully is useless.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I simple asked the Wikipedia community to look to the "extended" articles. They have defects, but those defects can be improved and they contain information that can be very useful for a lot of people. The Wikipedia is a place for sharing knowledge no for bullies and monsters. <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZapatancas_8ec3.html" title="User:Zapatancas">Zapatancas</a> 16:33, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is certain is that if our case came up before the arbcom both our behaviours would be under scrutiny, so it would providse you with an opportunity to state your case with diffs and it would mean SQ and SQAA would be the subject of a sockpuppet test to determine exactly where these 2 accounts were being edited from (your IP range is known as you have made edits which are obviously you while not signing into an account).

<p>Estonia wasn't even an independent country in 1912 (although there were several Estonians in the Russian team). Article is full of factual errors and inaccuracies. There are no other articles about teams in the 1912 olympics yet, so having one on a country that didn't even exist at that time isn't a good idea. Laur 16:50, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

The official report of the 1912 Olympic Games can be found <a href="http://www.aafla.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1912/1912.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.aafla.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1912/1912.pdf" rel="nofollow">here (note: 1426-page PDF file)</a>. As indicated on pages 943-44 of the file (numbered as pages 675-76 of the text), the losers of the semi-final matches in men's single scull rowing were E.B. Butler of Canada and M. Kusik of Russia. There is no indication of a third-place match between the two, which would explain why both are listed as bronze medalists. Whatever Mr. Kusik, Kuusik, or Kusick's preferred spelling of his name was, or what his first name was, or what his ethnic background was, he was competing for Russia in 1912, and I have found no indication in the report that Estonia competed independently at that Olympics. If there are Wikipedia editors who want to create articles about the Olympic performance of various nationalities such as Estonians, Ukrainians, Armenians, etc. on the Russian or Soviet teams, I would advise against creating them in this format. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:25, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: In 1912 Estonia was part of Russian Empire and Estonian athletes definitely competed in the Russian team. An article about Estonians in those olympics would be welcome, but this article doesn't even contain a complete list of them (and Hugo Kuusik's name was misspelt as a result of transforming from Latin to Cyrillic and back), so practically nothing could be retained from this article. Also, Kuusik didn't get any prize and his 3rd place is disputed, so it might be inaccurate to list him as "bronze medal" winner. Laur 10:04, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>If we are to judge Motl based solely upon his work, that is, his publications, it is obvious that he is only an average string theorist who is pretty much unnotable. He hasn't made any notable or groundbreaking contributions to physics and his papers, which are often coauthored with other more famous physicists are run-of-the-mill papers. The Czech textbook on linear algebra which he has coauthored isn't notable either. His only claim to fame/notability is his very active and aggressive presence on the internet (the usenet, various blogs and Wikipedia) where he frequently peppers his speech with invectives. In fact, his mere active presence isn't enough to contribute to his noteriety. There are many other physicists who also have an active presence on the internet but they don't stand out anywhere near as much because they don't litter their writings with hateful speech. They tend to blend in with the background, so to speak.</p>
<p>Not only that, this page is a vanity page of Lumidek, which is the user name of Motl here at Wikipedia.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree with your definition of "vanity article" because the article could not have been written by Ms. Marchant, given her distinctive style. While there are varying perspectives about Ms Marchant's talent, she certainly has a following and has made a name for herself and is news-worthy, in her own way. Her offer of selling her CDs for thousands of dollars was reported in any number of sources. I think that she does indeed have a certain importance in the area of web music, as she has become an extremely wellknown figure in these circles--for example, in this article in the Magazine San Francisco Weekly&#160;: <a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/2005-12-21/music/music.html" class="external free" title="http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/2005-12-21/music/music.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/2005-12-21/music/music.html</a> . It is true that she does not completely fulfill the criteria for inclusion under the WP:MUSIC directives, but I have seen the "internet" and "Indie" aspects of this directive be brought into question in other discussions, so it would seem that this policy is evolving. There are other, much more frivilous articles about people who are lesser known. I think that this article should stay.Musikfabrik 16:39, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Marissa Marchant is a prominent regional singer-songwriter with outspoken attitudes on the state of the music business. She was the anecdotal lead in a San Francisco Weekly cover story on the variable pricing of records. Her posts on message boards allow her fans to keep up with her progress in recording, as well as her artistic influences. She is also a prolific writer with myriad thoughts on sexism, culture and society. To claim that the entry was a "vanity" post is to underestimate the number of Ms. Marchant's fans, as well as their interest in her artistic progress. I believe this article should be maintained, and hopefully expanded to include more about Ms. Marchant's musical accomplishments. -- robuptight 12:31, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I've already voted, but I wanted to make the further comment that this discussion is not about whether or not the votes to keep this article are valid, but rather whether the content in the article entitled "Marissa Marchant" is worthy of having a place on this service. The first phrase of the article states that Miss Marchant is "more notorious as an Internet phenomenon than as a musician", so is it surprising that there are people coming off of the web (who have never posted here before) to support her? I am not an administrator, so I can't verify this, but it seems to be that it would probably be quite easy to verify where they were coming from using the IP address. I'm convinced that they are NOT sock puppets, but rather people who are coming here to underline the importance of Miss Marchant's work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>What we have here is another discussion concerning "notability" and whether this fits into various people's ideas of whether or not people are "famous" enough to be on this sort of service. As a classical musician and musicologist, I know that the standards set in WP:Music simply do not apply to many people who are obviously important figures in the classical music World. And given the way that market is changing (for example, the major labels do not produce classical recordings any more, which has lead to many famous musicians-such as Jordi Savall and David Finckel, Cellist of the Emerson Quartet, to name only two--to produce their own recordings...much in the same way as independent net musicians...), the idea of using "label releases" as a means of judging worth is completely <i>passé.</i> Even with a "label release", the majority of classical recordings (even those by name artists and composers) rarely sell more than 200 units. This scale also does not apply to Net Musicians, who work "outside of the box". This does not mean that their actions do not have importance nor does it not mean that their work is without merit. It simply means that they have figured out another way to go about their business, which is currently becoming the norm. It seems quite apparent to me that WP:Music needs to have a major overhaul to take these new aspects of the music business into account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The importance of Miss Marchant's work is centered around her action of asking for $1000 per CD on her website. While it does not constitute artistic greatness (a quality which obviously is subjective and outside of this discussion), it certainly caused a lot of discussion, on the net and off, which continues to this day about the market value of music and what the artist's reaction to it should or should not be. For this reason, Miss Marchant has significant importance as a cultural icon which is not a recent issue, but which has lasted for the several years that I have followed her career. In deleting this article, the Wikipedia community is closing itself to part of the music business which needs to be documented which it is still evolving. To delete this article would be doing a disservice to knowledge.Musikfabrik 09:58, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>What is interesting is that it is New Year's Eve and I am recording even tonight. The first few people were definately not myself and you people should know they are coming from California and the South of the U.S. I live in New York State. I am at home recording. I have devoted my whole life to music and art. That should sum up who I am. My devotion is what should be emphasized, not numbers etc.. People who are sour grapes love to flame people because they themselves are often discontent. I like to be positive about life, love and the new year. I am trying to improve myself, my behavior and my language. I want to be more loving this year and more productive. The world needs more of what is positive, and less of what is negative. I didn't write the article in the San Fransico Weekly, and someone else came up with that idea. I didn't prompt them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I don't think you should keep this article. First off I don't like the name Marissa Marchant, and came up with a better name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, I don't need Wikipedia's stamp of approval. Who are these people hiding behind a computer? Who cares? I don't care about Wikipedia. I think that my singing and quality of writing spoke for itself, that I am known more for music then anything else. The amount of money someone charges for a Cd is really not important, and either is the price of Paintings. The most important part of art is the quality. The amount of records someone sells is not important. The quality is. Numbers are not important to real artists. If the people at Wikipedia understood the value of true artists or artwork, they would not emphasize numbers or price.</p>

~**** I am not rich at all. I spent over 150 thousand dollars in my little lifetime so far on musical items, lessons, and paintings. I am far from rich. Art is a main priority in my life and a love of my life and my families life. I wouldn't laugh at fine artists in a world that devalues artists. Our world once honored fine artists and fine art composers, singers, singer/writers. Now people are living in the past, following the media trends and not caring about artwork, or caring about the fine detail of a artistic building. We are now living in a ugly, bland world, a world that is living the past and humankinds past accomplishments. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fa.music.ecto/browse_thread/thread/5a1cc1e80c426bb5/847505b78eca9187?lnk=st&amp;q=marissa%20marchant&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en&amp;" class="external free" title="http://groups.google.com/group/fa.music.ecto/browse_thread/thread/5a1cc1e80c426bb5/847505b78eca9187?lnk=st&amp;q=marissa%20marchant&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en&amp;" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/fa.music.ecto/browse_thread/thread/5a1cc1e80c426bb5/847505b78eca9187?lnk=st&amp;q=marissa%20marchant&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en&amp;</a></p>

<p>To a few people Marissa or whatever her name is not known as a musician but known more for a 1000 dollar Cd. But to other people Marissa is known more for her music. I think the article is biased to people who want to control the thoughts and opinions of others on the net. It seems they are trying to sway the opinions of others to make Marissa into another hooker of music. They want to say Marissa is another person not known for music but known for a gimmick. This is false information. Marissa isn't a hooker, and isn't someone who isn't worth the money. I am or was Marissa Marchant. But my new name isn't going to be Mariesa Sabriel after I finish this Cd. ..or CDS. This is a waste of your space. It is also mean and nasty to confuse people who want to hear music with so many different names. I came up with a nicer name... I better change it now..before I establish myself a little more. It is intersting that the Britney Spears Wiki articles don't say that she is known more for her body then her music. It is intersting that all these other people who are much more into gimmicks are people with articles that talk about them as though they are really artists and musicians. You sound totally anti-talent, I mean whoever wants to keep an article that says that real artists are not and people posing as artists with gimmicks are really artists. That is what this Wikipedia article is implying. It is implying that the music industry is signing artists. Are the rosters filled up for people who are known for their art? Or other gimmicks? Wikipedia is implying that the music industry filled with Rappers and people swinging around a poll are known more as musicans and artists and that people who are unsigned couldn't possibly be real musicians? How stupid are the people at Wikipedia?</p>

<p>Why would they have to think and question whether a dishonest article about someone deserves a place on their board. Aren't they aware that the music industry isn't signing artists on purpose but people who put out thoughtless music and people who are not complex because the people who run the music industry are as simple-minded as their pricings. The people at Wikipedia should be questioning whether people swinging around polls and people who are known more for writing offensive lyrics then music should be on Wikipedia then giving attention to someone like myself. I think the people in the music industry right now are known as one hit wonders, swinging around polls, grabbing themselves, offensive lyrics, and for their million dollar manison then they are known for music. It is interesting that you are giving a multi-instrumentalist, and multi-faceted artist so much thought, but you don't give thought to advertising non-musicians and non-artists. I think the people in the music industry are not really that well known for their music at the moment. I mean at the present time in history.</p>

<p>??The main controversy about people like Britney Spears and Christina Agulera is not about their sexual nature and image. It is about their lack of talent, lack of orginality and lack of writing skills and lack of unique vocals. The controversy is not about being sexual, it is about using sexuality to disguise their lack of talent. On Britney Spears article it plainly is very dishonest. Should Wikipedia have dishonest articles written about non-artists? Is she a singer? It said that she is. I don't think of Britney as a singer, and I think of Christina Agulera as an amateur singer or semi-professional. They sound that way to me. All the others, such Jewel, and all the new rock bands, they sound amateurish as well. They sound like semi-professionals to my ears and to some intelligent people. Also, alot of boybands, and people like John Mayor sound like a semi-professional to my ears. What kind of gimmick did they use to promote John Mayor? They took a very large amount of extremely high quality photographs and focused on his image, not that much about his music. They hype these people and they aren't really known as musicians to people like myself. Dave Matthews' first guitarist told me that I was more of a guitarist then Dave is. His first guitarist is not playing for him anymore and told me that he didn't think that Dave Matthews was that talented. Most likely his guitarist has more talent then Dave. I don't think of Dave Matthews as a really polished, professional musician, or his band.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Content is not notable enough to have its own article; very few actually refer to a "tenth" crusade. The metaphor of crusades has been used by bin Laden and other extreme Islamists to describe US presence in the Middle East for a long time; it is not a rhetorical device invented by Bush as the article claims. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 18:13, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tag for cleanup and <b>Keep</b> - 1,250 google hits suggests notability. Plus, as C. Sloat says above, many Muslims do think that Bush is engaged in a crusade. To delete the page because 'we know that he isn't' is reverse political correctness. And with respect, the article does not say that Bush invented the device, only that he used it. If bin Laden was using the term first, the fact should be added to the article but it doesn't present an argument for deleting the page, quite the contrary. I agree that 10<sup>th</sup> is arbitrary, but the reason for the name is less important than the fact that the name is widely used. Perhaps the concept is misnamed, but it doesn't mean that the page is not correctly named or shouldn't exist.

<dd>Correction - many of those references are to Wikipedia; many others are to other uses of the phrase (e.g. the 1983 novel -- some 400+ hits on your results alone -- or the 2001 article about English in Tunisia). A lexis/nexis search of major papers finds three uses of the phrase, listed below, none of which are in the usage here:

</dd>
<dd>A search of magazines and journals nets nothing on lexis/nexis. You're looking at a few hundred google hits at best, most of them referring to or just copying the Cockburn and O'Brien articles; those are the only two real voices using this particular phrase in this manner; I would not call it notable, especially given its nonexistence in lexis/nexis, a better gauge of material that is actually published. If the article is kept, it should be radically revamped and its name changed to talk about the "crusades" metaphor as used in general rather than the specious "tenth" crusade, which, as others noted, this is not really the tenth anyway.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 03:34, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>For the hell of it, I searched the New York Times back to 1857 for this term and found three uses of it; twice in 1904 and once in 1917 referring to the actual Crusades, specifically the battle in Jerusalem.

<dd>"tenth crusade" bush is 404 hits. -cockburn is still 231 hits, not that I see why cockburn should be excluded. As above, I'm not attached to the title so much as the concept. "bush crusade" gets 37,400 hits. "bush crusade" iraq gets 31,300 hits. There's a real concept here, perhaps the current page is misnamed and a mess, but I think there's something worth keeping?

<dd>Well, I like it better than Bush Crusade, though that's not saying much. I'd prefer to somehow have "The crusade" rather than "The Crusades" because I think the whole War on Whatever is a single thing, even if the connections between the parts are pretty tenuous sometimes. We did for a while have a page called <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade_%28modern%29.html" title="Crusade (modern)">Crusade (modern)</a> which is now a redirect to <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenth_Crusade_8207.html" title="Tenth Crusade">Tenth Crusade</a>. If we wanted to go that way, I'd prefer Modern crusade. Other options which I also don't like but am going to suggest in case it gives anybody a better idea are Crusade against terror, Crusade against terrorism or War on terrorism as crusade?

<dd>I would strongly advise against this. Nobody's going to look for information on the Antichrist by searching for "The Beast (biography)". In the unlikely event that someone went to that string, they'd probably do so seeking info on the real-world book I described in the nom (which is the reason I put this up for deletion in the first place, to keep from storing these incoherent ramblings in the page history).

<li>Cruft does not justify more cruft. Thoise who want to know about the history of BB6 (God help them) can get it from the broadcasters, or from the article on BB6. We do <b>not</b> need articles for people whose verifiable information begins and ends with paticipation in a "reality" show. The number of BB participants who are still in the press a year after is tiny; those who are not become <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. What's the rush? We have absolutely no need to cover breaking stories, current events, blow-by-blow coverage or whatever.

Note, there was a guest voice credit on the Simpsons claimed, which I removed, due to lack of independent sources. It's mentioned on her web site, and I think it's probably true, but even if it was true, its too minor to make a difference unfortunately.

<li>I would disagree, as her web site indicates she's a recording artist, performer at various places (locally at least), and has a guest voice on a hit show. This all falls well below <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but the person warrants an AFD.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Kasic is engaged in the battle of campus minds that has been going on for years. This wiki elitism only helps prevent accurate documentation of the right wing conspiracy that has been assaulting academic freedom for 20 years. The $20 million that the extreme right is funnelling into campuses can't be accurately understood if not for documenting the key players, and Kasic has been in both roles as an undergraduate and now, after graduating, as part of Morton Blackwell's campus brownshirts. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.220.30.48 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.220.30.48.html" title="User talk:24.220.30.48">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.220.30.48_79d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.220.30.48">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't understand why an article that is as well-referenced as this one would be considered for deletion. If anything, I think the article should be expanded. I am a sociologist and have come across other articles on this and closely related subjects over the years. To delete an article like this one seems almost a racial act to me. Wikipedia needs more articles like this one on African art and culture, not fewer. There is also the possibility (from what I've gleaned elsewhere on this) that there are personal aspects to this VfD, based on an RfA. I don't know all the facts on this yet, but have it from a source I trust. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerenise_0272.html" title="User:Berenise">Berenise</a> 11:05, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps you didn't see the old version, the article is currently the result of my deleting the subjective content. I assure you this isnt a personal issue. This is the only article I've done with DCV. Also, if you look at the talk page, you can see in my first post that I clearly support the pages existence, and wanted it improved. It was only when I recognized that POV was the reason for the article's creation-- the essence of the content, that I put this on AfD. Also, if anyone else falsely thinks that this is a personal problem of mine, rather than the crappiness of the article, please understand that Wikipedia has a rule about primary sources. And this article doesn't follow it.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 15:27, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, ill answer this one by one:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Constant reverts aren't the grounds, they are just what makes it worse.</li>
<li>It violates the following sections of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought and Wikipedia is not a soapbox.</li>
<li>To claim it has primary sources would be in complete contradiction with the words of Deeceevoice herself(who put all of the content up), who said the following in her attack on the established "eurocentric policy" of primary sources:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In subject matter such as this which treat third-world cultural/anthropological matters, primary&#160;::sources often are not available. It is, in a way, saying no article treating San culture has&#160;::credibility unless we can find an authoritative text written by a Bushman. Ridiculously eurocentric and absurd. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACool_%28African_philosophy%29&amp;diff=32199597&amp;oldid=32195914" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACool_%28African_philosophy%29&amp;diff=32199597&amp;oldid=32195914" rel="nofollow">[60]</a></i></dd>

<li>The problem isn't lack of sources, its lack of <b>encyclopedic primary sources</b>. All of her sources are art interpretations. People can come to many conclusions when viewing art. If she were to approach this objectively, she would say that so and so believes this, unfortunately, she had to take a leave from wikipedia before this could be forced into the ridiculous article.</li>
<li>Coolness in african art has meaning, but the article has not a single encyclopedic paragraph. I defy you to find one paragraph written by her in this article which subscribes to wikipedia's guidelines.</li>

<dd>I'm still a bit confused by your insistence on primary sources here, as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> seems to say that secondary sources are fine for constructing articles. What's even more confusing to me is your insistence on "scientific" or "empirical" evidence; how do you see this coming about in an article on aesthetics? Generally the precedent in art/aestethics articles seems to be to cite the relevant critics (or "interpreters," if you prefer); so far as "scientists" exist in the field, this is them. Anyway, I don't understand how summarizing scholarly secondary sources in this case is any different than what I've seen in dozens of history articles. It's certainly not required that we agree with this (I for one don't) but I don't see the harm in saying that "scholar X and scholar Y advocate a philosophy of Z". That's how Wikipedia articles are built, right? --<a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 22:01, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is OK to base articles on secondary sources, but she presented the secondary source as a primary one. She actually said "Cool is feminine energy, cool is etc." You can't do that! Even if you do suggest a keep of this article can you please address the fact that that isn't allowed by wikipedia policy? Furthermore, before my mass deletion of the article's content, there weren't statements like "scholar X advocates this". heres an example of how she would say stuff before my edits:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Cool is feminine energy; it is stillness, calm and strength. Cool is composure, dignity in being and comportment and a practiced stoicism. It is a way of being, a way of walking in the world. Cool abides. Heat is masculine energy, strength and movement; it acts. Both elements assume co-equal values in African movement and dance, in African music and art. The cool aesthetic permeates traditional West African cultures and African-American culture, as well— in black artistic and musical expression, in the hitch in the "pimp" strut of urban, African American men; in African American dress and adornment, demeanor and speech.</i></dd>

<dd>Not only is that a misinterpretation of Thompson(I've exchanged emails about the article with the man himself), but even if it were a proper citing of his view, it would be presenting his interpretations as the gospel truth!

I did not add this page in the first place (ask yourselves, when was the game entry entered?), though I did improve the entry. However, the game is not a part of my recent edits. The game can stand on its own in Wikipedia, without any reference to Exponentialist theory.I think you are over-reacting.</p>
<p>Given that other boardgames are listed on Wikipedia, this feels more like being burned at the stake for heresy than a reasoned response. <a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacoutts_f55b.html" title="User:Dacoutts">Dacoutts</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: In retrospect, you are correct, the article is not linked with the objectionable set. I have removed the inappropriate cross-namespace link to your user page. I still think that the article smells of vanity and self-promotion, but I can quite easily find the game on Google, so it's not wholly unnotable. The links at the bottom especially smell of vanity, but I remove my delete vote and leave a <b>weak keep</b>. In the future, you might want to avoid contributing to articles so linked to yourself - it really is <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">vanity</a>, and many Wikipedians will react badly to that and indeed try to burn you at the stake. My apologies for painting all your contributions with the same brush. -- <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillnotelf_81b2.html" title="User:Stillnotelf"><font color="#668353">stillnotelf</font></a> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStillnotelf_80d6.html" title="User talk:Stillnotelf"><font color="#FF4487">has a talk page</font></a> 23:50, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Apology accepted, though I note that the 6 Billion entry is still marked for deletion. As far as I could tell there are no guidelines that preclude me correcting what was an inaccurate entry for my game. I reject the charge of vanity, but you're entitled to your own opinion.</p>
