<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-11_2987.html" title="Edit section: Nemesis Factor by Hasbro (1999)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nemesis Factor by Hasbro (1999)</span></h2>
<p>A hollow cube with three faces removed containing a pyramid of five colored buttons inside. Produced by <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbro.html" title="Hasbro">Hasbro</a> for release in fall 1998.</p>
<p>The game consists of 100 electronic puzzles where the object is to light up the colored buttons in order from bottom to top. Success leads to the next puzzle in the series, until you solve the final puzzle and the white trophy light on top turns on.</p>
<p>The majority of the puzzles are solved using logic to extrapolate future puzzles based on initial puzzles. The easiest puzzles are where the machine speaks and the player makes the correct response.</p>
<p>Analysis and logic are rewarded; puzzles provide key clues to the whole game structure. Some puzzles require players to experiment with buttons and explore their behavior; these puzzles are unlocked more by guessing than any insight into the game structure.</p>
<p>As the game progresses the puzzles introduce new elements. The game's hardware holds a few of surprises which are not immediately obvious.</p>
<p>Up to four games can be stored at once in a colored button, leaving the top, small, blue button open for players wanting to try a sample.</p>
<p>A score is tracked for each game, for a possible 1,000. Each puzzle starts at 10 points and goes down from there for each incorrect guess. A puzzle's current value resets between sessions, making it possible to figure out a puzzle's trick, shut the game down and return to collect the full ten points. There is no score penalty for taking the two hints offered with each puzzle but taking even <b>ONE</b> hint at <b>ANY</b> time prevents the trophy from lighting up after the 100th puzzle.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-11_2987.html" title="Edit section: author Billy McCarthy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">author Billy McCarthy</span></h2>
<p>Billy McCarthy was born on April 2, 1960 in Roseland, IL. His father Bill Sr. worked for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) as a supervisor and his mother Eleanor was a stay at home mom to his three sisters and one brother. In 1981, Billy split for Los Angeles after being recruited to join a Chicago pop band quartet called Kid Rocker who were up and coming on the Sunset Strip. Kid Rocker was managed by Kiss legendary manager Bill Aucoin and the band ultimately recorded a three-song demo produced by legendary producer, Eddie Kramer of Jimmy Hendrix, Peter Frampton and Led Zeppelin fame. An unknown guitarist at the time CC Deville (later the guitarist of Poison) who had just arrived from New Jersey to L.A pleaded for weeks for an audition in Kid Rocker, but upon being invited into the group the bands leader and songwriter, Jimmy Vayne fired Deville after two rehearsals. Thus, McCarthy and Deville quickly formed Screamin' Mimi's and it was here in Deville's home that Poison's hit single "Talk Dirty to Me" was born though stories from both parties are conflicting. McCarthy came up short in LA after four years and returned to Chicago to form D'Molls with another former Kid Rocker guitarist, Duane Dunn, a.k.a Desi Rexx who was now D'Molls lead singer. The band rehearsed for a year before sellling out its first show in Chicago at the Limelight to over 1,600 people. The following week D'Molls split for L.A. where Atlantic Records offered them a record deal just days after unpacking their bags. D'molls sold well in the states and better in the UK and gained the highest respect from music critics world-wide who taunted them "the next Aeorosmith" but personal tensions within the band lead to a short-lived career and D'Molls finally disbanded in 1991. From there, McCarthy, (p.k.a. Billy Dior) went on to produce solo artist for various record companies and pioneered the first radio program in 1994 that featured unsigned musicians nationwide on "The National A&amp;R Radio Report" which aired on the respectable KIEV in Los Angeles. Soon after, McCarthy left L.A. for New York to produce and develop solo musician Brian Roy, a.k.a. Brian Taylor who was the son of "no respect comic" Rodney Dangerfield. McCarthy trumped Taylor to everyone as "a genuis, as gifted as Bob Dylan" but Taylor had stage fright and the project was stumped after a three year stint together in Austin Texas. In 1999, McCarthy was broke and returned to Chicago where he supported his widowed mother by working at a hotel and began his first novel, "The Devil of Shakespeare." The book was finally published in 2004 by Benbella books and is the first in literary history to include a single to the novel written by an author, featuring guest performances by recording artists from Warrant, Styx, E'Nuff Z'nuff &amp; 20/20. The Devil of Shakespeare was a best-seller in Chicago and was released by Benbella in hardcover only. Future books in the works for Billy McCarthy are "Beat Me Til I'm Famous" (non-fiction) and Funnyman Jack Smack. He is currently married to his wife Maggie and living in Chicago.</p>

<p>Ebrahim Hamedi, better known as <b>Ebi</b>, is one of the most famous Iranian pob singers. Born in 1949, Tehran, Iran, he began singing from age of 16 when he perfomed in the band "Sun Boys". His first song was titled "Atash (thirst)" for a film with the same title directed by Iraj Ghaderi. He came to fame with his song "<i>shab</i> (night)" in the Fereydoon Farokhzad's TV proram "Mikhak Noghreyi". He's been working closely with Iraj Jannati Ataii (song writer) since then. After the Islamic revolution in 1977, he -like many other pop singers- went to exile in US and then Sweden. He's currently living in Sweden with his second wife, Mahshid. He frequently holds concerts in USA (available through ticketmaster), Europe, Middle East, and Australia/New Zealand.</p>

<p>There are several character orientations that help each one of us deal with issues concerning adaptation to social demands. One specific character is he hoarding type. This type seems to always be hoarding everything and anything they can in order to conserve as much as possible. Fromm describes these hoarding types as "tight" in every aspect of life. Some examples would be tight lipped, tight eyed, constipated cramped and ulcered. They are very close minded to the outside world and cautious of what they themselves release to it. It is very closely linked with Freud's anal type.</p>

<p>Charnley made two unsuccessful world title challenges against his arch-rival Joe 'Old Bones' Brown. He was stopped on a cut eye in Houston, Texas, in 1959 and was narrowly out-pointed in a controversial 15 round bout in London on 18 April 1961. According to <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_Magazine_7546.html" title="Ring Magazine">Ring Magazine</a> it was "Fight of the Year." Many say Charnley should have won the decision. Dave eventually defeated <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Brown_5b53.html" title="Joe Brown">Joe Brown</a> in six rounds in a non-title fight in Manchester on 25 February 1963.</p>

<p>Before he became a boxer, Charnley worked in the pits as a boilermaker, which may help explain his powerful build. He had large forearms and was often compared to the "Toy Bulldog" <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Walker_bb68.html" title="Mickey Walker">Mickey Walker</a>.</p>
<p>Charnley also had good tools. He had double and triple hooks and was a true scrapper with plenty of bottle. His trademark was an aggressive attacking style. Inside the ring he was a furious brawler who gave and took brutal punishment. He fought everyone, even much heavier men and held his own.</p>
<p>Only <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Brown_%28boxer%29_334b.html" title="Joe Brown (boxer)">Joe Brown</a> stopped him on cuts and until his last fight only welterweight great Emile Griffiths stopped him from going the distance. Charnley ended his career fighting welterweights and was a real tough opponent for anyone.</p>
<p>Dave Charnley was a strong hard-hitting lightweight boxer with good power, definitely one of those classic British fighters who should be appreciated more. He was one tough Englishman.</p>

<p>Funded by Prince Albert’s Royal Patriotic Fund, the building was intended for the ‘Education and Training of three hundred Orphan Daughters of Soldiers, Seamen and Marines who perished in the Russian War, and for those who hereafter may require like succour’ . Originally named as the Royal Victoria Patriotic Asylum, the building was designed by Major Rhode Hawkins in a heroically ornate Gothic style. The foundation stone was laid by Queen Victoria on 11th July 1857 and the first phase was completed in 1858 to an almost entirely symmetrical plan form. The result was judged to be ‘bold, picturesque and effective’ by The Building News (October 8th,1858) . The first inmates were received on 1st July 1859.</p>
<p>Construction work was extremely rapid, taking only 18 months to complete. This was a result of many innovative features, including the use of iron filler joist floors of standard span, cast iron windows and stone dressings, roof trusses and decorative leadwork, all pre-fabricated off-site.</p>
<p>The Royal Victoria Patriotic Fund had raised the then colossal sum of £1.5 million. No expense was spared in the intricacy of the design and the quality of construction. However, the building cost was only £35,000, the builder being Mr George Myers of Belvedere Road , Lambeth. The symmetrical plan was altered to an asymmetrical Palladian layout by the addition of the dining hall (now used as a theatre), an annexe linked to the main building by a cloister, an infirmary to the south of the building and a chapel to the north. At the same time, an orphanage for boys was also built, this time in the Classical style, and is now used by Emanuel School.</p>
<p>Several small ancillary buildings also sprang up. These included a swimming pool and various small single storey buildings, including a greenhouse. Some of the buildings may have been used in connection with the market garden, which was tended by the orphans.</p>
<p>Life for the orphans was extremely harsh. Their work included pumping water by hand from an underground rainwater system in the rear courtyard up to the lead-lined slate water tanks in the towers. They had to launder all the clothes. Their heads were shaved to discourage head lice and they were made to assemble in the courtyards every morning to be hosed down with cold water. The patented warm air heating system failed to work. Fireplaces were added to the staff rooms but no heating was provided to the dormitories. The orphanage was nearly closed down after a scandal involving physical and sexual abuse by the Rector and the death of one of the orphans. Her ghost still allegedly roams the cloisters of the north and south courtyards.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-11_2987.html" title="Edit section: 20th Century">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">20th Century</span></h3>
<p>By the First World War the building had been renovated, its roof trusses strengthened, the Welsh slates replaced with Westmoreland, and the brickwork repointed in black mortar. A new heating system was installed and the building had become the South Western General Hospital. In the First World War a temporary railway station was built in front of the building and thousands of wounded troops were treated there. The field behind the building, now the cricket pitch, was filled with marquees full of wounded soldiers – approximately 1800 patients at any one time.After the war the school, still for girls only, reopened until the pupils were evacuated to Wales in 1939.</p>
<p>During the Second World War, the building became the London Reception Centre, a polite name for an alien clearing station run by MI6,under the direction of Colonel Pinto . It was rumoured that suspected spies were incarcerated for years, both in the building and in windowless concrete cells constructed in the south courtyard.</p>
<p>After the war the building was used as a Teachers Training College and then in 1952 purchased by the London County Council for £67,500 for initially Honeywell Secondary Mixed School and then Spencer Park Comprehensive School for Boys. Subsequently the iron filler joist floor in many areas of the building weakened when the timber battens supporting the weak concrete infill began to give way. The school was forced out of the unsafe areas and eventually moved out to occupy the new LCC-designed school in the 1970’s. The Royal Victoria building, still the responsibility of the ILEA but with no budget for maintenance, fell into serious disrepair. Almost every one of the thousands of window panes were smashed and the building became home to thousands of pigeons. Vandals stole the lead finials, the ridges and valleys of the roofs, and lead sheet from the flat roofs and from the water tanks in the towers. Dry rot spread through the water-damaged floors, causing more of the fill to fall out and destroying the timber floors and the doorframes. Much of the roof structure was also damaged. It had been suggested that the building be pulled down to open up a vista for the flats of the Fitzhugh Estate. However after pressure from the Victorian Society and the Wandsworth Society, the building was listed Grade II and could therefore not be demolished in spite of its derelict condition. Thus it became something of a liability to ILEA – too big to mend and too important to demolish.</p>
<p>The building was offered for sale by the GLC in 1980. Several offers were received but all except one was subject to the cost of repair. Surveyors for Wandsworth Council estimated the cost of restoration to be approximately £4 million and advised that the best economic use would be as a bird sanctuary. Eventually a lease was granted to Tuberg Property Company Ltd ( now South of the Border Holdings Ltd) with the right to acquire the freehold for £1 subject to the performance of a schedule of repair and restoration works..</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-11_2987.html" title="Edit section: Restoration &amp; Use">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Restoration &amp; Use</span></h3>
<p>Works of restoration and conversion were carried out in stages over a six-year period. A few days before the GLC handed over ownership, arsonists set light to the main hall, completely destroying the highly decorated hammer beam ceiling. By pure chance, a complete photographic survey of the hall had been carried out only two weeks before, and so the restoration was accurate to the last detail, including several errors in the original artwork. A Civic Trust commendation was awarded in 1985 for the restoration works for the Hall 1 ceiling. Another Civic Trust commendation was awarded for the restoration of the whole building in 1987 as was the Europa Nostra Order of Merit.</p>
<p>The brief to the architects , Dickinson, Quarme and Associates was first to stabilise and repair the building to prevent any further decay, and secondly to convert the building into economic use while complying with the local authority’s planning briefs and the restrictions imposed by a listed building. It was to be a mixed use development – providing studios and workshops to designers, artists and craftsmen together with residential spaces. The solution to the use of the two large halls was provided by ALRA who occupied these and other spaces for their drama school.</p>
<p>In addition to the halls the building now provides - 27 flats, 20 studios, 15 workshops and 1 bar &amp; restaurant together with 2 large office units in the Chapel. While the profile of residents has changed over the years, probably due to ever increasing flat prices in London, the intended mix of designers, artists, craftsmen, architects, and of course the drama school has remained amongst the commercial users. Changes planned for the future include the creation of a new access to John Archer Way and the provision of a new building in the style of the existing, at the rear of the site to provide additional purpose built studios for the drama school and two more apartments.</p>

<p>JOCK MAHONEY 1919-1989</p>
<p>Stuntman, TV’s Range Rider and Yancy Derringer, the movies’ thirteenth Tarzan, this six foot four actor was born in Chicago, Illinois. Intending to become a doctor, Jocko attended the University of Iowa, excelling in swimming, basketball and football. In World War II he earned the rank of flight instructor in the Marine Corps. After the war, Jock Mahoney became one of the top stuntmen in Hollywood, doing the tough stuff for stars such as, Gregory Peck, Errol Flynn, John Wayne, and Randolph Scott. In the 1949 film The Adventures of Don Juan, it was Jocko, not Errol Flynn, who made the dangerous leap off a descending staircase. Jock could perform a flat-footed leap over the small of the back of a horse.</p>
<p><br />
Actor Charles Starrett, who starred in a series of Durango Kid westerns for Columbia studios in the 40s and 50s, was doubled by Jocko for stunts, and commented: “Jocko was just beautiful. He was like a cat.” This led to Mahoney being given parts in many of the Durango Kid westerns, such as: Roaring Rangers (1946); The Stranger from Ponca City (1947); Blazing Across the Pecos (1948); Bandits of El Dorado (1949); Texas Dynamo (1950). Soon he was also acting in other films, making, among many westerns, five Three Stooges comedies between 1947 and 1956. He branched into TV, becoming legendary for his feats and inventiveness. In 1951 Gene Autry hired Jocko for the starring role in his TV series, The Range Rider. He married actor Margaret Field, and became the stepfather of Sally Field, who later became a great actor in films, herself.</p>
<p>Some of Mahoney’s more popular movies of this 50s period are: I’ve Lived Before (1956); A Day of Fury (1956); Showdown at Abilene (1956); the off-beat Joe Dakota (1957); The Land Unknown (1957); Slim Carter (1957); Last of the Fast Guns (1958); Three Blondes in His Life (1960). In 1958 Jock also starred in another TV show, Yancy Derringer. 1960 began Jock’s relationship with the legendary Tarzan character. He was hired to play the main villain, Coy Banton, in Tarzan the Magnificent. Considered the best Tarzan movie by many critics and fans, this fast paced, no nonsense film included John Carradine in the cast, portraying Mahoney’s father, Able Banton. Big John and Jocko are terrific in their roles, probably the best in Mahoney’s career, and his Coy stands out as one of the great villains of film history.</p>
<p>When Gordon Scott left the role of the Ape-Man, Jocko stepped in for the next movie, Tarzan Goes to India (1962). The oldest man to play the role, and doing his own stunts, Jocko made another Tarzan feature, Tarzan’s Three Challenges (1963). While filming in Thailand, Mahoney contracted dengue fever, dysentery and pneumonia, losing 35 pounds. He continued the strenuous shooting schedule, stunts and all, at 175 pounds, down from his usual 220. It took about a year and a half for him to regain his weight. He later guest-starred in episodes of the ‘60s TV series starring Ron Ely. Jocko stayed active in films and TV, as a stunt advisor and coordinator, training horses and writing poetry. The Burt Reynolds film, Hooper (1978), is homage to Jock Mahoney and his stuntman-actor career, with Brian Keith playing ‘Jocko Doyle.’</p>

<p>Ring Record Career Span 1954-1964 Total Bouts 61 Wins 48 Knockouts 27 Draws 1 Losses 12</p>
<p>Dave Charnley was a real tough, strong lightweight boxer with good power. He won bronze in Canada and went on to become one of the all-time great lightweight champions in British history.</p>
<p>Known as “The Dartford Destroyer" he was European, Commonwealth and British lightweight champion from 1957 to 1965. Born in Dartford, Kent, on 10 October 1935, he made two unsuccessful world title challenges against Joe 'Old Bones' Brown - stopped on a cut eye in Houston, Texas, in 1959, and narrowly out-pointed in the controversial 15 round “Fight of the Year” in London on 18 April 1961. Many say this was one of the greatest fights of all time. Some say that Charnley was unlucky not to get the verdict.</p>
<p>Stocky southpaw Dave eventually stopped the veteran American Joe Brown in six rounds in a non-title fight at Manchester on February 25 1963.</p>
<p>He fought most of the top men of his day won most, lost some. Only Joe brown stopped him on cuts, and until his last fight only welterweight great Emile Griffiths stopped him in 10 rounds. He ended his career fighting welterweights and was real tough proposition for anyone.</p>
<p>Dave Charnley was arguably Britain’s greatest lightweight boxer after WWII, although many would probably pick Ken Buchannan. Unfortunately, Charnley has become a bit of a forgotten man. He definitely doesn't get his due. He had good tools - double and triple hooks and was a true scrapper, with plenty of bottle. His trademark was an aggressive attacking style. Inside the ring he was a furious brawler who gave and took brutal punishment. He fought everyone, even much heavier men and held his own.</p>
<p>Before he became a boxer, Charnley worked in the pits as a boilermaker, which may help explain his powerful build. He had large forearms and was often compared to the "Toy Bulldog" Mickey Walker. After his retirement from the ring Dave took a different direction in his life and opened and operated hair salons which were quite profitable for him.</p>
<p>Dave Charnley was one tough Englishman, definitely one of those fighters who should be appreciated more.</p>

Soapy The Chicken, also known as Jesus of Nazareth, is the central figure of Christianity. He is commonly referred to as Jesus Christ, where "Christ" is a Greek-derived title meaning "Anointed One" which corresponds to the Hebrew-derived "Messiah".</p>
<p>The main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Most scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that Jesus was a Jewish teacher from Galilee, who was regarded as a healer, was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified in Jerusalem on orders of the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate under the accusation of sedition against the Roman Empire.[2] A small minority of scholars, based on their analysis and dating of the relevant biblical and extra-biblical sources, question the historical existence of Jesus.[3]</p>
<p>Christian views of Jesus, though diverse and complex, center on the belief in Jesus as the Messiah or Christ promised in the Old Testament and in his resurrection after his crucifixion. Most Christians believe in Jesus as the Son of God sent to provide salvation and reconciliation with God by atoning for the sins of humanity. Most Christians are Trinitarian and believe that Jesus is God incarnate, while Nontrinitarian Christians adopt various other interpretations regarding the divinity of Jesus. The area of study concerning these issues is known as Christology. Other beliefs shared by most Christians include his Virgin Birth, his ascension into Heaven and his future Second Coming. Most Christians also believe that Jesus performed miracles and fulfilled biblical prophecy.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-11_2987.html" title="Edit section: Transverse Flow Effect">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Transverse Flow Effect</span></h2>
<p>Transverse flow effect is an aerodynamic effect encountered when the helicopter moves (typically forward) through the air.</p>
<p>In a hover, the air above the rotor disk is being pulled down from above and is equally distributed around the rotor disk. The air is descending from above, which has the effect of reducing angle of attack.</p>
<p>As the helicopter starts moving into undisturbed air, a portion of the disk is in clean, unaccelerated air, while the remaining portion of the rotor disk is still working on descending air. The part of the disk working on clean air therefore sees a higher angle of attack than the portion of the disk which is working on descending air. This causes a difference in lift between the section in clean air and the section in descending air. The result is that the portion in clean air develops more lift, and the disk tilts as a result. Which way the disk tilts depends on a couple factors:</p>
<p>Gyroscopic precession will cause the extra lift to be seen approximately 90 degrees later in rotor rotation, so the pilot will experience either a right or left roll, depending upon whether the rotor of the helicopter rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise. Typically, an American helicopter would roll to the right during the takeoff roll, while a French or Russian helicopter would roll to the left.</p>
<p>Which way the helicopter rotor disk is moving in the wind will determine which part of the disk has higher lift. For instance, hovering sideways, or hovering stationary in a crosswind, the clean portion of the disk might be on the left or right, rather than the front of the rotor disk. Again, depending on which direction the rotor rotates, this might be seen as a nose pitch up or nose pitch down, a roll, or something in between.</p>
<p>As the helicopter accelerates into a higher airspeed, more and more of the rotor disk will be in clean air and the lift differential will decrease. At some higher airspeed the effect will disappear. In a typical single rotor helicopter, the effect can be felt to start at around 5-10 knots, increases in magnitude to a maximum around 20 knots, and decreases above that until it is almost completely gone by 40-60 knots of airspeed.</p>

<p><i>Maw</i> is a term invented by Dianne Campbell. The term <i>Maw</i> can be used in many instances, for example, if someone is not talking very much, you say <i>Maw</i>? It can also be used in other social situations, such as in a shop. Scenario: You are in a clothes shop and you ask the shop assistant <i>excuse me, do you have this piece of clothing</i>?, if the assistance answers <i>no</i>, you reply with <i>maw?</i> This shows that you are taking on the assist but are disheartened with the fact that that particular piece of clothing is not currently in stock. Dianne Campbell has also invented a plethera of slangs, however <i>Maw</i> seems to be the most widely used.</p>

Allan E. Cassis is an international fashion model and designer. Recently, Allan has attempted to make forays into the music industry, but his efforts have been met with only moderate success. His debut album, SEXYPIMPTIME, was released to a packed room in Schapiro Hall at Columbia University early in the fall of 2006.</p>
<p>SEXYPIMPTIME controversy:</p>
<p>Reviewers of SEXYPIMP differed in their interpretations of Allan’s music:</p>
<p>One such reviewer, Jeremiah Brownburn, a noted cultural critic, lamented: “This is quite possibly the worst thing I’ve ever heard. Is he even speaking English? One finishes SEXYPIMPTIME questioning not only Mr. Cassis’s musical abilities, but also his membership in the human race. Some of the noises he creates—unassisted by studio affects—resemble more the grunts of a constipated bear than anything musical. Absolutely terrible.”</p>
<p>Some of Allan’s fans, most notable Allan himself, defended the erstwhile fashion tycoon:</p>
<p>“I’m a pimp. I look at you [I see a] horrible guy. I look at me [and I see] sexy guy.”</p>
<p>Charitable work A friend to the deaf and blind, Mr. Cassis has often been seen around New York City escorting disabled women to public restrooms. As a Mexican émigré, Allan Cassis has also been a staunch proponent of illegal immigrants trying to gain citizenship rights. While there has been some dispute over the legality of Cassis’ entrance into this country, it is most widely believed that he did in fact enter the country legally with his family sometime in the late 1980s, riding on the back of a legendary burro named Galen. Despite the unexpected success of his fashion lines, Allan has remained humble about his roots, refusing to learn to read or write English or speak it properly. He has refused to be interviewed about his immigration status, quipping only that, “I am a child of the world. Women everywhere love me. I’m a PIMP.”</p>

<i><b>Roses Are Red</b></i> was <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Vinton_8eba.html" title="Bobby Vinton">Bobby Vinton</a>'s third studio album, released in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962_in_music.html" title="1962 in music">1962</a>. After Vinton's hit "Roses Are Red (My Love)" reached <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_Hot_100_a584.html" title="Billboard Hot 100">#1</a> (and saved Vinton from being fired from <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_Records_6e4e.html" title="Epic Records">Epic</a>), the eponymous album was released and made its way up to #5 on the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_Hot_200_bbea.html" title="Billboard Hot 200">Billboard Hot 200</a>.</p>
<p>"Roses Are Red (My Love)" is the first track on the album. Cover versions include <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Orbison_f3fc.html" title="Roy Orbison">Roy Orbison</a>'s hit "Crying," <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cole_Porter_269e.html" title="Cole Porter">Cole Porter</a>'s "True Love," and four country ballads ("I Fall to Pieces," "I Can't Stop Loving You," "I Can't Help It," and "Please Help Me, I'm Falling"). Interestingly enough, this album reveals that Vinton's hit "Mr. Lonely" (co-written by Vinton himself) was originally only an album track; its release as a single was not until two years later.</p>

<p>The voyd are a death metal band starring lead yeller Steven Hollis a loner who has tried to take his own life a record 123 times failed on each attempt. The Lead Guitar for the voyd is Josh Moses the most normal of the group despite being a mop head he's mostly O.K. Next is the Bass player Joe Elliot by far the least talented JOe takes it all a little too seriously and his obbsession for guitars cannot be healthy. The final member of the insturmental side of the voyd is alex carrie the drummer thinks he's great he isn't to put it simply. Thats all of the musicians but there are other members of the voyd. Ashley tecky and all round sweaty giant Heidi groupie/roadie part time singer never realy used and finally there is Rhinanon the illusive backstager who is only there for alex's eyes to gaze at and that completes the voyd. Don't buy the albumn it isn't out and they are rubbish</p>

<p>The Modern movement of Katy James has been a slow but fast growing one it has seen alot of turbluent times. In the later 1980's this free radical way of thinking was frowned upon, until the later 1990 at such a time it became widely known and more freely accpeted. Rebecca Oblein born in Lewsisham a current ghetto, found Katy at the tender age of 10, there un-conventional and un-stylisitc dress sense has been condemed by the conventional and more normal school of thinkers, for example the marxists and the frankfurt school. There relationship blossomed, however they were black sheep amoungst white, Katy in both sense with her caucasian asain approach to life. her urban style of thinking was exsaerbated when she began to create a safe house for ethnic minorities to sleep and live. however unfortunately the safe house went under during lack of funding. Rebecca at the young age of just 18, to help her friend went into prostution to try and help fund the safe house. Her effort were only to be down trodden in vain after falling pregnant aged 19. she decide to keep the baby which later turned out to be twin afro caribean children.</p>

<p><b>The Magic House</b> is a not-for-profit participatory museum that provides hands-on learning experiences for children and families that encourage participation, experimentation, creativity and the development of problem-solving skills within a place of beauty, wonder, joy and magic.</p>
<p>Recently voted the #1 national attraction for child appeal by Zagat U.S. Family Guide, <b>The Magic House</b> is the only place you can explore four levels of hands-on exhibits that allow you to touch and electronically charged ball and make your hair stand on end, make a splash in a water playground, announce a newscast, catch fish in an indoor pond and much more.</p>

<p>Located in the historic George Lane Edwards home in the demographic center of the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_bb74.html" title="St. Louis">St. Louis</a> metropolitan area, the <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a> building has been creatively renovated and expanded to provide four fully accessible floors of innovative learning spaces that are unique in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_bb74.html" title="St. Louis">St. Louis</a>. Originally designed to accommodate 30,000 visitors each year, the museum welcomed 165,000 guests during its first year of operation. Since the museum first opened its doors in October <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, The Magic House has sparked the imaginations and touched the lives of more than 7 million visitors.</p>
<p>Like the children it serves, The Magic House is perpetually growing and changing. The museum has undergone four separate expansion projects, including a major growth spurt in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, which increased its size with a Children’s Village, Math Path, Fitness Center and Education Wing.

<p><b>Five Friends from Japan – February 3 to May 20, 2007</b> <i>Visit Japan without a passport! This 1,800 square-foot exhibit invites students to experience contemporary Asian life through the eyes of five Japanese children. Museum-goers can visit Aisa’s kitchen to learn about Japanese cuisine and traditional festivals; explore Yusuke’s yard to practice aikido moves and learn about Japanese garden design; dress up in Japanese attire in Sakiko’s bedroom and check out her collection of Japanese manga, or comics; relax in Ken’s tatami room while trying out futon bedding and experimenting with calligraphy; and discover Shoko’s living room, where visitors get the opportunity to listen to and even create different types of Japanese music. <b>Five Friends from Japan</b> highlights the similarities and differences between young people in Japan and the Unites States, and provides an authentic look at current Asian lifestyles, which children will discover are not so different from their own.</i></p>

<p>This animal is new. The information about it has just been released. I have been working with it for about 12 years now. It is very hard to understand. In this article i will tell you about my jouneys with this wild animal. It is my journal.</p>
<p>Day 1, January 10, 1994 I have been kicked out of my home by this wretched animal. This new place in which i dwell is very unique. It is taking me a while to get used to the light. It is very bright. This woman in front of me must be my mother. The beast is coming. It squeels like a suffering human. It is the most horrible noise ever.</p>
<p>Day 698, I have discovered a language to speak outloud. now people can see how i feel about this beast that i have been living with for 2 years now. my mother is coming in. i must stop now.</p>
<p>Day 3650, i have been living with this beast for quite a while now. i have lost track. of time. over the years i have learned to understand this creature. behind the hideous outside. on the inside there is some kindness. that only happens when i have something that he wants. this has been a great journey. he gets very angry easily. he will start screaming a language that is unknown to me.</p>
<p>Day 7030,</p>
<p>i am now 12 years old. in 6 more years i will get to move away from him. it will end my journey with this beast. it has been insperational. it has shown me the way of life. what not to do.</p>
<p>That has been my journey with the beast.</p>

<p>In October, 2006, FOX Television affiliates across the United States began launching a unified series of websites for each station, dubbed MyFox____.com (fill in the blank with the station's location, such as MyFoxLA.com) which can be easily found on google: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=on&amp;q=myfox+-myfox.com+-myfox.tv+-myfox.org&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=on&amp;q=myfox+-myfox.com+-myfox.tv+-myfox.org&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>This is likely due to the recent acquisition of remaining UPN/WB stations who did not take the CW brand, dubbed MyNetworkTV, which is owned by FOX.</p>
<p>It is not clear yet whether or not the FOX network plans on renaming its stations from FOX to MyFOX, but it would certainly seem that they are moving in that direction.</p>
<p>(I'm too lazy to list all the sites, so anyone is welcome to do so, and format it neatly etc etc.) see the following for a list of FOX affiliates: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FOX_affiliates" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FOX_affiliates" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

Open once a year, the garden gets so many spectators that the roads get blocked up. The garden is devoted to the discoveries of our time: DNA, black holes and the history of the universe. It culminates in the Universe Cascade where each step represents a moment in time.</p>

<p><b>Snail Mound</b></p>
<p>Like DNA or a ziggurat, snail mound is a double helix path where two can pass without ever meeting.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>The Six Senses</b></p>
<p><br />
<i>Sense of Touch</i></p>
<p>The structre of DNA is presented with oak and steel. The DNA helices spiral around an aluminum hand waving in the breeze.</p>
<p><i>Sense of Smell</i></p>
<p>Four kinds of thyme cover this area, in the center an upside-down double nose that looks like a female torso. It is a pun of "Double Thyme," or "A Nose by Any Other Name would Smell as Sweet."</p>
<p><i>Sense of Taste</i></p>
<p>An aluminum mouth sits in a bed of strawberries, twists again represent DNA.</p>
<p><i>Sense of Hearing</i></p>
<p>Parabolic reflectors face each other, exchanging sound. One can whisper across the garden to another. Wind chimes go off wth the wind.</p>
<p><i>Sense of Sight</i></p>
<p>Like an optical illusion, one enters a womb-like space with undulating folds. It is a playful point in the garden where the visitor learns more and more about what he is actually seeing.</p>
<p><i>Sense of Intuition</i></p>
<p>A sculptural form of a woman bounces in the wind, a reflection of Keswick's description of intuition.</p>
