Author is not published in the traditional sense; his books are available only via a print-on-demand publisher, and there is no verification that he meets the minimum audience standards for author notability. The Asimov award sounds notable, but it's given only to college students who have never published professionally. In fact, it's not clear that he's ever been published professionally -- his almost-prize-winning mystery novel seems to have been turned down by the publisher that sponsored the prize. (His magazine appearances seem to be mostly in semi-professional magazines.)

<dd>If you look at the discussion of academics, it's suggested that publication in academic journals, and I think so-called small magazines are similar, is NOT evidence of notability, because of the publish or perish neccesity <i>mutatis mutandis</i> publishing in small magazines is important for "being a real writer" and getting the creative-writing equivalents of professorships (sometimes actually professorships). So more than just the publication in journals, the argument is that professors should be more than the average professor and not just published in a,b,c.--<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_J._Howard_705c.html" title="User:Samuel J.

<p>He produced a new justification for each time he reverted it.

<li><s><b>Keep</b>.</s> At this point, I see nothing left in the entry that is questionable, and his short fiction publications meet the eligibility criteria regardless of whether or not his novels are self-published.

<dd>Unfortunately for me, I am actually a real user, not Mr. Cochran. I'm obviously not very good at this. I've followed this discussion for awhile (and the discussion on NaNoWriMo in Nov. 2004 because my students sometimes participate in it). The constant NaNoWriMo references seem to violate NPOV, and the article with the bare facts simply didn't seem inappropriate anymore. And AvB, thanks for the link. I'm learning the rules as quickly as I can, but there's a big learning curve. I'll keep my comments to a minimum. --Susan,<a href="../../../j/l/g/User%7EJlgssk_1b9e.html" title="User:Jlgssk">jlgssk</a> 17:35, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry, I am new. I live by tally hall. Yes, TH is a fairly unknown indie band from Michigan, but if you went to Albinoblacksheep.com, you'd see the most viewed video files: Directions, Banana man. He edited those. He has also won awards for songwriting. It's not vanity if submitted by someone else. Why delete it?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm local to this band, so I may be misjudging their notability (though I've never seen them) but they seems to be rapidly growing in popularity, with a CD released, touring outside the midwest, etc. I would argue that Hawley and the band are both on the lower end of notability. As for albinoblacksheep.com, I really don't think there's much question of its notability, despite <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a>'s annoying attitude.

<p>As far as I am aware, there is no Nickelodeon Show, so this is a list of characters who appear in several different programs on the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickelodeon_%28TV_channel%29_ac4d.html" title="Nickelodeon (TV channel)">Nickelodeon (TV channel)</a>.

<li><b>Categorize</b>. The whole point of this thing is to have a list of all the characters without the need to go through 20+ articles by hand. It's not an indiscriminate list, they're related by the TV channel. Still, I don't see how this list could have any info other than what would be in a category.

<p>I dunno. For most other series, sure. But the random references have always been a big part of Family Guy's humor. I don't see it as being any that much less important than a listing of the characters. That said, there's generally an area for the references made in the induvidal episode entries. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESAMAS_7b35.html" title="User:SAMAS">SAMAS</a></p>

<li>Could you expand on "unmanageable"? I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 22:08, 12 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would tend to think "unmanageable" means that nothing can prepare a reasonable number of editors for the incredibly ridiculous amount of crap that will inevitably pour into the article. Runaway list syndrome. This can be applied differently to different situations. But in this instance, we're dealing with contributions that will be highly subjective and unverifiable. -- <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">Krash</a> 06:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think I agree with that. While this list is young, it is small and tightly-controlled at the moment. It's also a fairly finite list - I can't see it growing too much more than it is - it's not as if there are thousands of cartoons and movies which each have their own Burger King spoof. The entries are also very easy to veify, as they come from pop culture. One can simply check the primary source (offhand, I recognize about half the entries on this list) or visit the articles for the cartoon/movie. Even external refs should be pretty easy. I'll even go add a couple right now to demonstrate my willingness to maintain and verify.&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 14:18, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're not going to change my mind because I think, apart from my aforementioned sentiments, it's a silly thing to make a list of. Back to subjectivity. Many McBurgerKings in movies/TV are parodies of the all-american-burger-joint-fast-food-mentality where it's hard to say whether they're referencing a specific place or just making up a place so as not to get sued. Also many of the links provided don't provide any proof that the said parody is actually based on the restaurant which is claimed. -- <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">Krash</a> 19:42, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

If you or I were to create a neoglism (or whatever it's called), no one would care. This doctor doesn't deserve his own article any more than any doctor you could find in the yellow pages. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Jackson_a578.html" title="User:Captain Jackson">Captain Jackson</a> 05:09, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If he were to get IAD into DSM-V as a recognized mental disorder, that IMHO <i>would</i> make him encyclopedic... but that hasn't happened yet, so I agree with you.</dd>

It is to be the subject of at least one radio show (real life not purely internet) and an article for The Inquire.

My comment about AFD was just meant to mean that the fact that this article is badly named is not a good reason to stop (or make difficult) a future better named article from being created.

<li>So apparently the criterion for whether an article should be deleted or not is whether you've heard of the parties involved? If you really haven't heard of forums like Newgrounds or 4chan, that just means that you don't really know enough about this subject to judge whether it's notable. Your comments regarding "crappy links" pretty clearly betray your own bias against the subject matter, so I wonder why you care about this article in the first place. Also, Elfwood is right about the name. I didn't make it up, I just saw that other people have been using it.

<li><b>Keep</b> I know that to some people this may seem boring and stupid, but, as an educated man (I'm not some emo teenager) this is worth noting. If wikipedia can have a page for the movie spaceballs (good movie by the way) it can have an article over a MAJOR INTERNET EVENT. I don't think you guys understand that thousands of people were a part of this. This is the "first ever grand scale" massive strike against a website. Whether you agree or disagree with the attack, that is irrelevant. It is your duty as a provider of information to not exclude something because it is not "pretty" to look at. Life is not always pretty. We cannot plead ignorance to events which do happen. This is real life stuff, and as long as we stick to posting the facts, which will fully come to light given time, these articles are of real merit. --The mk 555 06:06, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaceballs.html" title="Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a> was a movie produced by a major movie studio. It had a budget and theater take both measured in millions of dollars. How you can even begin to compare this nothing of a conflict to that is beyond me. And if you think this is the "first ever grand scale massive strike against a website" ... where have you been these past few years? <i>Yahoo</i> was taken down by a DDOS. <i>Microsoft</i> was almost taken down by a DDOS. Whitehouse.gov has been DDOS'ed. Compared to this incidents this little forum spat is nothing. Hell, have any of these sites even gone down?

Also, may I point out that calling it "Ebaum's War" is very POV, and actually rather misleading. Let's reserve the word "war" for real wars, okay?

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. (Stumbled across this nomination while trying to wikify Frank and teds greatest hits, which was contributed by the same editor.) Admittedly, many of the details in this article fail the verification test. However, what troubles me about deleting this article is that (1) we have no criteria for determining how to verify that a skateborder exists, let alone to prove he/she a celebrity even within this subculture, &amp; (2) doing a Google search shows a lot of dead links about him -- which suggests that Internet sources are not a reliable way to verify facts about skateborders. I'd feel more comfortable about deleting this article if a search thru the relevant magazines on this article had also been done. (The websites for the few skateboard mags I found all had suboptimal search features, so even if Oakley was the subject of a featured profile this would be hard to determine short of reading the table of contents for every issue.) -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 18:25, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Did some edits to the entry, including outside references where appropriate, and the removal of content that I couldn't verify via another source. The terms 'Girlfriend in Refrigerator Syndrome' and 'Women in Refrigerator Syndrome' don't appear in the site where the term 'Women in Refrigerators' originated. Neither term is as common as 'Women in Refrigerators' (done with a search of 'Women in Refrigerators comic books'). The term 'Girlfriend in Refrigerators' appears to have originated on Wikipedia. I referenced both terms in the article for clarity, and noted that neither term appears in the original source documents<s>,</s>. <s>and</s> 'Girlfriend in Refrigerators' appears to have been an invention (accidental?) of <s>someone writing</s> whoever wrote the original 'Girlfriend in Refrigerator' Wikipedia entry. Is 'Women in Refrigerators Syndrome' still an appropriate article title? I think the early whimsy and lack of references in the redone article I wrote might've caused a problem, so I did my best to correct it. <a href="../../../f/c/r/User%7EFcr_3867.html" title="User:Fcr">Fcr</a> 14:07, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is one thing about the title 'Women in Refrigerators Syndrome'. The author who coined the term, Gail Simone, has never referred to a Syndrome. As the previous revision described, she did create a list of superheroines and send it out to comicbook fans and professionals--which sparked discussion (and continues to spark discussion on-line). She then published the list and responses (with help) online under the name 'Women in Refrigerators.' The term 'Women in Refrigerators' didn't exist until the website was created, and she's never described the list and the responses as a 'Syndrome.' Lauren Dayap (in late 2004, in this <a href="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/soapbox/111344749759399.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/soapbox/111344749759399.htm" rel="nofollow">article</a>) made an off-hand comment and said 'the girlfriend in the refrigerator syndrome' without explaining what the term meant. This is the closest reference linking what Gail Simone said to 'Syndrome' that exists on-line prior to June 2005. The intent of the article was as a better reference source for anyone doing research on the subject, the site list and site that sparked and still sparks discussion, Gail Simone, women in comics, women on the Internet, with links to the original site if a reader wanted to dig a little deeper into the <s>meaning</s> material. Titling the article 'Women in Refrigerators Syndrome' would essentially be coining a new term. The most accurate term is 'Women in Refrigerators' (which was coined by Gail Simone for the website where the materials were originally published). Anyway, I thought it was important to add that ... in fact, it might make a good extra addition to the article if it doesn't get deleted. Phew, I gotta work on that brevity, sorry everyone!<a href="../../../f/c/r/User%7EFcr_3867.html" title="User:Fcr">Fcr</a> 18:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am one of the authors of the ZK framework. ZK is new but I don't agree it is not notable. Since opened on Nov. 13, 2005, it attracts more than 8,000 downloads. It is #1 in the Sourceforge's ranking of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=561" class="external text" title="https://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=561" rel="nofollow">Software Development/User Interface</a>, and #2 in the ranking of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=606" class="external text" title="https://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=606" rel="nofollow">Software Development Frameworks</a>. Tomyeh January 17 2006.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> because it is in fact quite notable. It is not about how many google hits only but also about where the related entry is. The framework's name is actually "zk". When searching zk, with only two letters, its google hits is <b>2,190,000</b>. Then where is this ZK framework? It is #2 entry at the first page; and #10 is also related. It means google engine "thinks" this framework is the second most relative to these two letter "zk" out of 2 million plus hits. Then search with context word <b>zk ajax</b>, just like <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> said, there are tons of XXX about this framework. In fact, the first ten entries of the first page are all about it. —Jwalk <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">01-17</a>&#160;17:28</li>

<dd><b>KEEP!</b> GoKrida, while it is an MMORPG, it is unique. I mean, how many other such games are linked tothe National Heritage Foundation? The game is a society simulator, and the complexity and beauty of it is in the fact that the players make the game within the boundaries of the GoKrida online universe. The players are working on making this page as WiKi acceptable as possible. One person just informed me he had learned how to edit Wiki just so he could work on this page.

<li>Article contained no assertion of notability nor non-commercial verifiability, and Google search of the titled spelling failed to provide evidence.

<li>First, my apologies for being so terse. I wasn't trying to get you to change your vote, only your reasoning behind it. A google search for <i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=balderson+cheese" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=balderson+cheese" rel="nofollow">Balderson cheese</a></i> or <i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=balderson%27s+cheese" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=balderson%27s+cheese" rel="nofollow">Balderson's cheese</a></i> yields a total of roughly 1150 hits, so it has some relevance, but it also appears to be another generic cheese producer. (For what it's worth, I've seen their products in several supermarkets in my area.) I thought I'd add this to clarify for any other users who particpate in this AfD. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix"><font color="#8B4513">Mind</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindmatrix_738b.html" title="User talk:Mindmatrix"><font color="#EE8811">matrix</font></a> 23:54, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Furthemore, how strange do delete an article with an important message just becuase of a name. What is a neologism and what is wrong with it?</p>
<p>If I look in Wikipedia for Neologism I find:</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> is a word, term, or phrase which has been recently created ("coined") —often to apply to new concepts, or to reshape older terms in newer language form. Neologisms are especially useful in identifying inventions, new phenomena, or old ideas which have taken on a new cultural context.</p>
<p>So there seems to be nothing wrong with a neologism!</p>

<li>I can only say one thing: I am a scientist, go to my homepage <a href="http://oase.uci.kun.nl/~aven1935/" class="external free" title="http://oase.uci.kun.nl/~aven1935/" rel="nofollow">http://oase.uci.kun.nl/~aven1935/</a> and you will see that I was involved in the publication of 55 scientific papers. My last paper was in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology (2005). I must say I am very disappointed with this answer.
<p>I have always considered the British people as open minded. In Holland there is at least one official publication with the term lottocracy (lottocratie) in the title, which was one of the reasons to present this article to Wikipedia. It is most disappointing to hear that a concept, which meets almost all of the above criteria, among others, it really introduces a solution to the problems facing our world going to an end, is simply wept from the table by a single subject. In scientific publications one usually has three referees to judge a paper. In Wikipedia one seems to be sufficient.</p>
<p>At the same time I know that the above words have no value whatsoever. In Holland we would say: spoken to a deafman's ear.</p>

<li>Hm, okay does seem like Ad van der Ven is promoting his idea. However, I still think a Redirect would be good. It seems like many people reinvent the term and it has an obvious meaning. The redirect would not be acquiescing to AvdV; it is more like "if there's anything about Lottocracy, it's as a synonym or subtopic of Demarchy". Demarchy exists and is a more serious article, a redirect will stop people from recreating 'lottocracy' thinking they invented it. I myself immediately understood the concept from the name 'lottocracy'. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">01-13</a>&#160;08:28<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span></li>

<p>First of all it is not original research.</p>
<p>The idea of lottocracy has been described in detail in the chapter <a href="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/leonbook/node16.html" class="external text" title="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/leonbook/node16.html" rel="nofollow">A Concept for Government</a> of the book <a href="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/leonbook/leonbook.html" class="external text" title="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/leonbook/leonbook.html" rel="nofollow">The World Solution for World Problems</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 90-9002592-8</a>). The book is officially published in <b>1988</b>, which is, according to present standards, long ago. I cannot help it when the general public is not informed. Since the time of it's publication the book has been available, though, as a hard copy in the Library of Congress (Washington DC), the British Library (London) and, among others, in the Library of the University of Princeton (Princeton, USA). You can also find the book at <a href="http://picarta.pica.nl/LNG=NE/DB=2.41/" class="external text" title="http://picarta.pica.nl/LNG=NE/DB=2.41/" rel="nofollow">PiCarta</a>.</p>

<p>Dear Doktorb,</p>
<p>Would you really be so kind to wait a little with your comments. I am in the process of editing. This will take a few minutes. So, please, ...</p>
<p>Moreover, I do not know what you mean. The author of the book has died several years ago. Therefore, again, I do not know what you mean. I am <a href="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/" class="external text" title="http://www.socsci.kun.nl/~advdv/" rel="nofollow">Ad van der Ven</a>, a honest scientist (having published 55 papers in well-known scientific papers) and I repeat, I am not the author of the book.</p>
<p>Now I am continuing.</p>
<p>Second.</p>
<p>The term lottocracy is not my term, but the term of the author. The term has been used seven times in the book! I cannot help it, that the author uses this term to label his idea.</p>
<p>I really think, with all my heart, that the above referees have been rather careless and have made their recommendations too easy!</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - to the author of this article: I can understand your frustration, but please note that Wikipedia is not an academic journal and this is not peer-review. For a topic to merit an entry in wikipedia it needs to be notable in its own right. This discussion is largely about whether or not this concept is notable. It is being termed <i>original research</i> by other editors because it is not a term in widespread use, discussed by multiple notable authors but, rather, a term used in a not especially notable book by a not especially notable author. It may be a brilliant idea, but until it becomes a <i>notable</i> brilliant idea, it isn't appropriate as a topic for an article. Other editors have suggested that the concept is essentially the same as <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sortition.html" title="Sortition">sortition</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demarchy.html" title="Demarchy">demarchy</a>, so perhaps some of this information could be integrated into one or both of those articles. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattley_a310.html" title="User:Mattley">Mattley</a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattley_ace2.html" title="User talk:Mattley"><sup>(Chattley)</sup></a> 13:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Mattley,</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration. You are the first one who makes a comment in a kind and most informative way. I do understand what is meant by "notable". I am a scientist with many publications, among others a book, and at least I consider the topic certainly notable. But that will probably not do and I am well aware that the concept is a matter of subjective interpretation. Some will consider a topic notable and some not. In that case one still can hold to the criterium of importance, which by the way is also subjective. I can only wait and see.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I will certainly consider most seriously your suggestion to discuss the topic under the heading of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demarchy.html" title="Demarchy">demarchy</a>, which by the way is in some respects completely different from the concept of lottocracy.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> is supposed to say. Unfortunately, that just leads to discussion about what "notable" means in "<i>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in <b>notable</b> and verifiable sources.</i>" Some say that is indisuputable. Me? I dispute it. To answer other questions, there has been a big push here - including making WP:BAND violation a speedy deletion criteria - to stop Wikipedia from being flooded by every band that every person likes. I.e., if Rockets red glare is notable enough, then so are fifty zillion other bands until half the database is just bands, each of which is notable in one person's mind. Has anyone found any of this band's label-mates in Wikipedia? Why not? Get that new article button moving because they must all be notable too. And, if any of them were on a slightly larger label too, make articles for all of that label's bands, etc., etc... Soon, every schmuck that's ever picked up a guitar and happened to know someone with some recording equipment who happened to know someone at a CD publishing joint - they're all on Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 05:22, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have to defend my article here! Independent bands (currently they even realease from their own label) without the support of the industry don't get 'hits'. Despite this lack of support they have had success in a country that rock music is not as popular, which in itself is something notable. When one thinks of 90's greek rock bands , three main groups come in the mind. Two of them don't exist anymore, the third being Diafana Krina who are still going on. Many consider them as the flagship of the greek rock scene currently. I believe they are notable, of course: thus, <b>Keep</b> Volcan 06:22, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can best shed light on this because I created it. I created this to make a point. Note that point is different than <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> because this in no way causes disruption to wikipedia. Yet, when I saw a proliferation of anti-Islamic polemics (some found in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Category%7EBooks_critical_of_Islam_4b0b.html" title="Category:Books critical of Islam">Category:Books critical of Islam</a>) I created a rather borderline notability book about Christianity but made sure its Amazon rank (381,306) was better than the book that inspired its (639,969). I was worried about systemic bias because when an encyclopedia has many pretty non-scholarly critical books about one religion and not about others I'm not sure that's a good thing. It should be noted that there are more critical of Christianity books and hopefully things will even out some, but since it was pretty clear to me from other articles that inclusionist tendencies were winning out in the community I realized that books on this level were not considered notable per AfD voting standards. The title also plays off of Islamofascism debates but was not an attempt to get the title into greater usage. I would also not oppose in any way adding (book) to the end of the title of that makes people feel more comfortable. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/i/m/Wikipedia%7ELimited_administrators_6c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Limited administrators">?</a></sup> 14:02, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. So you agree that it's borderline notable, and you admit that you only created the article to make a point about an unrelated issue, yet you still insist that it should be kept? Is this really a book that is critical of Christianity? I'm not sure how it even makes your point. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 19:21, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I believe the book is probably not encyclopedic. However, my vote for this is based on other standards that seem to have been set from my perusal of other AfDs. Similar to the subject of schools I suppose. My point about Christianity evenness was not cheap critiques. It was moreso titles since I created it during the AfD of The Nazi Connection to Islamic Terrorism (book). My point was that what I believe has become the de facto standard for book notability has been set below this--whether it's good or bad. I was also curious about the deletion prospects for this. If this is deleted and some of the others aren't I'd want to know why. I'm not sure if I'm making sense. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/i/m/Wikipedia%7ELimited_administrators_6c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Limited administrators">?</a></sup> 20:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sure, the title is POV but I don't see why we'd care - it's the title of a <i>book</i>. We can argue the importance of the book, but I doubt it would go anywhere. We have articles on individual episodes of obscure TV programs nobody's ever seen, so I'd be surprised if we got consensus to delete this. However my actual "vote" is <b>merge</b> to Richard J. Weisman, the author. This is simply a matter of organization- there's little point having an article on a specific book <i>before</i> we even have an article on the author. The author article could discuss this and his other books, and if the day comes when it's too long, we split them off again. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:36, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Unverifiable, non-notable, spam, original research, and/or vanity.

<p>Regarding <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">lack of verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>: I challenge anyone out there to find verifiable, <b>independent</b>, peer-reviewed sources that seriously discuss "computational verb theory". By "independent" I mean sources that are neither (a) Wikipedia mirrors; (b) web sites published by Mr. Yang; (c) books self-published by Mr. Yang; (d) journals edited by Mr. Yang; nor anything else related directly or indirectly to Mr. Yang and/or colleagues. Keep in mind that the references cited in these articles do <b>not</b> meet these criteria; for example, Mr. Yang is the editor (and apparently also the publisher) of the <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Journal_of_Computational_Cognition_f76b.html" title="International Journal of Computational Cognition">International Journal of Computational Cognition</a></i>.</p>
<p>Regarding vanity and lack of notability: Even if the topic of "computational verb theory" is found to be verifiable, I'll also claim that it is not sufficiently notable to warrant several articles.

<p>I've done a little checking through the ISI Web of Knowledge, my results are appended below. Articles by Yang dealing with the 'computational verb' have appeared in at least two reputable peer-reviewed journals, the <i>International Journal of Intelligent Systems</i> and the <i>International Journal of General Systems</i>. However, the only time any of these papers has ever been cited is by Yang himself in other papers. So it's verifiable as a published theory, but it's not exactly setting the cognitive science world alight. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Nick Boalch</a> <sup><a href="../../../n/g/b/User_talk%7ENgb_2abf.html" title="User talk:Ngb">?!?</a></sup> 23:26, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Hoax"? That doesn't seem likely, for a hoax it's just too elaborate. The journal exists and is verifiable enough, and it's filled with lots and lots and lots of scholarly work. The only thing we don't know for certain is its quality.

<dd>It's definitely not a hoax: you can actually go to the website of the journal and download the articles published in it. However, it's not really a scientific journal, more of a scam: the editor-in-chief, the founder, the publisher, and the author who publishes the most papers in this journal are all the same person. There is no indication that published articles have undergone any form of peer review. (So for purposes of Wikipedia, it's not a reliable source.) Its main function is as an outlet for Mr. Yang's theories. I'll assert that nothing notable has been published in this journal, which makes the journal itself non-notable. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 22:17, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Additional information: The address of this institute is "Yang's Scientific Research Institute, 1303 East University Blvd. # 20882, Tucson, Arizona 85719-0521, USA". That may give the appearance that the institute is somehow affiliated with the University of Arizona, but that appearance is misleading: in reality, the address is associated with the campus post office, and presumably resolves to a PO box.</p>

<li>I don't understand what you mean by "CNN ... list[ing] a book". In the context of the book you mention, "CNN" expands to "cellular neural networks". The book "Handbook of CNN Image Processing: All You Need to Know about Cellular Neural Networks" is published by Yang's Scientific Research Institute a.k.a. YangSky and written by Tao Yang, who happens to be the founder, chief research scientist, and apparently only employee of YangSky. In other words, this is a self-published book. It's not a "top seller" at all: its Amazon sales rank is #1,423,430. There is no evidence that it has "gained some attention", other than by blatant self-promotion and piggy-backing on the "CNN" acronym. There is no evidence that Yang's Scientific Research Institute has any assets in addition to their web site and PO box, and any employees besides Mr. Yang himself. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 19:51, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

That's why I think Tuchel Heath should redirect to Tuchola Forest, and that article should have a link to the Battle of Krojanty.

However, some authority websites like <a href="http://www.ejury.com/attys_terms.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ejury.com/attys_terms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ejury.com/attys_terms.html</a> use the term deliberately. Term e-verdict has already been used before: "<a href="http://www.davidrowan.com/1998/01/glossary-for-nineties-chapter-5.html" class="external free" title="http://www.davidrowan.com/1998/01/glossary-for-nineties-chapter-5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidrowan.com/1998/01/glossary-for-nineties-chapter-5.html</a>" and here: <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=E-verdict" class="external free" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=E-verdict" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=E-verdict</a>. Moreover, some people in discussion forums and in article comments use term "verdict" to ask other people's opinions: "what is your verdict" - <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22what+is+your+verdict%22" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22what+is+your+verdict%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22what+is+your+verdict%22</a>. But the true and correct term to use would be "electronic verdict" or "e-verdict", because the verdict is announced on internet etc. So, articles e-verdict and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verdict.html" title="Verdict">verdict</a> should be equal to <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-mail.html" title="E-mail">e-mail</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail.html" title="Mail">mail</a> without exceptions. Therefore, to my opinion, assuming that the article is without advertisment, it will bring the definitions and will contribute to overall knowledge of wiki.

<li>Is it possible still to vote for "per nom." even though the article could not be nominated for the same reason anymore: advertisment? Is isn't it enough evidence proving the absence of advertisment and the need for an article I brought up in my above comment? I would also be very thankful to hear other voters and commenters MOTIVATIONS, like Mr. jpgordon∇∆∇∆'s etc. I hope admin will consider analyzing people's motivations before deleting this page.

<dd>Admittedly, many of the details in this article fail the verification test. I'd feel more comfortable about deleting this article if a search thru the relevant magazines on this article had also been done. (The websites for the few skateboard mags I found all had suboptimal search features, so even if this movie was the subject of a featured profile this would be hard to determine short of reading the table of contents for every issue.) -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 17:38, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not here to argue syntax and literal definitions. By tautology I meant your statement is true, but it does not support keeping the article. "<i>The use of a vocoder is rare enough to warrant an article...</i>" is, I feel, a perfectly valid argument to save the page. (Though I disagree with it.) Starting a new article "<i>to stop ongoing edit wars regarding which songs [warrant] inclusion</i>" is not.

<li><b>No merge</b> I've already voted 'keep', so I won't re-add that. But I just wanted to say that I'm not keen on the idea of merging the page with 'girl gamers' or 'female gamers'. As I fail to see the significance of a page about female gamers in general. I find the term 'girl gamer' condescending - and as for a page about 'female gamers' what next, a page called 'female mechanics: mechanics who are female' or 'female welders: welders who are female'. Sorry to moan, but apparently, for what it is worth, I feel strongly against a merger with that page, nor indeed see the point of a 'female gamer' page at all as it is too general. The concept of such a page is a bit to bizarre for me - and yes i did read the page too. 18:22, 14 January 2006 (GMT)</li>

Calling state intervention and the new deal part of a practice called 'economic fascism' is simply inaccurate, POV and not taken seriously by most historians or economists.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think every article I've created has survived a deletion vote. So, I must be doing something valuable. If this one doesn't survive, oh well; you can't win 'em all.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would support a merge, but it's inevitable that the article would be chopped down and information would be lost. I think it needs its own article so the topic can really be explored in depth. Was the New Deal really modeled on Mussolini's system? Let's explore it. If not, great. I don't understand what the POV'ers are worried about --are they afraid that it actually was modeled on fascism and don't want that revealed?

<li><b>Comment</b>: Comparison of the proposed New Deal with actually existing forms of economic planning, including the Soviet Union, was a commonplace of the early thirties. It did not, except among the kooks and hysterics, imply any non-economic similarity; and it should be remembered that Mussolini, in particular, was being mildly praised even by Winston Churchill. The attribution to Hayek is unsourced, and unlikely. (If it is an interpretation of <i>Road to Serfdom</i>, it is original research.) Most of the rest of the aources are either out-of-context partisan comments, or obscure rightwing flakes. A PoV screed.

<dd>Delete. It certainly does not fit into the New Deal article which is much more sophisticated and complex than this. (and which goves the fascism article the three sentences it deserves.

<li><b>Comment</b>: that would make this eligible for {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}}; saince even without the French text, this would still be "substantially the same" content. But I think this should run its course in AfD rather than <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy</a> G4, since someone is debating the deletion. Frankly, I sympathise with Canadian cities that want to get out from under the yoke of their provincial governments.

Still, this is not a <i>real</i> referendum on a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secession.html" title="Secession">secession</a> that has any chance of being on any ballot in the forseeable future.

<p>You bunch of geeks, don't you have anything better to do? Anyway the point of Wikipedia is to inform, and several people already know the Foamy Banana Anthem and agree the word should be spread further, as for You've Been Munched. Do not bother me again. Archdeacon Screameryhoof</p>
<p>Also, we DO qualify for the WP:music thing, because Munched "Has composed a number of melodies, tunes or standards used in a notable genre, or tradition or school within a notable genre." The genre being rock.</p>

<p>The article tells us that this is another name for lottocracy. If that were not original research itself, this would at best be a redirect there, given that it would be the same single concept. But as with "lottocracy", this is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> too. The article discusses the coinage of a made-up word for what is actually known as <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sortition.html" title="Sortition">sortition</a>. A redirect to either <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sortition.html" title="Sortition">sortition</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demarchy.html" title="Demarchy">demarchy</a> is inappropriate, because this word simply doesn't exist.
