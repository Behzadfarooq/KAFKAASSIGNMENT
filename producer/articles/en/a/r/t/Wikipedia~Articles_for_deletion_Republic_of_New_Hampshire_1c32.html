<p>Documented facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Hampshire Declared its Independence on January 5th, 1776, six months before the Continental Congress issued its Declaration of Independence.</li>
<li>New Hampshire adopted its Constitution on January 5th 1776, long before the Articles of Confederation were ratified in 1781 and more than a decade before the US Constitution was ratified (by the independent Republic of New Hampshire, as the ninth ratifying state) on June 21, 1788.</li>
<li>New Hampshire functioned as an entirely independent country between January 5, 1776 and Jun 21, 1788, with a republican form of government, under the title and seal of "Rei-pub Neo Hantoni" and "Republica Neo Hantoniensis" (as of 1784, when the state Constitution was revised).</li>
<li>During its period of total independence, it issued passports, collected tariffs, raised armies and activated militias (which operated independently of the Continental Army), coined money, held elections, issued letters of marque, constructed naval vessels for combat, etc.</li>
<li>The period of the independence of New Hampshire was at least as long as those experienced by the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Texas_b889.html" title="Republic of Texas">Republic of Texas</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Hawaii_406e.html" title="Republic of Hawaii">Republic of Hawaii</a>, and almost as long as the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Vermont_0894.html" title="Republic of Vermont">Republic of Vermont</a>.</li>
<li>It appears that The Commonwealth of Virginia and the Republic of South Carolina also declared their independence prior to the joint declaration of the Continental Congress.Citizenposse 20:27, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please keep this page.

<p>there never was a so-called "Republic of New Hampshire" see <i>Revolutionary New Hampshire: An Account of the Social and Political Forces Underlying the Transition from Royal Province to American Commonwealth</i> Dartmouth College Publications. Hanover. 1936. Page 180 says: "On September 10, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read before the legislature, whereupon an act was passed by the provisions of which the province assumed the name of the "State of New Hampshire."</p>
<p>The notion of a so-called "Republic of NH" is therefore a fraud concocted by militia groups in the 21st century. --<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am currently researching further, however the original <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seal_of_New_Hampshire_78dc.html" title="Seal of New Hampshire">Seal of New Hampshire</a> held the title "Rei-pub Neo Hantoni", which is "Republic of New Hampshire". This version of the Seal remains in existence and is published by the state government on the cover of its official copies of the State Constitution. I can document this further if people are not in such a huff to jump the gun with their prejudices on this topic. Please do not be precipitous, allow a researcher to find further references. I can say that New Hampshire declared its own independence and named itself a Republic BEFORE the Continental Congress issued its own Declaration of Independence. When the US D of I was read before the New Hampshire Congress, it was accepted and the Congress voted for statehood. If you look at the dates here, you'll see I'm right: NH was an independent Republic before the US Declaration of Independence even existed. For the record, I am not and never have been a member of any militia group, so Rjensens aspersions are pure libel and slander. Citizenposse 03:06, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, as I've told you before, the Republic is a different entity from the State. The State is an artificial corporate person which is governed by the legislators. The legislature brings the corporate State into being through its Acts, but it not itself the State, any more than the stockholders of Pepsico are the corporation. An artificial person cannot be made up of natural persons. It is a legal impossibility. Citizenposse 04:00, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just out of curiosity, what <i>else</i> are artificial persons made up of? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a distinction found at law, actually, even if Citizenposse is mucking up the meaning and confused on the applications. A corporation, for instance, is deemed an "artificial person" under the law. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nh09.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nh09.htm" rel="nofollow">The original Constitution</a> of New Hampshire was framed by a convention, or "congress," which assembled at Exeter, December 21, 1775, (in accordance with a recommendation from the Continental Congress,) and completed its labors January 5, 1776. This was 9 months before the events referred to by <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">User:Rjensen</a>.</li>

The Seal of 1784 also says "Republica Neo Hantoniensis" (Page 42). The 1848 to 1870 seal also says "Republicae Neo Hantoniensis" (page 43). So does every other Seal in the document up to 1916, when the current Seal was adopted. I believe that this conclusively proves my point. Citizenposse 03:39, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, as I've told you before, the Republic is a different entity from the State. The State is an artificial corporate person which is governed by the legislators. The legislature brings the corporate State into being through its Acts, but it not itself the State, any more than the stockholders of Pepsico are the corporation. An artificial person cannot be made up of natural persons. It is a legal impossibility. What is your bug?Citizenposse 04:01, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I can prove that the legislators are not the state: Legislators do not, and cannot be made to pay any taxes, or have any deductions taken from their $200 per session pay. They are not servants of the State, the State is a servant of the legislature.Citizenposse 04:03, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is a double standard between NH and TX/HI, and correctly so. Texas and Hawaii each had a long existence as totally independent political entities with diplomatic recognition by European powers. None of the original colonies had such an existence, and New Hampshire's postcolonial existence should be consistent with how Wikipedia treats them, not with how it treats Texas or Hawaii. -<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwbrum_d3bd.html" title="User:Benwbrum">Ben</a> 15:40, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Seems like original research. Most of the references given do not conclusively prove anything; they are used as part of the editor's own effort in trying to interpret New Hampshire's various seals. Other references only contain references to "Republic of New Hampshire" as a typo, rendering them completely irrelevant; this can possibly imply that the editor is grasping at straws. There is a single reference to "Republic of New Hampshire" in one document, but it seems to barely call for a merge to the main state history, as it still doesn't imply that the Republic was a recognized entity by historians, other nations, or other reliable sources. It was but a fleeting part of state history, which should be laid out like the rest of the histories of the other 13 colonies are, and per <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwbrum_d3bd.html" title="User:Benwbrum">Ben</a>'s comment. I do not support a merge, however, as it is original research. Comparisons to the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Texas_b889.html" title="Republic of Texas">Republic of Texas</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Hawaii_406e.html" title="Republic of Hawaii">Republic of Hawaii</a> are ludicrous and the editor's nomination of those two articles for AfD are a blatant violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

<dd>When a major government entity is created there always is a record, and a date when it happened. In this case there is no record, no date, no document, no citation in any history book. During the Revolution the Province of NH changed its name to the State of NH and never called itself the Republic of NH. All the history books agree on that. In recent years there is a militia group that is trying to set up a "republic of New Hampshire" -- try a google search. They talk about posse's a lot. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 19:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Original research and novel interpretations shouldn't be introduced into Wikipedia.

<li>I'm convinced there is something to the notion that New Hampshire had a separate existance for a period between the start of the war of independence and the ratification of the constitution. The material in the article, and the material presented here, are convincing enough evidence of that, assuming they're backed up with cites (which ought to be easy). I would oppose outright deletion of this material. What I'm not clear on is why this needs to be a separate article rather than a section of the main <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> article. I'm also not clear on why Citizenposse needs to be so vehement, as his vehemence does his cause a disservice (sorry, but that's the way it is... if two exactly equal cases are presented, consensus here more often seems to go with the case that is presented more softly and reasonably ). I think <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> with a redirect left behind is the right course of action.
