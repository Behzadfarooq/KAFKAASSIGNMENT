<li><b>Delete</b> precedent isn't binding in AfD. Wether or not it is notable should be decided on a case by case basis, not as a blanket assumption. Consider what wikipedia would be like under the "every high school is notable for being a high school" policy. With every single school accross the english speaking world having their own article. Thousands of articles that are utterly useless to everyone except those in the immediate area. Wikipedia would be one big education guide. Yes, I understand the argument that we spend a large amount of our lives in there but why does that make them notable? We also spend a large amount of our time sitting on the toilet in our house - do you think that makes it notable enough to write an article about? (extreme example obviously, if you try and pick holes in the arguement soley because of this example you don't have a leg to stand on) Some schools are notable, as a melbourne example the big private schools that everyone knows about are notable ie. <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_College%2C_Melbourne_54a1.html" title="Scotch College, Melbourne">Scotch College, Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Grammar_School_f74f.html" title="Melbourne Grammar School">Melbourne Grammar School</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Ladies%27_College%2C_Melbourne_7118.html" title="Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne">Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Grammar_School%2C_Victoria_aad8.html" title="Trinity Grammar School, Victoria">Trinity Grammar School, Victoria</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> In addition to the usual lack of an assertion of notability; we also get the special bonus of contradicting the one fact about it in the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cypress-Fairbanks_Independent_School_District_0f01.html" title="Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District">school district article</a>, so there is a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> failure to boot. The school district article says that this school hasn't even opened yet, thus bringing in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> concerns to go with the usual <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.</a> <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:53, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Weak <b>Delete</b> with no prejudice against future re-creation. — Only because the school is apparently not open yet and so doesn't meet my personal criteria for notability.

<ul>
<li>Notability is subjective, irrelevant and not established as a formal WP policy. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is among the most important - if not <i>the</i> most important - of all Wikipedia's policies. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 12:22, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can verify that a public toilet exists in melbourne. Does that make the information worthwhile of inclusion on wikipedia? While <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is not a policy, there are many guidlines for notability. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:48, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An article on Melbourne public toilets would indeed be a good thing, as a number of them are certainly of more than passing historical interest - however public hygiene facilities are of much less significance than schools, which are funded to the order of many millions of dollars, over many dozens of years, employ hundreds of staff, and impact large slabs of the lives of whole communities of people across many generations. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 11:59, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Schools and the education system are notable indeed. But like the few public toilets of historic interest, only a small subset of schools are notable on their own. So what is it about schools that makes them inherantly notable? The majority of school articles contain unverfied (and possibly unverifiable for wikipedias purposes, discounting <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>) information about the number of classrooms the names of many of the teachers and the students favourite after-school activities or other random, uninteresting, non-notable and often un-verifiable facts about the school. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:15, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
