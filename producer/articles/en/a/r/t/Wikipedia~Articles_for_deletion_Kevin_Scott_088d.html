<p>The fine people of Wakefield, Massachusetts chose him as their selectman, but his only other claim to fame is that he is one of the Republicans vying for the honor of being trounced by Ted Kennedy this fall. He is not even the nominee yet and, as a mere candidate whose only prior service was on a smallish city's board of selectmen, fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>. However, it is commendable that "a strong sense of civic duty was instilled in Kevin from a very young age by his father Jim Scott, who ... to this day is still one of the first people to talk to if a candidate is serious about winning an election." <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JChap2007_84c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/JChap2007">contribs</a>) 00:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Article is clearly promotional in tone. A selectman is not notable. A <i>candidacy</i> is not notable. Especially not a candidacy for a primary. Especially not the <i>Republican</i> primary in Massachusetts. If the article is kept it needs a radical POV-ectomy and careful watching, since there is at least a possibility of campaign staff involvement in the editing of the article. I note too that the article cites no sources inline, and the only sources mentioned, external links, are Scott's campaign site, and a site which merely presents politician's stated views (i.e. essentially self-authored); in the case of an intrinsically controversial topic, this kind of site can't be considered to meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>That's funny, last I heard this was America and anyone was allowed to run for office. I didn't realize one had to have a "claim to fame" to run. Also, I believe the original Wikipedia article was very much "stating the facts" in a non-promotional way. Then, certain individuals from the Chase campaign made their way onto this site and altered the article to show Kevin in a negative light. Let us not forget how this battle began. 10:19, 28 July 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.96.17.119 (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.96.17.119.html" title="User talk:65.96.17.119">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.96.17.119_99ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.96.17.119">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Redirect</b>. I note that the nomination and comments above <i>are based on a version of the article that was significantly altered (arguably, vandalized) by a pro-Scott partisan 65.96.17.119 on July 28th.</i> I just reversed that user's changes - AGAIN; he/she did the same thing on July 27th, which I reverted. So yes, what was there was highly promotional and unsourced, but it wasn't the "real" article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 14:45, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>"His lack of speaking ability as well as the fact he was a registered Democrat until 2001 are two factors that cost him the endorsement of his party at the state convention in April and are likely to cost him the primary in September, according to state GOP insiders"</b> Sir, please explain to me how his "lack of speaking ability" is a fact. That is a matter of opinion, YOUR opinion. Also, please site your sources for saying that he is likely to lose the primary in September "according to state GOP insiders". Your information is highly partisan and opinionated, and appears to be written in an effort to form a "smear campaign" against Kevin. Until you can write a reasonable article that doesn't take your own personal opinion and try to pass it off as fact, I will continue to edit this article as I see fit. 16:40, 28 July 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 132.183.67.124 (<a href="../../../1/3/2/User_talk%7E132.183.67.124.html" title="User talk:132.183.67.124">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_132.183.67.124_9a2d.html" title="Special:Contributions/132.183.67.124">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>For the record: (1) I did NOT write those words, and they are NOT my opinion. I personally don't care whether Scott wins or loses the Republican nomination; (2) You just deleted the ENTIRE campaign section in the Kevin Scott article, not just the words you just cited, even though the rest of the section was clearly NPOV (and I just reverted your edit, which was vandalism); (3) Discussions about text in an article belong on the talk/discussion page of the article, not on a project page about deleting the article. I will not respond further, here, to such postings, but will be happy to do so at Talk:Kevin Scott.
