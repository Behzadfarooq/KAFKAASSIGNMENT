<li><b>Delete</b>: There is nothing enyclopedic about hockey players names that start with the letter B. Simillar information can be easily achieved with categories.

<li><b>Keep</b> the "problem" with the external links has now been fixed. There are lots of useless lists on wikipedia, but this is not one of them. having a complete list of NHL players helps prevent duplicate articles, vanity articles, and helps disambig players with the same name. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 20:18, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A complete list of all the players who have played in the NHL is very important for when people create player articles. The complete list prevents duplicate articles and helps with disambigs. Categories don't work as well because they only include players who have articles. By listing all the players, red links or not, it is so much easier. One possibility would be to merge all the players onto one article, but i think that would create too large of an article. Separating them alphabetically is efficient and easier to read. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 20:22, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Unfortunately, categories don't work as well as a complete list of all the players who have played in the NHL for reasons that i have stated above. The idea is, of course, to eventually make an article for each NHL player (except players who have only played one game as one game doesn't make him noteworthy enough for his own article) thereby removing all the red links. I make about 10 player articles a week and I am not the only one making player articles. Not only do I create player articles regularly, I am also spending my time using media sources (such as tsn.ca) to update the list. as far as i know, it is the most complete list of sports players, and therefore the most usefull. A list (such as the baseball one) that is no where near complete is useless. having a complete list is the best way to keep track of all the NHL player articles. Can the articles be changed and improved? of course they can and should, but whatever fate holds true for this hockey list, the same fate must hold true for the baseball, football, soccer, rugby ones too. If you really want to tackle and delete a useless list that should be a category, then delete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_in_sports_d4c3.html" title="List of Jews in sports">List of Jews in sports</a>. Why not a List of Christians in sports? or a List of Mormons in sports? Anyways, my point is that there are countless useless lists on wikipedia, and a complete list of sports players that have played in a major league is not one of them. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 17:20, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

And thanks for <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>, and realizing that the hockeydb.com links were added by a third party not as a "googlebombing" but because said site is widely regarded as the de facto resource for professional hockey statistics. <a href="../../../c/c/w/User%7ECcwaters_bc8b.html" title="User:Ccwaters">ccwaters</a> 17:51, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. If they are notable enough to be on this list, they are notable enough to have their own article, in which case that article can be added to a self-maintaining and self-sorting category. If they are not, they should not be on the list. I assert that this is <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">listcruft</a> as redundant to a category. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 22:20, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If it's in use to further a WikiProject, then I have no problems with it being moved to Wikipedia namespace. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 22:21, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>: Sorry I've had internet problems and was not able to contribute to the discussion as of yet, but this is just silly that these articles are being put up for deletion in the first place. I agree these pages could be improved so it just isn't names beside links, but it still is an effective way of seeing which NHL players have articles and which do not, so that we may create new articles because they are a ton of very notable NHL players (mostly former ones) who do not yet have an existing article. This list is continuing to get updated, and it is a great guide for us people in the hockey editing world, that could not be used categorically because as I said before, you can't put uncreated articles into categories. I have created numerous stubs (at least 100-150) about hockey players thru these lists that need to have been created. There is no way that these articles should be deleted. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECroat_Canuck_1286.html" title="User talk:Croat Canuck"><font size="1"><font color="blue">Go Leafs Go</font></font></a></i> 15:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Turn it all into a category, delete the article</b> I don't see why these lists of MLB, NHL, etc. are put into articles when a link when a category page can do a much better job of listing these people.--<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid"><tt><b><font style="background:green" color="white">&#160;The ikiroid&#160;</font></b></tt></a> 02:44, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I can't believe you said that a category page can do a much better job of listing these people. There are hundreds of notable NHL players who have yet to get articles and that can't be listed in categories because, obviously, they do not have an article. There is no way a category is sufficient for the content of these articles. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECroat_Canuck_1286.html" title="User talk:Croat Canuck"><font size="1"><font color="blue">Go Leafs Go</font></font></a></i> 03:22, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You make a list on a hockey wikiproject subpage of all of the notable hockey athletes that still need an article. You put all of the players that already have an article in the category. How's that?--<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid"><tt><b><font style="background:green" color="white">&#160;The ikiroid&#160;</font></b></tt></a> 18:11, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personally, I believe that with the changes we are implementing to the lists (see: <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_players_Y_61da.html" title="NHL players Y">NHL players Y</a>, they are valuable to keep as articles. Give us a chance to make these lists encyclopedic. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 04:34, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
