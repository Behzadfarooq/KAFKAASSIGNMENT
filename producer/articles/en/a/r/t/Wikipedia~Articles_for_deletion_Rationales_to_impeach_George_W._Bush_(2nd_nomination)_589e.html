<dd>Feel free to move this comment if it's in the wrong place, but I don't see how 32 deletes and 14 keeps is a "clear consensus", at least not if you're using the word <i>consensus</i> the way I understand it. It's just about 70% which is borderline for AfD, and barely describable as <i>supermajority</i>, much less <i>consensus</i>. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 03:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Be that as it may, I wrote that before I realized that this was inappropriately closed after just 27 hours, so the point is now moot until five days have passed. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 03:47, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On that ground, I agree with the reopening. Perhaps this didn't turn out to be a good occasion to bypass process... -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 03:54, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm not too sure about the closing early, but vote-counting as a reason to overturn another administrator's close is bloody stupid. You'd be better off taking it to DRV, where (hopefully) they'd tell you to pull your head in for promoting the incorrect view that the tally is in any way meaningful. <i><b>AfD is not a vote.</b></i> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 04:13, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Have you read anything that I said above? I did not reopen this because of the vote count, I reopened because it should never have been closed since the closing was clearly against policy. And if the vote was properly closed, Cyde needs to have explained <i>why</i> he ruled as he did. Does this kind of thing happen often at AfD? I would have had my head handed to me for such cavalier action at RfA. Ah, which brings me to "pull my head in". Oh my, do you think that could actually happen? I think perhaps you are a little fuddled, Mark.&#160;:D -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 04:47, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is merely a soapbox for Wikipedia editors who want George W. Bush impeached. We already have an article called Movement to impeach George W. Bush, which in my opinion is informative and NPOV. It should also be of note that some editors who want this page here and are frequent editors to this page initiated a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Merecat_3be5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Merecat">bad faith RfC against Merecat</a>, who was trying to make the page conform to NPOV. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueGoose_a607.html" title="User:BlueGoose">BlueGoose</a> 21:09, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>A vile and very not good faith assertion. You are well aware Merecat kept deleting things that were well sourced material. To say the RFC was an attack is ridiculous. All he has to do is stop deleting sourced material, and start discussing!<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a>
<ul>
<li>Didn't you also call something I wrote "vile"? I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt because you're not a native speaker of English, but calling something or someone "vile" is fairly extreme, and in the context of a human being is a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 00:55, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 18:25, 3 May 2006 (UTC) Actually, merecat is the one who was operating in bad faith, and the RFC against him was founded on totally cogent grounds. Merecat was being abusive, was using ad hominem and straw man arguments, and was otherwise nitpicking over Alternet, despite the fact that Alternet is in this case and for these purposes a completely valid reference, due to its membership in the group of people at large who are making rationales for impeachment. Blue goose, you are just spewing bile ignorantly. You have made no edits, and are factually ignorant as far as i can tell about anything to do with the article. Your comments below to the effect that this is mostly from a "single book" are further evidence that you simply aren't paying attention and don't know what you are talking about. The facts are that millions of people think Bush should be impeached, and the article reflects a very broad set of citations to reflect this. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 18:25, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

As a side note, I am surprised that you would want a page of noise showing that you are being a manipulative nitpicker using ad hominem and straw man arguments to be used as any kind of evidence. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 18:25, 3 May 2006 (UTC) I am sorry if i failed to follow some protocol.

While I categorically reject the users right to delete my materials, and am thus at odds with them, it seems likely and probable that they were jsut trying to make the scene more livable.

<dd>My point is to draw attention to the concurrent arrival of that editor and all the anon IP editors who caused havoc there tonight. I make no assertions and I draw no conclusions, but I think that the correlation in the arrival times is worth looking at. Is 205.188.116.13 actually one and the same as the IP vandals of tonight? I don't know. To me it seems likely, but others here can decide that for themselves. Are some editors who are opposed to this AfD making edits as anons towards the aim of messing up the pages to obscure the edit history?

<li><b>keep</b> Merecat and etc are just pov pushers of the republican agenda, and this is driven by that agenda. This article is a reasonable exploration of the factual rationales to impeach, which are now noteworthy enough to warrant an article. The idea that anybody arguing for impeachment needs to "read and study" is an ad hominem and silly; There are dozens of cogent reasons to impeach, and this is just a petty invalidation of those facts.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 22:32, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

Fine, I apologize for including you, since i don't know enough about you to know whether or not this is partisan antics. Merecat and Bluegoose on the other hand are known to me to be simple obstructionist republican game the system trolls. This is NOT a soap box, it IS a REPORT on the factual rationales of literally thousands of people in the USA and millions of people Globally on why Bush and Co should be impeached. That is a factual movement, and it is factually noteworthy, and it is not a soap box. If it were a soap box, it would be a very large soap box, it would have to be an intercontinental sized soap box. "Soap Box" is an invalidation and an ad hominem, and has no substance. So give me a REAL reason why you want the article deleted.</dd>

It is a long page, by all means feel free to be more specific. I have copied and pasted one section here. "Not a Soapbox." This article is not a Soap box. It is a factual report about the rationales used by the movement to impeach. You have made no valid point. Nobody has offered a single cogent reason why the article should be deleted. Again. What is the REAL reason you want the article deleted? ANSWER; There is next to no way to defend against it. The rationales are grounded in fact. You don't have an argument, so you are gaming the system. I'd be happy to help you generate a defense argument. I can't promise it will be cogent, but at least it will provide a POV balance. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 20:35, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You are thinking of the article <i>"People suggesting impeachment of Bush."</i> Clearly, this is not what this article is about. It offers several <b>arguments</b> in favour of impeachment, and to address the inevitable demand for censorship based on POV-OR allegations, numerous sources have been used to substantiate what is being presented. To object to sources is to invite a new AFD and it violates wikipedia policy.<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a> 10:58, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not objecting to sources. What I am objecting to is the bloating of <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> (and the article under discussion here) with such excessive detail that the editors can't even fit the reasons why some people want to impeach President Bush into the "Movement" article. Note that <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> covers that president's entire life from birth to death, including not just his impeachment but the rest of his presidency as well, in half the space used by <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> -- and Johnson actually <b>was</b> impeached. I recognize that there is a movement to impeach President Bush which is sufficiently notable for a Wikipedia article, so I'm not calling for the deletion of <i>that</i> article, but I am saying that the pro-impeachment movement does not need <i>two</i> articles each twice the length of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> to be described and explained. Therefore, as a second choice, I would support a merger of <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationales_provided_by_advocates_of_the_impeachment_of_George_W._Bush_8ea4.html" title="Rationales provided by advocates of the impeachment of George W.

The problem here is probably that this isn't explicitly stated. That reference is relevant to the defense effort. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 20:12, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Wikipedia is not a soapbox Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:</p>
<p>Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a "sympathetic point of view" for every article."</p>
<p>The article is NOT a soap box, it is in fact a report about a factual movement, and that movements factual rationales. If it was a soap box, one or two persons and their socks would be writing it from their own heads. This is a factual article, regarding factual events, and factual rationales, generated by factual and noteworthy groups of people, who are demonstrated to be factually noteworthy for the purposes of wikipedia by means of the creation of the "movement to impeach" article.</p>
<p>This VFD is just more gaming the system, partisan obstructionism, and manipulations and con artistry, and that is all it is. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 02:46, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

In fact, my opinion is that Mr. Bushes personal page should be treated in some senses as if it were his own virtual "user" page, and that information in that article should be confined to the facts as he might present them himself, were he the sole author. However much i may disagree with Bush or the admin, He is still the President of the United States Currently, and is deserving of a certain amount of respect. I believe that merging this article into Mr. Bushes personal article would be an unconsiable attack on his person. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 20:20, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>His relentless comments regarding my person are tiresome. Needless to say he once again misrepresents his actions. When Merecat deletes referenced material I object, which everybody else would. When he continues to delete and then refuses to discuss, I object. This editor undoubtedly has the best intentions, however it seems he has problems argumenting his case and therefore resorts to assertions, ad hominem attacks, and other behaviour not helpful. Regarding the links, it is a fine example of Merecat refusing to discuss. Further, for an editor that uses rightwing sources it is utterly hypocritical to object to leftwing sources. Beyond that, nobody prevents him from inserting rightwing sources. Last, nowhere in wikipedia can we find anything about how many references can be used. Alleging it does, again shows the technique of making misleading assertions.<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a> 11:08, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>strong keep</b> This article only claims to be exactly what it is titled: Rationales to impeach George Bush. And goes on to give exactly that, stated rationales to impeach George Bush. It is clear and easy to follow, it is thorough, although I could add some more reasons myself, and will after some research to substiantiate my claims. It states facts, something essential to an entry to an encyclopedia. It is well referenced. I say please keep it. It is one of the few politically oriented or controverisial articles I've seen on Wikipedia for a while that is not biased, just plain factual. <b>However, if any of you use this as an excuse to further harrass Merecat or anyone else, I will oppose you openly and relentlessly.</b> Let's all behave ourselves now and continue to work on this great article. <i>Maggie</i><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">thewolfstar</a> 09:28, 3 May 2006 (UTC) (I corrected my grammer above and boldified some text) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">thewolfstar</a> 09:32, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Reasons: i agree with Thewolfstar - my general impression is:
<ul>
<li>it's a list of well-referenced, externally documented facts, and claims of facts NPOV-presented as "claims"</li>
<li>the nature of the content <b>is</b> political, but so is the article about any politician - s/he is important because s/he has political power - all the more importantly that ordinary citizens can work together to document facts (except for personal data like address and sex life) related to that politician</li>
<li>BlueGoose wrote: <i>This article is merely a soapbox for Wikipedia editors who want George W. Bush impeached.</i> The same argument could say that <b>any article on a politician is a soapbox for electing or reelecting that politician to office</b>. We do not delete articles on Bush, Clinton, Clinton-Rodham, Kerry, Blair despite the fact that these articles, in some sense, constitute soapboxes. Instead, we NPOV individual sentences and the page structure, if needed, in order that we have NPOV presentation of externally documented, "verifiable", no-original-research facts.</li>
<li>My impression from the discussion page is that the people objecting to the article are unable or unwilling to find externally documented claims that individual "rationales" for impeaching Bush are false. Rather than deleting the page, i would suggest that people unhappy with the page <b>do the work of finding externally documented facts such as, e.g., source X [reference] notes that the invasion of Iraq was legal under US law because it only consisted of "forceful operations" and did not legally constitute a "war"</b> - (this is just a fictional example).</li>
<li>the <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> article is too long to include the rationales there - people involved in that movement may be morally and/or legally justified, they may be morally and/or legally wrong, but the fact is that they are active in the movement - splitting their reasons (rationales) into this article makes sense</li>
<li><b>NPOV title change</b>: look for <i>Ad 1 The title</i> on the discussion page - IMHO the present title "rationales to impeach George W. Bush" <b>could</b> be interpreted to mean that the rationales are correct. IMHO the following two options should remove concerns that the subject may be POV:
<ul>
<li><b>Reasons cited for seeking George W. Bush's impeachment</b> - <i>reasons</i> is a more common word than <i>rationales</i>, we're not doing neo-postmodernist-poststructuralist reading of hermeunistic narratives here</li>
<li><b>Purported impeachable offenses of George W. Bush</b> - except that a simpler word than "purported" would be better, see previous point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both of these make it clear that wikipedia neither asserts that the rationales/reasons are valid nor that they are invalid, only that various people (listed in the "movement" article) have stated or cited these reasons. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 11:44, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's already gone up for AfD and failed due to lack of consensus -- less than a month ago! This is a waste of time. Additionally, this article covers some important information - for those of us going, "what? people are trying to impeach Bush?!," it's a handy list. And before you bash me or go ad hominid, I'll admit: I'm a registered Democrat, and I don't like Bush. However, what I do like are well-researched explanations of the rationale behind current events, and that's what this is. It's not original research because these are the reasons cited by those in the movement (which, I do believe is a bit extreme, but they are people of prominence), and it's not POV for the same reason. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanet13_ca5f.html" title="User:Janet13">Janet13</a> 16:48, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

I'm going to go out on a limb here, and maybe this may not be the best Wikipedian thing to do, but is there some middle ground where we can find consensus. Common sense tells me the last thing we need is a page that is not worthy for an encyclopedia, which is exactly how I feel about this article, and the mere removal of tags will not improve the quality of the article because the tags are there for a reason. On the other hand, the positions of the keeps who have not been editing on this page (which I would say is 7 keeps approximately) is intriguing. The one idea that I'm interested, though I'm not totally convinced yet with, is a page rename. Would this alleviate the problems with this article or is this article totally unsalvageable? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueGoose_a607.html" title="User:BlueGoose">BlueGoose</a> 18:08, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm the only merge? Weird... I could've sworn I saw a few others. Perhaps they were from the earlier nom. Anyways, I think a page rename would help in that the name itself is arguably POV, but that's not the only problem with the article. The larger problem, as I see it, is that it is in some ways the completion of a POV fork which was begun with <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a>. So here's my other suggestion: <b>Merge</b> to articles such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush%27s_first_term_as_President_of_the_United_States_f72b.html" title="George W. Bush's first term as President of the United States">George W.

Together, these articles make up an appropriate place for the information; once it's been distributed, <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> (which strikes me as already the only claim this page has to not being an OR essay) can simply link to sections within those articles. Each point will then be packaged with its context, and redundancy will be sharply reduced. I realize that this is probably the most time-consuming by far of all the suggested options, and will cause reverberations in those subsidiary articles as an NPOV equilibrium is reestablished.

<li><b>Attempt at synthesis so far.</b> It seems to me that there would probably be consensus that:
<ul>
<li><b>Reasons cited for seeking George W. Bush's impeachment</b> or <b>Purported impeachable offenses of George W. Bush</b> is a subject which should be <b>somewhere</b> as part of a wikipedia article, provided that it is written in an NPOV way and properly referenced to external sources.</li>
<li>some people suggest that relevant content from this article should be salvaged and merged into <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a></li>
<li>some people suggest merging into <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush%27s_second_term_as_President_of_the_United_States_8ad5.html" title="George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States">George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States</a> or similar</li>
<li>A necessary criterion for merging into another page is page length - but the present page source text is <b>42 kbytes</b> long right now (according to mediawiki), so would require removing a huge amount of material, especially since there would also be the material of the page into which this would be merged. i don't see any easy NPOV way of condensing the article by such a big factor.</li>
<li>Given such a sensitive subject - after all Bush is the president of the world's most powerful military State - surely any claims of reasons why Bush should be impeached need to be referenced, so removing the references - which are a big part of the article source text - would be dangerous for any chance of consensing on NPOV.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> mostly concentrates on the <b>people</b> and groups or organisations who are trying to impeach Bush - dividing this up from the actual reasons they allege are valid to impeach Bush seems reasonable to me - i don't see any other obvious solution</li>
<li>pages like <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush%27s_second_term_as_President_of_the_United_States_8ad5.html" title="George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States">George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States</a> are bound to get longer in the future since (even if an impeachment process gets going) he's going to be president for quite some time yet - i don't see how there's room to fit in an extra 42 kbytes somehow thinned out without removing relevant material.</li>
<li>So maybe it's worth asking these questions to both "keepers" and "deleters" and people not-so-easy-to-classify:
<ul>
<li>Does anyone claim that <b>Reasons cited for seeking George W. Bush's impeachment</b> or <b>Purported impeachable offenses of George W. Bush</b> should <b>not be documented in any wikipedia article</b>?</li>
<li>Can anyone explain (with some level of detail) how <b>Reasons cited for seeking George W. Bush's impeachment</b> or <b>Purported impeachable offenses of George W. Bush</b> can be merged into another article without removing relevant content and state which other article that is?</li>
<li>Does anyone object to renaming the present article to <b>Reasons cited for seeking George W. Bush's impeachment</b> or <b>Purported impeachable offenses of George W. Bush</b>?
<ul>
<li>BD2412's suggestion of <b>Rationales provided by advocates of the impeachment of George W. Bush</b> seems like a good idea too - long, but clearly NPOV. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 22:14, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal additional comment modifying my earlier comment - i think that <b>some</b> of the article needs to be more NPOV-ed - there are some statements that are POV or borderline POV. But this is not a reason for deleting the article, it's a reason for making small appropriate edits, doing things step-by-step and discussing them on the discussion page if there's any chance that they'll be controversial. And it's something which can probably happen more constructively if there's agreement on an NPOV title of the article. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 22:08, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
