<li><b>Keep</b> It furnishes an integration of information not found in the other articles. <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Old_West_16e1.html" title="American Old West">American Old West</a> comes closest, but does not even mention the 1862 Sioux uprising which is in this article, and is full of {fact} tags. <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_United_States_afd6.html" title="Western United States">Western United States</a> leaves out a lot of info in this article and includes a lot about the present day, and covers geographically all the way to Hawaii. There was far more to the Western Frontier than the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Desert_a108.html" title="North American Desert">North American Desert</a>. A reader might not want to plow through <a href="../../../s/i/o/Sioux.html" title="Sioux">Sioux</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/o/Sioux_Uprising_da76.html" title="Sioux Uprising">Sioux Uprising</a> to get the info included succinctly here. The "Western Frontier" deserves an article, and the need for coverage of it as an integral subject is not met by the other articles mentioned, since they are only in small part about the Western Frontier and include much that is not about it. If this one reads like written by a junior high student, so do half the other articles on Wikipedia, so it will fit right in, and benefit from collaborative editing as do other articles. I would only caution the authors to add inline references as they go in addition to the Wikilinks to other articles. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:38, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete and salt</b></s>. First off, the title is horrible. If nothing else, it should be retitled as "The <u><i>American</i></u> Western Frontier", but that doesn't get rid of the other problems with the title. Depending upon which time frame you choose in American history, the "Western Frontier" could be anything from what is now <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_4016.html" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a> to frontier Alaska. Then on to the article itself, which is just a bunch of vague assertions and rather random events. There should probably be a good basic overview on this part of American history, but it should be titled something like Post-Civil War expansion of the United States, which would gives a brief overview on each topic, and would then link to the main articles on the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_American_War_4afd.html" title="Mexican American War">Mexican American War</a>, the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_Pioneers_48eb.html" title="Mormon Pioneers">Mormon Pioneers</a>, the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Gold_Rush_e2d6.html" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a>, etc. <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green">Blank</font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017">Verse</font></sup></a></i> 04:20, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I was just about to post something similar - there might be a case for something like a timeline or a very broad synopsis, but it would have to be very heavily wiki-linked and let the individual articles speak for themselves. Even then it would be very difficult to keep the scope limited and the POV neutral, since there are thousands of articles about the American West during this period, many of which are unflattering to at least one of the primary parties. Whatever the result might be, its not <i>this</i> article which has no citations, is full of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a> and many parts fail <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <b>Delete</b> this version, and see if anybody is brave enough to try again. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 06:00, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Changed to <b>Neutral</b>. With a much better title at The Indian Wars of the Great Plains, that solves only one of my complaints about the article. Still, I'm going to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> that <a href="../../../a/2A/s/User%7EA_star_actress_6137.html" title="User:A*star actress">A*star actress</a> will work to improve the article, changing the tone of the article to a less 'breezy', more encyclopedic version, plus adding more details and more dates. The other serious problem is the complete lack of any references, but hopefully she will also take care of that as well. <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green">Blank</font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017">Verse</font></sup></a></i> 05:16, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Keep but rename</b></s> This article is not about the Western Frontier or else it would discuss the westward expansion of pioneers in prairie schooners, the Mormons, cattlemen vs. sheepherders, railroads, gold rushes and other mining, etc. etc. etc. This article as it now stands is about the American wars against the Indians. Fine, name it accordingly. BTW, I looked at the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_United_States_afd6.html" title="Western United States">Western United States</a> article and that article needs work. How can you hope to dump all of those states in a single "region"? California is different from the Pacific Northwest which is different from the Southwest and the other Western states are different from those regions. I also looked at the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Old_West_16e1.html" title="American Old West">American Old West</a> and it's got problems too. For now, let's keep all the articles but there needs to be some serious re-organization to rationalize all these articles. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 01:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm sorry if this is difficult for you to understand. Let's put it as simply as possible: An acceptable source is one that other people besides you can check. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 16:21, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In other words, if the authenticity of the journal in your possession was verified by an expert in culture of the Old American West and the contents of the journal were published for the world to see, then it would qualify as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Otherwise, nobody else can verify that this journal really exists, that it is authentically of the period in question and not a 20th century forgery and that it is not the fictional product of from the imagination of some Easterner imagination who never set foot west of the Mississippi. Sorry, I don't mean to malign your integrity but these kinds of issues are what are behind the Wikipedia standards for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 03:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>What about my boyfriend, my parents, my grandparents, my brothers, my sisters, my jr. high and high school teachers, the people that live in the apartment building I do, the other students here at MIT, my boyfriend's best friend, my group of friends, college professors, my aunts, uncles, couisins, etc. Don't they count? Because they are other people besides me.</li>

<li>We can't verify any of them, either, can we? If it isn't published somewhere that we can see, we can't verify it.

<li>Fan-1967 is right, Actress. Anything on Wikipedia has to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, we can't just take your word for it.

<dd>First of all, many journals are published, and a large collection is available on line as "Womens diaries of the western journey". Manuscript sources are problematic, and work with them would normally be considered OR here. But I do not see how the article depends on any of this,for everything described is well-known history, and any 2 good american history textbooks would do as the sources. One is already given. Many individual parts could also be sourced, &amp; for Chief Josephs famous speech not to be given a specific reference is not careful work.</dd>

<li>It is only a fairly good high school essay, and that it is better than the material in WP says something about us. It could be turned into an article, with help. Most good WP articles have not been written by a single person, as this is. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:20, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, and I do from time to time jump in and improve an article to save it from deletion. I have done this successfully on more than one occasion (e.g. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_in_Mexico_c906.html" title="Crime in Mexico">Crime in Mexico</a>,<a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty_in_India_b565.html" title="Poverty in India">Poverty in India</a>. In this case, however, I think I will wait until this AFD closes as I would like to see how the consensus turns out before putting in a lot of effort. Can we agree to my recommendation above? That is, we will redirect this title to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Old_West_16e1.html" title="American Old West">American Old West</a>, delete <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-Civil_War_Expansion_of_the_United_States_b8ff.html" title="Post-Civil War Expansion of the United States">Post-Civil War Expansion of the United States</a> and defer a decision on The Indian Wars of the Great Plains for a couple of weeks to see if it is improved to Wikipedia's standards of quality. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 03:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
