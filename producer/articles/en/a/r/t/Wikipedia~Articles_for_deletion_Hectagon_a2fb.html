<li><b>Keep</b>. These seem like valid stubs to me. I'm not sure whether "notability" is the right criterion to judge mathematical abstractions by.

<dd>Well, mathematicians do actually write about mathematical abstractions, even if only a dozen specialists care about those abstractions--those dozen people might well write a dozen papers each on their favorite abstractions, making them pass the notability test.

<dd>Curiosity isn't sufficient reason to keep it. And certainly math terms should need to be notable--otherwise, I could make up my own math terms that only I use and add them. It's certainly a pretty common practice in math to make up a new term to describe whatever you're talking about, whenever there isn't one that describes it well. But we shouldn't have articles on those terms unless they're in common usage. Similarly, we shouldn't have articles on topics that nobody writes about. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 00:09, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is already a list of named polygons. It's in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygon.html" title="Polygon">Polygon</a>.

<dd>Yeah, I'm aware of polygon naming conventions. I thought it might just be useful to have a chart, but I suppose the one already at polygon does a fair enough job combined with the naming conventions. Fair point, nothing to merge, amending accordingly. Also, as long as we're bundling in the less-than-useful polygons, perhaps consider <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tricontagon.html" title="Tricontagon">tricontagon</a>, unless Michelob trivia is sufficient notability.

<li><b>Delete all unless references provided to demonstrate notability</b> There are an infinite number of polygons, so obviously we can't write individual articles about every single one. More importantly, the articles provide no references showing that these specific polygons are notably mentioned in outside publications. All articles, including mathematical ones that are otherwise accurate, need to provide references to establish the information is not only correct but notable enough to be talked about. Now if these articles can find outside, verifiable mentions and uses or mathematical discussions about one of these specific polygons, then go ahead an do an article about it and include that information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:59, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Many of the articles on abstract polygons like this have already been deleted. While notability may be a difficult thing to prove in and of itself, this article is useful intellectually because of its place as one in a series (and I mean that as <i>seperately</i> from the polygon article). I came to the Hexagon page wanting to know if a three dimensional construct was possible only containing hexagons (a soccer ball has pentagons in it). Instead I got side-tracked by the polygons series box at the bottom of its page. After reading about Pentadecagon and the like I wondered how quickly polygons visually descend into simply appearing as circles. It only took two clicks on the Pentacontagon and Tricontagon articles to read the stubs and satisfy my curiosity. Given the articles already exist and noone is proposing to add hundreds of other intermediate shapes, I feel keeping short stubs on polygons at 30, 50 and 100 sides has value in and of itself. 193.129.65.37 07:05, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep or merge</b> The comment (way, way) above stating that there's nothing worth merging in this article is incorrect. The illustrations are helpful, for instance in showing when polygons become visually indistinct from circles (see comment by 193.129.65.37). That may mean these articles need merging into polygon but their pictures shouldn't be lost from Wikipedia. Perhaps someone versed in human psychology could come up with an "XXX-agon" article saying "for the majority of human beings this is the last shape visably distinguishable from a circle, in which case I'd vote to delete or merge these pieces into that. Until an XXX-agon article appears I think the current arrangement works just fine. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 07:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Both you and the IP user above you are arguing essentially that they are useful because they show you how quickly the polygons begin to look like circles?

It might possibly be worth mentioning on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygon.html" title="Polygon">Polygon</a> that many-sided polygons were used to approximate pi, due to their being nearly circular, with a link to <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">pi</a>. I think that would solve this issue. And any issue that can be solved with a passing mention of an unrelated article isn't worth having several articles about. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 09:42, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know what the IP user's arguing but he influenced me in my opinion vis-a-vis the illustrations have merit. To quote myself: "these articles need merging into polygon but their pictures shouldn't be lost from Wikipedia". If the consensus is that the articles should be delted, I'm happy with that but I don't think the illustrations should be lost. And the Polygon article (which is a bit "listy" at present) could do with more pictures. I still say <b>merge</b> the pictures, or failing that <b>keep</b> the article. I agree with you, certainly, that "many-sided polygons were used to approximate pi" should definitely be in the polygon article. Perhaps the illustrations from these articles to be deleted could be used to show the point? It might work well... <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 10:37, 24 January 2007 (UTC) P.S. --&gt; I'm happy with tetracontagon being <b>deleted</b> - there's nothing worth saving there.

I'm not entirely happy to be following this route, but the article itself costs little.

<dd>The problem with this is that if a 100-gon really were significant, someone would have written something about it at some point, <i>but no one ever has</i>. An article is pretty cheap, yes, but a redirect is cheaper and easier to maintain. It's not that I particularly mind having an article on any subject you like--I just think that if we can't write more than a sentence about it, we shouldn't have a separate article for it.

And the circle-like pictures are only for regular polygons. <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_polygon.html" title="Regular polygon">Regular polygon</a> has a table which might add angle, although the formula is trivial.

<li><b>redirect</b> the WP standards are useless in this case. Any geometric figure is notable, if there is something to say about it. But in his case there isn't much. (&amp; hectagon is probably the wrong word ', as several people pointed out) Undoubtedly a few textbooks of some vintage could be unearthed that happened to mention it but it would take a look at the table of contents of every geometry textbook of even actually looking through the books) to find them. This will even be possible once Google finishes scanning all the books, but the sort of book that might have this will be nobody's priority. Apparently we have none in hand today, and next year we have two. So, it isn't notable now, but it would be then. Multiple nontrivial published works. There are many gradations in that, but the standards don't recognize them. Rules of thumb are approximations, and have to be treated as such. A statement that "someone would have written about it" is meaningless without an operational definition, and the available technology to see that is not available. We deal with that by saying the default is "not notable"--which makes the notability of something dependent on the amount of work devoted to the article.</li>

<dd>While I agree in principle that these need to go (I nominated them, after all), your reasoning isn't sound. If there really are books of which this is the subject (even just a single section specifically devoted to it in a few books would probably be enough) then we need to keep the article. Its notability isn't dependent on the books being easy to access. When I nominated them I did so in part due to lack of any online, easily-accessible sources that would prove notability, but mostly because my experience tells me that it's likely that no sources exist--electronically or in print--that could prove it to be notable. If I thought that there were print sources, I would have gone to the library and found them, rather than nominating the articles for deletion. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 00:26, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One does not expect books about topics like this. I do not think any of the sources for hexagon for is a book about hexagons. (and similarly for everything beyond there), in the sense that a book on trigonometry is a book about the properties of triangles. I could not agree more that the material will be difficult to find. Almost all detailed scientific &amp; mathematical subjects will be of this nature. What is usually looked for on WP seems to be a significant mention in a book--not just a list of terms, but a discussion giving information from which an article could be written. As I said at first, I dont think this is readily findable, and thus I joined wha ti think is the general feeling, to merge, as the practical solution. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:10, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think you misunderstand me somewhat: I do not know of any book called "Hexagons: Their Story" or such, but I do know that hexagons are mentioned quite frequently in literature--in particular, crystalline structures take the form of regular polygons (in some way; I am no expert on crystallography), hexagons included. See <a href="../../../h/e/x/Hexagonal_crystal_system.html" title="Hexagonal crystal system">Hexagonal crystal system</a>. That probably ought to be mentioned in <a href="../../../h/e/x/Hexagon.html" title="Hexagon">Hexagon</a>, actually. The point I was trying to make was that one <i>does</i> expect books about--at least in part--pretty much any topic of note. Mathematicians (and scientists in general) turn out a stunning amount of text in the course of a year. It's rarely difficult to find at least some mention of any topic, however noteworthy it may or may not be. Well, that's enough.

<dd>This is quite interesting, but a regular polygon having for its side "half the side of the equilateral triangle inscribed in the same circle" hardly can have 100 sides. I am too lazy to calculate what it should be, but it seems it can have 7 or 8 sides (both of which are likely candidates to be misspelt as "hectagon"). (Actually, by some trigonometry jotted down on the back of an envelope, I am not sure that any regular polygon can have side one half etc.) --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 11:34, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
