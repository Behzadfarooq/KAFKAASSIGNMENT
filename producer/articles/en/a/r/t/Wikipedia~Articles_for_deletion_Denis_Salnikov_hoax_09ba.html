<p>Vandalism: The user who created this page also made edits to other eXile pages which were designed to vilify the newspaper or its contributors rather than give information; Strange POV; Factually incorrect: how is it a "hoax" if there is no evidence that Salnikov is a pseudonym? There is evidence that this entry and others by user 199.107.55.222 are part of a campaign by <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Green_Footballs_498d.html" title="Little Green Footballs">Little Green Footballs</a> readers who vowed revenge on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_eXile_ffcc.html" title="The eXile">the eXile</a> following the <a href="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=16892" class="external text" title="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=16892" rel="nofollow">recent posting</a> of an article by <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Brecher_4fcc.html" title="Gary Brecher">Gary Brecher</a>, who also came under attack by 199.107.55.222.</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b>: Hi Mark. I'm sorry but I don't quite understand. The <b>eXILE VfD</b> was initiated by User:199.107.55.222 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/The_eXile&amp;diff=21002527&amp;oldid=21002410" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/The_eXile&amp;diff=21002527&amp;oldid=21002410" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This was a very strongly worded VfD against an article on the eXILE magazine, and seems to have been motivated by reasons other than a concern for WP policy. When VfD editors started disagreeing with User:199.107.55.222's take on the article, he actually reworded his VfD even more harshly. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/The_eXile&amp;diff=21007279&amp;oldid=21003667" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/The_eXile&amp;diff=21007279&amp;oldid=21003667" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The article proposed by malathion for deletion is a piece on one Denis Salnikov. It was <i><b>written by</b></i> User:199.107.55.222 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denis_Salnikov_hoax&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denis_Salnikov_hoax&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. From start to end, this article appears to be an unrelenting personal attack of Mr. Salnikov, and as malathion points out, there is no modifying view to counter the strident POV by the author. For some reason User:199.107.55.222 does not seem very fond of either eXILE or its employees. Anyway, I voted to <b>delete</b> this as it looks like a transparent attack piece. There is some question over whether it qualifies as a speedy; I think it just might under <b><a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">A6</a></b>, which states that short articles that exist simply to disparage their subjects are candidates for speedy (the shortness of short is not defined). I don't think malathion agrees with that route, but there I agree with him about <b>delete</b>. Have I missed something about the article that convinced you it should stay?

<li>Let me clarify: I think this is a worthwhile topic, that should be included in Wikipedia. Clearly the current version of the article is far from the standard set by the most brilliant prose on Wikipedia, but that means it should be improved, rather than deleted. I don't care whether the article is merged, renamed, etc. I'm merely stating my opinion that the "Denis Salnikov" affair is a topic that's, uhm, keep-worthy. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 01:53, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mark, we are in fundamental agreement. The only reason my vote (delete) differs from yours (keep) is that I'm looking at this from the closer's POV, in which he has to decide whether the page at "Denis Whatsisname hoax" has to be deleted, or kept. Because we all agree the title is itself biased, it should be deleted (or as you say, "renamed"). A redirect is unsuitable for the same reason, and unnecessary if the new title contains his name anyway. I have absolutely no objection whatsoever to anyone writing an article now or in the future with a suitable title ("Denis Whatsis") and dealing with it with the NPOV. The reason I didn't vote "merge" is that there is nothing in the article that needs to be merged, there is no other article at present to merge to, and currently the article is itself an unrelenting personal attack from start to end, such that it really should be deleted on sight. WP should have as many good articles as possible and as few poor ones; but it should have zero personal attacks. Kind regards—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a>&#160; 16:31:05, 2005-08-18 (UTC)</li>

<p>Rename to Denis Salnikov or <b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_eXile_ffcc.html" title="The eXile">the eXile</a>, (edited see below). we should give an NPOV account of how it has been suggested that this is a fictional/satirical character, explain how his club review style etc. relates to eXile's style, and how he relates to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Russian_a111.html" title="New Russian">novi ruskii</a> phenomenon. this personage is notable, even if he doesn't deserve its own article <a href="../../../d/s/o/User%7EDsol_459f.html" title="User:Dsol">Dsol</a> 16:36, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Dsol</b>, the reason I urged <b>delete</b> is that the title seems to me irretrivably one sided. If the title page was just "David Whatsisname", it would be fine to simply edit the article to introduce the NPOV. In fact that would be the best solution. But <i>this</i> title should to be deleted. If an editor is interested in starting an article on David after that, he is entirely free to do so.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a>&#160; 22:02:00, 2005-08-17 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> to Denis Salnikov or <b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_eXile_ffcc.html" title="The eXile">the eXile</a>, but absolutely <i>do not delete</i> as per <b>Dsol</b> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 04:37, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
OK, unless I've misunderstood something, there seems to be a disconnect here. Every one of the above voters is <b>saying the same thing</b>, but is using <b>different words to vote</b>. We agree: David Whatsis is notable, a good article on him is suitable for WP, the current article is a personal attack, the current title is too biased to be maintained even if a perfectly NPOV article on David is written in that title space. What this implies, I think, is a delete vote for the closer. When one says "<b>rename</b>", one is saying "<b>delete the page and start a new one with a new name</b>," because in effect that is what has to be done (if my understanding of the technical process is wrong I hope an admin will correct this statement). Do any one of the above voters have an objection to the following sequence of actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the page titled "Denis Salnikov hoax."</li>
<li>Open a new page titled "Denis Salnikov."</li>
<li>Write an NPOV article in that title space on David Salnikov.</li>
<li>Alternatively, instead of 2 and 3, write an NPOV accont of Denis Salnikov in the eXILE article.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you agree with the above, your vote is <b>delete</b>. If you disagree, it is <b>keep, keep/redirect</b>, or something else that requires <i><b>maintenance</b></i> of the page "Denis Salnikov hoax."
