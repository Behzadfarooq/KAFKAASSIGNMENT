<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>Most of the "delete" voters clearly expressed an opinion that a new entity can not generally be encyclopedia-worthy the day of its launch (or worse, the day prior) and that more time should be allowed before the decision is made to include it. The "keep" voters were less consistent in their reasoning. By strict vote-count, I count 20 "deletes", 20 "keep as is" (though ten of them had to be discounted as either anonymous or so new that they were indistinguishable from sockpuppets) and 6 "merge". Since the "merge" votes count as a variant of "keep", the decision to delete fails to meet the necessary concensus even though there is a clear majority (20 to 16) in favor of deletion. There is, however, an overwhelming concensus (26 to 10) that this should not remain as an independent article. Accordingly, I am going to call this one as a "merge and redirect". Relevant content has been merged with <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Rose_5701.html" title="Kevin Rose">Kevin Rose</a> per the recommendations below. (If anyone thinks I missed an important detail, you can view it in the page history and can merge it yourself.)</p>
<p>This decision should be considered binding until there is clear and convincing evidence that <i>Systm</i> is independently encyclopedia-worthy. That is usually taken to mean that the entity has been around long enough and has had enough general impact on society that a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> article of greater than <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a> length can be written and that the topic is widely enough known that we can expect the necessary critical mass of knowledgable reader/editors to keep the article <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">neutral</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:23, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete The Systm...</b> -- In the mid to late 90's The Screensavers on ZDTV/TechTV became a phenomenon that has spun-off MANY web-based shows with The Systm being one. If you remove The Systm you must also remove TWiT and The Broken. Don't remove any of these&#160;!!</li>

<dd>Friends was a popular sitcom syndicated over the world, seen by roughly a third of a billion people. Systm will be lucky to see 10,000 viewers. This should be regarded as nothing more than an amateur podcast that gets its article deleted every day from this encyclopedia. Nothing differs from the two. And, if you want to combat it, please - shed some intelligence. --<a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrmiscellanious_802d.html" title="User:Mrmiscellanious">Mrmiscellanious</a> 00:59, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

More importantly than that, given Kevin Rose's existing fan base and the quality of the show, Systm may very well define how the online TV format should be done.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> One episode and hardly any information available on its distribution/popularity. It doesn't deserve an article just because it is a side project of some D-list celebrity, and it doesn't have enough of a cult following (or content for that matter) to write about. Definitely watch for new developments, should this change. -- <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberpenguin_c2a8.html" title="User:Uberpenguin">uberpenguin</a> 02:50, 2005 Jun 1 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Merge</b> with Kevin Rose. On second thought, this would be better since it will add more content to that article but still keep the mention of it around so a new article isn't formed until there is enough information available to merit one. -- <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberpenguin_c2a8.html" title="User:Uberpenguin">uberpenguin</a> 02:52, 2005 Jun 1 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- This is big from <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Rose_5701.html" title="Kevin Rose">Kevin Rose</a> and I think videozines are something that will change media distribution, now that we know the Internet is able to help people get their message across faster. It'll be recreated at some point in the future, so what's the point in deleting this article? This isn't pointless "newb" stuff! People will want to know what Systm is and what the background of it is. Just keep it. <i>..... added at 01:26, 2005 Jun by 69.230.167.162</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I came to Wikipedia a moment ago specifically to look up Systm, and that's how I saw the VfD.
