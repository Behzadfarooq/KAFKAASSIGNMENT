<p>Article makes no assertion of notability. The one source referenced seems to say little aside from the fact that he intended to become a Communist, though I'm not certain how that makes someone notable - nor does dying of SARS. A Google search turns up at best a couple of obituaries, aside from Wiki mirrors and the like. Anyway, in case it wasn't clear, nominating as this seems not to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:42, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's notable beacuse it was covered by the media, and while I admit at the time of nomination that it didn't seem to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, I think it's a lot more clear that it does now. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 17:34, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> As <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#MEMORIAL" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a memorial</a>. It's unfortunate as it seems that <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">User:Mckaysalisbury</a>, the creator, is probably the son identified in the article. It's a sad situation, but the article does fail to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a> guidelines. This is not in any way a statement on the subject. <font color="CornflowerBlue"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo_0662.html" title="User:Leebo">Leebo</a></b></font> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo_c104.html" title="User talk:Leebo"><font color="#B22222">T</font></a></sup></small>/<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leebo_addb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leebo"><font color="#B22222">C</font></a></small> 16:53, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Also, note that I am *not* the son (Mickey) identified in the article. I think there are articles out there that make trivial mentionings of me, but let the record show that I am not claiming any semblance of notability for myself. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 17:34, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, I'm his son, and the creator of the article. But I'd like to think I can still debate this objectively. If anyone feels I'm debating this unobjectively, please let me know what I'm doing wrong. Also note that I have cleaned up the page, removed all OR, and sourced virtually everything.
<dl>
<dd>I think it's conclusively been shown that his death is notable, the numerous articles written surrounding his death can attest to that. There was extensive discussion about this on <a href="../../../j/a/m/Talk%7EJames_Earl_Salisbury_b1ee.html" title="Talk:James Earl Salisbury">the talk page</a>. Becuase he didn't contribute substantially to his field, some have said that he isn't notable. I think that the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> page has changed, because I'm not seeing that on there anymore. What I am seeing is the primary notability criterion: "A person is notable if he or she has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, intellectually independent, and independent of the subject." Which his death certainly satisfies, so I think the real question should be should this be an article about him, or about his death? <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> under "general" has two criteria that seem to be met:
<ol>
<li>Wide name recognition</li>
<li>Multiple features in credible news media.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>His name is recognized all across the country, particularly around Utah where the news coverage was heavier, but I had friends all across the country ask me if I was related to the James Salisbury that died. The plethora of news stories around his death permeated the US, because SARS was a big topic at the time. So clearly this criteria is met. The question still remains as to whether or not there should be an article about him, or just about his death. This is where the communist party link comes in. He had at least two newsworthy events in his life (I'd like to go back to get some of the things that he did while he was in college that were notable, but that's going to take a lot more work, *I* know that he did some things, but I don't have newspaper clippings handy, so right now those things, which are not currently covered in the article, are just OR.) So beacuse there are multiple, non-trivial mentionings, I think it's abundantly clear that the article about him should stay. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 17:31, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Thanks for being up-front about your connection to the subject, that kind of disclosure is appreciated. In any case, I'm not sure that the additions do much to establish notability - the second and third sources mention him but aren't about him. The fourth is currently coming up with an error but I'd assume based on the title that again, the article isn't about him so much as it may mention him. Only the first article could qualify as potential proof of notability as he is the subject of the secondary source, the remainder are all incidental coverage. Whether it's enough to pass muster I leave up to consensus to determine, and I appreciate you work in trying to improve the article, but my opinion remains unchanged. I also agree with <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo_0662.html" title="User:Leebo">Leebo</a> below, a more appropriate place for the info might be in another article. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:54, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are correct in that some of the sources are not about him, but in none of those cases are they a trivial mentioning. There are literally thousands of articles that mention him and his death, and I haven't even gone past the first page of google hits(google(James Salisbury SARS). If you'd like, I can bring up several newspaper articles which aren't available online that are about him specifically. I figure these sources are better than printed one because of the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> policy. I've added another few articles, if you still think that he's not notable enough.

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps it could be solved by merging some of the information into <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progress_of_the_SARS_outbreak_284b.html" title="Progress of the SARS outbreak">Progress of the SARS outbreak</a>.

<dd>Yes, I think he should be mentioned at that article (and I added him there), but that doesn't mean he shouldn't exist here too. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 17:55, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> You're probably already aware of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a>, so I won't harp on that, but these are my thoughts on disaster victims of various distinctions: Quite often the victims of disasters, or epidemics in this case, receive wide news coverage, but nearly all of it is linked directly with the event. Like you've said, his death is notable, but it's his death <i>in the context of the outbreak</i> that is notable. I feel that the best place to mention him is the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progress_of_the_SARS_outbreak_284b.html" title="Progress of the SARS outbreak">Progress of the SARS outbreak</a> article. His article doesn't really set his death into a particular context, other than that he died from SARS (a reader with no knowledge of the epidemic would be confused). <font color="CornflowerBlue"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo_0662.html" title="User:Leebo">Leebo</a></b></font> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo_c104.html" title="User talk:Leebo"><font color="#B22222">T</font></a></sup></small>/<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leebo_addb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leebo"><font color="#B22222">C</font></a></small> 18:07, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but what about the other event in his life notable enough to be brought up to the news media? Also, while I understand your opinion, I don't see how we should look at the outbreak for this article. This article is about a biography, so shouldn't we use the established guideline of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> rather than your own ideas about which articles to delete? <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 18:39, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, like I said above, if anyone thinks that my potential <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> is interfering with my neutrality, please state how I am doing so, so that I may correct my inappropriate actions. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 18:42, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Given the fact that you seem to be the lone proponent of keeping the article (at present), I would suggest that you disengage for a short time. The discussion will be ongoing for a week, during which time you can follow it's progress. By disengaging in this manner, you allow other potential supporters to step up and give their views. As it stands now, your continued advocacy seems to be campaigning. When this impression is combined with your admitted relation to the subject, a newcomer to the debate (such as myself) may begin to question your objectivity. I personally have not done enough research to voice an opinion for keep or delete, but I hope you consider my suggestion. <a href="../../../-/b/o/User_talk%7E-Bobby_2c83.html" title="User talk:-Bobby">→</a><a href="../../../-/b/o/User%7E-Bobby_56ae.html" title="User:-Bobby"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Bobby_0e62.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Bobby">←</a> 20:21, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
