<p>Proceedual nomination for deletion as begun by an IP user. <b>No stance at this time</b> -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 23:13, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am puzzled by this entry. If I understand right, an anonymous editor has nominated this article for deletion, but has indicated no grounds for the proposal. It is hard to see why an article on a topic harped upon on several Web sites should be excluded from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 05:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>At last a reason is proposed. However, the websites present the oath not as a rumour, but as a fact. Just look up the sites mentioned in the article. It is also published, as fact, in at least one fairly widely read book. One of the websites is that of the somewhat important <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_St._Pius_X_8d3f.html" title="Society of St. Pius X">Society of St. Pius X</a>. Another, to which Wikipedia does not allow links (but whose name includes "fisheaters"), no longer gives the oath as an undoubted fact, but it still says: "You should be familiar with the above form of the oath because it is often seen in traditionalist circles." "Often seen in traditionalist circles" - surely a very good reason why Wikipedia should speak of it. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 09:02, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: there does <i>seem</i> to have been a Papal oath at some point in time of little notability; but this article seems largely devoted to a Traditionalist Catholic conspiracy theory, no? Possibly this article could be renamed to reflect this, but I don't think articles should generally start out <i><b>X</b></i> <i>does not exist, but....</i> -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 19:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The article does not start out with "The Papal Oath does not exist." It starts by saying the Papal Oath is an oath (in fact a concrete existing oath, whose concrete existing text is quoted) that some (many, to judge by the number of times the text is quoted) Traditionalist Catholics firmly believe was until recently taken by all Popes at their coronation.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The article thus treats of an existing text and an existing belief. There are articles on other people's beliefs, e.g. Apostolic Succession, Papal Infallibility, "Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus" etc.</dd>
<dd>Kendrick's idea of moving the article to another title might be a good one. But what title? "Traditionalist Catholics' Belief in a Papal Coronation Oath Used from Agatho to Paul VI"? On the whole I prefer the present title.</dd>
<dd>Interesting the reference to the 1845 book. Does that book speak of the <i>Liber Diurnus</i> profession of faith published in 1680, or of the quite different text that today's traditionalist Catholics believe in and that the Wikipedia article is about? (In view of the ignorance of Latin displayed by the author of the oath the article is about, how could it have been written by any educated person of 1845?) Does that book say that the text it speaks of, whether or not it was the oath the Wikipedia article deals with, was used in nineteenth-century papal coronations? Unfortunately, Kendrick only gives a link to and quotes from a text (by the same author) that makes no mention whatever of any oath by any Pope. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 22:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps Papal Oath (Traditional Catholicism) would be OK, or perhaps some shorter version could just be merged into <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_Catholicism_3dc1.html" title="Traditional Catholicism">Traditional Catholicism</a>. I'm still concerned this falls under <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a>. You can find the passage cited above on google books. In Dowling's version, it is the Pope who forces all his bishops, in his specific example Saint <a href="../../../b/o/n/Boniface.html" title="Boniface">Boniface</a>, to take the oath over the grave of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html" title="Saint Peter">Saint Peter</a>. It isn't perfectly aligned with the text at <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_oath.html#The_text_of_the_alleged_oath" title="Papal oath">Papal_oath#The_text_of_the_alleged_oath</a>, but it's strikingly similiar.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This article concerns a real Papal Oath apparently used until the <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.vi.xiii.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.vi.xiii.html" rel="nofollow">11th century.</a> The story/legend that this oath was used until recently seems notable by its presence on numerous sites, and discussing an urban legend as urban legend is <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_create_hoaxes_fecb.html#Hoaxes_vs._articles_about_hoaxes" title="Wikipedia:Don't create hoaxes">fine with WP:HOAX</a>. However, as currently written this part of the article has the appearances of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, even if it is accurate. It lists a number of sources which treat the story/legend as fact, then criticizes them, but gives no sources repeating these criticisms, or even sources which state that it is an urban legend. Compare <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Franklin_Prophecy_3c29.html" title="The Franklin Prophecy">The Franklin Prophecy</a> which lists sources directly arguing against authenticity. It would be nice if at least one source could be cited which actually states these other sources are repeating a legend.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep, split and disambig</b> OK, I'm crossing out my original vote. If there was a real <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> oath, that's what the article should be about. Or we can split and disambig between the historical and the quasi-historical theories of the Traditionalists. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 00:16, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Copying a quote from the link. The latin text in the article seems to be the "solemn oath at their accession" mentioned here, given its specific mention of the sixth ecumenical council. However, there may not be a whole lot more to say about it other than the modern story/legend. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 03:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>An œcumenical Council, universally acknowledged in the East and in the West, held in Constantinople, 680, condemned and excommunicated Honorius, 'the former Pope of Old Rome,' as a heretic, who with the help of the old serpent had scattered deadly error.... The succeeding Popes down to the eleventh century, in a solemn oath at their accession, endorsed the sixth œcumenical Council, and pronounced 'an eternal anathema' on the authors of the Monothelite heresy, together with Pope Honorius, because he had given aid and comfort to the perverse doctrines of the heretics. The Popes themselves, therefore, for more than three centuries, publicly recognized, first, that an œcumenical Council may condemn a Pope for open heresy, and, secondly, that Pope Honorius was justly condemned for heresy. (From Philip Schaff, <i>Creeds of Christendom</i>, 1877)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Looking further at the Dowling passage, it seems to be talking about an oath of allegiance made to a Pope by someone else (there, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Gregory_II_e856.html" title="Pope Gregory II">Pope Gregory II</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Boniface_719b.html" title="Saint Boniface">Saint Boniface</a>). This article is supposedly about an oath the Pope makes at his own accession - attributed to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Agatho_013f.html" title="Pope Agatho">Pope Agatho</a> and the sixth ecumenical council. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 05:40, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Right, but I thought it was strikingly similiar to the oath the Traditionalists are talking about. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 05:59, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Even after reading all the above, I do not see why <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_Oath_4f14.html" title="Papal Oath">Papal Oath</a> - or "Papal Oath (Traditionalist Catholics)" or "Papal Coronation Oath (Traditionalist Catholics)" - should be treated any differently from <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirianism.html" title="Sirianism">Sirianism</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/%C4%91/Me%C4%91ugorje.html" title="Međugorje">Međugorje</a> or ...</dd>
<dd>As for "original research", surely <i>ungainsayable</i> statements are permissible. Do we need to quote a source for a statement like "two is more than one"? By the way, I have noticed that a recent (9 February 2007) contributor to a blog has written: "In response to Traditio in Radice's call for additional information on the papal coronation oath, we have done a little here in Rome. From an initial survey of the 'Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum' as it appears in Migne's Patrologia Latina, it would appear that the information given at Wikipedia, concerning it is more or less correct. I will try to see if I can find some of the more accurate versions of the document; otherwise I will simply send the text as it is found in PL." Would that count as a source, were one needed? But this source will, I suppose, soon disappear from the Internet.
<dl>
<dd>Something is "original research" if the argument is published first on WP. Can any source be cited that is aware of the story/legend of the traditionalists and says it is a legend? <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 20:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>My reading of the Papal Oath - not the profession of faith that at least one Pope sent to the representative at Ravenna of the Constantinopolitan emperor to ask for recognition of his election as Pope (and for how long did Ravenna and Rome remain under the emperor's power? certainly not "until the 11th century") - is that it was in part a "translation" from the <i>Liber Diurnus</i> text by someone with a very limited knowledge of Latin with just a few wishful-thinking additions.</dd>
<dd>There is no evidence that even the <i>Liber Diurnus</i> text (much less the "Papal Oath") was ever used as part of a papal coronation ceremony. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 09:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Rename</b> to "Papal Oath (Traditionalist Catholic)" per above, and focus on the Trad. Cath. theory about the Papal Oath. There appears to be very little outside of the Trad. Cath. POV to substantiate this. That said, it needs to be re-written with a little less disdain towards those who hold to the theory. -- <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 19:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>There is no reason to rename this with some arbitrary parenthetic disambiguation. The Liber Diurnus text is real. The article should be about that, and about the notable stories/legends of its use. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 20:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>Keep</s> but with a rewrite to cut down on the (apparently original) arguments. The source quoted section goes into much too bizarre detail about a typo. Only one of the 6 sites listed has "1005". By the way, the IQnaut site is a mirror of an old version of this wiki page. (This article has reversed since it was created.) Most of the arguments in the "Authenticity of the text" (regarding "Thy", successors of Christ, revealed, "Vicar of Peter", etc.) section should probably have some citations. (I'm not saying the arguments are inaccurate.) Likewise the "Alleged use in coronation ceremonies" section. Obviously, making the case for a negative is difficult, but some of this stuff needs citations. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 20:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've gone ahead and made the disambig, though I'm not a Latin or Church scholar, and I'm somewhat unclear how <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liber_Diurnus_Romanorum_Pontificum_bdd2.html" title="Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum">Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum</a> relates to all this. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 06:11, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Er, why do we need a disambiguation again? This article isn't about the Liber Diurnus, but about one text in it. I see the article structured like:
<ul>
<li>Intro: There is this old text which some sources say may have been used as an oath before the 11th century.</li>
<li>Text: Give latin text from Liber Diurnus / Migne. (or links to wikisource if appropriate)</li>
<li>Popular story: There is this story/legend that this text was used until recently.
<ul>
<li>The English "translation" and original source, footnoting some organizations that repeat this text</li>
<li>The criticisms of this story/legend</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I really don't see the point disambiguating this. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 06:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Gimmetrow. "Papal Oath" does not "refer to" the <i>Liber Diurnus</i>. There is no need for a page to say that "a papal oath" can mean an oath taken by a Pope. Popes must have taken many different oaths in the course of the centuries. None of those oaths, not even the profession of faith that one or two Popes seem to have taken when Constantinopolitan emperors ruled Rome, can be referred to as the Papal Oath. I have reverted the disambiguation change. I have not reverted the move from "Papal Oath" to "Papal Oath (Traditionalist Catholic)" - by the way, shouldn't it be "... (Traditionalist Catholic<i>s</i>)"? But shouldn't we first settle the question "Delete or not delete" before taking any action whatever? Is anyone at all now in favour of deleting? <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 08:32, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Popes must have taken many different oaths in the course of the centuries" Cite??? As Jesus said oaths were from the devil, this is kind of important, don't you think? -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 08:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Google "pope swore" and you'll find a number of cases. So, again, why single out as "the" Papal Oath a text in an obscure source about one particular oath that formed part of a communication from one newly elected Pope, or at most a very few newly elected Popes, to the Imperial Exarch at Ravenna? According to <a href="../../../e/x/a/Exarchate_of_Ravenna_e052.html" title="Exarchate of Ravenna">Exarchate of Ravenna</a>, the last such Exarch was killed in 751, long before the eleventh century!</dd>
<dd>There is no oath whatever that can be called the Papal Oath apart from the one in the urban legend spread by traditionalist Catholics in writing (paper and Internet) and by word of mouth. The text of this "Papal Oath" is obviously loosely based on the text in the letter to the Imperial Exarch, both because of the similarity of some of its expressions and because the letter that the (one?) Pope sent to the Exarch mentions his predecessor Agatho, and this mention has been completely distorted to mean that it was Agatho who took the oath!</dd>
<dd>[The <i>Liber Diurnus</i> text mentions "Constantino <i>piae memoriae</i>", which shows that the Pope who wrote to the Exarch, giving him the text of his profession of faith, was elected after the death of Emperor Constantine IV in September 685; so the Pope in question was probably Conon (686-687) or Sergius I (687-701). (This comment is not mine: it is in one of the notes in the <i>Patrologia Latina</i> volume.) At latest, the Pope who wrote can only have been John VI (701-705), John VII (705-707), Sissinius (January-February 708), Constantine (708-715), Gregory II (715-731), Gregory III (731-741) or Zachary (741-752).] <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 11:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see now that Kendrick has restored his disambiguation page on the grounds that "Papal Oath shouldn't redirect to a myth." What else is there to direct to? <i>All</i> of the oaths that Popes have taken over the centuries? Or just one arbirarily selected oath from those that were really taken? Which one? There is really nothing whatever to direct to as "the Papal Oath" except the "myth" (in the non-technical sense) or urban legend. There never was anything else, even among the oaths that Popes did take, that could be referred to, with capitals, as the Papal Oath.</dd>

<dd>Look first you say <i>Google "pope swore" and you'll find a number of cases</i> then you say <i>There is really nothing whatever to direct to as "the Papal Oath" except the "myth" (in the non-technical sense) or urban legend</i> which leaves me befuddled; these two statements contradict themselves. If there are a number of such oaths or purported oaths, <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_Oath_4f14.html" title="Papal Oath">Papal Oath</a> should be a disambig, plain and simple.

<dd>It still seems obvious to me: "papal oaths" are many; "the Papal Oath" (singular, with definite article, and capitalized) is only one thing, and that thing cannot be confused with anything else. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 19:17, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To me it seems plain silly to devote a disambiguation page to saying that a papal oath is ... wait for it ... an oath by a Pope, and that "the Papal Oath" (a quite widespread urban legend) is something different.

<li><b>Very strong Keep</b> What business of ours' is it to judge what oath any or all popes may or may not have taken? How can we possibly be expected to reach a verdict--by our own theological judgement? by our own interpretation of the church-historical sources? This article is a sourced discussion of the claimed material, and a discussion of the controversy concerning it--just what a WP article ought to be. Since it is one of the distinctive doctrines of a very N church, what more is there to say. Deletion would be pushing the POV that there is no such thing. I do know a very little about the sources &amp; have my own interpretation of the controversy, but I am not a RS, and neither is anyone else in this discussion--unless they may happen to have published discussions of it, in which case they should add the cites to the article, not the AfD. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:07, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As I said above, it seems no one at all wants to delete the article, which is one of the 149 in the Urban Legends category. The others in that category do not need a disambig page to say that, for instance, "Hairy hands" can refer to hairy hands, "The Licked Hand" can refer to a licked hand, "The Hook" can refer to a hook, "Hundredth Monkey" to a hundredth monkey ...

<li><b>Comment</b>. This AfD is not improving things. Now we have two articles. One article is a stub with incorrect information - does the citation <i>really</i> assert this was used "from the fifth through eleventh centuries"? The other article discusses a story, which I do think is an urban legend, yet still lacks a single citation to anyone who actually says the story is an urban legend. At this point, they should both be deleted. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 03:56, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>'<i>comment</i> I appreciate the clarification. Now that I know which article it is , I would say <b>strong keep</b> as there is no doubt that such a belief exists. To what extent it is based on fact should be discussed on the article talk page. Personally, I don;t see how we can actually judge something like that--we just report the opinions. Whether the people who hold the opinions may possibly be confused themselves is --fortunately--not something we have to decide. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kendrick has gone too far, making unilateral changes in complete disregard of others, indeed against the opposition of others and without the support of even one other person. Now he has gone further: inventing pages that claim that "the Papal Oath" can mean various other things. Can he quote a single source outside of Wikipedia that says the profession of faith found in the <i>Liber Diurnus</i> is called "the Papal Oath"? ...</p>
<p>I trust I do have support for moving the article this discussion is about to "The Papal Oath". This is unambiguous: no papal oath other than the one attributed to the Popes from Agatho to Paul VI is known as "<i>the</i> <i>P</i>apal <i>O</i>ath". It is NPOV, while "Papal Oath (Traditionalist Catholic)" contradicts the POV of those Traditionalist Catholics who claim that the text in question is not just a Traditionalist Catholic Papal Oath, but a genuine oath actually taken by the Popes.</p>
<p>The question of keeping or not keeping the article has been settled long ago, and there was no real need to continue that discussion. The discussion now is on the name of the article that we are keeping. Do we support the move to "The Papal Oath"?</p>

<dd>Kendrick is right in saying that according to the strict rules there is a proper procedure for proposing possibly controversial moves. Kendrick chose not to follow that procedure, and we have been discussing here the unilateral action he took in breach of those rules. Why should we not continue the discussion, and find out for certain what support if any Kendrick has for his POV renaming of the article? If Kendrick prefers, let him revert all the changes and return to the status quo ante, and then we can put into operation the <i>normal</i> method of deciding whether to move an article. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 08:35, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>By the way, I cannot find in the <i>Liber Diurnus</i> text the words that Schaff seems to attribute to it: "smites with eternal anathema the originators of the new heresy ..." (a heresy that cannot have still been considered new in the eleventh century). But I leave consideration of that till later, in order to concentrate on the question of the name of the article we are discussing. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 09:15, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I substantially agree with Lima. The article discussing the story/legend should be at "Papal Oath" where it started. If that means the article needs to expand to mention that there have been other "papal oaths", so be it; that should only add a paragraph or so of verifiable material. If any disambiguation was necessary, it should have happened at Papal Oath (disambiguation), per <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html#Primary_topic" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation#Primary_topic</a>. The Schaff book is a non-Catholic source arguing against papal infallibility, but it seems to cite the Rozière text, if that helps. I would still really like to see the article have at least one citation to a reliable source, aware of the story/legend, that says it is a legend. Material counts as <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html#What_is_original_research.3F" title="WP:ATT">original research</a> if it "introduces an analysis or synthesis of published facts, opinions, or arguments in a way that advances a position favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reliable source who has published the material in relation to the topic of the article." <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 12:23, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
