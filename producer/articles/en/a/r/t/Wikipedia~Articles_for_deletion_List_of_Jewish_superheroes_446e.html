<li>It is only reasonably to say that it <i>"can be dealt with by citing sources"</i> if such sources can be and are found.

<li>I don't know much about any of these comics, but looking that the wp pages for the characters, it seems that for some of them, their religion is well established in the comics. For such characters, the comics themselves is a sufficient source (the whole series, no specific citation required). I do agree that many others, maybe exactly those whose WP articles don't reference the character being jewish, require sourcing (though possibly in the character's own page instead of the list). Nevertheless, the article itself is a good idea - and the list will be small and maintainable. As Zordrac mentions, there are other procedures to deal with articles that require verification. The history of the page shows a lot of interest in the topic, and indicates to me that the page will likely be improved, not just expanded. -<a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 05:54, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure. Although I thought this was the one "List of Jewish people" that struck me as basically silly(unlike the ones that have actually been deleted which at worst were overly specific) if there are similar lists for other groups it should stay. There apparently is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_black_superheroes.html" title="List of black superheroes">List of black superheroes</a>. Plus people who come to Wikipedia I think tend to be disproportionately dorky. (I am on the dorky side myself, though not about comics) Knowing which superhero was Jewish, African-American, gay, etc seems important to many dorky people. Cutting this list out might be slighting a group, I mean "the dorkish" not Jewish people, who have contributed a great deal to Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>We don't 'give out' sympathy to low standards articles as a reward for contributing. Knowing whether a superhero is black or not requires determining what colour the ink on the paper is, without need for any sources probably. Determining any of the things you mention, including Jewishness, requires proof beyond a Geocities page. We should not compromise our standards of verifiabily sourced articles for fear of a peculiar kind of offence of upsetting cartoon characters or those who like them. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 05:39, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well my statement was not entirely serious as should have been in least somewhat clear. Although I was thinking that as this might be interesting enough to users who would come here deletion might become a waste of time as someone would try to recreate a list like this in short order. Although looking it up that interest is rather more minor then I may have thought.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Jewish+superhero%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Jewish+superhero%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> So essentially I'd actually lean to delete. However there are a few comic characters I know of where they did have them say they were Jewish, or Christian or Armenian or whatever, explicitly. Possibly if limited to those cases, with the comic and page number cited, that'd be acceptable.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li>This is just about the only list of Jews that I'm actually tempted to vote "keep" on, as it's actually likely that Jewish identity is likely to be a signficant aspect of a superhero's character in a way that it's unlikely to be significant that a given baker or dentist is Jewish. I'm dubious, however, because the list as it stands contains a lot of doubtful claims (how can Superman be Jewish when he's not even human?).
<p>Instead of keeping this as it stands, why not move to something like Judaism in comics and write an <i>encyclopedia article</i> on the subject, making reference to only those characters who are actually explicitly and significantly Jewish, and doing so in prose instead of as a list? <i>That</i> would be a strong keep. This is just a <b>weak keep</b> and strong cleanup. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 14:52, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is slightly silly, and I would feel the same with a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_superheroes_with_disabilities.html" title="List of superheroes with disabilities">List of superheroes with disabilities</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Catholic_superheroes_3a53.html" title="List of Catholic superheroes">List of Catholic superheroes</a>. That said I would go keep before delete. Too many lists are getting deleted almost for no reason except "I don't like lists" or "we have too many." In just <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_lists_uncategorized_4b1f.html" title="Wikipedia:List of lists/uncategorized">Wikipedia:List of lists/uncategorized</a> there are in least 3600 lists. You'd have to delete a hundred a day for five weeks, without any new ones coming, to get it down to a hundred. It's just a fool's errand. Eventually people will just accept lists are unlikely to disappear unless they are somehow summarily destroyed all at once. Then again I agree with removing the silliest or most trivial ones. This strikes me as borderline to that so I went with merge instead of keep.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I usually vote 'delete' on List of Jewish (something) articles, but this one makes sense to me. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 17:51, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
