<dd>I gather from the "Rationale" section that the problem is that complaints from companies are creating an administrative load on the Wikipedia office. Libel (at least in the US) to the point of actually losing a libel suit, isn't really the issue. Is that correct? --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 16:51, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>The proposed policy was almost pro-advertising. With that policy, most company articles would be puff pieces. I've made some changes to balance it more. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 19:52, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Balancing user rights is not sufficient because of the growing practice of <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>. A growing number of professional spin doctors are defending corporate reputations on the internet, and I have seen at least one case where they are using extensive wikilawyering to do it. This policy would really help them. In order to compete against their greater resources (they're paid to do this full-time!) volunteer critics should be given more freedom than corporate cheerleaders.--<a href="../../../y/t/r/User%7EYtrottier_9d75.html" title="User:Ytrottier">Yannick</a> 02:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How big a legal problem is this?</p>
<p>I don't want to see Wikipedia turned into a business directory, full of puff pieces. The bad news belongs in there too. Here are a few pieces of bad news about companies I've added, all currently in Wikipedia.</p>

<li><i>(From <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moller_Skycar_2824.html" title="Moller Skycar">Moller Skycar</a>):</i> In 2003, the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission_f519.html" title="Securities and Exchange Commission">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> sued Moller for civil fraud <i>(Securities And Exchange Commission v. Moller International, Inc., and Paul S. Moller, Defendants)</i> in connection with the sale of unregistered stock, and for making unsubstantiated claims about the performance of the Skycar. Moller settled this lawsuit by agreeing to a permanent injunction and paying $50,000. In the words of the SEC complaint, "As of late 2002, MI's approximately 40 years' of development has resulted in a prototype Skycar capable of hovering about fifteen feet above the ground."</li>

<p>This is the working journalist's guide to libel law. It tells you how to stay out of trouble without being overly conservative. If Wikipedia management is worried about libel suits, that's the place to look for policy guidance.</p>
<p>On a personal note, during the dot-com boom and collapse, I ran <a href="http://www.downside.com" class="external text" title="http://www.downside.com" rel="nofollow">Downside</a>, a web site devoted to predicting which dot-coms would go under and when. Predictions of corporate "death dates" were generated by automated processing of company SEC filings. The accuracy was suprisingly good. I received hate mail and occasional legal threats, sometimes from CEO-level people. But nobody ever actually sued. They knew they'd lose. So don't cave in to corporate pressure when you don't have to. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 02:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just posted a concern about linking to customer opinion websites on <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSPAM_fbb6.html" title="WP:WPSPAM">WP:WPSPAM</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none;">
<p>What does everyone think about linking to websites which contain customer opinions? For example consider <a href="http://www.airlinequality.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.airlinequality.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.airlinequality.com/</a> which contains passenger opinions on airlines (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/n/Special%7ELinksearch_3efd.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/n/Special%7ELinksearch_3efd.html" rel="nofollow">all links</a>). I beleive such a site doesn't meet any of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:ELs</a> "when to link" guidelines (for #4 it's hard to consider it neutral &amp; accurate) and hits against some of the recommendations on when not to link:</p>
<ul>
<li>2: "Any site that contains factually inaccurate material or unverified original research, as detailed in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>"</li>
<li>9: "Blogs, social networking sites (such as MySpace) and forums should generally not be linked to unless mandated by the article itself."</li>
</ul>
I wonder if there's a parallel here with the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy which is applied to biographies of living people... And has recently spawned a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_about_ongoing_enterprises_1bdc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles about ongoing enterprises">Wikipedia:Articles about ongoing enterprises</a> proposal?</blockquote>

<dd>My understanding is that BPL has to do with morality, wiki-love, and the fact that the whole point of a free great encyclopedia for all mankind is that is a <i>good</i> thing good people volunteer to help. I see no reason to extend that to not-livings-humans. Staying legal is a concern in every article and while a special consideration is due living people, I don't feel the same way about <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_cbf4.html" title="IBM">IBM</a>. I believe we should maintain the distiction between saying "Fictional Tobacco company Predident John Smith is morally guilty of mass murder" which <i>is</i> covered by BLP versus saying "Fictional Tobacco company is morally guilty of mass murder" which is not covered by BLP but is covered by Verifyability, no original research and NPOV which is quite sufficient. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 23:52, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Moved this from the article to talk, because that quote isn't in the reference.

The closest he came was to say <i>"And the few people who are still sort of in the old days, saying, "Well, you know, it's a wiki, why don't we just...

<p>The ongoing enterprise article has been helpful to me and I saw the enterprise template and added it to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starbucks.html" title="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> article. But another editor removed it the next day saying it is <i>only</i> a proposed policy. Should we not be using the enterprise template afterall?

<dd>The enterprise template was mis-worded given that this is just a proposal. I've fixed that. As for your other question, policies become policies because they are widely supported by the community. If you feel that this proposal should become a policy, you should follow the proposal right now. If the community is in agreement, other people will start to do so as well. If a lot of people disagree with it, then that should become pretty obvious really quickly. Note that this is not an opinion on the validity of the proposal itself, just a suggestion as to what you should do if you feel the proposal is valid. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 19:46, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Application of verifiability, no original research, and NPOV is important for <i>every</i> article. Special sensitivity (enhanced awareness for privacy rights and morality concerns) is for living people. Providing special sensitivity for IBM is nonsense.

<p>Please justify the Merge idea or delete it. It makes no sense. BLP is a well defined policy. This is not even a fully defined proposal. What it applies to is not identified.

<p>Agreed, the merge is the wrong way to go. There will be parallels and differences between the two standards. If anything, it looks like this started as a cookie cutter copy of BLP and we are now trying to work out here what the differences ought to be. BLP started 17 December 2005 as a proposal, was upgraded to a guideline at some point, and was upgraded to policy on 18 July 2006 (on the it is being so used basis), and the community as a whole is still coming to realize that BLP is a policy and figure out how to apply and work with it. If it still looks like basically a cookie cutter copy of BLP this time next year, then merging will be a good idea.

The next question is how soon we start debating whether to tag this as {{<a href="../../../r/e/j/Template%7ERejected_0a64.html" title="Template:Rejected">rejected</a>}}. Once we get to the standards that really apply to companies and other organizations, you're back to our regular standards of verifiability, etc. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 18:50, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Law.com: What is your liability for inaccurate information that's posted on the Web site?</p>
<p>Bradford A. Patrick: Our belief is that since every post is attributed to an individual, is time-stamped and is retained in the database, the foundation itself is not publishing that content. We view individual editors as responsible and have prominently displayed on every edit page that individuals are responsible for their own contributions. We take the position that we are a service provider and are protected under §230. We try to emphasize to everyone who posts that they, as publishers, have responsibility for what they add.

<dd>Morally, yes of course. But some have said that efforts (some? all?) to assume responsibility create responsibility in the eyes of the law so that the more sucessful we are at this, the more legal liability. I'm not a lawyer. While this may not be your specialty, you are a lawyer. So, without giving legal advice, can you shed light on this? <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 04:09, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Highly questionable. The Foundation owns and operates the servers. Foundation employees have ultimate control over the software on the servers. This software determines who has permission bits assigned within the hierarchy of admins, bureaucrats, stewards, etc. These permission bits collectively play a huge role in shaping the content on Wikipedia in terms of blocking editors, banning editors, deleting articles, and protecting articles. 68.91.90.53 23:31, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's just verifiability, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The term "Misery Synod" does appear in a few hundred places, but most of them are blogs.

<p>I put a "fact" tag on "Well-founded complaints about articles about ongoing enterprises from their subjects arrive daily in the form of e-mails to the Wikipedia contact address, phone calls to the Foundation headquarters and to Jimbo Wales, and via postal mail." That unsubstantiated claim doesn't belong in the policy without substantial backup. Discussion here hasn't established that there's a real problem, and putting that line in the article lead asserts that there is. I know that it's not customary to require <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> in a policy, but because that's being used as justification for the policy, it's appropriate and necessary.</p>
<p>Let's see a monthly summary of complaints for the last year. Then this issue can be discussed effectively. Thanks. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 18:31, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could they be posted here for public review, without getting into specific names? I think this may be a bad idea; as organizations/groups/companies and corporations are not people. Negative press and sourced facts are that; and we don't have to concern ourselves with the hurt feelings of a given political party or corporation, in the same regard as we do a living human being. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 16:29, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess it depends on whether <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, as our only specific effort to prevent <a href="../../../l/i/b/Wikipedia%7ELibel_9d80.html" title="Wikipedia:Libel">Wikipedia:Libel</a> (with the possible exception of <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>) , is viewed only by its ethical considerations, as opposed to its Legal considerations. I believe this page is more about the legal considerations involved, something which we cannot just ignore. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 04:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Certainly, the legal comes first, and then consideration for the ethical. What I mean is that if negative press about Megacorp, LLC is uncovered by a reliable source, it would be negligient to not report on it at least in passing. For example, a very small incident could be handled safely by a line or two, with a link or two to RS detailed it more fully. I simply mean that this proposed policy should not be used to shield organizations or corporations from "bad press" simply because Google or other SE results will have disproportionate weight via Wikipedia being what it is. The goal is not to assist in spin control or minimizing negative associations for the subject of an article, but to be the sum total of human knowledge as Jimbo has said. And, of course, companies are not and never will be people to have hurt 'feelings'. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 16:38, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
