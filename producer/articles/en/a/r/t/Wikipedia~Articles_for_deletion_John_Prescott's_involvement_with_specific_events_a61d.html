<p>The result was <b>keep</b>. TerriersFan is correct that 'merge and delete' is not an acceptable outcome to support (it destroys the edit history, which violates the <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL</a>). He also doesn't go quite far enough, because there are in fact only two possible 'choices' - keep or delete. AfD does not govern merges. After an AfD merging or redirecting may be done based on discussion that took place during the AfD, sometimes by the closing admin, but it is still effectively a 'keep' result as far as the AfD goes - that its content may be moved elsewhere or its own content may be replaced with a redirect is secondary.</p>
<p>Clearly many believe that this should not be a separate article, but it is up to them to discuss, perform and defend the merge in the normal way if they want to. Apart from that we have very few editors arguing for actual deletion, and 'keep (in some form)' is the only possible summary of the consensus here. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge and delete</b>. <i>Individual</i> controversies (e.g. Temple etc.) <i>may</i> merit their own articles, if necessitated by lack of space. The title is also terrible- there is often a pretty good correlation between the unwieldyness of an article's title and its requirement to exist. This is a VERY unwieldy title.....<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> could do with some work, largely due to POV complications arising from his current difficulties.

<dd>I doubt if it's really necessary to erect a redirect for a title that is very, very unlikely to ever be searched for, but redirects are cheap, I guess. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:11, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The reason that 'Delete and Merge' is not an option is that it destroys the edit history. Delete is fine as is Keep but if you want to merge it has to be 'Merge and Redirect' for that reason not for any searching benefits. This has been discussed on AfD recently. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 02:48, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Some thoughts. This section was starting to overwhelm the original article. It was becomming hard to navigate around the article. There was certainly no intention to 'sanitise' the article; the new article is clearly linked and the link can be made more prominent if required. Inevitably, the section is going to get much longer, and the problem worsening.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It certainly is not a content fork - the guidelienes say:</dd>
<dd>'Sometimes, when an article gets long, a section of the article is made into its own article, and the handling of the subject in the main article is condensed to a brief summary. This is completely normal Wikipedia procedure; the new article is sometimes called a "spinout" or "spinoff" of the main article, see for example wikipedia:summary style, which explains the technique. Even if the subject of the new article is controversial, this does not automatically make the new article a POV fork. However, the moved material must be replaced with an NPOV summary of that material.'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The criticism of the title is a matter of no importance; it was chosen to try to be NPOV. If the length is truely of any import then it can be renamed John Prescott: controversies or whatever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is no point in saying that the article needs attention or this or that section needs spinning off unless an editor is prepared to do the work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If this section is simply merged back then not only will the problem remain; it will get worse. What is needed is a concrete proposal backed up by some editorial action.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let me emphasise that I will lose no sleep whatever happens to this article. If the split is undone; so be it but unless someone else is prepared to take an initiative then an article on a major political figure will progressively decline. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 21:55, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - On balance, I think that TerriersFan's arguments hold true. Merging this section back will more than double the length of the article. If any of the dissenting editors <i>be bold</i> and <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> spins out topics or <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoad_Wizard_b7b6.html" title="User:Road Wizard">Road Wizard</a> splits the article on chronological lines then I will change my 'vote'. The point is that TerriersFan has identified a problem and done something about it. It is easy to criticise but less easy to do something about it. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 23:53, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Currently, ALL the controversies that Prescott has been involved in lie in this separate article- how therefore is the main <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> article NPOV? I am not criticising TF's boldness- but he has got this one wrong. For a start, from what I can see even with the controversial material back in, JP was only 34 kb- reasonably big, but hardly enormous. Moreover, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">WP:Article size</a> specifically states that an adequate summary of the material must be left in the article proper after a split- this is not currently the case (and it is imply not appropriate in this case to spin out all the negative stuff anyway, in my view). <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> could do with some improvement, but I do not see any reason to take this kind of drastic action, although I am not criticising anyone and TF has gone about things correctly (it's particularly laudable that he advertised this AfD on the main JP talk page). It's a straw man to criticise other editors for pointing out a mistake. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:08, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fair point about the main article summary; I think that TF got that wrong - I have now expanded <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html#Involvement_with_specific_events" title="John Prescott">John Prescott#Involvement with specific events</a> to list all the incidents and toughened the text. Nothing is now concealed! Do you agree that the main article is now NPOV? I would add that with JPs disappearance over airport terrorism, alledged links to his son's company etc to be added this is going to grow and grow! <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 01:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The section in <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> is now a wikified bulletpoint-list of controversies (listed under the bizarre heading "Involvement with specific events") involving Prescott, with very brief descriptions (some of which are rather juvenile (and inaccurate), e.g. <i>Brit Awards, 1998; dockers cool him down</i>). I do not agree that this is an adequate summary, nor is it NPOV, and it is certainly not an improvement over what was already there. Other editors can obviously have a look at it and judge for themselves. The removal of the "controversies" section wholesale was a mistake, but one that is easily remedied at the moment by re-merging the recently excised material. If the two articles remain separate, the problem is really going to grow and grow. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:09, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The controversies, particlarly the very recent controversies, were disproportionally dominating the main article in a manner that was not encyclopedic. It was right to separate them out. They are currently, and imo correctly, summarised and linked in the main article.

<li><b>Merge</b>, keeping <i>all</i> the information. "Controversy" is what politicians are about, so I don't see much of a point in a split between a head article about a politician and an article about their argumentative positions taken, public conduct, or private conduct that reflects on their prudence or leadership. This is all politics; it's why politicians are notable. Standing alone, this page is almost devoid of context; I had to read down a ways before I even figured out what country he was from.

<li><b>Comment</b> the split was raised on the talk page. A point against it was posted, to which Terriers Fan responded. No further posts against the move were forthcoming over the next few days, so the move was in order. If the move is now to be reverted, then that is OK provided the material involved is heavily trimmed.

<dd>Without trying to start an argument, and simply for the sake of accuracy, your "over the next few days" comment is not quite correct.

<li><b>Keep</b> but rename as it's currently a horrible title. Something along the lines of John Prescott controversies.

Hence I extrapolated to John Prescott (not that the two are comparable&#160;:-) ). I also wanted to avoid a POV title such as 'controversies' in the hope that the succesful intervention by Prescott in an event or incident can also be included. Having said all that, the mood of the Community is obviously for a title that is much shorter and snappier. My inclination, if this article is kept, is <i>John Prescott: Contentious events</i> which is briefer without being too POV. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 22:36, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that merging all the information back into the main article would greatly affect its balance. It's well referenced and I believe the detail is encyclopedic and warranted. Changing the title to TerriersFan's suggestion would be fine, still remain NPOV, and I agree be more descriptive and less unwieldy. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransUtopian_743a.html" title="User:TransUtopian">TransUtopian</a> 18:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm confused- remerging this information with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> affects the balance of that article- but removing it wholesale somehow does not have the same effect? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 18:45, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
