<p>Carling King is ridden by the Irish show jumper Kevin Babington</p>
<p>Color: Chestnut</p>
<p>Sex: Gelding</p>
<p>Born: 1991</p>
<p>Breed: Irish</p>
<p>Breeding: by Carling King, out of Gortnageer Star, by Chairlift xx</p>
<p>Rider: Kevin Babington</p>
<p>Owner: Kindle Hill Farm</p>
<p><br />
Carling King was originally bought as a 7-year-old as a mount for his owner, amateur Saly Glassman. After arriving in the states, his remarkable talent (and a somewhat difficult nature) was discovered and Irishman Kevin Babington took over the reins shortly thereafter. Since then, Carling King was eighth in the World Equestrian Games in Jerez, Spain 2002, won multiple international Nation’s Cups in 2003, and was the 2001 Samsung Nation’s Cup leading horse. In 2004, Kevin and Carling King placed fifth individually at the Summer Olympics in Athens. After winning several major grand prix competitions in 2004, King was sidelined with an injury to one of his ligaments but has since returned to competition successfully.</p>
<p><br />
Before his arrival in the states, "King", as he is known around the stables, was crowned the 5 year-old champion at the prestigious Dublin Horse Show with rider Michael Buckley. The class was renamed in his honor as the "Carling King Five Year Old National Championship".</p>
<p><br />
King is famous for his incredible consistancy in competition and his stylish technique. Although most of his grooms have managed to find a softer side, he is known for being quite facetious around the barn and will, on occasion, bite the arm of those not paying enough attention.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-14_6e55.html" title="Edit section: FMA!Harem">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">FMA!Harem</span></h2>
<p><b>FMA!Harem</b> (also may be FMAHarem, FMA-Harem, the Harem, Kevin's Boobies, etc.) was a chat started completely by accident. The head honcho, the great Fuhrer, Edo (named for Edward Elric of the series <a href="../../../f/u/l/FullMetal_Alchemist_6f33.html" title="FullMetal Alchemist">FullMetal Alchemist</a> ) did a chat one night for the FMA MSN group on AIM. Unfortunately, the chat didn't go so well. There were many obnoxious foolish noobs, and the normal people decided to change the name to keep them away. Thus on <b>September 17, 2005</b> the FMA!Harem (fmaharem) chat was born!</p>
<p>Now, you can find the FMA!Harem all over the web! They have their own LiveJournal Community, their own website, their own forum boards, everything!</p>
<p>Why is the FMA!Harem more special and more important than any other FMA fan group? Well for starters, everyone is free to talk about anything. There is no law saying it can't be rated R or above, or you're not allowed to talk to voice actors, or anything. Those who chat can get as perverted as they please, talk about whomever and whatever they wish, and express themselves. The possiblities in the chat are endless!</p>
<p><b><u>What You Can Find In The Chat:</u></b> -<a href="../../../h/e/n/Hentai.html" title="Hentai">Hentai</a> -<a href="../../../y/a/o/Yaoi.html" title="Yaoi">Yaoi</a> -<a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuri.html" title="Yuri">Yuri</a> -<a href="../../../f/u/l/FullMetal_Alchemist_6f33.html" title="FullMetal Alchemist">FullMetal Alchemist</a> -<a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">Gravitation</a> -<a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Tennis_c635.html" title="Prince of Tennis">Prince of Tennis</a> -<a href="../../../t/y/p/Typos.html" title="Typos">typos</a> -<a href="../../../r/e/n/Rent.html" title="Rent">Rent</a> -<a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> -Cavemen -New and unusual languages -drunk people and much more!</p>
<p>It's the most fun you'll ever have in a chatroom!</p>
<p>Although groups like Hellcon and the Risembool Rangers are more commonly known due to their involvement with the voice actors, the FMA!Harem has not once ever had any serious <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wank.html" title="Wank">wank</a> or has ever had any issues with any other group/person. So far it's been considered the "most pleasant" of FMA Chatrooms due to the fact no one can find a problem with it. Perhaps one of the reasons is because people aren't in there expecting the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_actors.html" title="Voice actors">voice actors</a>&#160;?</p>
<p>Even though the chat is small, it's ever growing! By the MODs' selective choosing of who is allowed in, it helps keep down trhe humber of obnoxious <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fangirls.html" title="Fangirls">fangirls</a> , Mary Sues, Emo Kids, and other disturbances that may make a chat unpleasant for those just wanting to talk and not constantly hear people going "Edward is my husband!" or "OMG! Did you see Travis? He was wearing ___ and looked soooo ____ and _____ and _____ and _____ and ____ and _____!" .</p>
<p><br />
The Harem is also home to several serious <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosplayers.html" title="Cosplayers">cosplayers</a> who are popular at <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_conventions.html" title="Anime conventions">anime conventions</a> for their FullMetal Alchemist <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosplay.html" title="Cosplay">cosplay</a>. Also several voice actors come in from time to time, not expecting fangirling or a Q&amp;A session (as it is with other chats), just wanting to chat with regular people. Such actors include Kevin Conolly, Chris Patton, and Kyle Heibeart. It's the perfect chatroom for people just wanting to talk about what they like without worrying about being offensive or breaking any "rules" .</p>

<p>OgreWeb is a website created to determine who possesses the most ogre-like qualities. It has its genesis in mid 2006, and compares two individuals, Adam Hollander and Devon Comstock to one another. According to Wikipedia itself, ogres are "a a race of humanoid beings, fierce and cruel monsters, that eat human flesh". The site allows viewers to vote for which individual they think exemplifies this behaviour.</p>

<p>Once a duty is recognised, the next question is whether there has been a breach of such duty; some, particularly US lawyers, have argued that, once a duty is there, liability of the def is strict, in that the pln’s harm completes the action; but Commonwealth lawyers have embraced the principle that lia should not be strict, that liability should require something more than pl’s harm; there should be a lack of care that a reasonable person would take in similar circumstances;</p>

<p><i><b>Characters</b></i>: Remi, her foster parents, her sister, Victor, Three dogs(Cappi, Dolche' and Salfino), a monkey (Jolli), Madam Madison(Remi's real mother), Arthur, Nelly, Gaspard and the orphans(Remi's best friens -Martin, Richardo, Marsello, Liz, Maria and others).</p>
<p><i><b>Episodes</b></i>&#160;:- 26</p>
<p><i><b>Status</b></i>&#160;:- An Anime T.V. series adopted from a novel(Sans Famille where Remi is a boy)</p>
<p><i><b>Genre</b></i>&#160;:- Sentiment, Friendship, Romance and Comedy</p>
<p>Nobody's Girl (T.V. Anime series) having 26 episodes is a story about an orphan girl named Remi adopted from the novel Sans Famille by Hector H. Mallot. In his book the orphan is a boy with the same name Remi. In the anime series Remi lives happily with her foster mother and sister until her foster father decides to sell her. Then its Victor(Vitalis in the novel) a street performer, who comes to rescue Remi.</p>
<p>Victor convinces Remi to come along with him for it will be dangerous for her mother if Remi stays with her for long. Remi moves away from the village where she was, with Victor and becomes a member of Victor's travelling circus along with three dogs ( Cappi, Dolche' &amp; Salfino) and a monkey named Jolli. They became the best of friends.</p>
<p>Remi is a singer in the travelling circus. They travel many villages and meet many friends. In one such village there were a series of robbery and Victor was mistaken for the robber &amp; put in prison. While Victor was in prison a lovely lady Madam Madison along with her son Arthur look after Remi and her animal friends. There Remi shows Arthur her precious cameo which her real mother had given(knowledge from her foster mother). Victor was released after the real robber was arrested. Then Victor &amp; Remi decide to continue their show business.</p>
<p>Arthur did not want Remi to leave. When it was time for Remi to leave, Arthur did not wish to give them a farewell. He just went into his room. By that time Remi had left. Arthur comes running to his mother shouting that Remi had left her cameo behind. His mother looks at it and says that it was hers. Arthur says that it was the same cameo that Remi was wearing. Miss Madison comes to realize that Remi was her real lost daughtet. But by the time they could search for Remi &amp; the others, they had left for Paris.</p>
<p>On the way to Paris Dolche' &amp; Salfino get killed while they tried to save Remi &amp; Victor from the wolves. Soon Victor dies due to his old age. Before he dies Victor gives Remi the address of his old friend named Gaspard and asks her to take Jolli and Cappi with her to Gaspard.</p>
<p>Remi goes in search of Gaspard along with her friens. She finds where Gaspard lives but unlike Victor's prediction Gaspard was very rude. The Gaspard whom Victor knew had died. This was his son. Remi makes friends with other orphan children whom Gaspard uses as slaves and ill treats them. Remi also becomes a slave. Remi falls in love with Martin one among the group.</p>
<p>Somehow Gaspard comes to know that Remi is Madam Madison's lost daughter. So he holds Remi and Martin(as he comes to help Remi) captives and demands a huge sum of money from Miss Madison. Then Remi and Martin were saved by their friend Liz, Marsello, Maria, Richardo, the other friends, Nelly (Madam Madison's maid), a Detective and Jolli the monkey (Cappi was taken captive too).</p>
<p>Remi was re-united with her real mother. Her other friends leave her thinking that soon they'll be forgotten by Remi but Miss Madison adopts all the kids and they become Remi's sisters and brothers. Martin promises Remi that he'll become a famous violonist and come back to live with Remi for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Remi never forgot what Victor always used to tell her,"<i><b>KEEP MOVING FORWARD ALWAYS".</b></i></p>

<p>At more than 6,200' above sea level Benmore Peak Observatory is the highest in <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceania.html" title="Oceania">Oceania</a>. It is owned and operated by amateur astronomers and has the 2nd largest optical telescope in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and a number of smaller instruments. The Benmore Peak Observatory has a dark sky since it is more than 75 miles from Timaru, which is the nearest big town, and separated by several mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Benmore Peak Observatory also has a site in a wide valley nearby. This site is almost completely surrounded by mountain ranges and a radio telescope array is being built there. It is also useful for optical astronomy as it too is very dark although it is more prone to cloud cover being much lower than Benmore Peak.</p>

<p><b>Antics The Band</b> was set up in the mid 2000's to inspire a generation of people to change the world from the inside. To look at the deepest passions they had, no matter how ridiculous; and spill them onto a generation of people who just weren't getting that essential buzz from their daily routine.</p>
<p>Founded in <b>Middlesbrough</b>, UK. Antics The Band has fast become a way of life for a lot of the misguideds, as a way of channeling their potentially world-dominating dreams into a society that desperately needs them.</p>
<p>MR <b>Andrew Chorus</b> and <b>Phil Underscore Libertine</b> are the foul beginners of this fray, long may they live in peace and passion to change the world for those that accept <b>beauty</b>, <b>imagination</b> and most importantly; the occasional fleck of <b>bulls**t!</b></p>

<p>Jack and Faye was to have been a 7" containing the final recordings by the Mountain Goats of the Sweden/Nine Black Poppies/Nothing for Juice era. There were multiple delays. At one point there was finished artwork. Then there were more delays. Eventually history staked its claim on these recordings and it was almost as though they never even existed at all.</p>
<p>The songs themselves were recorded in December of 1995 and January of 1996 in Chicago, Illinois and San Dimas, California. John and Rachel considered them some of their best work and were especially fond of "Raid on Entebbe." Time has given them a somewhat melancholy air. 87.219.191.89 08:50, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Vorn was born at Tauranga Hospital, Tauranga, in 1977, the son of a square dancer of aristocratic bearing and profligate facial hair. In 1993 he was bound over into a series of really quite awful high school rock bands after attempting to grow a mullet. He has recorded and produced three albums.</p>
<p>Normal the Normal Normal (1999) "... a great grinding grandpappy of an album it is too. . . returns self-indulgence to its rightful place at the top of the desirable qualities list".</p>
<p>-Chris Knox</p>
<p>Not Quite As Good (2001) "Vorn has made a mountain out of his molehill ...despite the flakey quality, beautiful passages, poignant lyrics and layered detail emerge miraculously through the gloop." -New Zealand Musician Magazine</p>
<p>Thunk! (2006) "...truly deserves the title of genius . . . if you like alt-pop, your mission for this year is to find this album and fall in love - ***** " - Lyndon Walker, Rip it Up Magazine</p>
<p>Vorn currently abides in Wellington, with his collection of instruments and some rather iffy recording gear. He is an Aries, and thinks High Voltage was easily AC/DC's best album, no matter what anyone says to the contrary.</p>

<p><b>Fairchild, Thomas</b> 1667-1729 Thomas Fairchild was the first English nurseryman to experiment with hybridization of plants. Before 1717 he placed the pollen of sweet william on the style of carnations. Johnson (1829) states that he was one of the few gardeners "uniting a love of science with the practice of his art." He was the author of The City Gardener (1722) which was the first book on town gardening. His book was particularly important since it listed the plants which could be grown in London even in the 18th Century. It is interesting to note that the most serious problem was the rapid rise of smoke pollution which one can understand in view of the massive number of chimneys and the extensive use of coal current in London even today. The book was purposefully written to enable those who lived in the city to "delight themselves in gardening" and to prepare them to enjoy the country when they retired from business. We also learn that apple trees flowered abundantly within the city but they did not bear fruit unless grafted on dwarfing stock. He gave a considerable list of evergreen trees and flowers for London gardens. He was a leading member of the Society of Gardeners, comprised at first of 19 gardeners, and his name stands first upon a list of members, in the preface of a work published by them in 1730. Catalogus Plantarum - A Catalogue of Trees, Shrubs, etc; for Sale in the Gardens near London by a Society of Gardeners appeared in 1731 after Fairchild's death.</p>

<p>This rock is called Sarsfield's Rock.

At the time this was the most important stronghold in the southern provinces, and was mainly Catholic in population.</p>
<p>However following on from the exploits of Patrick Sarsfield and Galloping Hogan all the wagons were dragged on top of one another.

A short trail of gunpowder was laid and ignited, and the Irish soldiers made haste their escape.

<p>These actions resulted in the 'Treaty of Limerick'.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-14_6e55.html" title="Edit section: Sarsfield's Rock, Ballyneety, Co. Limerick">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sarsfield's Rock, Ballyneety, Co. Limerick</span></h2>
<p>After the defeat of the Jacobites at the Battle of the Boyne (1-7-1690 ) James II fled to France, and the remnants of the Irish army, under Lauzun, Tyreconnel, Sarsfield and Berwick retreated to Limerick. They were pursued by William, who entered Dublin in triumph and captured Clonmel, Kilkenny and Waterford on the way south. Limerick was the most important stronghold in the southern provinces, and was mainly Catholic in population.</p>
<p>As news of his approach reached Limerick, acrimonious disagreements broke out amongst the Limerick garrison. Lauzun, who commanded, was for evacuation and surrender, and he was supported by Tyreconnel in his arguments. Sarsfield maintained that the city could be held, and he was supported by the young Duke of Berwick. Lauzun’s excuse for withdrawing from Limerick was that the city was not tenable and that it "could be taken with roasted apples". Sarsfield and the Irish Jacobites boldly declared that they would not submit, and said that they would defend the city themselves. Tyreconnel and Lauzun decided to remove themselves to Galway for transportation to France. They appointed General Boisseleau Governor of the city, but removed all the French troops, their cannon and equipment with them. The whole of the Irish army, numbering about 15,000 remained to defend Limerick under Boisseleau and Sarsfield.</p>
<p>The news of the departure of the French elated the Williamites, who now considered Limerick a push over, and were sure of abject surrender on their terms. William marched on several days ahead of his cannon, ammunition and provisions. Thus he was without the full equipment which was essential for a siege, and which was on a siege train which followed from Dublin at a more leisurely pace. On the 7th of August 1690 the Williamite army of about 40,000 camped at Caherconlish, about seven miles south-east of Limerick. The Jacobites in the city were puzzled as to why William was not commencing the siege. A deserter from the enemy provided the answer. He informed them that the Dutch general was waiting for the siege train which was on its way, and was presently approaching Cashel on August 10th. Sarsfield was among those who interrogated the deserter, and a daring plan began to form in his mind.</p>
<p>On Sunday night August 10th 1690, under cover of darkness, Sarsfield rode out of Limerick with a company of six hundred picked riders. With their horse-hooves muffled, they rode silently out of Limerick on the north side, and continued through Co. Clare, where they crossed the Shannon at Killaloe. They crossed over into the Silvermines Mountains and when dawn appeared they camped in the valley of Keeper Hill. They were guided by Galloping Hogan, who was the leader of the famous Wild Rapparees, in this expedition. He knew every inch of the countryside between Cashel and Limerick, and his services were invaluable on that night. On the slopes of Keeper Hill they were clearly drawing closer to the siege train, and extreme caution was necessary lest they would be betrayed. Luck was on their side, and every person encountered proved a valuable source of information. With extreme caution Sarsfield drew nearer and nearer to the advancing siege train. They found that the convoy was guarded by one hundred soldiers only. Confident that they would not be attacked, the convoy halted for the night at Ballyneety, a little place south-east of Limerick and only ten miles from Williams camp. Drawing up their wagons near a ruined castle, they turned the horses to graze, and leaving only five or six on guard duty, the escort turned in for the night. The guards also fell asleep. This was Monday night August 11th.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, a spy had brought news of Sarsfields movements to William's camp. He had seen the Irish dragoons moving through the mountains and hastily brought the news to the enemy. No one took much notice of this news, as it was commonplace to have frequent movement of troops, and it was considered that the spy was trying to secure his own position with the Williamites. The King chanced to hear it and at once guessed what Sarsfield was up to. He ordered a detachment to leave the camp at nine o’clock that night to meet the convoy and protect it on the last stage of its journey.</p>
<p>But the luck of the Irish was with Sarsfield on this mission. In the evening one of his soldiers horses cast a shoe, and he was obliged to fall behind and walk the animal. He met with a woman on her way to Ballyneety, and they became engrossed in conversation. She told him that she was the wife of a Williamite soldier and that she was on her way to Ballyneety to rejoin her husband, who was one of the escort of the siege train. She told him that the password for the night was Sarsfield.</p>
<p>The Irish soldiers gradually closed in on the siege train, and in single file approached the sentry. The first was allowed to pass after giving the correct password, and Sarsfield came next. Legend has it that he answered the challenge with a delighted roar: Sarsfield’s the word and Sarsfield’s the man. Too late the escort realised their danger, and over half were killed, the rest fled and one officer was taken prisoner. The Irish rounded up about five hundred horses, which were already saddled and bridled and with pistols in the saddles. The siege train itself exceeded all expectations. It comprised of one hundred and fifty-five wagons of stores, mainly ammunition for the military; six twenty-four pounder cannons; two eighteen pounders; five mortars; eighteen pontoons, and twelve wagons of biscuit and other provisions.</p>
<p>All the wagons were dragged on top of one another. The siege guns were filled with powder, and their muzzles were rammed deep into the ground. The casks and pontoons and ammunitions were flung up on top of this pile. A short trail of gunpowder was laid and ignited, and the Irish soldiers made haste their escape. There was a flash that lighted all the heavens, and the ground rocked and heaved, and with a deafening roar the vast mass burst into the sky.</p>
<p>The ammunition exploded with a blinding flash, and the pile burned steadily. William’s siege train was a pile of shattered wreckage. Luck was still on the Irish side. The Dutch company, that was ordered out to protect the convoy, did not leave Limerick at the appointed time of nine o’clock, but delayed its departure until after midnight. They were only about a mile from Ballyneety when the explosion occurred. Furiously rushing to the scene of the explosion they found that the Jacobites had fled. They arrived just in time to be too late. They followed for some distance, but believing capture impossible, they wheeled westward trying to cut off Sarsfield before he reached the Shannon. Darkness favoured the Irish, and with Galloping Hogan as their guide they safely crossed the Shannon at Portumna on the 14th August. The pursuers gave up the chase, and with their tails between their legs they returned to their camp in Limerick. Sarsfield was now in familiar territory, as he was in his brother-in-laws estate in Portumna. He made his way easily back to Limerick, where he received a rapturous welcome. Pride in his daring move revived the flagging spirits of the garrison in Limerick, and they now prepared themselves for a stout resistance.</p>
<p>The exploit at Ballyneety saved Limerick. It took William a whole week to replace the equipment that had been destroyed, and it gave the Irish time to regroup, whilst awaiting news of reinforcements from France, and it brought nearer the rainy season which favoured the Irish. Back to Top</p>
<p>William began his siege of Limerick on 17th August 1690, but after massive resistance by the garrison and the people of Limerick, the siege was lifted on the 30th of August, and William sailed out of Ireland immediately for England, leaving Ginkel in charge. He sent over also that renowned general, Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, who was an uncle to the Duke of Berwick.</p>
<p>Tradition has preserved the route of Sarsfield's Ride. He rode first to Glennagross and then down to Ballyvalley ford outside Killaloe where he crossed the river, and then inland to Labadiha Bridge (also known as Hogan's Glen). He then made his way into the wooded Silvermine mountains, along the west side of Keeper Hill through Ballyhourigan Wood and then up the valley to Toor and between the hills to Rearcross. Mother Mountain and the Bilboa river valley are next encountered, and then on to Glengar. After dark on the 11th of August, Sarsfield's men crossed the low country to Toem, Monard and Cullen, and from there they moved quickly to Derk, and thence one mile on to Ballyneety. A memorial on the site of the battle was unveiled by the then President of Ireland, Cearbhall O‘Dalaigh on August 8th 1976.</p>
<p>Song of Sarsfield's Trooper</p>
<p>The night fell dark on Limerick and all the land was still, As for the foe in ambush we lay beside the hill; Long impatiently we waited to rush upon our prey, With noble Sarsfield at our head before the break of day. From Dublin came foemen, with deadly warlike store - Huge guns with tons of powder and thund’ring balls galore But little was he dreaming that there to work his bale, We’d come with our commander bold from dark Slieve Felims Vale.</p>
<p>At the lonely hour of midnight each man leaped on his stead, Down moor and vale to Cullen we dashed with lightening speed; Then eagerly we galloped to Ballyneety’s wall, Where lay our foe’s encampment with guns and stores and all. "Give the word!" - "The word is Sarsfield, and Sarsfield is the man: And here I am!" our general cried, as down on them we ran; Then God he cleared the firmament, the moon and stars gave light, And for the battle of the Boyne we took revenge that night.</p>

<p><b>Sei</b>: The main protaganist. Sei is the son of a man who makes hunter's gloves for Nexus. Sei is the only one who can use Virtua Souls. He can also use Synapse Break (allows you to keep enemies in the air for a longer period) and Synapse Bomber (summons one of the Virtua Fighters to do a blast attack that knocks enemies off their feet). Only one other person can use Synapse Break.</p>
<p><b>Hayami</b>: Sei's friend. Hayami is an ExA class treasure hunter. He acts like Sei's manager during the early part of the game. Hayami calls the Virtua Souls "Ghost Data" an later on tells Sei that the Virtua Soul looked like random data to him and not like fighting technique data.</p>
<p><b>Toka</b>: Toka is/was a member of Judgement Six. She really seems to care about Sei and also wants to stay out of the way. While she worked Judgement Six, she assisted an cyber detective and his partner Raud into data files of Judgement Six's illegal activities. However, it was all a trap. She deleted Raud's backup data and then derezzed (Derezz is short for Dresolution) him permanently. She is one of three characters who don't have a hunter's glove. The thing on her collar allows her to turn invisible.</p>
<p><b>Raud</b>: Raud was the partner of a Cyber detective. He was derezzed by Toka. He apparently can still live in Nexus. He gives Sei the Synapse Break data. He is the second of three characters who don't have a hunter's glove.</p>
<p><b>Bit</b>: Bit is Sei's partner. His purpose is to act as a guide to the world of Nexus. Sei's Bit has a Virtua Soul detector. All other Bits do not. All Bits can evolve into diffrent forms, however, this serves no other purpose than causeing Bit to have different powers and looking cute. Sei's Bit starts of as a Bunny-Type and can detect items.</p>

<p>Alex Marotta is a pupil at Stamford Endowed School and he is a wemo, a person who is a wannabe emo, he likes to think of himself as an individual but being able to group him into the catergory wemo obviously means he has achieved this as he is the only one!</p>
<p>What's more he has auburn hair a sort of cross between red and brown - BUT with black eyebrows etc. Thus he is not a PROPER redhead - but a halfcast redhead. he was thinking of dying his hair black, but decided against it as he realised that there are a lot of people that actually like his hair colour (yes, its true!).</p>

<p>Frederick Louis (F.L.) Maytag founded the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maytag.html" title="Maytag">Maytag</a> Company, eventually becoming the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maytag_Corporation_dfb1.html" title="Maytag Corporation">Maytag Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>F.L. Maytag was the eldest of 10 children born to German immigants Daniel and Amelia Maytag. F.L. was born in <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cook_County%2C_Illinois_bf0c.html" title="Cook County, Illinois">Cook County, Illinois</a>. When ten years old F.L. traveled in a covered wagon with his family to a small farm near <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurel%2C_Iowa_b10a.html" title="Laurel, Iowa">Laurel, Iowa</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_County_76d9.html" title="Marshall County">Marshall County</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1867.html" title="1867">1867</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a> F.L., his two brothers-in-laws, and George W. Parsons each contributed $600, for a total of $2,400, to start a new farm implement company named Parsons Band-Cutter &amp; Self Feeder Company. This company produced threshing machines, band-cutters, and self-feeder attachments invented by Parsons.</p>
<p>F.L. Maytag eventually toke sole control of the firm and renamed it the Maytag Company. As Maytag grew, F.L. forayed into other businesses. In the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910%27s.html" title="1910's">1910's</a>, F.L. left the day-to-day company operation in the hands of sons E.H. and L.B., to concentrate on other business areas including new innovations of a washing machine with a gas powered motor branded as the Multi-Motor and a washing machine with an agitator that forced the water through the clothes branded as the Gyrafoam. These inventions proved exteremly valuable as by <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>, Maytag was producing more than twice the washers of its nearest competition and had outperformed the industry with growth doubling for five years consecutive years.</p>
<p>Even after E.H. Maytag became Maytag's president in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, F.L. was active in promoting Maytag products, and ensuring worker happiness and often greated employees by asking, "Is everybody happy?"</p>
<p>F.L. married Dena Bergman, and they had two sons and two daughters. F.L.'s donated to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton%2C_IA_c5aa.html" title="Newton, IA">Newton, IA</a> a 40-acre park and swimming pool, now named Maytag Park and Maytag Pool. He built and donated the Maytag Hotel and spearheaded a theater and a water plant. F.L. also built hundreds of houses for his workers, selling them on easy terms.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, F.L. Maytag died of a heart ailment at his winter home in <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Hills%2C_CA_a4f0.html" title="Beverly Hills, CA">Beverly Hills, CA</a>, leaving a $10 million estate. A special train brought mourners from the east coast to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton%2C_IA_c5aa.html" title="Newton, IA">Newton, IA</a>, and an estimated 10,000 factory workers and salesman formed lined five blocks in length to observe the casket processional.

<p>When people refer to global capitalism they usually mean an expansion of the networks of the capitalist system to incorporate more parts of the world.</p>
<p>This includes the rapid expansion of productive networks, particualy industrial production, beyond the tarditional industrial bases of Norh America, Western Europe and Japan. The globalisation of production means that products once manufactured in the US (for example) are now manufactured in Korea, China and Indonesia (as fine examples). Ths process is also called Thrd Wave Industrialisation which refers to the spread of productive processes that thirty years ago were found almost entierly in the first wolrd but which are now expanding to, and relocating to, the thrid world- what development theorists call the Newly Industrialised Countries (the NICs).</p>
<p>Capitalist networks also include productive and commercial relations. So not only is industrial manufacture now incorporating more places and peoples but these places and peoples are themselves drawn into complex economic (and cultural and political) relationships with other people many thousonds of miles away. For example the labourers making a product are in a wage relationship with the company that employs them even when that company might be based on the other side of the world. Also the consumers of a product, or service,are entering into a relationship with people equally far away.</p>
<p>The rise of Multi-Ntional Corporations (MNCs), Transnational Corporations (TNCs) and Global Conglomeretes and the creation of globally intergrated finacial markets has driven and is driven by all this. The movemnets in financial markets in Hong Kong affect a TNCs car production in Brazil whilst a board decision in Frankfurt means lay offs in Shanghi.</p>
<p>In simple terms people talk about global capitalism because they recognise that modern capitalism is different from the capitalism of thirty years ago. In the 1970s capitalism was a first world system that kept the third world in a dependant periphery. economic structures within capitalism were closely linked to a particular nation-state. There were national capitalims (eg: Japan and Germany) and international, or transatlatnic capitalism inwhich the different national economies interacted. Today those structures are to so tied to particular nation-states or economic sysyems. This gives a remarkable amount of free reign to capital to increas its profits and powers and powers and profits.</p>

The Satyanarayana Pooja is usually done on the <i>Poornima</i> day of every month (full moon day). It is also done on special occasions and during times of achievements as an offering of gratitude to the Lord. These occasions include marriage, graduation, and the purchase of a new home to name a few. In addition, it is said that a devotional performance of this pooja will bear children to infertile couples.</p>
<p>The pooja starts by a prayer to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Ganesha_0b53.html" title="Lord Ganesha">Lord Ganesha</a>, the elephant God and remover of all obstacles that may occur as a result of incorrectly performing the pooja. This is done by chanting all the names of Lord Ganesha and offering <i>prasad</i> (a food offering, usually consisting of one of Lorg Ganesha's favorite foods - <i>modak</i>, a sugar and coconut mixture, or <i>lhadu</i>) and the showering of flower petals.</p>
<p>Another part of the prayer involves a prayer to the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navagraha.html" title="Navagraha">Navagraha</a>'s, which are the 9 important celestial beings, in the universe. They consist of <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surya.html" title="Surya">Surya</a> (the Sun), <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandra.html" title="Chandra">Chandra</a> (the moon), Angaaraka/<a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevaai.html" title="Chevaai">Chevaai</a> (Mars), <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budha.html" title="Budha">Budha</a> (Mercury), <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">Guru</a> aka Bruhaspati (Jupiter), <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shukra.html" title="Shukra">Shukra</a> (Venus), <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sani.html" title="Sani">Sani</a> (Saturn), <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahu.html" title="Rahu">Rahu</a> (the head of Demon snake), and <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketu.html" title="Ketu">Ketu</a> (the tail of Demon snake).</p>
<p>The rest of the prayer consists worship to Lord Satyanarayana, an extremely benevolent form of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Vishnu_2d39.html" title="Lord Vishnu">Lord Vishnu</a>. Again, names of Lord Satyanarayana are chanted along with offering of a variety of <i>prasads</i> (including a mixture of milk, honey, ghee/butter, yogurt, sugar) and flower petals.</p>
<p>Another requirement of the pooja is that the story of the pooja be heard amoung all those observing and partaking in the pooja. The story involves the origin of the pooja, the benefits of it, and the potential mishaps that may occur with the careless performance of the pooja.</p>
<p>The prayer concludes with an <i><a href="../../../a/a/r/Aarti.html" title="Aarti">Aarti</a></i>, which consists of revolving a small fire-lit-lamp in the vicinity of an image of the Lord. After the pooja is over, participants and observers of the pooja are required to injest in the <i>prasad</i> that was offered and blessed by the Lord.</p>

The <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyanarayana_Puja_c9c9.html" title="Satyanarayana Puja">Satyanarayana Puja</a> is unique in that it does not require a brahman to perform.</p>
<p>The Satyanarayana Pooja is usually done on the <i>Poornima</i> day of every month (full moon day). It is also done on special occasions and during times of achievements as an offering of gratitude to the Lord. These occasions include marriage, graduation, and the purchase of a new home to name a few. In addition, it is said that a devotional performance of this pooja will bear children to infertile couples.</p>
<p>The pooja starts by a prayer to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Ganesha_0b53.html" title="Lord Ganesha">Lord Ganesha</a>, the elephant God and remover of all obstacles that may occur as a result of incorrectly performing the pooja. This is done by chanting all the names of Lord Ganesha and offering <i>prasad</i> (a food offering, usually consisting of one of Lorg Ganesha's favorite foods - <i>modak</i>, a sugar and coconut mixture, or <i>lhadu</i>) and the showering of flower petals.</p>
<p>Another part of the prayer involves a prayer to the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navagraha.html" title="Navagraha">Navagraha</a>'s, which are the 9 important celestial beings, in the universe.

<p>"UKBEG" or the UK Buell Enthusiasts Group was born on 1st April 1998. The person behind the formation of the Group was a guy called Chris Jessop from Yorkshire, England. Chris bought a Buell S1 in 1997, the first year of official imports into the UK and fell in love with the brand. With a few like minded souls, Chris launched the UK Buell Enthusiasts Group. Chris knew that the bikes were rare in the UK, quite "exotic" in fact, but the owners were (and still are!) a passionate bunch. Chris ran the group along with his wife Jane from 1st April 1998 until April 2000 when, after two hectic and loss making years he just had to give the project a rest. The original UKBEG is still fondly remembered and the club magazine "American Thunder" is still missed by many in the UK.</p>
<p>However, the group didn't die! An early user of the World Wide Web, Steve Shakeshaft saw that the way forward for the group was on the web, with electronic publishing of "American Thunder" the way forward. So the group was "relaunched" on December 31st 1999. Just a few weeks before Chris Jessop decided to give UKBEg a rest for a while. Steve created a website at the domain ukbeg.org.uk with a forum hosted at a "free" forum hosting site long since defunct and a photo gallery at another "free" host, again long since defunct. This was clearly a shoestring operation with zero funding and a steep learning curve for Steve! The group slowly started to re-form. From a (very) small number of folks from the original UKBEG, the website and group grew and flourished. In fact, I believe it to be the very first "web only" virtual motorcycle club in the UK and possibly Europe. As time went by, the group was outgrowing its "shoe string" website with members steadily growing in number internationally, as well as UK based. Steve decided to take the group to a more "professional" home. The domain UKBEG.COM was purchased and an entirely new website was written by Steve. The Forum was Snitz 2000 and for wahile the whole site settled down really well and was a huge success. The actual launch of the new UKBEG.COM group is not documented because following a preview of the website, member Alison White was so impresed she told lots of other members about it, so the site was sort of launched and still developed at the same time! Shortly after the launch, a new domain BIKE-PIX.COM was purchased on which a Picture Gallery was hosted. At this time, the group was funded by 6 trade sponsors and this arrangement lasted for just over a year. However, the Forum software Snitz 2000 soon showed the strain. After a number of upgrades to a better database etc... the forum was changed to phpBB hosted at the group's secondary domain, BIKE-PIX.COM. Steve continued to administer the group and it has become the UK's premier source of Technical information and Socialising for Buell Enthusiasts. To this day, as Chris Jessop originally intended, you do <b>NOT</b> have to <b>OWN</b> a Buell to be a member. Just an enthusiast about Buells! Steve finally handed over the reigns to another member (in fact several members) in May 2005, completely exhausted at the effort of keeping the group going!</p>
<p>To this day, the group thrives at www.ukbeg.com and there is a huge sense of "belonging" amongst the many diverse members. Throughout the year there are meetings across the UK, every weekend from spring through to autumn, supported by more local week day gatherings and ad-hoc ride outs, meetings etc. The highlight of the group year is the annual winter meet called the "Sproutfest". This event having been held every winter for several years is eagerly looked forward to by the membershp every year. Some of the stories from past Sproutfests are now group legends! Long may UKBEG prosper!</p>

Michael Thomas Zoccano (also known as: Michael Trevdon Donverlly, Guy Switchburg, Marcus Munroe Titherby and Ice-Man McGee) is a performance artist who is currently living in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area).</p>

<p>EARLY LIFE</p>
<p>Michael Thomas Zoccano (MTZ) was born December 24th 1979 in Hamilton Ontario at Joseph Brant Hospital to Paula Lenore and Nicholas Franklin Zoccano. In 1982 his family, including 4 brothers – Joseph, Allan, Xavier and Norman – and 2 sisters – Shelly and Donna, moved to Terra Cotta Ontario to an estate which his parents christened “Stanfield Cove”. He spent his childhood years at Stanfield Cove and his family lived there until the latter part of 1989. During the early years of his MTZ’s parents discovered that he had a talent – he was a born performance artist and this first became clear to himself and his family in 1984 when he built his first “Replica of Paris” out of Lego (the model was not to scale but was a staggeringly accurate portrayal of “The City of Lights”…at least for a 4 year old). This “construction project” (MTZ was later known to have said that his “City of Lights” models were partly responsible for his intense grief in his later life and could very well have been the sole catalyst for the incidents that happened in 1998) would become a yearly tradition until 1989 and the incident which, amongst the Zoccano family, would become known as “The Fall”.</p>
<p>The early years at Stanfield Cove were mostly happy for MTZ. He would play in the forest, build forts (MTZ would later revisit his love for fortress building and eventually complete a life-sized recreation of his parents garage. However he constructed it 24.5 feel above the ground between a cluster of Birch, Elm, Cedar and Maple trees, located in a now deceased section of forest in the north-western section of Oakville, Ontario Canada. The Garage or “The Gee” as it became known, was eventually destroyed, along with the forest it was housed in, to make room for a new development of executive class homes) and generally participate in average “kids things”. He even befriended one of his neighbors – Jonathan R. Radcliffe and the two of them remained friends until 1999 when Radcliffe took his own life. (Radcliffe had been involved in an illegal diet-pill ring and when he caught wind that the police were on to him, he took a lethal dose of Conjugated Linoleic Acid – he actually died from a blood sugar overdoes as a bi-product of the CLA. Radcliffe was a diabetic.) Over all MTZ had an excellent childhood by most standards.</p>

<p>Brokephosis is a very serious medical condition which effects various limbs of the body. After a traumatic event, ie an accident or injury. The veins and arteries in the digit recalibrate themselves in the new position. This, in turn, can create strangely jointed hands and feet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Treatment:<br />
Treatment is very limited in treating brokephosis. The surgeons actually have to reopen the the affected area down and completely reconstruct the foot or hand in the right position. Even after reconstruction, the hand or foot is still barely less crooked at best. Brokephosis surgeries are some of the most expensive types of reconstructive surgeries, only second to reconstructive neural surgery.</p>
<p>Here are examples of brokephosis in accident and trauma victims: [<a href="http://www.taylor.org/~argus/all/incountry/virginia/wintergreen_feb_2002/crooked_grimace_feet.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.taylor.org/~argus/all/incountry/virginia/wintergreen_feb_2002/crooked_grimace_feet.JPG" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] [<a href="http://www.lifebridgehealth.org/images/sinai_body/limb/cases/mnt4a.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lifebridgehealth.org/images/sinai_body/limb/cases/mnt4a.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] [<a href="http://www.lifebridgehealth.org/images/sinai_body/limb/cases/mnt1.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lifebridgehealth.org/images/sinai_body/limb/cases/mnt1.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]</p>

<p>ETFs (Electronically Traded Funds) are equities that act like a passive mutual fund. Individual traders buy and sell the ETFs at the price set for by the market as a representation of the actual value of securites held inside the fund. Originally, ETFs were mirrors of a particular equity index, however companies like [ishares.com iShares.com] have begun selling fixed income ETFs, <a href="../../../r/e/i/REITs_a750.html" title="REITs">REITs</a>, Gold, Oil, Silver, and other Commodities. Because ETFs generally mirror an index; long and short term capital gains are much lower then actively traded mutual funds. ETFs settle like a stock (3 days), while most mutual funds settle at the end of the day of the transaction. Prices also vary throught the day like a stock, unlike a mutual fund that prices at the close of business day.</p>

<p>Little is known about Nebel, except that he was born in Altona, a town west of Hamburg on March 18, 1805. He died 50 years later in Paris, in June 1855. He was an architect, designer and painter and was educated according to the customs of his time and influenced strongly by the neo Classic movement; his works belong to the artistic current known as Romanticism that was at its peak in France in the 19th century. His work reflects this current of thought and style.</p>
<p>Nebel’s work, titled “Picturesque and Archeological Journey through the most important part of the Mexican Republic from 1829 to 1834” consists of 50 color and black and white lithographs. This work was designed by Nebel himself but was printed at two different workshops in Paris. Bernard Lemercier Lithographs and Co., located on Rue de Seine S. G. gg, and Frederick Miahle Bros., at Rue Saint Honoré 35. Some of the laminas were lithographed by Arnold, others by Emile Lasalle, who worked at the Bernard and Frey workshop. Cuvillier and Lehnert also worked on the lithographs.</p>
<p>The French edition of Nebel’s work was published in 1836, and the Spanish version came out four years later. His texts that accompanied the lithographs providing an explanation of the detailed illustrations reveal that the writer had knowledge of the books written by the first 16th century Spanish historians like Torquemada, as well as others like Alexander Von Humboldt and Antonio de León y Gama.</p>
<p>Having completed his journey through the northern, coastal and bajío regions of Mexico, as well as visiting Mexico City and Puebla, he returned to Paris and had an interview with Humboldt in which he asked him of he would write the prologue to his book. The baron complied and wrote of the naturalist feeling, the aesthetic nature and the archeological interest of the work. He also praised the extreme dedication of the German explorer, but Humboldt was most interested in the lithographs.</p>
<p>Nebel’s main objective in his work was to inform the public of the different natural and artistic aspects of Mexico, which he called “Atica Americana”</p>
<p>He did not wish to instruct the reader but rather, entertain him.</p>
<p>His lithographs covered three themes: archeology, urbanism and Mexican customs. The archeology section contains 20 lithographs; the urban section has 20 and the remaining 10 deal with the local dress and customs.</p>

"Richard Nelson's provocative account of the deadly rivalry between two great 18th century actors, one quintessentially American, the other quintessentially British.</p>
<p>A writer obsessed with American vs. English notions of society and class, Nelson spins out a fantasy in comic but almost documentary detail, from the events that led to New York's Astor Place riots in May 1849. Competing productions of MACBETH with American heartthrob Edwin Forrest and British star William Macready drove an America First mob to break up Macready's performance....</p>
<p>It all adds up to a rare event for Broadway, a big, populated show in which life, art and melodrama happily co-exist."</p>
<p>Jeremy Gerard, Variety</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Richard Nelson, who wrote TWO SHAKESPEAREAN ACTORS, is one of our most--forgive the weasel word--interesting playwrights. Having lived both in America and in England, he has acquired a sort of mid-Atlantic accent in his writing. This equips him with both dryly English quips and juicy American humor. ...his plays...show a concern for the world that few American plays do...."</p>

<p>On December 14, 1992, Wayne Lo committed one the first deadly school shootings of the 1990's when he gunned down a professor- Nacunan Saez, a fellow student- Galen Gibson, and wounded a security guard- Teresa Beavers, and 3 other fellow students- Thomas McElderry, Joshua Faber, and Mather David. Wayne Lo was born in Taiwan in 1974. His family immigrated to the US in 1987, settling in Billings, Montana. In 1991, Wayne Lo was accepted by Simon's Rock College of Bard in Great Barrington, MA and given the W.E.B. DuBoise minority scholarship. Wayne Lo's conservative views were deemed racist, homophobic and anti-semitic by fellow students at Simon's Rock, leading Wayne Lo and his friends to be outcasted. Wayne Lo ordered and received ammunition from a mail order arms company and purchased a SKS carbine the very day of the shooting at a sporting goods store in Pittsfield, MA. Although statements were made accusing Wayne Lo of being a racist, homophobic and anti-semitic bigot, he was never charged with a hate crime violation. Wayne Lo was convicted and sentenced to 2 consecutive lst degree life sentences without possibility of parole in 1994, after his insanity plea defense failed. In 1999, Gregory Gibson, the father of Galen Gibson, wrote and published Gone Boy- A Walkabout. A detailed book recounting the shooting. The book spurred correspondence between Wayne Lo and Mr. Gibson. A New York Times article as well as 2 documentaries were made detailing the relationship. The rock band Weezer wrote a song about Wayne Lo called Lullaby for Wayne.</p>

<p>The X-1 Viper Automadon is a futuristic mechanized war vehicle seen in the Star Wars Dark Empire trilogy. The Automadon first appears in the comic Dark Empire II on the planet Balmorra. Looking something like a large beetle, the Automadon is one of the most powerful mechanized attack vehicles in the Star Wars universe. Designed by a man by the name of Beltane, it posesses molecular shielding that absorbs the energy blasts of attackers and then utilizes that energy to fire its own blaster cannons. The X-1 Viper Automadon was first battle tested during a rebellion against the Galactic Empire on Balmorra. They Automadons were used to demolish the oncoming Imperial attackers. The Rebel Alliance recieved a shipment of these war machines and used them to infiltrate and assault the Imperial capital of Byss.</p>
