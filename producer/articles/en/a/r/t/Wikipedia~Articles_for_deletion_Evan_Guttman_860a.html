<p>Any claim to notability that this person has is solely due to the Stolen Sidekick ordeal; he is not famous enough outside of htat incident. The article should logically redirect to How NOT to steal a SideKick 2, which was deleted. If that incident isn't notable enough for inclusion into Wikipedia, I feel that this person doesn't either.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I am confused. The StolenSidekick story was reported around the world, with the name Evan Guttman appearing in Newspaper headlines, radio, and TV. For 3 weeks straight there were 5-10 million hits a day on the website and even though the story is over, more than 100,000 hits still a day. It was linked in over 400,000 websites. Yet, Wikipedia deleted the page twice. Now someone has created this page, and again it is being put up for deletion. What does it take to "make" Wikipedia. There is a page about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Poop_Girl" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Poop_Girl" rel="nofollow">Dog Poop Girl</a>. That wasn't reported in US newspapers (let alone on the front pages of them), yet it has a page here. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Kid" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Kid" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Kid</a> has a page... The StolenSidekick saga too had people creating videos, flash games, and photoshops. So, again...what does it take? In the end, I will quote what someone wrote when the Dog Pool Girl page was up for deletion: "these are the kinds of entries that make wikipedia so much more than an encarta clone. Interesting, if not always tasteful, articles about EVERYTHING notable... not just one person's concept of "appropriate".

<li><b>Keep</b> Worth keeping, the story is fresh, newsworthy and interesting. teaches people to be honest. JohnD508 00:33, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The argument against this article's notability has been sustained yet no valid reasoning has been presented in this light. That the value of the information being presented here can only be weighted in context is, in my opinion, not a legitimate argument because the nature of all information in this universe is that it can only be viewed in context--inside an infinite size system, all events are relative to each other. Ergo, the notability of first president George Washington exists only in context of a country called the United States of America, which in turn is only notable in context of a planet named Earth, and so on. Ultimately, a true encyclopedic endeavor would mandate the inclusion of all perceivable information without bias or regard for its "relevance," if only because relevance is subjective while reference sources ought to be objective. I am not saying that limitations of current technology and financial availability must not reasonably limit such an endeavor, but rather that an event which has been recognized by the international community could not have done so were it not "notable" in the eyes of a great many. This factor must be considered if Wikipedia is truly for the people, because it is the people that demand this information. --Connected 24x7 05:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What matters is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Specifically, one of the guidelines states: "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)" Guttman has only been mentioned in the context of a single day's news event - the Sidekick incident - and nothing more, and thus does not meet the notability guideline as set in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li>However, another guideline states that it is okay to have articles for "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events," something Evan Guttman has, indeed, accomplished. And "In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful?" Most certainly--the moral aspect behind the Stolen Sidekick issue transcends time as a core value of humanity. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Connected 24x7 (<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConnected_24x7_7341.html" title="User talk:Connected 24x7">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Connected_24x7_7b66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Connected 24x7">contribs</a>) at 15:08, July 18, 2006.</small></li>

<li>Well, the second guideline that you pointed out is under the alternatives section, which has not necessarily gained widespread support. Also, why are you making such sweeping judgements over the predicted sentimental value of this incident? One oculd argue that the P-P-P-Powerbook also teaches the similar morales, about honesty and what-not. It is on Wikipedia because it was still memorable and well-known months after it had taken place. I don't necessarily know if it's a <i>de facto</i> guideline or real, but it has been a general guideline that people only notable due to a single event are redirected into that event's article. For instance, the owner of <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>, <a href="../../../c/j/a/CJayC_a5cf.html" title="CJayC">CJayC</a>, redirects to GameFAQs because he is not notable besides being the owner. <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patsy_Ramsey_edf9.html" title="Patsy Ramsey">Patsy Ramsey</a>, accused killer of her daughter, simply redirects into <a href="../../../j/o/n/JonBen%C3%A9t_Ramsey_b118.html" title="JonBenét Ramsey">JonBenét Ramsey</a> because she is not notable outside of her daughter's murder.

<li>I beg to differ. There were actually now 3 news events that were reported. One was the start of the website, the second was the arrest of the alleged thief and return of the Sidekick, and the third was the Ebay auction with portion to charity. On top of that, it caused debate online and in the media on what is the right thing to do when you find someone else's property. Maybe one of you can explain how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Poop_Girl" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Poop_Girl" rel="nofollow">Dog Poop Girl</a> fits in the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> Actually, according to the guidelines of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> this entry qualitifes:</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe that the three events that you mentioned are still tied into one main event - the sidekick event. It still all points to the same thing. Hbdragon88 21:34, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Are we to presume that <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanWasHere_7a61.html" title="User:EvanWasHere">User:EvanWasHere</a> is the subject of the article? Due to your comments above, one might conclude that you are arguing for this article because of its publicity value. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 14:48, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - You could conclude whatever you wish.. I didn't use a anonymous name on here. If you had read my site, you would have known that I have been turning down media interviews as I am done speaking about this story... So I am not trying to create more publicity. This page though, as it was made by one of my readers, I enjoy and appreciate. If there was a page about you on Wikipedia, wouldn't you defend it too? In the end, lets stick to the facts... 1.) There are other pages like this one on Wikipedia 2.) As stated above, this qualifies as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> 3.)
