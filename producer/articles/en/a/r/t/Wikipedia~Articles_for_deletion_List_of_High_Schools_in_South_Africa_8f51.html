<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists of schools are valuable because many notable schools do not have articles. All the redlinks in this list are evidence of the fact that many notable schools do not have articles. If there are errors in the list, they should be fixed. The capitalization of the article's title should also be fixed. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 12:55, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article might be redundant with <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchools_in_South_Africa_9dd8.html" title="Category:Schools in South Africa">Category:Schools in South Africa</a>, but it is not a business directory.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - most of the links are redlinks that have no articles. An encyclopaedia is made up primarily of articles, not links. Schools should be added as articles or stubs and categorised appropriately. - <a href="../../../r/a/k/User%7ERaker_9c52.html" title="User:Raker">Raker</a> 15:00, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the ability to include red links is one of the main assists of lists. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerchbow_41db.html" title="User:Merchbow">Merchbow</a> 15:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Merchbow. Lists are a vital tool to allow editors to see which articles need creating. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:46, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The list needs a lot of work: completion, disambiguation &amp; creation of articles/stubs to take care of the redlinks. But it's still somewhat useful as is, and can become very useful with careful cultivation. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 21:47, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Lists not redundant with categories. I've started a new religion where I go around voting keep every time I see that non-argument. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 09:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Despite the meaningless rhetoric, lists and categories are not equivalent and do not -- and never can -- serve the same purposes. The fact that the nominator (and those voting delete, for that matter) doesn't even bother to refer to a supposed Wikipedia policy that bans lists, or articles with many red links, speaks strongly for the retnetion of this and other, similar articles. I don't see any of the "errors" that the nominator mentions. I do see many red links, which are NOT a justification to delete an article, serve as placeholders for future articles and will magically turn blue once the corresponding articles were created. The fact that lists CAN have red links is a point in their favor. If someone started a religion whereby adherents would vote to keep any article where the list vs. category argument is used, I'd sign up in a second. Any info on such a religion and details on what holidays are observed would be appreciated. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 11:41, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: References to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> almost always merely mean "things I personally think don't belong here" and need far more detailed reference as to what aspect of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you think are <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> being satisfied by this article. Otherwise, we will <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> know what we can do to address your concerns. Claims based on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a> are a new one on me, but I see nothing whatsover in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a> that would justify deletion of this particular article. Again, we need to see a far more meaningful explanation of what is not being fulfilled in this particular article. If anything, this list fulfills all three of the primary purposes of a list as specified in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>: Information, Navigation and Development; none of which are fully satisfied by a category. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 04:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
