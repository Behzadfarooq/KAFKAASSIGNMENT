<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - For all the above and SGGS on Meat - The point of these quotations is to inform the reader of what these Holy texts have to say – that I hope you will agree is an important point; an important issue and a mechanism that needs to be preserved. The job of Encyclopaedias is to correctly inform!! Without quotations you get to a situation when wrong messages of the holy text can be conveyed as is happening with some aspects of Islam. So its is very important that we are allowed to quote these holy text verbatim so that the message is not interfered with – Discussion can be NPOV or POV, etc and these can be added to these articles if required. The quotations in themselves do not have a POV or NPOV – They are a FACT. The quote from the holy Bible is a FACT which has existed for 2000 years. Whether you believe it or not is another matter – Many billions believe in these facts. The writings of the Bible, Koran, SGGS, etc are all FACTS – They are NOT NPOV or POV. If I write that the SGGS says "There is one God" – That is a factual statement. If you go and look in the SGGS, then you will find that statement there. Whether you want to believe the statement or not – is another matter. Verbatim quotations are facts not subject to the POV or NPOV criterion. When we start making our own comments and have discussions on these texts, it can becomes POV or NPOV. I urge all participants here to vote and argue to keep the SGGS on Meat article as well.

<li><b>Keep all</b> - the articles are terrible - some of them need renamed - some could perhaps be merged. But these are notable (and I don't even need to cite <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a>). Bad content gets cleaned up - not deleted. I'm willing to work on this when I get some time (not this week). We always end up keeping these things, so I suggest this is withdrawn. If deletion was to proceed, we'd need to debate each seperately, as some of these have had huge imact on art, literature and cuture (leave aside religion). --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 21:31, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete All or Merge together</b>. They are just quotes from a fictional book(yes I believe the Bible is fictional) with at most a 2 sentence explanation, no need for seperate articles. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 23:32, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact is that over 2 billion people are <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a> worldwide (see <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_religious_groups.html" title="Major religious groups">Major religious groups</a>) and rely on the holy bible for guidance and enlightenment and for them this issue is of serious relevance – 2 sentences of explanation without the original text will not do! Also, this subject matter is important for them and so I feel there is justification for spreading the parables. - Your personal POV does not come into it. It's what the whole world believes in and thinks - that is significant!<br />
Further, these holy texts have been around for 1000s of years and many millions of Bibles have been printed giving this subject matter inherent magnitude. And finally, the issue of morality and spirituality is very relevant to the world and should be enhanced by coverage in an encyclopaedia. I ask you please, to be objective in your discussion and unbiased in the points that you make. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 00:39, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What you (or I) believe about the Bible is (or should be) beside the point. These parables (fiction or not) are worthy of distinct articles. However, as it stands, in many cases, the content could be merged for the time being (until proper neutral verifiable information can fill them out - it certainly exists).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 23:40, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The parables by themselves without interpretation belong on Wikisource. If they have interpretation, they need sourcing for that interpretation (which I don't see in the ones I spot checked, didn't look at all of them). <b>Delete or transwiki</b> but they don't belong here, this is not the place for sources. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 00:23, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This doesn't make much sense. The text themselves will already be on wikisource, so there's no point in a transwiki. So the question is what to do with the articles. We don't delete things because the current content is crap, we generally redirect elsewhere or stubify. Given we've plenty of sub-stubs, on much less noteworthy thing, that such as 'x is a school in New Hampshire' or 'Y is a film directed by Z', there seems little problem in stubifying these to 'is a parrable found in the gospel of Matthew at...' (if there is indeed no other information currently in the article) that allows for someone (perhaps me) to write an article later, without someone deleting it as a recreation. Let's just treat Bible articles like an others. If the closing admin wants to notify me, I'll clean these up myself. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 01:22, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not seeing the strong argument for keeping articles at the individual verse level. When I look at <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> for example, which is an entire book, the article is well sourced and ties themes of the book to other books via theme articles. I can see an article on all the parables, or on specific parables as they are told in several books, but not verses. Verses belong on Wikisource, where they already are, so scratch my suggestion to transwiki and just delete. I don't buy the "a crap article is better than no article" argument. I'm willing to revise my thinking for any of these that are substantially improved (remove the verse itself, point to source, and give cited references to the significance, meaning or connection of the parable) but in this state? No. They must go. We had individual verse articles before, and I remember them being on AfD. I thought they went. I certainly can't find them now, and I spent some time looking. WP is not a bible, and it is not an annotated bible. These must go unless they change a lot before the end of the AfD. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:49, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't looking hard enough for the verses.. here is the history of one (thank you pschemp for the ref): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Matthew_4:8&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Matthew_4:8&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> ... note that the verse is now a redirect to a more appropriate higher level place rather than bibletext. I feel that strengthens my argument. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:58, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>These are not merely random biblical verses or "straight quotes" as the nominator calls them, but parables of Jesus. Parables of Jesus are paramount to Christianity and are thereby notable. The articles are stubs, some of them badly written, but with your logic we should delete all stubs. The issue in question is the subject, not the quality of these articles. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 03:23, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm going to run with TJ Spyke's comment here for a second. If were discussing episodes of a TV series, we would be deciding whether there is enough information to go into the article to make it stand on its own. Even if we were talking, say, speeches of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._19fa.html" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, the standard would be, is the speech individually notable? That's why I see these articles as having been nominated: they are minor parables with either no discussion or only original research about an editor's perceived meaning of the parable. Based on that, the articles do not stand on their own and assert the notability of the individual parables, and that's why I favor deletion. That said, if an editor <i>does</i> have enough information to expand the articles that hasn't been brought to the table yet, then I favor the new, expanded article being allowed to exist. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 03:00, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>95% of articles are straight quotes from the Bible.</li>
<li>Little actual context.</li>
<li>What context exists is unsourced.</li>

<li>Yes, all that you say is true - so mark the articles for expansion, referencing and clean-up. None of these are deletion criteria - as there is sufficient context to know what subject matter is and to know that it is significant enough that a reasonable article can be written. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 10:01, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We don't do that. We keep things that should have good articles but havn't yet. We call them stubs. The existence of a stubified article is an invitation for someone to provide just the material you have indicated. Let's just treat Bible articles in the dull (but tried and tested) way we treat all others.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> - I agree that they seriously need to be improved so that they are more than just quotations from a particular religious source. However, given that these stories and parables are alluded to in all manner of litertaure and art, people will certainly look to an encyclopaedia to find out what the story is rather than try to find it in a Bible. I intend to improve a few of these, for example add an explanation of what the Unjust Steward actually does that is unjust, as well as what his solution actually implies. Whether we merge or keep them, they need to be here for people who will naturally look to an encyclopaedia to tell them in a neutral way what these stories are.--<a href="../../../l/l/o/User%7ELloegr-Cymru_9c46.html" title="User:Lloegr-Cymru"><b><font color="green">Lloegr</font><font color="black">-</font><font color="red">Cymru</font></b></a><sup><b><a href="../../../l/l/o/User_talk%7ELloegr-Cymru_4a9b.html" title="User talk:Lloegr-Cymru">£</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lloegr-Cymru_9d66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lloegr-Cymru">¥</a></b></sup> 12:40, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
