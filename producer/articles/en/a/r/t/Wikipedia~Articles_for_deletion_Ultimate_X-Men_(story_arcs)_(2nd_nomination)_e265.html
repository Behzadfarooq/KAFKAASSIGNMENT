<li><b>Keep</b> Upon reading the nomination reason, I was under the impression that each issue had a seperate article. However, it's actually giving quick summaries of all the story arcs on one page (except the last arc) which should be trimmed. Some formatting would probably help improve the article. (Example: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Heroes_graphic_novels_5858.html" title="List of Heroes graphic novels">List of Heroes graphic novels</a>) <a href="../../../f/m/m/User%7EFmmarianicolon_02b0.html" title="User:Fmmarianicolon">fmmarianicolon</a> | <a href="../../../f/m/m/User_talk%7EFmmarianicolon_bdb5.html" title="User talk:Fmmarianicolon">Talk</a> 01:24, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is no reason this can't be in the Ultimate X-Men article, and no reason for there to be an article just to explain the PLOT of some of the comics. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 01:46, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - I would really like to see some of the <i>Keep</i> advocates discuss how this article fits in with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> #7, which is official policy here on Wikipedia. ""Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic. <i>Until that happens I fail to see any valid reason for keeping it. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 01:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Speaking of the Spider-man page, which is how this page can be if it's fixed instead of deleted: real world context = creators and dates. historical significance = first appearances and deaths. sourced analysis = Notes like "This storyline is continued in the video game.", differnces with the original Spider-man continuity, etc. This is the larger topic that reasonable sized plot summaries can accompany. I agree this page needs work, but it doesn't need to be deleted. It sounds like we're going to disagree on what constitutes a valid larger topic, but I'd like to point out this is just a matter of opinion, not an obvious fail of WP:NOT. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 03:35, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In and of itself when related to articles, no. However, I was pointing out that the material being used to shield what is essentially an arc by arc summary of the entire run to date from Wiki guides, is, for the most part, duplicated on the parent article. Hence it carries less weight in evaluating this article. If the material was unique, then it would be a strong argument for retention of the article. As it stands, the primary aspect is the summary, the notes do not add enough to outweigh that, even in the revised format of "Tomorrow People" and "Magical". — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 08:15, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's needlessly detailed plot summary. Primary sources are useful when you're establishing uncontroversial facts to support commentary backed by secondary sources. If you're writing an episode guide by watching the episodes or a readers' guide based on reading the work, you're writing original research. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 00:00, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We fixed the first sections plot so it isn't overly long. Anyway, it sounds like you're confusing interpretation ("Any interpretive claims require secondary sources") and summarization. If you think watching the show or reading the book isn't a valid source for summarization, I guess you think all plot summaries on WP are OR. No wonder you tilt at the cruft windmill, everything would be OR cruft with that def. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 00:26, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm arguing that this article is utterly useless without intepretation, and interpretation is verboten. Right now, it doesn't offer useful context to any encyclopedic commentary, just unadorned plot summary. People who want to know nothing more than what happens in the comic can read the comic. This is why <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> counsels merging plot summary to articles with encyclopedic commentary, and redirecting when additional plot detail isn't needed. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 08:30, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that some real-world discussion of the Ultimate X-Men series is needed, but I think this article should be regarded as a companion piece of the main <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_X-Men_a58d.html" title="Ultimate X-Men">Ultimate X-Men</a> article. Real-world discussion about the whole series could go there, while real-world discussion about more specific plot-related issues could go here. The only reason this list is an independent article is its size. I can see in the page history that a couple of editors are working on it right now, so I'm willing to see where they take it.</li>

<dd>Oh, btw, I like the new format used in "The Tomorrow People". One other thing - we should avoid duplication. If we do plot outlines here, they should be removed from the main article - just add a blurb like "Main article: <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_X-Men_%28story_arcs%29_f143.html" title="Ultimate X-Men (story arcs)">Ultimate X-Men (story arcs)</a>" in the main article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 10:25, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Problems do exist with this article.</i> I do agree with many of those who chose "Delete" that this page has a large problem: lots of plot summary and not much else. Worse, it was all from an in-universe point of view. However, I don't believe a large problem means it is an unfixable problem. Peregrinefisher and I have worked toward providing better formatting and less summary in three of the sections: The Tomorrow People, Magical, and Cable. The sections still discuss plot, but we've added references to more real world perspective such as an interview where Robert Kirkman (the current main writer) describes how his perspective on the 90s mainstream Cable affected his choices when introducing the Ultimate version of Cable.</li>
<li><i>A problem also exists with the main article.</i> The main page for the Ultimate X-Men is now 30kb. According to the Rationale section of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_break_up_a_page_610a.html#Rationale" title="Wikipedia:How to break up a page">WP:Summary</a>, 30kb is the point where articles start to become lengthy. I know <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia isn't a crystal ball</a> but I'm going to gamble that the Ultimate X-Men series will not end or be discontinued soon. The article will continue to grow larger when Brian Singer takes over writing, and larger when subsequent changes happen to Ultimate X-Men. Much of the information from the plot section on the main page can be merged to or added to the story arc page. This would leave more space to add additional general information on the main page while putting more detailing information on the story arcs and their creative teams (in a NPOV, out-of-universe style) on a seperate page without leaving either page lengthy.</li>
<li><i>The page is not unfixable given work and time.</i> Is the page or even these three sections perfect? No. However, making a featured article or a good article takes time. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies_d339.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup controversies">2006 FIFA World Cup controversies</a> is an example of an article that went from AfD to Good Article status. I know some editors are worried that few improvements happened between the first and current AfD. However, the page history shows that since this AfD started many edits have been made. I personally have worked hard to contribute, and it would not end after the AfD ended. <a href="../../../f/m/m/User%7EFmmarianicolon_02b0.html" title="User:Fmmarianicolon">fmmarianicolon</a> | <a href="../../../f/m/m/User_talk%7EFmmarianicolon_bdb5.html" title="User talk:Fmmarianicolon">Talk</a> 03:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral / Comment</b>.
