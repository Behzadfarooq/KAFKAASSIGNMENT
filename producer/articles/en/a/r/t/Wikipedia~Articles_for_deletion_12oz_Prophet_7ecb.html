<p>I'm sure the members of 12oz Prophet may get a kick out of this article, but it doesn't belong on Wikipedia. This is not Encyclopedia Dramatica. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZaratoosa_0a1a.html" title="User:Zaratoosa">Zaratoosa</a> 14:01, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> We at 12oz have agreed to make this a serious article, not just "something to get a kick out of." Like I said before, wikipedia is about free information, and this is a notable website in the graffiti world. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJontimbo_cef8.html" title="User:Jontimbo">Jontimbo</a></li>
<li>Perhaps 12oz's hits should be noted? What is the argument that this is non-notable? Because its not important to you? Graffiti is regarded nation-wide as an important issue, and this site is a hub of the graffiti artists. Where else can you talk to graffiti writers? The streets of new york are covered in paint, but do you ever get to learn anything about what that person's life is like, or who they are, or anything about the artform? No, but this site allows you to. Wikipedia is about free information, and this article provides information about a website that is a core form of communication in a subculture. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJontimbo_cef8.html" title="User:Jontimbo">Jontimbo</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJontimbo_d0c1.html" title="User talk:Jontimbo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jontimbo_3c24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jontimbo">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>It should also be noted that it says in the thread to add to the wiki to make it more legit, and to argue why this should not be deleted. Not to add "VOTES" but to make the wiki better, stop making everything seem like the users of that site are making it a joke. -Grits</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> It was me who prod'd this back in July. It's still an article about a non-notable website that fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>KEEP</b>Yeah, the worlds largest and best run graffiti website, which has been up for 8 years, has over 55,000 members, 60,000 threads with a combined 2.65 MILLION posts inside those threads, really needs WIKIPEDIA for adspace. NON-NOTABLE website, maybe in your community, but in the graffiti world, this is the ONLY website. Backed by some of the BIGGEST artists in the graffiti community. At least do a little research into things before you describe something as "non-notable". So the worlds biggest graffiti website, which used to be one of the worlds biggest graffiti magazines, which has published one of the greatest graffiti books, which is backed by some of the worlds most famous graffiti artists, isn't notable enough?

<li>"If article X then article Y." is a fallacious argument. The article on Art Crimes may simply have not yet been written.

<li>Definitely keep, as mentioned 12ozprophet.com has been an ongoing effort of various minds throughout the world. These include some of the worlds most reknown graffiti artists and is a forum which allows participation from the inexperienced, to the masters of style. As far as not having any news mentions or no credibility as a source, the website in recent months has been highlighted by several news broadcasts. I will ad that with 55,000+ registered members, perhaps to you it is unoticeable, however to the community it is aimed for it is a premier source of information. yes artcrimes is the first website to feature graffiti as its central point, but why should 12oz prophet, a site which started 2 years after, be penalized and not be featured here?189.165.46.229 17:16, 28 September 2006 (UTC)Ginger Bread Man

<li><b>Comment</b> Do you have any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to back up your claims? Also, I have no idea what you mean about it being two years since "be penilized". --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 17:21, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see what you don't understand about it, makes sense to me. Why should 12oz be penalized because it started two years after Artcrimes, which by the way, has little to no actual content, just alot of pictures and dead links. No thanks. As far as news articles, it seems weird that you would notice the wikipedia article being announced so more people could come on here and fix it, but not notice, <a href="http://www.10news.com/news/9858635/detail.html" class="external free" title="http://www.10news.com/news/9858635/detail.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.10news.com/news/9858635/detail.html</a> , apparently the news thinks 12oz is a popular site. But how reliable are they? Grits
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. For establishing notability, we usually require multiple non-trivial notable mentions, with "notable" being very well-known or national news, or at least non-local news. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 18:33, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay. From the top:
<p>Of course Wikipedia is not a webhost. Clearly 12oz Prophet is strong enough to stand on its own. Yes, there is a link from the main page, so what? There are links to <i>many</i> other sites.</p>
<p>Yes, artcrimes would appear to be “<i>the</i> comprehensive source for graffiti information” with a cursory look. That is simply because it is the most well-known. I am having a hard time understanding this philosophy that 12oz doesn’t deserve its own article just because artcrimes doesn’t have one. That’s like saying Lili St. Cyr wouldn’t deserve an article if Bettie Paige didn’t have one. Also, if you go to the artcrimes page, and look at their list of best graffiti sites, guess who’s first? 12oz Prophet. Albeit, it is an alphabetical list, but the fact that 12oz is listed should say something.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you would consider 12oz a “reliable source”, the statistics kept as a function of the message board software should be sufficient enough. (Or, see for yourself on the main page of the forum.)</p>

<li>A reliable source has to be independent and notable. Also, statistics don't usually merit inclusion unless they're particularly outstanding and leading in their field. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 18:33, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>It wasn't clear which claims you were asking him to back up. I included those simply to affirm his comments about how busy the site is.<a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELili_St_Cynical_f5fc.html" title="User:Lili St Cynical">Lili St Cynical</a> 18:40, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'd also like to add that 12ozProphet has many more attributes that Art Crimes does not, simply due to the nature of it being a forum. Aside from the pictures, there are instructional threads and topics concerning safety, discussion of legal issues and individual rights, a political and current events forum, and a forum for non-graffiti-related art. I agree that the current article is a little lacking, but <b>I propose that Wiki give us a week to flesh it out a bit more and clean up a bit.</b>(did anyone read this?) Because truth be told, it really is an awesome site, and does deserve to have an article<a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELili_St_Cynical_f5fc.html" title="User:Lili St Cynical">Lili St Cynical</a> 18:40, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It will be at least 5 days before an admin decides whether the article should be deleted. If you think a clean-up will help, go for it.

<ul>
<li>"This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books,..." I will end it right here. Since 12ozprophet, actually started out as a graffiti magazine (a well sought out one, in fact one of the most infamous at it's time) I will exclude that one, and just tell you that it's been in SEVERAL graffiti magazines over the years, not limited to casual passes or ads, but full articles dedicated to the history, present, and future of 12ozprophet. Not only that, but has been in books, including but not limited to Also Known As. One of the best graffiti books to come out in recent years. So if being in several well known magazines, and books, not to mention PUBLISHING books, isn't notable then what is? Ask anyone within the community that we are in, and 12oz is not only the most well known site, but also the best run. Delete it if you want, me or someone I know will have a new one up the same day. -Grits <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.119.195.76 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.119.195.76_71fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.119.195.76">contribs</a>) 2006-09-28 20:01:40 (UTC)</small>

<li>I have to admit when I read the article, I laughed. It's funny, and in a way, it's accurate. We do discuss a lot of things on there- at times, I share anecodes about my life and am 100% aware of the fact that I am leaving myself open to all kinds of responses as a result of putting myself out there in the public eye. However, based on the guidelines of Wikipedia, it's not a good article. I interpret those guidelines to be something along the lines of neutrality and/or unbiased reporting, and it fails on both counts. I don't think it should be deleted, though. If anything, it should be allowed to remain, and edited by some of the moderators to include the history of the site (what was mentioned was cursory at best), what the policies of the forum are and how those policies came about, future plans for the site, its intended purpose, etc. I've been posting on the board for almost four years, and am still a little unclear on some of these points.

<li><b>KEEP</b>- not only does it have a coprihensive archive of graffiti related topics, it is one of the most current archives out on the net, as people can continually add new information and photos. It can be viewed as a magazine, that has grown online and which continues to grow with up to date pictures, events, shows, information, stories and products etc. It is in a sense, the equivalent of Wikipedia but for the graffiti community all around the world. I dont even see what the big deal is with keeping it. Its not like the site needs exposure on here to get membership and interest. It is well known among those who are into this kind of thing, and having it on here merely recognizes the soceital shift into online information and on going growth of online communities, that were once non existant. It is not on here to advertise anything, and it is a documentation of an online resource for those in the graffiti community. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by LUMOS (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LUMOS_ceb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/LUMOS">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— LUMOS (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LUMOS_ceb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/LUMOS">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li>It seems to me the nerds who continually come back here just to argue their point aren't going to listen anyway. I don't know where your Alexis rating gets your numbers, but it's nowhere near the 20million hits a month that the site is actually getting. I've already stated that it's been mentioned in several magazines, newspaper articles, and books. Not to mention, that it at one time WAS it's own graffiti magazine. I don't know how you expect me to reference this, since it's not online (there is a world outside of the internet, it uses paper) short of scanning it, and hosting it, and linking you to the picture.

<dd>Here's an excerpt for you, Graffiti Brasil p.18. "McGee told 12 Oz Prophet magazine editor Alen Benedikt/Raven about the Brazilian scene, and in 1997 he and Sonik travelled to Sao Paulo to visit Os Gemeos. The resulting 1998 issue of 12 Oz Prophet introduced the Brazilian scene to graffiti writers throughout North America and Europe, which catapulted Sao Paulo to the top of many writers' destination wish lists." Issue 6 is listed in the book's bibliography. This excerpt gives us a reliable verified source that mentions 12 Oz. And the quote itself also affirms just how notable it is; it was read across North America and Europe, and had widespread influence in making Brazil a desirable destination. --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">duncan</a> 07:03, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
