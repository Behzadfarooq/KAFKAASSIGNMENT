<li><b>Please keep</b> as I have checked <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> The only criteria that might possibly apply is the one forbidding formless collections of information. These all relate to the the sometimes tempestuous history of a significant parish in Scotland (meaning the people and events are well in the mainstream of Scottish history and not replicated elsewhere). In that, they give exemplary life to broader treatments elsewhere. John Robertson and James Meek wrote siginificant historical documents - still consulted today. Others to be added have had similar significant impact on the history of Scotland in turbulent times. The others you mention (Blair, Houston, Calderwood) are I admit there to fill in the historical record, but this is not formless or meaningless. I have not yet tracked down the criteria for "notability" and will have to take your advice on this, but I would have thought that the sharing of this sort of well established historical knowledge is just what Wikipedia does best. I appreciate not everyone is interested in history, especially local history, but loads are.

<dd>Hi there. I did read the articles, and researched them. Robert S Calderwood has his notability asserted as publishing. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Patriotism+-+a+coronation+address%22&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Patriotism+-+a+coronation+address%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Googling</a> (which is almost certainly not the best way to research this, but the only simple way) the Patriotism coronation address for which he was apparently known turns up one single result - the WP article. James S Johnstone's big thing was introducing gas lighting to his Church, and riding around "in a large black cloak". I personally don't feel that hymn translation is a notable activity. Bible translation potentially is, but Robert Blair wasn't doing it alone, and I doubt it had a very large effect on the number of people who could access it. At best, give him a line in an article about translation of the bible. Ergo, my vote. --<a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_807a.html" title="User:Mnemeson">Mnem</a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_Esperanza_c3bd.html" title="User:Mnemeson/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnemeson_24d9.html" title="User talk:Mnemeson">son</a> 13:29, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep Robert Blair</b>, and move per DeLarge. Being a part of the team that translated the Bible into Scottish Gaelic strikes me as a significant enough achievement, and per <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> translating the Bible into a small minority language is no less significant than translating it into English or French. <b>Weak delete</b> on the other two unless a further case for their notability is made out. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 13:59, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambuslang_clergy.html" title="Cambuslang clergy">Cambuslang clergy</a> page is also suspect; this is just a history of ministers in basically one parish, not a history of Christianity in Scotland.

<li><b>Comment</b>Please note that I have started a discussion topic at Wikipedia talk:Notability (people) to create a standard for notability of religious leaders. Some should have articles, if, for instance they are an official of their denomination churchwide, or they started some important movement, wrote widely used hymns, or were notable in ways special to religion. They probably should not have an article if they were just a typical priest, rabbi, or mullah serving a local group. We have such standards for Porn actors and sports figures, and it would save a lot of argumentation. I have also started a discussion for standards of notability for individual churches, also seen all the time in AFD. We have a standard for schools, so why not for churches. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:23, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. To English speakers Blair's work might not seem particularly important, but it sounds like he made some important contributions to Gaelic literature. He held some fairly important posts and wrote for a newspaper. I wouldn't say that any one thing is particularly notable but overall it seems enough to be worth keeping. <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a> 08:53, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</b></li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - This article's nomination for deletion should be a lesson in writing good articles. The article simply presents Robert Blair using a series of bland general statements about his life that fail to convey the importance of his contribution to society. The article needs to be rewritten to highlight Blair's contributions (his editorial and translation work), to explain the importance of his work, and to de-emphasize the bland biographical information (such as the exact dates of when he got married, when he moved to Edinburgh, etc.). Otherwise, it is going to look like the biography of an unimportant minister. George J. Bendo 12:27, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I am extremely confused by this and a couple similar comments at the AfD for the other minister I nominated. Since when is the rule "if it verifiably exists, it's in??" A huge proportion of the deletions at AfD are non-notable bands, vanity pages, etc - these people/bands do verifiably exist, but they are so obscure that there's no real benefit to having them. Do you support keeping such articles? Would you support keeping an article about me, a humble and insignificant student, were I to create and source it? I realize <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> is not official policy, but the idea of having no notability standards whatsoever is pretty bewildering... -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 20:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>: First of all, there is a big difference between an article about an obscure band with its only source being a Myspace account and an article about minister which is sourced from a reputable book about ministers. In the first case the source is created by the band itself, in the second case a secondary source already considered the minister important enough to include him in the book. Secondly, I am no big fan of the whole notability concept (which, I keep saying, is <i>not</i> official policy), mainly because it introduces a big bias towards American topics. I've seen people nominate very well-known asian artists for example, and even vigorously defend their AfD when confronted with evidence. All because this person was not "notable" (meaning they never heard of it). So, im my book, notability alone is a too slippery slope to be the only reason for deletion, ever. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> common enough, though the article needs cleanup; not a great set of statistics, but <a href="http://distrowatch.com/" class="external text" title="http://distrowatch.com/" rel="nofollow">DistroWatch</a> ranks it above Slackware and Debian in lookups over the past year. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 01:32, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Damn Small Linux is perhaps the most well-known Linux distro for business-card CD's and USB thumbdrives. I see it as notable. However the article could certainly do with a clean up and a trim to make it more focused. But I don't think slapping a 'prod' template on the article and now listing it here on AfD is the proper way to motivate people to fix the article. Even if it does result in a cleanup, there are other ways to achieve that result. This is just a waste of time. <a href="../../../i/m/r/User%7EImroy_06a3.html" title="User:Imroy">Imroy</a> 04:37, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>Please note that I have started a discussion topic at Wikipedia talk:Notability (people) to create a standard for notability of religious leaders. Some should have articles, if, for instance they are an official of their denomination churchwide, or they started some important movement, wrote widely used hymns, or were notable in ways special to religion. They probably should not have an article if they were just a typical priest, rabbi, or mullah serving a local group. We have such standards for Porn actors and sports figures, and it would save a lot of argumentation. I have also started a discussion for standards of notability for individual churches, also seen all the time in AFD. We have a standard for schools, so why not for churches.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:27, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete:</b> Those suggesting this outfit is trivial clearly don't live in East Texas. This is a sizeable (if a bit odd) organization that is one of the major religious and social institutions in East Texas. I don't know the numbers, but they fill busload after busload of congregants every Sunday from as far away as Dallas (130 miles). No, it isn't world-famous; but anyone who lives in Longview or any of the surrounding towns is well aware of it, has likely had dealings with it in some way, and understands that it is quite influential in the region. Its accreditation or lack thereof really doesn't have much to do with it's overall influence. This is a substantial, locally influential, controversial institution - if that doesn't make it worthy of an entry, then I just don't understand the criteria very well I guess.Ritwingr 05:13, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> At first, I had trouble understanding the problem, too, but let me see if I can explain it. All of this controversy is potentially VERY notable ... but we don't have sufficiently solid sources to demonstrate that controversy yet. (The Spurgeon book doesn't yet count because none of us seem to be able to address whether it talks about TBC or only about the church.) If you look at the Hyles-Anderson College article mentioned above, you see that newspapers have written about problems there (just one example). If you live in East Texas, you may be able to find verifiable sources that those of us using online searches can't find; for example, have the Longview News-Journal or the Tyler Morning Telegraph published stories? I also wonder whether any specifically Baptist papers or papers of other Baptist colleges have written about it; I know that when the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Churches_of_Christ_4f57.html" title="International Churches of Christ">International Churches of Christ</a> were getting started, a paper called <i>The Christian Chronicle</i> was writing about the movement long before major newspapers and TV stations or networks started covering the topic. Consider whether you or someone you know has access to such sources, and if so, post here any information you find. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 09:15, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A student number would be important here.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Regarding your claims:</li>
</ul>
<p>1) Yes, the church is listed among 1,300 other US churches. It claims attendance is 3,000 meaning it is as big as a high school on Sundays. 2) That book is published by a pastor at the church. It does NOT prove notability because any pastor can write about his church, self publish it, and list it at amazon.com 3) Yes, there are blogs that mention it. I don't see any that meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which can establish notability?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I could be wrong, but how do these prove notability for inclusion? <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 02:40, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree it's one of many megachurches; I don't know what the threshhold is, but I thought I'd mention it. The book is actually by a pastor at a different church; he was a former LBT member and his book is an expose. I know that blogs aren't reliable sources, but the amount of discussion about it suggests to me that it may be notable. Naturally, all facts in the article should be verifiable, and blogs don't count for that. As I said, I'm not sure which way to go on this, but I thought I'd post what I turned up i my research. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 06:29, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think that overstates the case. There are very few churches that have entire critical books written about them.

<li><b>merge</b>I beleive that, no, this church is not notable in and of itself but it is notable as the founding control of Texas Baptist College, though that page is up for discussion as well if you will read what I said on that discussion, The college is needed on wikipedia if only to provide an unbiased opinion of the school, providing both the controversial and the positives. --<a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 03:02, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Please note that I have started a discussion topic at Wikipedia talk:Notability to create a standard for notability of individual churches. We have a standard for schools, so why not for churches. We reinvent the wheel arguing over each individual church as to what the global criteria should be. Size definitely should not be the only criterion, any more than it is for schools. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:30, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Two of grounds for deletion are incorrect. It's certainly verifiable, given that you can check the titles against the publisher's catalog, which is certainly reliable enough. Not to mention the Library of Congress, Amazon, and whatever else is available to the book ordering trade. So we have only WP:ISNOT, particularly 1.7.3 to argue about. And that's where I can say as a list, this has some potential use, if any of the titles warrant further elucidation, even a whole article. I'd suggest making this part of the main article, but then we'd have problems with that growing unmmanageable. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:38, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as I advocated before. This is a mirror of a list which is available online from an authoritative source. The list at the publishers is complete, accurate and up to date - our list is not guaranteed to be so as new books are published all the time. Previous and present keep arguments often rested on the fact that ...for Dummies books are notable; that is not questioned, but <b>we already have an article on ...for Dummies books</b>, this is just a list of them at an unspecified date. There are precisely zero bluelinks to individual books, making this list considerably <i>less</i> useful than the one on the publisher's website, which has a short synopsis for each book. This list violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as both a directory and an indiscriminate collection of information (why this particular publisher's catalogue?). This is simply a copy and paste of the listing on the publisher's website on an unstated date; "<b>do not add copies of primary sources</b>". <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 08:25, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per the previous AfD. This is one of the true publishing success stories of the last 20 years. We obviously need the list if we want to be a serious reference work, that goes beyond video games characters, obscure porn stars or irrelevant diploma mills. Nominator cites wp:not without referring to a specific clause- not really surprising since none apply. Concern over lack of sources may be valid, although nothing prevents the nom from adding sources. In fact, few of our hundreds of book lists have sources, essentially because the publication of the book proves its existence.

<dd>You are comparing a list of political memoirs and fictional books? Those lists contain notable authors and political figures created by wikipedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Those lists are incomplete, lack clear inclusion standards and have no references. This list has the potential to be complete and has clear inclusion standards. Otherwise, you are certainly entitled to fail to see the significance of the Dummies series, but the significance is clearly implied, not the least because we have an article on the series. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:24, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point was that this list, unlike those, has fewer problems with the completeness of the list. If it's missing a title or two, that is easily correctable, and more likely because a new title was just released than any actual problem.

<li><b><strike>Weak</strike> keep</b> - The linked-to NY Times article (only just) establishes notability as per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. The fact that it was only a single article (i.e. not multiple sources) is mitigated by the fact that it's the NYT, which is pretty high profile as far as media coverage goes. Also, the chief "rival" in that article, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angie%27s_List_35f0.html" title="Angie's List">Angie's List</a>, has a page on WP as well. Neither company's article is overly self-aggrandising either, which counts in their favour. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 10:10, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's a startup content aggregator that managed to finagle NYT coverage and reference on CNET. That does not mean we should suspend <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>; as far as the importance of sources go, whilst I am in general agreement, I feel that a mention in the NYT does not automatically confer notability - indeed, it should refelct notability, which in this case is lacking. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 16:33, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. <b>Keep</b> Other reviewers have found additional articles since I first entered a comment. So, according to the letter of item #1 of WP:CORP (multiple non-trivial mentions in the press), we should be keeping it. The article itself seems quite boring, however. When I look at the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angie%27s_list.html" title="Angie's list">Angie's list</a> article I see more about the actual impact that the web site has had, and the reactions of the users. The <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insider_Pages_fba1.html" title="Insider Pages">Insider Pages</a> article says, 'This is a company active in local search, and it has X thousand listings'.

<li><b>Keep</b> This seems almost exactly the opposite of OR to me. The article gives a timeline of various scholarly studies with what seems to me to be a neutral voice, and gives multiple references at the bottom.

<li>Doing exactly the same as the nominator <i>at the same time as criticising the nominator</i>, is bad form. Now to the sources, which is what we should be looking for and looking at.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Adobe Photoshop makes pictures: something the average layman can understand and take an interest in. This has something to do with software development, and as such the description of their flagship product's intended uses is vague and sketchy: <i>a full solution for the application design process and included features to manage marketing requirements, diagram sitemaps and logic, design interfaces, generate prototypes, and generate specifications.</i> This will always be a rather obscure offering, and the article doesn't make a good case for notability othewise. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:11, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I concur, it is not a clone and is an interesting interpretation and implementation of a minimalist programming language. This could be applicable to embedded systems or programmable integrated circuits (PIC) which have extremely limited (relative) memory storage capacity --Neo 08:56, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Esoteric to the point of uselessness, and ultimately non-notable. It's not useful for PIC programming, as there is no hardware that implements it.

<li><b>Delete,</b> but with significant reservations. The article should be deleted because there are no references whatsoever. But I'm rather curious what you think this article is that Wikipedia is "not." There's nothing prohibiting articles on family histories, provided their subject is notable, verifiable, and the articles have citations. I'm also concerned that Hello32020 seems to simply be machine-gun-voting "<b>Delete per nom</b>" down the page, in at least one instance voting twice in the same AfD. That Hello32020 voted to delete per the nominator here, when the nominator basically didn't say anything, is somewhat alarming. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 06:40, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Probably, it would be impossible to cover a U.S. Congress race, like this one, without biographical articles on the participants. I think the question here is, should a House seat race be covered, merely because it's a House seat race?

<p>Im not sure your claim that is pseudo-science has any support. It is an alternative form of therapy that it is being practiced, tought and researched. So why dont we delete it in the german wikipedia? <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraltherapie" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraltherapie" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> Knowing chemistry means little in understanding medicine or biology.

<dd>As I described, there's a distinct lack of published research on the subject, and a lack of sources indicating that it is a common alternative treatment despite this. One paper from 1956 does not make an article, regardless of what the German Wikipedia does or doesn't do. I was referring to the pluralization of "ganglion" as "ganglions", which suggested a lack of familiarity with the subject matter, but as this is a reasonable error for a non-native English speaker I have stricken it. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 06:10, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>Language is a fre e moving social construction of meaning.

Theres a recent publication where patients prefer neural therapy over accupunture in accute pain. Since pain is a subjective experience the finding is of value to the medical community (patients and caretakers).

<dd>I'm not for a moment suggesting that this therapy is a good idea, but the evidence does seem to be that's it's fairly widely used, and therefore notable. That's why I argue 'keep'.

<li><b>Comment</b> Niether of the following are good reasons to delete: 1. the article isn't NPOV or well-written; 2. the therapy it describes is pseudoscientific rubbish. 1 is a reason to improve the article. 2 is irrelevant: plenty of articles in WP are <i>about</i> rubbish without <i>promoting</i> rubbish. What's at stake is whether the subject of the article is notable - the evidence seems to be that it is - and whether an adequate article could be written about it - which doesn't seem impossible, given the improvement (e.g. in referencing) so far.

<li><b>Oppose</b>, relatively small but nevertheless influential betting exchange in the UK which is in opposition to <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betdaq.html" title="Betdaq">Betdaq</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betfair.html" title="Betfair">Betfair</a>. This exchange is steadily acquiring liquidity and it is entirely possible that once reasonable liquidity levels are achieved that the 1% commisssion basis may result in it becoming <b>the</b> major UK exchange. Whilst small, it is still a sizeable presence in some key UK betting markets, and the occasional very serious trade is exercised intra players on there. The article does however need some work and should demonstrate notability to a greater extent than it does. I will give this some attention if the article survives what appears to be an unnecessary and spurious attempt to delete. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">Sjc</a> 08:47, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The reason that the nominator gives is that the article doesn't demonstrate how the subject satisfies our <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria for companies, products, and services. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:40, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it doesn't. Would it have killed the nominator to state what you just said? The nominator made several apparently random nominations at the same time, with no stated reason for any of them. This article obviously states its reasons for notability, but apparently the article was not even read. The company may well not meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but that was not the nomination so lets not pretend it is. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 21:21, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> If BackAndLay's entry is deleted then, by the same criteria, all other betting exchanges should be deleted too. The existing sections on betting exchanges - products faciliated by the internet - seems proportionate and balanced. Betfair rightly gets the most coverage, but the minor competitors like this one have their brief place too. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.141.85.183 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.141.85.183_5211.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.141.85.183">contribs</a>) 2006-10-07 00:18:11 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Oppose</b>, Its main claim to fame is that its owner has a certain notoriety within the UK betting industry and certainly online among online punters. He is a frequent correspondent with the Racing Post on betting industry-related matters and he has attained a profile out of proportion to the traffic his betting exchange appears to drive. I maintain the entry is worth preserving as stub, as the website might acquire more significance over time. Right now, its main claim to fame is that it is possibly the only totally unfunded betting exchange start-up on the web.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes, it was an incredibly poor article, but I have cleaned it up, and now it is a perfectly good stub. The official site works fine for me, and Quebec City's own website indicates that the party is the second largest party on the City Council, with 6 of the 37 seats (<a href="http://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/fr/organisation/conseil_municipal/liste_membres.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/fr/organisation/conseil_municipal/liste_membres.shtml" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>). It is notable and verifiable.
<p>A Google search turns up plenty of hits. I note that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does not preclude the use of non-English sources; it simply prefers the use of English-language versions <i>where available</i> for the convenience of English-speaking readers (and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> states that "foreign-language sources are acceptable in terms of verifiability"). I strongly disagree with the notion that the lack of English-language sources (not surprising for a local political party in an overwhelmingly non-English speaking city) somehow renders the subject non-notable and non-verifiable, but that it would be okay for there to be an article on the French-language wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 12:42, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Aside from the information that they hold 6 of the 37 council seats, and a pointer to their seldom-updated web site, I'm not sure that this tells us anything about the Action Civique de Québec. I'd support deletion of the article now, and recreation if anyone has time to do a proper article. The other parties on the City Council don't have articles yet, and I sure wouldn't recommend they get ones like this. As an office-holding political party I agree that the A.C.Q. are notable. It's just that the stub is so small it makes you feel you wasted your time looking it up and reading it. As a temporary measure, could a section be added to the Quebec City Council page that just has the URLs of the party web sites? <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 21:09, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b> without prejudice against recreation/userfication. Looking past the <b>bold-lettered quasi-votes</b>, there is actually a unanimous consensus here that this article is presently close to unreadable: I concur in that judgment. Subject may be notable, but this article is not encyclopedic in the extreme.

<p>As his claim is so radically opposed to the sciences of archaeology, dating, etc., it is incumbent upon Heribert to prove that his claims are more than disatisfaction with current dating methods and supposed radical innacuracies of medieval scribes. This is Heribert's only claim to fame, his only reason for inclusion in the Wikipedia. As such, is it enough to actually justify any page on him?

If this were the German Wikipedia, then it might be notable enough to keep. But 1) the theory is just plain stupid and 2) is not notable in English -- it thus should not be on the English Wikipedia.

<dd>Well, the editorial board of EWE (as it is now called) doesn't include Illig: Loh, for example, is a Professor of Sociology at Paderborn, Keil-Slawik of Computing &amp; Society. The journal has been published for 14+ years. One issue had some material on Illig, largely rebuttals of his work. And yes, the link is to a table of contents. The printed journals are issued by the academic publishers <a href="http://www.luciusverlag.com/zeitschriften/erwaegen/zeitschrift_erwaegen_wissen_ethik.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.luciusverlag.com/zeitschriften/erwaegen/zeitschrift_erwaegen_wissen_ethik.htm" rel="nofollow">Lucius &amp; Lucius</a>. Everything seems quite above board. Illig has been published in a reliable source, but his ravings were rejected and probably, going by the table of contents, on the grounds that the WP article gives: the need for massive and highly improbable cross-cultural collusion (Gunnar Heinsohn: Armenier und Juden als Testfall für die Streichung von drei Jahrhunderten durch Heribert Illig) and on astronomical grounds (Wolfhard Schlosser: Astronomie und Chronologie). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 00:39, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Along with the daughter articles, this duplicates information already at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_towns_and_cities_with_100%2C000_or_more_inhabitants.html" title="List of towns and cities with 100,000 or more inhabitants">List of towns and cities with 100,000 or more inhabitants</a>. Something needs to go, here, and I think it should be the set that is strangely organized and strangely named. Further nominations on the daughter articles to follow. --<a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 09:37, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The further nominations are for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants: Africa</li>
<li>List of cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants: Asia</li>
<li>List of cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants: Europe</li>
<li>List of cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants: North America</li>
<li>List of cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants: Oceania</li>
<li>List of cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants: South America</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that because the lists include capitals even when the capitals have less than 100,000 people, the Oceania list is not so much of a list of cities as a list of capitals. Having the articles separate also has led to them being in different states of disrepair (the Europe article lists the populations of some consitutent cities, but others don't). <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 09:45, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Obviously another weakness of Wikipedia. A more serious argument against the list (or cat): in the Czech Republic cities with &gt; 100k people get larger percentage of money from state budget than the smaller cities. As a result those just a little bellow the threshold cheat in many ways at the time of making the decision. The "official" numbers easily jump up by hundredths to thousands overnight. There are five cities (<a href="../../../o/l/o/Olomouc.html" title="Olomouc">Olomouc</a>, <a href="../../../h/r/a/Hradec_Kralove_8074.html" title="Hradec Kralove">Hradec Kralove</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pardubice.html" title="Pardubice">Pardubice</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/t/Usti_nad_Labem_b990.html" title="Usti nad Labem">Usti nad Labem</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberec.html" title="Liberec">Liberec</a>) that oscilate around 100k every year. At least the lists should acknowledge inherent fuzziness of their classification. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 23:33, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That weakness of WP is self-imposed: verifiability from a reliable source is sufficient for inclusion; not truth. So these lists are no more nor less accurate than any article that purports to give a population figure (which changes daily in any large area anyhow). To contrast the Czech example: in the US, and may other places probably, there are serious under-counts by census because some people don't respond, some people shouldn't be in the country at all, some people are wanted for crimes, some people have no fixed abode (homeless), and (not surprisingly) some people don't trust the government with their information. But, nearly every entry on a populated US geographic entity here uses the census population figures. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 16:30, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - get rid of the capital cities anomaly by all means but I see no reason to dismiss this as list-cruft. Why do you say these pages are "strangely organised"? There are too many cities to include in one world-wide page so the continent pages are necessary. Most wotld lists split off by continent when they get too long - why not here? If you really want to delete something on the grounds of duplication it should be the other list (the "towns and cities" one, I mean). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJameswilson_10c0.html" title="User:Jameswilson">Jameswilson</a> 23:52, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and clean out the entries (capital cities) that don't belong. The list meets the list criteria: it's verifiable and clear what should go in and should not (needs that clean up though). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:49, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Once again, this list <i>already exists</i> at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_towns_and_cities_with_100%2C000_or_more_inhabitants.html" title="List of towns and cities with 100,000 or more inhabitants">List of towns and cities with 100,000 or more inhabitants</a>. Whether it is too long or not is debatable, but the page with all cities over 100,000 together is at 59KB. This is definitely a workable page length in the case of a list. It makes more sense to me to have one page instead of seven, and I'm irked by the page that is nothing more than a list of lists. Separating the lists has already caused the editing of them to diverge, and this makes the lists less reliable. Looking through the pages, I trust the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_towns_and_cities_with_100%2C000_or_more_inhabitants.html" title="List of towns and cities with 100,000 or more inhabitants">List of towns and cities with 100,000 or more inhabitants</a> more than the others. At any rate, the main point was that there is duplication going on and something needs to go. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 01:23, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Does a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> start with, "We think that Corky Coker, of Coker Tire, is a jerk. Actually, we think a lot worse of him, but all we're going to say is 'jerk'"? I also question whether that "famous" incident is at all notable in the context of the Wikipedia. (NB, I have no connection with Mr. Coker, with the forums mentioned, or with hot-rodding of any sort. I stumbled upon this page and nominated it for deletion for the reasons given above.) --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 13:00, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In considering the action, the word "Jerk" seems intentionally restrained. Many "reliable" sources have made much worse claims about individuals. Reliability is established when the allegations match the facts. If you doubt the reliability of the information, you can call up Coker Tire on the phone. Also, you can call up Discovery Channel or SEMA. Regarding notability, I had made a strong case for it in the article's discussion page. In addition to the notablility of the described episode, the fact that Coker Tire is involved in an extremely blatant vanity article attempt on Wikipedia lends notability to the previous incident. Anyway, Qmax deleted my discussion comments, although an administrator was kind enough to restore them to the discussion page, where you can now view them. This is the second time that my comments had been deleted from the discussion page in an attempt to cover-up the information. BTW, Qmax's request to "rename" is being done for <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_optimization.html" title="Search engine optimization">search engine optimization</a> purposes. He wants the page to rank well for the phrase "Corky Coker". This is why he wants it to be titled exactly as such, rather than with the more appropriate title which lists first and last name, as well as nickname. For example, see this entry in Qmax's blog: <a href="http://chattablogs.com/quintus/archives/040292.html" class="external free" title="http://chattablogs.com/quintus/archives/040292.html" rel="nofollow">http://chattablogs.com/quintus/archives/040292.html</a> .--<a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfo-freedom_8ae0.html" title="User:Info-freedom">Info-freedom</a> 15:29, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll let the community decide about the reliability of that source and the notability of Mr. Coker, but while I agree that your comments should not have been deleted from the talk page, I don't think this article can stand on its own merits apart from any alleged "cover-up." --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 15:35, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfo-freedom_8ae0.html" title="User:Info-freedom">User:Info-freedom</a> suggested I explicitly cite <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html#What_is_encyclopedic.3F" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN#What_is_encyclopedic?</a> in regard to the "famous" discussion board incident. As far as I can tell, Coker was allegedly involved in spamming to a discussion board and following it up with some sock puppetry. Those are not crimes and are not worthy of mention in an encyclopedia as I read the guidelines. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 18:43, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agreed w/Flex, "not encyclopedic" is a reasonable argument for deletion. Although, it's interpretive. Regarding the nature of the incident as not a crime, Coker's sock puppetry incident may constitute the crime of a threat, or the crime of wire fraud. In the <a href="http://www.hotrodders.com/forum/gas-monkey-garage-giving-away-hot-rod-need-your-help-96191-12.html#post682919" class="external text" title="http://www.hotrodders.com/forum/gas-monkey-garage-giving-away-hot-rod-need-your-help-96191-12.html#post682919" rel="nofollow">referenced post</a> note how Coker puts the administrator's first and last name, and his town and state of residence, as the title of his post. In addition, he falsifies his location. Rather than entering his home state, he enters CO, the administrator's home state. In his post, he says: "watch what you say and who you say it to. You never know when it may really come back to bite you." This veiled threat, coupled with falsifying his location such that it is the same as the forum administrator's, may constitute a crime. In addition, I contend that the resultant wave in the industry from this episode is notable, rather than the encapsulated episode itself.--<a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfo-freedom_8ae0.html" title="User:Info-freedom">Info-freedom</a> 19:57, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The discussion about the Coker's sock puppetry should probably go back to Talk:Joseph "Corky" Coker, but I will say here that unless he was convicted or officially charged with a crime, you may not raise that allegation here. That is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and perhaps <a href="../../../l/i/b/WP%7ELIBEL_4020.html" title="WP:LIBEL">libel</a>. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 20:21, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Uncertain, leaning towards keep</b>. It's a bit tough to determine where to draw the line for an Iranian stage/film actress. However, according to the IMDB, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116851/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116851/" rel="nofollow">Leila</a>, one of her movies, was distributed internationally and apparently got a certain amount of critical attention, including a New York Times review. However, she's the 7th cast member listed, so it's hard to say how big the part was. The IMDB cast list doesn't even give a name to her character ("second wife"), but on the other hand it doesn't give a name to any of the characters except the two main protagonists. This one is too close to call, so no vote from me, but it definitely isn't a clear-cut case for deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I had typed in "delete" after looking at IMDB, but then did a Google search. She seems to be famous among Iranians, although nearly all the Web sites seem to be in Persian. She starred in "Butterfly in the Wind" and won the "Best Actress" award for that role at the 2004 Amiens International Film Festival<a href="http://www.movie-times.net/2004.AMIENS.FESTIVAL.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.movie-times.net/2004.AMIENS.FESTIVAL.HTM" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, and she was interviewed by the <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:vIVNHYhr-agJ:www.iranian.com/Times/2000/Marchd/Kouhdasht/944front.html+%22Shaghayegh+Farahani%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=23&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:vIVNHYhr-agJ:www.iranian.com/Times/2000/Marchd/Kouhdasht/944front.html+%22Shaghayegh+Farahani%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=23&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">Iranian Times Web site</a> (in Persian and in a PDF file which I can't figure out how to translate). There are 129 or so English Google hits and about 3,500 in total. You could certainly make the case that she's only worth an article in a Farsi Wikipedia and not in English I suppose, but apparently those three movies on IMDB have been translated into English, so some people might be interested in her.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> just poking around google I was able to find quite a few sites in Arabic with this person's name. I am not going to pretend that I can read Arabic and google was pretty much unable to translate the sites for me.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> as per comments by Starblind above.</s> Change to <b>Strong Keep</b> as per comments below by Splash. Even if Vahid Tarokh <b>is</b> the one requesting the article be deleted(which I doubt), I'm not sure it would be a consideration.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The man seems more than notable enough for wikipedia: through his inventions, through the awards, through the honorary degrees (I don't think someone would get an honorary degree from Harvard for nothing) and through being "one of the Top 10 Most Cited Researchers in Computer Science according to the ISI web of science." Also, I would need to see proof that 72.70.95.56 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.70.95.56.html" title="User talk:72.70.95.56">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.70.95.56_cef5.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.70.95.56">contribs</a>) is indeed Vahid Tarokh himself, before considering the request. Furthermore, I'm not in favour of deleting articles because the subject requests it: either people are notable enough for wikipedia and they get an article, or they're not notable enough and they don't get an article. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aecis_0e71.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a> <sup>I'm too <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis">busy</a> acting like I'm not <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">naive</a>.</sup> 14:49, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> definitely notable and as the last 2 comments stated, just because the subject wants an article deleted, that doesn't mean it should be. The subject is of course quite welcome to help correct any inaccuracies in the article. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelnuneb_b3c1.html" title="User:Maelnuneb">Maelnuneb</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaelnuneb_aa13.html" title="User talk:Maelnuneb">Talk</a>) 20:39, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, incredibly famous person in the field in which I just completed my PhD - he invented a scheme (<a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-time_code.html" title="Space-time code">space-time coding</a>, see also <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-time_block_code.html" title="Space-time block code">space-time block code</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-time_trellis_code.html" title="Space-time trellis code">space-time trellis code</a>) that changed the face of wireless communications research at a stroke. He is faculty at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>. Absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the person who blanked the article and its talk page is Tarokh himself. The article is rather poor because it was written by a student/employee of Tarokh's who had some reflected vanity issues; I got beaten to writing it myself but believe me that he is one of <i>the</i> most notable individuals in the whole of the field. His two most famous papers, references [6] and [7] in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-time_block_code.html" title="Space-time block code">space-time block code</a> are amongst the most widely cited journal articles in wireless.

<p>The result was <b>speedy delete</b> as either vandalism or an advert for a company that would require practically a complete overhaul in order to make an article. Given that the creator of the article, berf (<a href="../../../b/e/r/User_talk%7EBerf_fdc6.html" title="User talk:Berf">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_berf_f81d.html" title="Special:Contributions/berf">contribs</a>), has given us such silliness as Berf and Everett Lobster, both of which were silly vandalism, it is highly probable that a one-sentence article on a company with no supporting citations and only a borough name to go on for context is simply more of the same. I strongly suspect, given prior deleted edits (which I won't provide specifics of because they are personally identifying), that the author has just invented this company, and even if it were real this would be self-promotion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:39, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I will take on this project and straighten out the form issues on the page, it will just take some time. I'm still trying to figure out how to use the system. Arguement: Whether this gal is now 50 years old or not has nothing to do with the viability of her contributions to the adult industry for 25 years. Her porn contributions are mostly in the fetish arena, YES. This isnt as main stream as some others, but still notable in that market nitch. She's very well known in the BDSM community. It isnt just realing out porn videos as much as a LIFE spent entertaining men in most all arenas of adult entertainment. Have you ever popped into a Gentlemen's Club and met her over her 25 years? She's retiring at the end of 2006. This article is not self promotion of Ms Wilde however she provided information to the writer. I personally feel this just marks her place in history. How many of you have a Paradise Galleries doll made of you? This didn't happen "just because" RBFAST</p>
<p>Article as it stands right now does make a valid argument for her to be considered notable as per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and the <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> proposed guidelines.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is an election within 45 days in Victoria. If this article is kept, then from a NPOV I would think that all candidates should be allowed an article. The problem is that a Wiki entry will come up in a Google search, and may give the impression that one candidate is "more notable" than others. The question we should be asking, is strip the article of any mention of her standing for Parliament, and is she notable enough? And BTW I would have voted for the Gymer deletion, too. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 00:16, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no issue with giving all candidates pages, but I'm clearly in the minority on that one. What I do take serious objection to, is deleting a page on someone who is almost definitely going to win, as deleting a page when one knows that one will definitely have to recreate it in three weeks is madness. And her imminent entry into parliament is the reason why she is notable, so excluding that from the rationale would be rather illogical. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 01:49, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Given that long-term members are normally supposed to have a personal vote of 1 to 2%, I'd be working hard for her right now, because if everything else stays the same, she is gone. So no, it is not a sure thing. As has been said before, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. As for all candidates having articles, well perhaps you are right, but that is not the status quo on Wikipedia right now.

<li><b>Keep</b>.It is a straight copy but so are all the other lists (ie: gdp/flags ext). However I have changed the stats from # per 1000 to # per 100,000. I feel it is more conceptually realistic when dealing with murder rates.
<p>I think it is quite relevant as the murder rate of both the world and individual countries is likely to be of interest to people (I know it was to me since I was looking for it before starting this article) and yes it does have links from it.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The problem is that the "article" starts by saying "This is a list..." and then provides a list. So, if it is a list, then rename the title to indicate that it is a list. A good article about murder rate might talk about comparisons of murder rates in different countries and what causes the differences (longer jail sentences, death penalty, strong law enforcement, education, poverty, etc.). Also a discussion of how murder rate data is collected and whether there are methodological issues in collection techniques that make it difficult to compare murder rate data across countries. Etc., etc., etc.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Expand</b> because yes, the article needs more up to date stats on it. In the eight to six years since this report was researched and subsequently published, some rates have fallen and risen, sometimes significantly (Colombia wouldn't top the list if the same survey were made in 2005/2006, though it'd still be high). The list itself can stay, if necessary, but later and current trends should be reflected somehow. The list remains a good resource for showing what murder rates were like half a decade ago, but it's not that accurate today. <a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuancarlos2004_ab3b.html" title="User:Juancarlos2004">Juancarlos2004</a> 20:31, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulp_Fiction_f567.html" title="Pulp Fiction">Pulp Fiction</a> invites so much trivia (I've indulged in an edit or two myself) that it almost seems like this article should exist as an intentional stopping point on the way for these tidbits headed towards removal. Metaphorically send all the trivia to this article, slam the door shut, ignore any screams you hear. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 16:24, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Note that <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">WP:TRIVIA</a> does <i>not</i> prohibit trivia sections in articles.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Trivia sections are bad enough in the main articles, never mind giving them separate ones. Integrate and rewrite the most encyclpaedic points into the article, in context, and shoot the rest down in a big lexical blood bath. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 19:33, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: this "list" was obviously ripped off from the main article with hope to keep the main text clean. Merge it and damage the main text, delete it and the cruft will start to grow in the main article immediatelly.

<li><b>Delete</b> and consistently remove the trivia from this section. I don't see how "people are going to add it" is a reason to let it stay on site so much as a reason to patrol the main article and ensure it stays clean. GassyGuy 08:51, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> A lot of this material is available at IMDB's trivia page and doesn't fit in an encyclopedia. Interesting read though.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is not OR. It is sourced and presents a philosopher's argument that has attracted enough attention to warrant a book rebutting the argument (<i>Naturalism Defeated?</i>).

<li><s>Delete</s>. In the Critique of atheism the consensus was that it didn't belong in it's entirety there, but the dispute of it's actual existance was nowhere near settled. It has been said in the Critique of Atheism discussion that according to Plantinga's website this paper is unpublished, and therefore has not received a peer review. That coupled with the article presenting his views as undisputed fact, and the fact that these views can raise quite a few eyebrows and looks like a wedge issue for advocates of Intelligent Design (which is actually compatible with Plantinga's background), makes this article seem less informative, more like it's fullfilling an agenda. The use of secondary sources to refer to such a polemical subject is frowned to within guidelines, and given the fact that the paper is unpublished this maybe beyond repair. NPOV and RS issues aside. I would say epistemologists would agree that the importance is not in the arguments themselves, but in the debate, and that is not presented at all here. It should be recognized that he argues evolution is only possible if it is guided by a supernatural being, and therefore this is purely a philosophical argument for intelligent design, as far as I can see, if this belongs anywhere, it's in the ID article and presented as such. And as for Lamont's concerns above, maybe the deletion of this article is the precedent needed so other articles dont need to deal with this at all. Whether that is established or not, future edits should converge those articles' mentions of this argument linking to this one.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">Starghost</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStarghost_d510.html" title="User talk:Starghost">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Starghost_a508.html" title="Special:Contributions/Starghost">contribs</a>) 19:35, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I removed my previous vote, and am currently indifferent. I guess this argument is bound to resurface, or at least I believe it will be mentioned in Wikipedia in one form or another (it would be too long before editors would cede ground and give up on this argument on the other pages anyway). As some concerns are being adressed, such as the criticisms to the argument, I believe in time it may earn the right to a dignified existance. It is related published books and all, and we got plenty of other published crap anyway, so what the hell. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">Starghost</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStarghost_d510.html" title="User talk:Starghost">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Starghost_a508.html" title="Special:Contributions/Starghost">contribs</a>) 21:24, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Regarding the alleged PoV fork, I should think the fact that the article is a result of a rough consensus by opposing views on the merits of the argument would indicate that it is not. In discussion at <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECritique_of_atheism_7a18.html" title="Talk:Critique of atheism">Critique of atheism</a> a number of points were made, including the fact that it needs to be expanded, as it is a quite technical and intricate argument. As such, it would overwhelm the <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Plantinga_8fc3.html" title="Alvin Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a> page. Moreover, since when do significant ideas go on their discoverer/postulator's articles? <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">Meme</a> isn't under <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, nor <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deconstruction.html" title="Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> under <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Derrida_cbcf.html" title="Jacques Derrida">Jacques Derrida</a>. As for the relevance of the EAAN to metaphysical naturalism, it has the same problem we ran into in Critique of Atheism- it isn't a disproof of naturalism <i>per se</i>, but rather naturalism in conjunction with evolution.</li>
<li>Lastly, I think it is somewhat incumbent on the community to consider, if not defer to, the deliberations of the editors that led to the creation of the article, which may be found <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECritique_of_atheism_7a18.html#Vote_on_linking_to_Plantinga" title="Talk:Critique of atheism">here</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielthursday_048f.html" title="User:Gabrielthursday">Gabrielthursday</a> 05:20, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that having an extended discussion of it at <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysical_naturalism.html" title="Metaphysical naturalism">Metaphysical naturalism</a> is a mistake because the argument is not about naturalism <i>per se</i>, and it is distracting there. Plantinga's argument is not about naturalism or evolution, it is about the two combined. He says that Naturalism in conjunction with belief in evolution renders the premises that underly the two beliefs unreliable. Putting the argument in <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Plantinga_8fc3.html" title="Alvin Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a> is not appropriate - for some reason, other philosophers take his argument seriously. As I pointed out earlier, there is a published book criticising his argument (and with his responses). If professional philosophers take the argument seriously and debate it on its merits, there is no reason to conflate the argument with its proponent (I also second Gabrielthursday's comments on this issue). <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamontacranston_0a5f.html" title="User:Lamontacranston">Lamont A Cranston</a> 12:28, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>So, is the article still pending expansion? I can understand content-forking if there is too much to be said that cannot be covered in other articles. But as it stands, the content is largely redundent with existing pages, and is NOT expanded.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 13:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think there is enough here to justify the article. The fact that two other articles want to discuss the <i>argument</i> (rather than the philosopher) justifies the article. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamontacranston_0a5f.html" title="User:Lamontacranston">Lamont A Cranston</a> 13:38, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hi, Andrew, I second Lamont's and Gabriel's comments. In addition, the article (that was created yesterday) is already larger than many stub-pages in Wikipedia (*update: as in <i>21:46, 7 October 2006</i>, the text is now considerably larger than it was when Andrew made his last comment). There is continuing philosophical debate around the argument, but the critique section in the page is still based on comments from <i>only one</i> of the already existing critical reviews... There is certainly room for further expansion, not only of the criticism section, but also of the main argument. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ¬ <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/18px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">»saudações!</a> 14:28, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have previously misunderstood what a POV fork really is. As to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, as I said above, that charge is misguided. That policy forbids Wikipedians from inserting their own original research, not from inserting the original research of others. As to notability, the proponents of this article have shown that Plantinga's argument has elicited wide discussion in the philosophical community. Finally, this article should not be deleted even if Plantinga's argument is "logically faulty" (as one editor says above). Using that criterion we would have to delete <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontological_argument.html" title="Ontological argument">Ontological argument</a>. We keep or delete philosophical arguments based on notability of the argument and verifiability that the argument has been made, not actual merit of the argument. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:38, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Leaving Little and White Russias makes some sense and could be convenient, but technically they do not belong on this disambiguation page, because "Russia" is only a part of their names.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#160;•&#160;(<a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 20:29, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The editor MiamiTom has been all over the place. He has been blanking talk pages, editing and/or removing other editors remarks on talk pages and creating multiple duplicates of existing articles with huge images of his own. He has made as many as 5 reverts to keep his own idea. At present, if he has not once more reverted, the <a href="../../../v/i/z/Vizcaya.html" title="Vizcaya">Vizcaya</a> page is a DAB showing the existing articles which existed long before any of his edits. The museum article has always existed at <a href="../../../v/i/z/Vizcaya_Museum_and_Gardens_ddb2.html" title="Vizcaya Museum and Gardens">Vizcaya Museum and Gardens</a>. He has tried to recreate the article under the above title as well as several other places. He does not sign his posts and when I have tried to post links and help on his talk page he blanks either the entire page or my remarks. I am at a loss how to help him. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 20:18, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

I find that <a href="../../../v/i/z/Vizcaya_%28Miami%29_e0bb.html" title="Vizcaya (Miami)">Vizcaya (Miami)</a> was a name suggested by an editor of the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Biscay.html" title="Biscay">Biscay</a> article. On his <a href="../../../m/i/a/User_talk%7EMiamitom_5c84.html" title="User talk:Miamitom">talk page</a> he gives the distinct impression that in his view only Miami search results matter and only Miamians use Wikipedia. (He has even opened a <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_Requests_September_2006_MiamiTom_5354.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance/Requests/September 2006/MiamiTom">request for assistance</a>.) I think Wikipedia editors were initially patient with him but he is exhausting that patience (even as his patience with Wikipedia editing procedures is exhausted -- if there's any excuse for page-blanking, in this case he seems to be under the impression that Talk pages are some kind of e-mail editor). In the end the question at hand is whether <a href="../../../v/i/z/Vizcaya_%28Miami%29_e0bb.html" title="Vizcaya (Miami)">Vizcaya (Miami)</a> needs to exist at all and clearly it does not, since there must not be duplicate articles on the same topic.

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me that no one will look for <a href="../../../v/i/z/Vizcaya_%28Miami%29_e0bb.html" title="Vizcaya (Miami)">Vizcaya (Miami)</a> but if consensus is to have a redirect, it should either go to the DAB page at <a href="../../../v/i/z/Vizcaya.html" title="Vizcaya">Vizcaya</a> which includes all options or to have it become another DAB page with links to both articles <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa_Vizcaya_77fe.html" title="Villa Vizcaya">Villa Vizcaya</a> the villa and home and the museum which has the exact title as the webpage given above <a href="../../../v/i/z/Vizcaya_Museum_and_Gardens_ddb2.html" title="Vizcaya Museum and Gardens">Vizcaya Museum and Gardens</a> Again, it seems to me that no one will search for the above title which is why I nominated it for deletion. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 21:27, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Personally I question why the Villa and Museum have separate articles at all. If the house had a more extensive treatment that would be one thing. The name Villa Vizcaya refers to the entire estate, and I have been there; they are not separate entities.

<li>I am now conditionally concurring with Ac@osr's merge solution - the condition being that independent source referencing is introduced to the Fourth Dimension article <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 15:56, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><s>Neutral - had there been an article for the parent label Fourth Dimension, I would have recommended a merge as FD has released records by several notable underground artists (<a href="../../../t/h/u/Thurston_Moore_8167.html" title="Thurston Moore">Thurston Moore</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merzbow.html" title="Merzbow">Merzbow</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Wickham-Smith_cb2c.html" title="Simon Wickham-Smith">Simon Wickham-Smith</a> &amp; <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Youngs_8cc6.html" title="Richard Youngs">Richard Youngs</a>, <a href="../../../k/k/_/KK_Null_92e7.html" title="KK Null">KK Null</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gerogerigegege_bb06.html" title="The Gerogerigegege">The Gerogerigegege</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circle_%28band%29.html" title="Circle (band)">Circle</a> etc...) and FD catalogue numbers were given to the Grim Humour giveaways (which featured <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Youth_0a85.html" title="Sonic Youth">Sonic Youth</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Ausgang.html" title="Ausgang">Ausgang</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portion_Control_5147.html" title="Portion Control">Portion Control</a> etc...).

<li>Update - having considered the position, I have started an article for <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Dimension_Records_c0ca.html" title="Fourth Dimension Records">Fourth Dimension Records</a> which I feel establishes notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>: such a type of information would be very useful if maintained by experts. Perhaps stable version will allow to keep such lists. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 23:04, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: providing a scholarly bibliography is encyclopaedic. Such a bibliography must necessarily be selective. Note further that there are articles throughout WP on "important publications in subject X", and this is encouraged. If Night Gyr has issues with the inclusion of particular titles, or the non-inclusion of other titles, this is a very valid matter for discussion, and the talk page provides an appropriate forum. I believe that, with appropriate discussion, metrics could be established to solidify criteria for inclusion or non-inclusion. Deletion should be reserved for articles which are not valuable and for which there is no likely prospect of improvement. On the contrary, this article is useful; it is on-topic for WP; and IMO concerns raised about inclusion criteria can substantially be addressed. It should remain, and be improved. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 02:15, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Statistical mechanics, and its presentation, is important and practical; but it is also nuanced and subtle. Perspectives on these details are important: they can lead to new understandings, and gross misunderstandings; they can be really quite deep issues in the philosophy of physics and the history of science; and they can still lead to quite vehement debate (see some of the recent discussion on <a href="../../../e/n/t/Talk%7EEntropy_cc8c.html" title="Talk:Entropy">Talk:Entropy</a> for example!). It is scientifically interesting (and encyclopaedic) to see what were the dominant presentations in their time, and how different presentations have evolved. Hence this list of references. There might be other texts which could be added, but I would submit that, certainly up to 1970, all of the texts on the list deserve inclusion without a hint of POV -- being seen either as the very bible of the subject in their time, or at the very least as one of <i>the</i> lead texts for teaching it. Many of them still are (on both counts). For the titles afer 1970, IMO Penrose and Landsberg deserve inclusion for being very distinctive in their approaches; Ruelle for really opening up a new direction with the rigour of his approach and results. The others are I believe a representative cross-section of the most cited, most prevalent and most recommended mainstream textbooks in leading teaching universities in this field. This could be validated quantitatively with appropriate further investigation. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 03:33, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment(2)</b>: One thing the article could perhaps use is sentences for titles to say <i>what</i> makes them notable, and worthy of inclusion. This might substantially resolve Night Gyr's issues with it. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 03:44, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That sentence needs to be a reference to another source, or else we are doing original research. All of the keep votes so far have spoken about the books from their personal experience, and no one has cited a source that identifies these as important works. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:10, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - All the books on the list that I am familiar with are on my A list, and, as mentioned above, as long as it does not become a battleground, I say keep it. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPAR_bf60.html" title="User:PAR">PAR</a> 04:42, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> You bring up an interesting question of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> for such a list. That is, who says these authors and books are notable? We just kind of grow up with the idea that these authors and books are notable--because these authors and books appear over and over in the bibliographies of the books we use in our work. Isn't that right? I would be surprised if any of the listed books is not referenced and therefore notable in McQuarrie's 2000 Second Edition. Should the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for the whole list be McQuarrie's 2000 Second Edition? And surely McQuarrie's 2000 Second Edition is notable because it is already in the Second Edition. A book with only one typo so full of mathematical formulas and proofs that sells so well to graduate students eager to find a typo makes it very notable, does it not? The suggestion of a few sentences characterizing each book is a good suggestion. Someone could quote the appropriate sentences from each author's own preface, explaining the author's particular concern and targeted audience. What do you think? --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 18:43, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Is there some way a sentence or two could be added about each work? While I'd like to see the list kept, and I am glad to see that others want to keep it as well, it's clear that lists are under pressure across WP and even this one may not survive future deletion debates... Just a few comments: (1) There are unreasonably many ISBNs for some works (like Kubo's). (2) It may be that someone will have the time to add pointers to book reviews for these books. That could make the list much more useful. Even a one or two-sentence summary of what some reviewer said could be helpful. (3) Integrating the listed books into a history of statistical mechanics, while a great deal of work, would permanently forestall any criticism of its 'listiness'. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 15:54, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

The last line of the article reads <i>"He is a grandson of Roberto Weiss, a great great nephew of Sir Horace Hector Hearne and a great great nephew of Sadie Bonnell"</i>; as well as this being fairly irrelevant, Julien Foster has created two of these pages himself, and this again makes me think it is a vainity page. If he ever becomes an MP then the page of course should be remade, but I think at the moment he's not notable. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerks105_514e.html" title="User:Berks105">Berks105</a> 21:47, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You didn't give a view. You just wrote "Keep", and that was it. You gave no rationale at all. Rationales are important, and bare votes cannot outweigh arguments based upon policies. You've given a rationale now, but it is a fallacious one. You assert that the article is "well sourced". But it isn't actually sourced at all. See what I already wrote at length on the purported sources. It seems unlikely that anyone who has actually read the purported sources would come to the conclusion that this article was "well sourced". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:40, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article cites as references what the article describes as "profiles" of this person. They are not, in fact, any such things. The purported "profile" at <i>The Guardian</i> comprises exactly 1 sentence: "Not currently an MP". The purported "profile" at <i>The Times</i> is in fact the page with the election results for a U.K. parliamentary constituency, and contains exactly the same amount of information about M. Foster as <a href="../../../l/e/y/Leyton_and_Wanstead_2c64.html#Elections" title="Leyton and Wanstead">Leyton and Wanstead#Elections</a> does: 1 line in a table giving polling results. The other three cited references are not even remotely about the subject and contain no biographical information whatsoever. (One is a name check in a debate, one is a quotation, and one is a dumped electronic mail message.)
<p>The article is an autobiography, written by Julien Foster (<a href="../../../j/u/l/User_talk%7EJulien_Foster_97c7.html" title="User talk:Julien Foster">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Julien_Foster_2bcf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Julien Foster">contribs</a>). The references aren't references at all, and it has clearly been constructed from M. Foster's own firsthand knowledge of xyrself. Searching, the only biographies of this person that I can find are <a href="http://www.goldsmithchambers.law.co.uk/barristers.cgi?action=view&amp;cvid=3&amp;keywords=" class="external text" title="http://www.goldsmithchambers.law.co.uk/barristers.cgi?action=view&amp;cvid=3&amp;keywords=" rel="nofollow">other autobiographies</a>, also supplied directly from the subject, that are word-for-word identical to this one.</p>
<p>When it comes to the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>, the subject does not satisfy any of them anyway. The subject is a barrister, and an election candidate who didn't win. The appearances on radio programmes are clearly on the level of phone-in interviews. Notability is not inheritable, especially from one's grandfather or great-great uncle, and the notability by association is the only thing that the autobiographies have going as even <i>claims</i> of notability. Not that we can actually trust that this person is in fact related to whom xe claims to be related.</p>
<p>And that is the crux of the problem. There is <i>nothing</i> from which to verify the content of this article, including the claims of being a distant relative of notable people, except for other word-for-word identical autobiographies that the subject has had published elsewhere, in addition to submitting to Wikipedia. (The other autobiographies don't even mention the distant relatives, moreover.) <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html#The_problem_with_autobiographies" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography#The_problem_with_autobiographies</a> explains the problems with that. The subject is non-notable, and nothing in the article is verifiable <i>except</i> for the information that we already have in <a href="../../../l/e/y/Leyton_and_Wanstead_2c64.html#Elections" title="Leyton and Wanstead">Leyton and Wanstead#Elections</a>.

I know I've personally referenced it (directly or indirectly) in a number of articles for a variety of publicaions, including Next-Gen.biz and GamaSutra, as one of the most elegant recent game designs for any platform. It's a common basis for discussion and comparison on at least two major Internet communites I'm aware of, dealing at least in part with design analysis and indie game development. For its part, it's an incredibly influential little game. --Aderack 10:40, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Look, I am enthusiastic about learning how to produce a viable article. Admittedly I do not fully understand, but in this case I wish to provide an excellent definition/article. Though the site (www.phoons.com) is indeed "minor" it was once a Yahoo! Pick of the Week, has been written up in international newspapers, magazines, etc. and has attracted viewers from all over the world.<br />
<b>Significantly</b> a simple image search on search engines reveals people posting this pose and referring to it as a phoon. There ought to be a location where people can get an explanation as to the origins of the naming of the pose. I don't think many of the people using the term even understand why they are calling it that. As to "multiple languages" eliciting an "ROFL" -- which seems inappropriate -- Volunteers from several countries have put in significant hours of their own time making the site accessible to others. It is not a commercial site, is maintained solely by its creator, and grows by submissions from others, like the Mirror Project, or others.<br />
How does this differ from <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>? This word "stuck." <b>All</b> words are invented. If you can list an article on the uncertain origins of the word <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shit.html" title="Shit">shit</a> which garners increasing worldwide use and understanding, adding Phoon with an absolutely certain and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verfiable.html" title="Verfiable">verfiable</a> origin (and not <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">WP:BOLLOCKS</a> as erroneously asserted above), and widespread use should not be an issue. --David R.

<li><b>Worth your considering?</b> ...Regarding "I am still less than convinced of its notability, as it seems to be documented on one minor website that collects photos of this pose," can't the same be said about "geocaching"? It's fully described on its own website, so "why mention it in a wiki page?" While geocaching is a far greater phenomenon, still, not everyone has heard about it. It is, likewise, a made-up word. Yet, it is wiki-worthy as a current phenomenon.</li>

<li>I'm the author of the <a href="http://www.phoons.com" class="external text" title="http://www.phoons.com" rel="nofollow">phoons.com</a> site; my brother initiated the wiki page that started this discussion; that was his own choice. He noted I might want to chime in with additional thoughts. My guess is that the proposed deletions here have more to do with those individuals disliking and wanting to distance themselves from the idea of phooning. That's completely fair to dislike phooning. However, I'm thinking that disliking some phenomenon is not reason to delete it from the wiki. (I don't get why there are wiki pages dedicated to TV cartoons for elementary school kids, for example, but who am I to say it shouldn't be there?)</li>
<li>Just two days ago, a guy named Zack wrote to me out of the blue and ask why "Phoon" was <i>not</i> in the wiki. Adults are interested in this topic, too.</li>
<li>By the way, to get a sense of how "phooning" has crept around the world, search <b>Flickr</b> for the tag '<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=phoon" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=phoon" rel="nofollow">phoon</a>' or '<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=phooning" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=phooning" rel="nofollow">phooning</a>'.

<li>Search <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=phoon&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search+Images" class="external text" title="http://images.google.com/images?q=phoon&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">Google Images</a> category.</li>
<li>An argument was made that there is a minor website collecting photos of the poses. Yet if you scan the 'net as I suggested, you'll find that it is the <i><b>primary</b></i> collection, while others maintain their own collections (some large, one in Norway, one in Italy, and others small (individual Flickr accounts)).</li>
<li>Lastly, I recommend visiting phoons.com and selecting any picture AND observing the category names at the bottom of the picture page. Follow a category of interest and I think you will understand why other viewers have been drawn in and why the word 'phoon' now sticks in their head...<b>and</b> why Phoon is thus worth considering as viable.</li>

<li>Perhaps it is a neogolism, but whether it is a coined term, one that few if any of the comments/voters above have ever heard, is not inconsequential. In the minds of many (see links in John Darrow's paragraphs above) it is a word <i>describing</i> the specific pose. The purpose, depite A Rubin's objection, is <i>not</i> to give a name to the pose, rather to give a definition and origin of the word/sound which has, internationally, attached itself to that pose. It is not the claim of the author or his brother that the pose was invented by him, rather that the word was, and has a noteworthy origin, and that this resource recognizes it. <b>Argument</b>: <a href="../../../k/l/e/Kleenex.html" title="Kleenex">Kleenex</a> did not invent the facial tissue, but because of advertising and brand recognition has in the minds of most English-speaking people <i>become</i> the word for <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facial_tissue.html" title="Facial tissue">facial tissue</a>. --drdarrow 22:57, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> - Notable well known band /extremely notable/ in their field. The fact they're noted as a supergroup consisting of members from other big bands didn't ring any bells for you that they might be notable? A poor article doesn't mean it should be deleted, just improved. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 00:29, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>In that case, which page do you think this article should be redirected to? It is clearly not independently notable, as that is the only assertion of notability mentioned, and the suggested remedy for those bands is to create an article, not a redirect. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:35, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the article doesn't establish that, that's a problem with the article not a reason for deletion. Also see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>: <i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable;</i> - members of other hardcore bands.

<li>That is exactly the clause I was referring to myself, though you've taken it out of context. It finishes "<i>it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</i>" In any case, the other prods I made were because they lacked sources and assertions of notability, but that's off-topic. I'm unhappy they were deprodded without an effort to fix the problems, but this case is different: it appears to not merit inclusion. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:02, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

It appears to have notable members, but I don't see anything that justifies the band itself having it own article; however, I also don't see why it shouldn't be content in the Schreifels article as a notable aspect of his career, with mentions of the group perfectly appropriate in the articles of other notable personnel connected with the project. <i>unimportant venting</i>: 1) Being rude is neither constructive nor appealing. 2) WP:OSTRICH does not apply when the article's claims are tenuous, and while I do think editors should attempt research before nomming articles for deletion, it is perfectly understandable that something worthy of an article does not always come across as such based on the article's content and resources found at the time of the nom. This appears perfectly good faith to me. GassyGuy 09:05, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's very difficult to establish notability of a short-lived, well known, influential band. Influence generally stuggles to get references, and a simple Google search won't find their popularity due to the game. Their CDs are sold all over the place though, and they're well known. The only way I could possibly establish their relative influence and popularity that is point out their Last.FM<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rival+Schools" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Rival+Schools" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> fans (different people playing one of their songs) are much higher compared to similar bands like <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorilla_Biscuits_0891.html" title="Gorilla Biscuits">Gorilla Biscuits</a><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gorilla+Biscuits" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Gorilla+Biscuits" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/t/Rites_of_Spring_802c.html" title="Rites of Spring">Rites of Spring</a><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rites+of+Spring" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Rites+of+Spring" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, Quicksand<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Quicksand" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Quicksand" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planes_Mistaken_For_Stars_b250.html" title="Planes Mistaken For Stars">Planes Mistaken For Stars</a><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Planes+Mistaken+for+Stars" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Planes+Mistaken+for+Stars" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Million_Dead_28d4.html" title="Million Dead">Million Dead</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Million+Dead" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Million+Dead" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> and several other large bands from the same genre, and Rival Schools only have one album. They're a popular band. This band isn't known as <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Schreifels_de95.html" title="Walter Schreifels">Walter Schreifels</a>'s side project, it's probably his best known band, so it's inaccurate to redirect there. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 10:07, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It can be his best known band and still be covered in his article. I'm not sure why that would be a reason not to merge it. I trust you that they're influential, but I'm trying to work within <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and the sources I've looked at just don't have any content that properly assert that this needs to remain as is. If you think Schreifels is a bad place to house the info, please suggest a better one. GassyGuy 10:26, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because people who look for information on Rival Schools are looking for the band, not a person in the band. There /is/ no appropriate place to merge it too, and that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> rule is intended for small obscure side-projects and early bands that appear before a band gets big but aren't as notable as the major band, which this _isn't_, particularly as the band is more well known than the person. Also, the article now meets WP:MUSIC as they internationally toured, it contains at least two notable members, and I'm also trying to show it has become one of the most prominent examples of the scene through Last.FM. I'm really struggling on show to show it is more well known, aside from the fact that I knew of the band before Googling and they are one of the best known bands in the scene, even if they were shortlived. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 10:37, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I'm trying to say is that, if you merge the band to the Schreifels article, or elsewhere, people get the same information, regardless of where it is housed. I'm not trying to call this a Schreifels side project, but at the same time, I remain unconvinced that it merits a standalone article and am simply trying to find a decent place to house the information contained. As it stands it appears this is heading towards a keep anyway, but, to me, it really doesn't demonstrate it terribly well and it doesn't seem like there's a good way for it to do so.

<p>Encyclopedia articicle or an ad? No independent verifiaction of the importance of this "movement" --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">Peta</a> 23:56, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm uncertain what level of proof you require, or even what your meaning/definition is. So first I ask for a clarification, and more details about your concerns with the article. It is not an ad; this movement represents a large number of styles and concepts within the overall belly dance world, thus the separate article. For example, likely the best-known belly dancer (as opposed to singer-who-dances, like <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakira.html" title="Shakira">Shakira</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natasha_Atlas_ab83.html" title="Natasha Atlas">Natasha Atlas</a>) in America, at this point, is a Tribal style dancer named <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Brice_f367.html" title="Rachel Brice">Rachel Brice</a>. But this is sort of like saying the most important gospel singer of the last 30 years is the Reverend <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cleveland_a3ee.html" title="James Cleveland">James Cleveland</a>; it may be true, and important enough for an entry, but the importance is only noted within that genre, and is mostly indirect outside of it.I'm happy to answer in in-depth questions about ATS and Tribal, as best as I can.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a notable form of bellydance. It sounds like an ad because its wirtten very poorly but it is notable, and has had a huge impact on the world of bellydance since its inception. It is the other major form of the dance proacticed around the world besides the traditional Egyptian.

<li><b>Comment</b> Interesting article, but I don't see any references to verify notability other than websites of people promoting the art. Has there been no reporting in any newspaper or magazine of general circulation?

<dd>Note the book references I reported above.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This article describes Tribal bellydance, a very exciting and innovative movement within the dance community. The article refers to Jamila, one of the originators of this movement. Jamila's daughter Suhaila is a quite famous dancer in many dance spectra, she has appeared on several American television series, including "Fame," "Max Headroom," and an ABC pilot entitled "Harem," in addition to starring in numerous commercials. <a href="http://www.suhaila.com/Pages/Biography.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.suhaila.com/Pages/Biography.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.suhaila.com/Pages/Biography.htm</a> Suhaila's style is one of many emerging styles of bellydance that include several famous dancers who have developed new dance artforms, e.g., Jill Parker of UltraGypsy, Rachel Brice of the Indigo, Carolena of FatChanceBellydance, and many, many more. Any of the million or more bellydancers practicing the art could tell you about Tribal Style Bellydance movement in the US. THis is important information, and should be kept. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.141.116.175 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.141.116.175_94c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.141.116.175">contribs</a>).</small></li>
