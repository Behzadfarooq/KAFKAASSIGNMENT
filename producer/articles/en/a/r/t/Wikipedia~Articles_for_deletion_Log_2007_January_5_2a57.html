<li>Thanks for your comments. I'd still like to fight to hold onto this entry. In its current form, it is a factual description of a venture-backed company in Silicon Valley. The company has 13 patents issued and 12 pending. From the Wikipedia notability requirements for companies: "The company or corporation (is notable if it) has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself." Please see the 'notes' section of this entry. Thanks for your consideration. --<a href="../../../c/b/y/User%7ECbyeh_106a.html" title="User:Cbyeh">Cbyeh</a> 02:19, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Even if the company is notable but the Wikipedia article does not sufficiently bring that out. Its not enough that the company be notable, the Wikipedia article has to establish it. You indicated that the company has 13 patents, but that is not in the article so it cannot be considered in determining whether to delete the article. If you want to improve the article (or at least have the article survive this Article for Deletion), look at other Wikipedia articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Infobox_Company" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Infobox_Company" rel="nofollow">companies</a> and use those as a guide. (see, for example, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>). Basically, Wikipedia articles on corporations usually include a lead section, an Infobox_Company template, a history section, and other sections that may go into particularly notable events listed in the history section. Articles usually contain more than that. Please review <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContributing_to_Wikipedia_bc52.html#Create_new_articles" title="Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia">creating new articles.</a> To give you a time frame, this Article for Deletion (AfD) may close after five days (e.g., after 00:19, 10 January 2007). -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 03:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> - The Wikipedia article does not sufficiently bring out notability. (The article also lacks footnotes.) I reviewed the 'notes' section of this entry and the articles provided in the link do not seem to provide enough history about the company to bring out notability. They more or less relate to marketing events. A bigger problem is that the company itself does not see its history important enough to include on its own web page (see <a href="http://www.tacit.com/company/about_tacit/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tacit.com/company/about_tacit/index.html" rel="nofollow">About Tacit</a>). Since the article should be deleted as it presently exists and the company itself does not see its own history as important enough to include on its web page, the appropriate course of action appears to be <b>Delete.</b> Note to <a href="../../../c/b/y/User%7ECbyeh_106a.html" title="User:Cbyeh">user:Cbyeh</a> - If there are significant changes to the article in the next few days, please post a note on my talk page so that I may review my reasoning and vote in light of the new information.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Since the article still appears as an advertisement masquerading as an article, the article still is <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">spammy</a> as indicated in the nomination. It's no secret that Tacit Software's information gathering software is funded by the <a href="../../../i/n/-/In-Q-Tel_4b35.html" title="In-Q-Tel">CIA</a> and that Tacit Software gives away its information gathering software free to individuals. There are several third party articles that connect these two facts and conclude that the CIA can spy on individuals all over the world who use Tacit Software's freely issued, patented products. Despite my prodding, this information -- which would make the company noteworthy -- has not been added to the article. With a little help, the article could be rewritten from a neutral point of view per Wikipedia policy and thus I added the advert tag and have changed my vote to <b>Keep.</b> -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 19:36, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks again for your comments. Articles about a company that are not written by the company itself cannot be considered to be press releases. You may perceive some articles to be favorable to the company, but that is not because the company wrote them. Especially in the case of major news organizations, articles about companies are written from the unbiased, individual perspective of each reporter as formed by interviews with the company, its customers and independent analysts. Not all of these points of view are necessarily favorable to the company.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Might need cleanup, but there are some good mentions in large publications that don't appear to be press releases (the Business 2.0 and PC Magazine pieces, for example).

<li>To <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> - thanks for your help and for your comments. I have modified the content of the page significantly so that it better states (and supports) the notability requirements (and hopefully the neutrality requirements) the community has cited in this dialog. Let me address your more personal questions. This is indeed my first posting in Wikipedia. Tacit Software is a company that has recently come under much more public scrutiny because of a new product it just launched. My goal for posting in Wikipedia is to provide a fact-based description of the company and its technologies so users can learn more in a neutral environment. If the article violates Wikipedia notability and neutrality rules, I think that's due to the fact that I'm a Wikipedia novice and not that the company itself is not notable. As always, your comments are welcome. I am particularly interested in community feedback on cleanup - what specifically should be worked on? --<a href="../../../c/b/y/User%7ECbyeh_106a.html" title="User:Cbyeh">Cbyeh</a> 02:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Cbyeh - The cleaned up article looks even more like an advertisement for the company's products, which makes it even a stronger deletion candidate (see <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html#Companies" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP#Companies</a>). Didn't anything notable happen to the company or was caused by the company between 1997 and 2007? Review this <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Tacit+Software&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Tacit+Software&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for notable items to include in the article. Did the company receive any legitimate awards for notable merit? Did Tacit best other companies to win any awards? A company having products or patents is not notable. Did the ActiveNet or illumio products make a notable difference in the companies that purchased the product? Was there some notable event in the development of these products? Were any of the Tacit patents subject to a notable legal fight? Did Tacit buy any of the patents for a huge amount of money? As for further clean up, you should review the cited external links for facts to include in the article and add the link as a footnote and remove it from the external links. - <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 06:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is more of a fact based environment rather than a neutral environment. You might want to include in the article information about the public scrutiny of Tacit Software that you mention above. I'm sure it will eventually be added and, if you don't do it yourself, you might not like the results. Also, I think it's great that you would like to contribute to Wikipedia beyond this one article.

<li>Was wondering, could you cite another source other than the "bro rape" clip on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zvTRQr7ns8" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zvTRQr7ns8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zvTRQr7ns8</a> that shows "bro" defined this way? I've found using Google far more hits of webpages alluding to "bro" defined similarly to the current Wikipedia article than the way on the "bro rape" clip. UrbanDictionary.com, while not a citeable source, is a pretty good consensus of the use of slang and the majority of the definitions corroborate the Wikipedia article (a couple of the definitions date back as far as 2003). I would more call the guys on the "bro rape" clip "frat boys". <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESection8pidgeon_88de.html" title="User:Section8pidgeon">section8pidgeon</a> 10:44, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm also a little concerned about the top picture - Image:Daltonroad1912.jpg. It's licensed as GFDL by the author, but is apparently taken in 1912 (meaning they would have to be at least 96). Anyone know what to do about this? MrBeast 01:04, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe the editor is the owner of the photo, inherited from a relative. From 1912, it's likely public-domain anyway. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 01:20, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps not. This wasn't taken in the US, so the pre-1923 clause is irrelevant. If the copyright statute in the UK (and I don't know what it is) is 50 or 70 years after the death of the author, it's possible it could still be copyright. If the author was 18 when the picture was taken, he or she could easily have died in the 1960s or 1970s. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 02:56, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Unless the photographer is "unknown", in which case the copyright expired on January 1st, 1983.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is not a Japanese language AFD. That link above is just a page for people interested in topics about Japan to easily monitor related AFDs. There are other deletion sorting projects, although, I think that very few are active. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 22:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, the Ja: wikipedia doesn't seem to have an article on this game, and even more compelling is the fact it is not mentioned in an article about the entire "strip majong" genre: <a href="../../../../ja/%E8%84%B1/%E8%A1%A3/%E9%BA%BB/%E8%84%B1%E8%A1%A3%E9%BA%BB%E9%9B%80.html" class="extiw" title="ja:脱衣麻雀">ja:脱衣麻雀</a>. And given the sheer length of an article about "Idol Janshi Sweety Pie": <a href="../../../../ja/%E3%82%A2/%E3%82%A4/%E3%83%89/%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%89%E3%83%AB%E9%9B%80%E5%A3%AB%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%81%E3%83%BC%E3%83%91%E3%82%A4.html" class="extiw" title="ja:アイドル雀士スーチーパイ">ja:アイドル雀士スーチーパイ</a>, I think that the missing ja: article is not due to a lack of interest in the topic... For anyone wanting to look any further, keep in mind that the Japanese characters for "Pretty Sailor" are not firmly established, and care must be taken wrt Google's parsing mechanism. 美少女雀士プリティーセーラー, 美少女雀士プリティセーラ, and 美少女雀士プリティーセイラー are a few different ways I saw it represented. The most G-hits were for the first one (12,500), while the Sweety Pie game linked above got 49,500 G-hits (for a relative comparison). <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 22:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

If a student union is notable at all, notability needs to be demonstrated here as per the standards - and in this case we're not seeing notability being demonstrated.

<p>The result was <b>KEEP</b>. The raw vote totals are 4 Delete, 3 Keep, 4 Merge (two of the Keep voters struck out their bolded "vote", for some reason, but they didn't strike out their Keep arguments, so they still count as Keep comments. So clearly there's no consensus to outright delete the article, and no real consensus at all about what to do. I found the Keep arguments to be pretty well-made and cogent, so by strength of argument we get Keep. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:34, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Do Not Delete</b>.</s> Because he's more famous for writing songs than plays/screenplays, does not make his work in this area unremarkable. See the page <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_B._Sherman_02ab.html" title="Robert B. Sherman">Robert B. Sherman</a> to see his work in screenplays. The fact that it was written when the author was 16 is not the point of the article either: What is important is that the play and author were recognized for fiscal contribution to the war effort, raising thousands of dollars. This play along with two radio programs produced and written by the same author appear on page 109 of <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt%27s_Time_139c.html" title="Walt's Time">Walt's Time</a></i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> which was a published, joint autobiography, from 1998. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward352_6e2d.html" title="User:Howard352">Howard352</a> 18:59, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response to Robertissimo</b> <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt%27s_Time_139c.html" title="Walt's Time">Walt's Time</a></i> is a joint autobiography of both <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherman_Brothers_68e3.html" title="Sherman Brothers">Sherman Brothers</a> so <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice_and_Dedication_Day_0847.html" title="Armistice and Dedication Day">Armistice and Dedication Day</a>'s "less than one page's mention" is understandable. (I don't know how Robertissimo can consider this legitimate criteria for deletion however.) As a side note, I have reason to believe that there is more of a mention in the author's currently unpublished (but recently completed) personal autobiography. I did not site that source here, because, as I'm certain Wikipedia standards would concur, an unpublished source cannot be cited. Nevertheless, <i>Walt's Time</i> was cited, and it is a published source, so that really should be adequete. Regardless, and as I mentioned above, I don't think that "a page mention" is actually considered a Wikipedia dividing line. Further to Robertissmo's argument, I am not aware of the "thousands that helped support the war effort" to whom he is haphazzardly refering. Certainly Robertissmo isn't suggesting that there were thousands of plays written in support of the war effort. Simply put, <i><a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice_and_Dedication_Day_0847.html" title="Armistice and Dedication Day">Armistice and Dedication Day</a></i> was performed publically, it made a profit at the time, it was covered by Newspapers at the time, it was lauded by the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Department_b819.html" title="War Department">War Department</a> and certified by same, it is a work by a famous person and was unique in that person's career to the point that its inclusion (as its own page) in Wikipedia may be of interest to users. Lastly, it was referenced in a recently published and available book (i.e. "<a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt%27s_Time_139c.html" title="Walt's Time">Walt's Time</a>"). For the reasons cited, the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice_and_Dedication_Day_0847.html" title="Armistice and Dedication Day">Armistice and Dedication Day</a> page should not be deleted or merged. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward352_6e2d.html" title="User:Howard352">Howard352</a> 14:56, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The information should not be lost. I agree with Howard's reasoning, recognition by War Department and famous author makes it notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> In response to Dhartung, I have been doing on going research on this article and have to get access to some archives which I plan to do over the next few months. There will be more information, when I am able to access it, but like many articles found in Wikipedia, this is a work in progress. It is being developed. I don't believe that I have been irresponsible or premature in creating the separate page either. However, I must make a personal note on this, I find it very discouraging to find articles deleted before they have a chance to be fully developed and will wait to know the immediate status of the article prior to spending any more time doing research for it. I hope this doesn't come across as bitterness, it's not meant as such. I recognize the balance that must be attained between hard line "deletionism" and a more liberal view. I just have better things to do with my time than to do research in good faith, only to see that work fall into the abyss! <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward352_6e2d.html" title="User:Howard352">Howard352</a> 10:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Recommend author works on article in userspace (User:Horard352/development) until he can do the above. Right now, Dhartung's right - it's not referenced, and really doesn't say anything besides "he wrote it, here's the plot, here's a short summary of his life story". --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWooty_3c1e.html#Mission_statement" title="User:Wooty"><i><b>W</b></i></a><a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWooty_3c1e.html" title="User:Wooty"><i><b>o</b></i></a><a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWooty_b_d631.html" title="User:Wooty/b"><font color="red"><b>o</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWooty_3c1e.html" title="User:Wooty"><i><b>ty</b></i></a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWooty_4caf.html" title="User talk:Wooty"><b>Woot?</b></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wooty_7925.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wooty"><b>contribs</b></a></small> 01:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)\</li>

<li><s><b>Keep, Do Not Move To Userspace</b></s> Wooty is correct that the article was not referenced, but that has now been corrected. Thank you for pointing out my ommision. Let me restate that this article is a work in progress. But that said, there will probably be other contributors to this page as there are a number of people who are interested in the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherman_Brothers_68e3.html" title="Sherman Brothers">Sherman Brothers</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney.html" title="Disney">Disney</a> related media. There are people who know about this play. Nothing in the article has been "guessed at", but it is sparce, admittedly. But I don't think <a href="../../../u/s/e/Userspace.html" title="Userspace">userspace</a> is appropriate because then it won't have the chance of properly expanding and therefore will be defeating one of the purposes of Wikipedia, to build accurate articles about meaningful data by a community of Wikipedians. (This is not a quote, I did not find this anywhere. But it seems to me to capture, in part, the spirit) I will restate, <i><a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice_and_Dedication_Day_0847.html" title="Armistice and Dedication Day">Armistice and Dedication Day</a></i> was performed publicly, it made a profit at the time, it was covered by Newspapers at the time, it was lauded by the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Department_b819.html" title="War Department">War Department</a> and certified by same, it is a work by a famous person and was unique in that person's career to the point that its inclusion (as its own page) in Wikipedia may prove to be of value to users. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward352_6e2d.html" title="User:Howard352">Howard352</a> 20:52, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

A reason these fan pages keep getting deleted is that they appear to be written from someone's personal memory of the topic. There might be something that we are overlooking. For example, look at today's featured article, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Tintin_3fe1.html" title="The Adventures of Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a>. It became a featured article, even though it links to the troubled article <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_characters_and_settings_in_The_Adventures_of_Tintin_7e2c.html" title="Secondary characters and settings in The Adventures of Tintin">Secondary characters and settings in The Adventures of Tintin</a>. Is there some special Wikipedia rule for fan pages? I don't know of any so I believe that delete is appropriate here. It's unfortunate that many of these fan pages have to be deleted. There probably is valid, factual information in the article that would permit the article to survive AfD if an editor did the leg work and provided footnotes. Keeping these troubled fan pages and giving featured article status to articles that link to these troubled fan pages only encourages more problem pages, results in more AfD work, and creates more disappointed editors whose hard work continues to be deleted because it is allow to exists and grow in the first place. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 18:40, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a></b> - PGNx Media meets the third possibility in the WP:WEB requirement. As a reminder, it requires that "The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster" - The content is actually distributed through a number of independent online publications, but for the source of this argument, I will be using Rotten Tomatoes.
<ul>
<li>Rotten Tomatoes is <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotten_Tomatoes_9dc6.html" title="Rotten Tomatoes">well-known</a></li>
<li>Rotten Tomatoes is independent; It is owned by <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> whereas PGNx Media is owned by PGNx Media, Inc. There are <i>no</i> connections -- shared owners, editors, revenues, etc.</li>

<li><b>Comment on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a></b> - The sources mentioned in the article, namely <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metacritic.html" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Rankings_40a1.html" title="Game Rankings">Game Rankings</a>, and Rotten Tomoatoes are notable, reliable, and independent sources. As I mentioned above, PGNx Media does not share any editors, owners, etc with any of those sources. Any notable claims, such as the size of the review archives, business opportunities, etc are sources. The claims in the article are not extraordinary or self-supporting. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfomanager_4c30.html" title="User:Infomanager">Infomanager</a> 04:13, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment on website's content</b> - Its review archive is currently at 1,223 reviews, making it the <i>23rd largest archive</i> on Gamerankings among active websites, 25th largest archive among all websites, and 35th largest among all websites and print publications <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/itemrankings/sites.asp?sort=5&amp;includeoth=n" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamerankings.com/itemrankings/sites.asp?sort=5&amp;includeoth=n" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.

<li><b>Comment on article's structure</b> - The article was written to comply with Wikipedia's objective tone and I followed the structure used by other websites (namely Introduction, Coverage, Notability, Staff, Criticisms) <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfomanager_4c30.html" title="User:Infomanager">Infomanager</a> 04:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment on passing the five-year rule</b> - As mentioned in the article, PGNx Media will began its sixth year of operations in two weeks. As someone who follows videogame websites, this is an important milestone and one that not many are able to claim (especially those that are independent). Also, in looking at the website today, I noticed that they have published over 13,000 articles in the last five years <a href="http://www.pgnx.net/news.php?page=full&amp;id=13004" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pgnx.net/news.php?page=full&amp;id=13004" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfomanager_4c30.html" title="User:Infomanager">Infomanager</a> 04:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - Websites primarily seem to involve <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. As discussed above, I fully believe that both of those requirements have been aptly met and demonstrated in the article. With 5 years, 13,000 articles, and 1,200 reviews under their belts, I don't see this website going away anytime soon. They have demonstrated to be important in their field. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfomanager_4c30.html" title="User:Infomanager">Infomanager</a> 04:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - WP:WEB and WP:RS, the two essential policies that matter when dealing with websites, have been met (though it is questionable whether the distribution methods truly demostrate notability). My personal notability requirements regarding websites (importance to its field and age) are definitely met.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Infomanager has aptly proved WP:WEB and WP:RS.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Yes, I do have an objection to the move because if nothing else, I will learn enough Spanish to build more pages on this subject. As a result of my efforts to improve this page and find the right cat stub I found five other orphaned pages with one that had been tagged for delete. Two were historical non-related except that they have <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a> or <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> in common. One was even an American page. To get back on-topic, I even went on the Spanish wiki to research this topic and see what they have. Most of their articles are linked to our wiki. It would be nice to have another contribution here that should be linked there. I became a Wiki Comics member supporter last night for a similar advocacy. I will do with the Spanish one at a later date as I have ten projects I want to get to first. This one is number one right now a comic project in close second place. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 19:04, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Number three will be to build a page on the two awards that <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alejandro_Agresti_8af6.html" title="Alejandro Agresti">Alejandro Agresti</a> which would be that awards' year page. I have seen three of his flicks and did not know that he was director. I am fascinated by what he has done. I am going to go off vandal patrol to accomplish projects within the next 30 days. My word is my username and ronbo76 has more than the 30 years of what it means to me as my nickname. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 19:11, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> (quasi-merge) per Dhartung (but spelled correctly per Folantin). While I respect Ronbo76's desire to increase his created-page count, I think it's better to have one article on the topic unless and until we have enough to justify a split into multiple articles. If that happens in the next few weeks, fine, but until that time, I think it's more appropriate to have just one article. Life happens, and it could end up being years before Ronbo creates the other articles he has in mind. (I know it's taken me much longer than originally planned to create several articles I have in mind.) If it takes longer than expected, then we're better off with one central article, and if it doesn't, we're no worse off, because splitting off a new sub-article is quite easy. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 09:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Personally, I know nothing about this subject but when I came across the article, it looked a little suspect.

As such, I prodded it, but it was removed with the message "de-prod, this is a denomination, and denominations are almost always kept" (I actually have no idea where this logic comes from since most articles are de-prodded by the author and then deleted at AfD).

The first ("Baccalaureate Career") allows one to access a self-generated alumnus profile indicating that subject did indeed double-major as an undergraduate at a Maryland College. The second is a link to employer The Lagniappe Project that does not mention the subject.

We are a legitimate group. The several hundred members that have been 'questioned' would quite like to post their comments concerning whether the page should be Kept or Deleted, but thereisno option for them to do so, unlike the several other Satanic groups which youhave also decided to delete. we are registered in the Slovak Republic as a company entity. our teachings are legitmate and are published in the form of two books - both by Crystal Dreams Publishing in the United States - and by Aestheteka itself elsewhere. As for legitimate links - there were several links to discussion groups, forums and otehr internet entities, due to our globally located membership, yet these have been deleted from the reference page. As for the legitimate existence of the Bestian Order of aestheteka, just do a google on 'Aestheteka' and you will see how substantial both our membership and our coverage is.

<li><b>Keep!</b> Bestian Order of the Aestheteka is a legitimate group that has maintained contact, worldwide, via the internet. Open discussions on a variety of spiritual concepts is a main function of this group. It is a budding religion focused on the need for self to be recognized more intimately. This is not a religion based on strict code of moral or dogma. These are discovered and worked through by each individual, with the aid and support of the groups members. The importance of this order, is the melding of ancient wisdom (as passed down through the ages) and more modernistic concepts from the likes of Jung and Crowley. It is a religion focused on self, but not exclusive of the world at large. - Kevin W.

<dd>Aestheteka is recognised by many in the Left Hand Path communities and is known globally as a melting pot of Dark Art and teh dark Arts. To remove the entry would be to discriminate solely on religious terms. Should you wish us to edit the entry to make it more Wikippealing, then please state how. The sources are plentiful; as previously stated on two occasions 'just google aestheteka'. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Aestheteka (<a href="../../../a/e/s/User_talk%7EAestheteka_a555.html" title="User talk:Aestheteka">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aestheteka_ad82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aestheteka">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>Perhaps WilyD would be good enough to explain why he is so obsessed about the removal of a page describing a religious order? Sources have been cited, yet these have been ignored. it is clear that WilyD is being objectionable on something other than purely academic grounds andhis comments such be taken into account in such light. The article may be updated to fit those sources (if they are not removed again by hands unseesn), but it is intolerable for such discriminatory behaviour to be enacted upon given suchlegislation as UN Human Rights Committee’s General Comments Article 18. Wikipedia is supposed to be about information and it is an invaluable research tool. One learns from using it. Perhaps those who had notheard of aestheteka due to theirlack of connection to LHP activities, now have access to its basic tenets (as opposed to its stated Occult Ideology here - <a href="http://www.aestheteka.com/aestheteka%20occult%20ideology.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.aestheteka.com/aestheteka%20occult%20ideology.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aestheteka.com/aestheteka%20occult%20ideology.htm</a> ). As the Aestheteka Forum is currently ranked c.60,000 out of all internet sites, it is clearthatmore than a handful of people know of Aestheteka and its activities. but again a simple google would have shown that.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Bestian Order of Aestheteka equates to a post-modern intelligent construct with creativity at warp-drive.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Bestian Order of Aestheteka is an innovative and active system of LHP initiation. The Order currently has three published texts outlining It's initiation ceremonies, core ideology, and practices. The The Bestian Order of Aestheteka Has an international hub on the Internet as well as local groups in Slovakia, Germany, and the US. I, along with the hundreds of other members, were shocked to hear that the entry on our order is being considered for deletion on the supposition that we don't exist. We find this humorous, but disturbing. The The Bestian Order of Aestheteka is endorsed by the Magickal Paradigms Occult group and myself it's moderator.

<li><b>Keep</b> While not everyone may find Aesthetheka politically correct, there are many individuals who find it relevant, and having access to this information for both research and networking, on Wikipedia, is necessary. If Wikipedia wants to maintain any credibility as an impartial tool for information, and not an instrument of arbitrary censorship, Aesthetheka should not be deleted. Mr. O'Toole has several books published, an E-zine, and a worldwide internet following. This is all easily verified.… Based on those facts alone, Aesthetheka should not be deleted.

<dl>
<dd>To remove such a tiny entry purely due to a few religious bigots who are basing their argument on lack of source material and at the same time ignoring the fact that the leader of our group, Edward O'Toole, is an author whose work (our founding tenets - the Sophia Bestiae and the Grimoire Bestiae) is registered and easily accessible to anyone who either understands ISBN numbers or the internet, or Amazon, etc, and that the Aestheteka symbol is a copyrighted symbol with an extremely indepth meaning (originally copyrighted by the English and US magazine Phenomena - countless sources concerning O'Toole's writings, including Coast-to-Coast may be accessed using online search engines).</dd>

<p>This entry does not violate any of the following Wikipedia Policy as is claimed by WillyD: 1)WP:RS Reliable Published Sources. The material given here is based on reliable published sources: Sophia Bestiae is published by Crystal Dreams Publishing, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-59146-075-1</a>, as is Grimoire Bestiae, 1-59146-666-0) 2)WP:OR Is also used to refer to material that has not been published by a reliable source or is a "novel narrative or historical interpretation." This is negated by the above explanation and also by the fact that Aestheteka exists as an international occult group with hundreds of members and therefore should be listed for the same reasons that Wikipedia lists Christianity. 3)WP:SPAM Articles considered advertisements include those that are solicitations for a business, product or service, or are public relations pieces designed to promote a company or individual. This article is not selling or promoting anyone or anything and does not meet the criteria for being spam. This article is designed to provide information on a rapidly growing religious-philosophical movement. 4)WP:V Verifiability, not truth. That The Bestian Order of Aestheteka is an fast growing International Occult Order with local groups in three countries, with three texts published by a well-known publishing company and available on Amazon.com and is endorsed by several external organizations (linked to above in this article) is easily verifiable by anyone capable of a web search. 5) WP:VAIN or WP:COI The only Conflict of interest in the move to have this article deleted is on the part of the editor who is obviously prejudiced by the inclusion of the terms Luciferian and Satanist. The comments made by WillyD constitute mere intolerance, but the deleting of this article would constitute an illegal act of religious discrimination and censorship. 6) WP:KITCHEN SINK States that: Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia and, as a means to that end, an online community of people interested in building a high-quality encyclopedia in a spirit of mutual respect. Therefore, there are certain things that Wikipedia is not. IF Wikipedia wishes to remain true to it's commitment to providing a high quality encyclopedia it is important that it not delete relevant articles relating to important religious movements just because some prejudiced editor has a personal problem with the articles ideology. Wikipedia is incomplete without reference to the one of the occult community's fastest growing sub-cultures; Aestheteka. Unless one of the certain things that Wikipedia is not happens to be - unbiased. 7) It appears that this article has been attacked by an unscrupulous character calling himself WillyD who is determined to convince Wikipedia that this article violates Wikipedia policy, which it does not, due to his personal dislike of the content of this page. Aestheteka is an innovative and rapidly growing international quasi-religious organization. Any Online Encyclopedia not including it would be incomplete. 68.206.197.128 23:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC) Jay Krodel.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Reserving judgment pending discussion of the sources cited. This article at least claims to have some sources, but it is difficult to evaluate whether they are reliable, verifiable, and independent. "Thormynd Press" is the main publisher cited and only gets 236 google hits and apparently is primarily a publisher of books on Nazi Satanism. Is Thormynd independent of the subject of the article?

<li><b>Keep</b>. This organization is mentioned in several published books - such as the one by Goodrick-Clark which mention is several pages long - and has been detailed in academic articles such as the Anthropoetics, and in various published magazines such as Searchlight. The Tripod site is a mirror site - not the actual site of the group. The assertion that some sources are "fake" is incorrect - did the writer of that comment bother to check the British Library catalogue, for instance? It does seem that there is or could be some partionship involved by some users associated maybe with ToS who want the article deleted - as the group under discussion s not liked by some adherents of other "satanic" paths or cults. <i>The article clearly meets the Wikipedia criteria for notability given the range of published non-partisan sources listed</i>. 65.57.106.27 20:03, 5 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— 65.57.106.27 (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.57.106.27.html" title="User talk:65.57.106.27">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.57.106.27_d08d.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.57.106.27">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>IMHO, it's pretty good for Google books, as opposed to Google web.

<dd>Fair enough - I've changed my vote. From what I can tell, (1) JQ is right that the current version of the article is unsourced and probably pretty close to completely wrong; (2) although "fiscalism" was in relatively frequent use in the 1970's economic literature as the converse of monatarism and it is probably possible to write a good article about fiscalism, it will take more research than I have time to do. At least until someone commits to writing a worthwhile article, a redirect is much better than unsourced and probably incorrect information. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 15:27, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>My sincerest apologies. I think this may just be a confusion over official and colloquial nomenclature. The site <a href="http://www.enjoyengland.com" class="external free" title="http://www.enjoyengland.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.enjoyengland.com</a> , linked to from the article, is also linked as the official site for England on the VisitBritain index page (<a href="http://www.visitbritain.com/VB3-en-gb/default.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.visitbritain.com/VB3-en-gb/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>). It's also the first site that comes up on a Google search for "English Tourist Board", and was the historical name of the organization until 1999 (See <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/397958.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/397958.stm" rel="nofollow">this BBC article</a>).

<dd>Apology accepted. This whole area is very confusing due to devolution and mergers of bodies. The VisitBritain article says that it was a merger of the BTA and something called the "English Tourism Council", but that BBC article clarifies that. In view of the links you provide I would be happy with a page move, leaving this as a redirect. I really did not think that the enjoyengland website looked like anything other than a commercial enterprise, certainly not very "official" looking, but there you go... --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 07:09, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would <b>merge/redirect</b> to <a href="../../../v/i/s/VisitBritain_befb.html" title="VisitBritain">VisitBritain</a> as that is the successor organization.

VisitBritain is the sucessor to the old BTA, responsible for all of Britain (not Northern Ireland - that's still controlled by the NITB) - EnjoyEngland is the arm of it specifically responsible for England.

<dd>It's mainly a matter of negative evidence. :) Unlike the English, Scottish, and Welsh sites, the Northern Ireland site ( <a href="http://www.nitb.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.nitb.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nitb.com/</a> ) does _not_ contain any reference to VisitBritain, and the VisitBritian page giving details of its management (<a href="http://www.visitbritain.com/corporate/corporategovernance/vbboardmembers/index.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.visitbritain.com/corporate/corporategovernance/vbboardmembers/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>), contains the statement "As chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, Tom McGrath attends VisitBritain Board meetings as an observer", strongly implying (but not, I agree, stating explicitly) that the NITB isn't in any way a subsidiary of VB. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 12:29, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article seems to be <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>. "Ergadenylic acid" is an obscure term for <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adenosine_monophosphate.html" title="Adenosine monophosphate">adenosine monophosphate</a> (AMP) <a href="http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/gen_metab_summary_4.php?molName=AMP" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/gen_metab_summary_4.php?molName=AMP" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, and cannot even be found at <a href="../../../p/u/b/PubMed_05d8.html" title="PubMed">PubMed</a> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=;&amp;db=PubMed&amp;cmd=search&amp;term=Ergadenylic%20acid" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=;&amp;db=PubMed&amp;cmd=search&amp;term=Ergadenylic%20acid" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>.</p>
<p>The entire text is meant to support the notion that AMP is a vitamin by disguising it as "ergadenylic acid". Not only is there a lack of citations to back this claim up, but AMP can be endogenously generated by a number of different mechanisms, as discussed in the article on <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adenosine_monophosphate.html" title="Adenosine monophosphate">adenosine monophosphate</a>. This contradicts the notion that it is a <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitamin.html" title="Vitamin">vitamin</a>.</p>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. If this is a _genuine_ term for AMP, then I think turning it into a redirect would be better than deleting it. The issue of whether or not it's a vitamin is probably best decided on the main <a href="../../../b/_/v/B_Vitamins_9d31.html" title="B Vitamins">B Vitamins</a> page. (Incidentally, the majority of Ghits for "vitamin B8" come up with <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biotin.html" title="Biotin">Biotin</a>, which is listed here as B7.

<li><b>redirect</b>. The Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank link above gives the name as a synonym, so a redirect to <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adenosine_monophosphate.html" title="Adenosine monophosphate">adenosine monophosphate</a> seems best.

<li>No, the status quo is that "Vitamin B8" is really AMP/Ergadenylic acid, but Inositol was formerly/erroneously labelled as B8. There are two separate issues to resolve elsewhere - (a) is AMP a vitamin? and (b) which compound is/was labelled "vitamin B8"? (Again, Google overwhelmingly suggests Biotin, with folic acid a distant second). But neither are at issue in this AfD. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 13:12, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Looks to me as if he has won more than Scandinavian race, he is Finnish Junior Champion and if you follow the link against International Open Masters you can see that the races will be televised this year on RAI and Eurosport, and that the Championship is the virtual equivalent of the World Championship's. Following some research I also note that other sporting individuals who have achieved less than this guy have their Wikipedia entries allowed without question. I don't see how something interesting, factual and that is televised internationally should be removed at this stage. If he is the 'reigning' Finnish Junior Champion then there is probably interest in his career from important sources. If he doesnt deliver for a year then I agree it should be removed at that time but why be harsh on a young guy trying to achieve something and so far doing a good job?

<li>Your argument is flawed and is often used by article creators to justify notability of their article. There has to be sensible ways to determine importance (or lack of it) of each subject. When it comes to sports biographies, it is clear that the sportsperson in question has to compete at senior level. This racing driver has still years to reach it. He attends the KF3 class (for under-15's), which is, frankly, a children's class! More creditable karting classes, like KF1 (aka <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_A_aca8.html" title="Formula A">Formula A</a>) and ICA (<a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercontinental_A_77f4.html" title="Intercontinental A">Intercontinental A</a>) are also effectively junior classes since most drivers move to bigger vehicles (like <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_Ford_f1b2.html" title="Formula Ford">Formula Ford</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_BMW_9338.html" title="Formula BMW">Formula BMW</a>) immediately when they are allowed to do so. Furthermore, nothing implies this driver has outstanding achievements. In Europe alone, there are likely tenfolds of equally talented drivers of his age group. What if all of them would post autobiographies at Wikipedia? If Petri Suvanto matures into a famous driver, he will certainly have a page at Wikipedia. But this is not a crystal ball, he might fail as well. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulius_Sahara_5577.html" title="User:Julius Sahara">Julius Sahara</a> 13:17, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Julius, with the greatest respect my specialist subject's are motor cycling and motor sport and particularly the junior levels which are often underrated by many people as being insignificant - having followed Junior levels of two and four wheels for over 30 years I have seen many stars (Including Schumacher, Raikkonen) rise from Junior categories which are extremely competitive and fought out at international level. Many of the 'children' you refer too are paid as professional's before reaching the higher level's. If I were the original poster Julius then I don't think I would have been as polite to you as I have, particularly when you use a put you down comment by saying that all this driver has done is won a few Scandinavian races when quite clearly he has and is in the continual process of achieving so much more than that. I am not here to argue the rights or wrongs for Wikipedia or this article because I am new and have never seen Petri Suvanto race but sometimes a fresh perspective can be worth a look at, if I am wrong then it will have been served as a lesson but at the same time I am very grateful to Wikipedia for allowing me the opportunity to cast my view and own opinion (after all that is one of the beauties of this site and on-line encyclopaedia). <b>I would argue that the age of an athlete is not relevant to the level of professionalism or competitiveness or credibility of what he or she does with their profession OR to which Championship they compete in.</b> In fact if they are children, then in a way they deserve more credit and encouragement for at least trying to achieve something at a young age. To finalise my message I would like to note the following reasons why in my opinion it seems appropriate for this particular article to remain:<br /></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1)Karting is most certainly <b>not a Junior racing category</b>, it has several drivers still racing (such as David Fore and Marco Ardigo) who raced against the likes of Schumacher, Trulli and Fisichella and they took the decision to remain in karting as <b>professionally paid sportsmen</b> which serves as a far better career than many hundreds of drivers in series Julius mentions such as Formula BMW and Formula Ford<br /></p>
<p>2)I see that Petri Suvanto will race in Maranello team in 2007 and that his <b>team-mate will be none other than 5 time Karting World Champion Davide Fore</b><br /></p>
<p>3) <b>He is Finnish Junior Champion</b>; Finland is acknowledged as a nation which produces many stars. A couple of drivers who competed in this Championship and did NOT win it include Kimi Raikkonen and Heikki Kovalainen<br /></p>
<p>4) <b>Petri Suvanto's 2007 races will be shown on RAI Live Italian television with Live broadcasts simultaneously shown on Eurosport</b><br /></p>
<p>5) <b>Petri Suvanto is one of the favourites to win the KF3 title in 2007.</b> Even if he wins just one of the races which is shown live on TV then there is a very good chance at least one Wikipedia user would like to refer to see if he can find out more on him<br /></p>
<p>6) Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopaedia and one of the beauties of this is that the inclusion of this page is that it is not taking up unavailable space or preventing someone elses page appearing<br /></p>
<p><b>7) For 2007 Suvanto's 'no longer' Italian Championship was awarded International status by the FIA (governing body to the Formula One World Championship) who have given permission for the series to be called the INTERNATIONAL Open Championship due to its mass international credibility throughout the world of motor sport. It was called the Italian Championship when Raikkonen, Schumacher, Montoya, Fisichella and Trulli competed in it but due to the overall success, interest and commercial viability of karting, the series has moved up a gear<br /></b></p>
<p>8) Karting is recognised as one of the most exciting categories of motor sport that can be watched hence the high ratings and continued live coverage by RAI and the Eurosport TV channel<br /></p>
<p>9) <b>Despite being three years younger than the reigning Formula A European Champion (Michael Christensen), Petri Suvanto beat this driver as a twelve year old</b><br /></p>
<p>10) Suvanto is a driver who has achieved great things as a youngster and is already moving on to the international platform that karting is recognised as. Why not be proud of representing a great achiever at such a tender age.<br />
<br />
11) <b>Anyone who understands motor sport knows that the Championship's hosted by the International Open Masters in 2007 are the equivalent of the World Championship's. There are many other Wikipedia entries that hold other Junior champions and achievers from all walks of life and sports in general.</b> - Mikedonlough 21:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Dear Wikipedia, as the original poster of this article I am not sure whether I am allowed a say in this area or not, but if I may reply then I would like too purely with facts and without biase: There are several reasons as to why I thought the inclusion of Petri Suvanto in Wikipedia was appropriate but without going into huge detail as someone has done above, I'd like to also mention in addition that this driver is coached by the same driver coach for Raikkonen, McLaren and RedBull. He is also legally represented by Macfarlanes who are the law firm to Sir Jackie Stewart and Red Bull F1 team and he is managed by Allstar International who have represented Nelson Piquet Junior and Antonio Pizzonia amongst others. He is also competing in an International series which is aired live on Eurosport, the leading Pan-European Sports channel reaching over 100 million households, 240 million viewers in 54 different countries plus RAI, the Italian channel. In 2007 he is also team mates with Davide Fore the five time karting World Champion. I will slightly update the entry to demonstrate these facts. In terms of article notability I hope I have satisfied this request by putting in over 20 links - if this is still not appropriate then please let me know and I will act accordingly to your request.</li>

<li>Another Red Card to Julius Sahara - not only with another put you down (without good reason) comment but by now criticising a new Wikipedian who has already offered more than one useful opinion in sports categories. At least the new users I have seen in this thread seem to be dealing with the facts instead of trying to paint the black tarnished picture that Sahara is intent on doing without any validity whatsoever. Please don't let this go unnoticed Wikipedia. For me, the facts of this driver speak for themselves. Mikedonlough 18:54, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Article makes explicit claims of notability per <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, especially regarding multiple sports championships. This is a thorough article that more than adequately covers the school and its activities. This is yet another pathetic case of an article that should have been tagged for sources, tone or image issues. There are dozens of tags that could have -- and should have -- been applied. There is no reason that an AfD needed to be initiated to address these issues. A few minutes at the keyboard was more than enough to address POV concerns and add several sources. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:56, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Let's start taking apart the statements made above from the beginning, with the creation of this article. I did it. I admit it. I created this article. I created it after someone had edited the original article "Ridgewood High School", which was about a school in New Jersey, and overlaid the text with the description of a school somewhere in Florida. After some back and forth, I restored the New Jersey school article, took the Florida text and pasted it in to create the <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridgewood_High_School_%28Florida%29_cb0a.html" title="Ridgewood High School (Florida)">Ridgewood High School (Florida)</a> article. You can take a gander at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ridgewood_High_School_%28New_Jersey%29&amp;diff=54786414&amp;oldid=54767304" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ridgewood_High_School_%28New_Jersey%29&amp;diff=54786414&amp;oldid=54767304" rel="nofollow">this link</a> for some of the details. A disambiguation page was created shortly thereafter at <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridgewood_High_School_89a9.html" title="Ridgewood High School">Ridgewood High School</a>. My only connection in creating the article was to resolve a nascent edit war by creating a new article. I don't attend the school. I'm not an alumnus. I don't know where New Port Richey is, nor do have any idea of where the original Port Richey is located. I do know school articles. And I also know that if the AfD nominator states that "[t]he article doesn't follow WP:SCHOOL in asserting notability", then indicating why it does indeed meet the notability criteria specified by <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> would be an appropriate refutation of the claim that it should be deleted. As the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> argument fails, and the concerns about "bias" and images can be or already have been easily addressed, my argument for a <b>Speedy Keep</b> seem rather well justified. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 23:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are a student of the school which can lead to bias. Please give a reason on how the school is notable other then that it serves a large community. If that is the reason why there should be an article, then many schools can have their own articles, but <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> or a <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information.23wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">directory</a>.

<li><b>Edit &amp; Comment</b>: Oops; I forgot to sign the above. Anyway, I would actually say that it's much harder for British Christian bands to meet the criteria. In America, there's a massive CCM industry willing to report on bands, etc.; in Britain, there's literally no CCM subculture... and a lot of music magazines, channels, etc. refuse to consider Christian bands (and hence especially their by-definition less-notable members) as being worthy of attention.

<li><b>Keep</b> Delerious is one of the most important bands in contemporary Christian circles, especially in the UK. and has influenced worship in 1000s of churches. Martin Smith and Stu Garrard in particular have written songs that are used regularly in worship and are Christian hymnwriters in their own right. It might be best to keep their articles seperate and combine the others into Delerious' article.

Ignoring that your "reliable source" can't even spell <i>medal</i> or <i>amateur</i>, it is incorrect. <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khosrow_Vaziri_f812.html" title="Khosrow Vaziri">Khosrow Vaziri</a> states "Although he was billed as having been a 1968 Olympic medalist, this is untrue", which is confirmed by the <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestling_at_the_1968_Summer_Olympics_de12.html" title="Wrestling at the 1968 Summer Olympics">relevant results from the 1968 Olympics</a>. OWW is nothing more than a fansite, and should not be considering a reliable source. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 23:43, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe we should remove OWW as a source from all wrestling bios, as if you look at any of them, they are there.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. OWW is a glorified fan site for wrestling fans. I doubt every wrestler listed on the site is notable. The fact OWW links are listed in many wrestling articles means very little: seeing as how there isn't alot of other major wrestling sites out there (besides the official ones for WWE, TNA, etc, along with news sites and fan sites such as OWW). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 23:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem is that, there is a conflict; you cannot be a <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">muslim</a> <b>and</b> at the same time believe that you can <b>create</b> life in a laboratory. <i>Jabir</i> was an experimental chemist, also <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alchemy_%28islam%29.html" title="Alchemy (islam)">alchemy</a> in Islam differs from alchemy at large. so there is no point of keeping the article, because if we remove the line about Jabir and the other irrelevant paragraph; there will be no article hence I'm adding it for <s>deletion</s>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I think you do wrong assumptions. The article talk about research of about 1300 year ago. Islamic theology was not very developed, as also communications. Do you think that in a century the traditions and local believes can be erased? And in all the people?

<dd>Nah, there is no such thing called takwin or not takwin, also that is not a proof of verifiability, I don't care if it from pennsylvania or else..there is a possibility of being a fake research or something.. the article is a false assumption and no need to keep it..btw, that don't happen in Islam and even if it happens, it will not happen in the golden era.. you don't just say need that or that..you don't know Islam and you keep in talking convincing other fellows of false information...I don't like to appear as bashing every keep statement but it is necessary to explain.. again, the article's subject is non-existent and needs to be deleted!.--<a href="../../../a/l/n/User%7EAlnokta_c859.html" title="User:Alnokta">Alnokta</a> 05:12, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An online game. Nothingon Google News, nothing on Factiva, "Version 0.71 is due to be out on Friday, January 4."

<li><b>Keep</b>: The game is classified as "in development". The Game's website is a primary source, why should it be up for deletion? 24.136.249.147 23:48, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: The game is listed on Gameshout.com <a href="http://www.gameshout.com/news/pc_games_gameshout_announces_lost_colony_video_game/article8617.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.gameshout.com/news/pc_games_gameshout_announces_lost_colony_video_game/article8617.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gameshout.com/news/pc_games_gameshout_announces_lost_colony_video_game/article8617.htm</a> however, as Red Planet LLC seems to belong to gameshout...... I would argue that the controvesy surrounding the game is enough to merit a Wiki entry not to mention the staffs tactics in dealing with anyone who criticises it. Signed - OMaHTLD Mark Berry. 0534GMT 6/1/07.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: OMaHTLD is correct in the site he provided, however I do disagree with his reasoning for wanting the article not deleted. The article HAS had the problem of edit wars by people who seem to have a vindetta against the game on multiple sites, and the user StateofShock, who is a developer of the game. While Im not sure it is nessaraly approperiate for a developer to be editing out things in place of info that essentially plugs the game, on the same token it has also been a problem for the article being vandalised and constantly putting up things of speculative nature as fact. Though peoples opinions and speculation have been put in a community reaction section, which is where I think it is approperiate imho. But I digress, the game is still under development and the game's site is a primary source. The link OMaHTLD provided, albiet a sister company, is a seperate source that the game exists, again Under Development. Simply because the company has not had a great amount of advertising or is not prevelent in the news, it should have merit for an entry in wikipedia because of thoes sources, or at least as much right as other games being developed that have articles.

<dd>Yes you are quite correct in that some people have made some fairly vitriolic comments about the game/devs, and some unsubstantiated comments, mainly relating to the licensing of the Torque Engine, something of which they would have no way of knowing either way.</dd>
<dd>There is also speculation over the actual existence of the full game the devs have claimed is completed after a years development, of which they are unwilling to release any screenshots etc before asking for cash. This has led to speculation that they intend to begin production on the money gained by pre orders and delay the game due to ‘bugs’ as the only in game screenshots are from their testbed version of the game which has drawn criticism as being a simply modified version of the Torque demo included with the engine.</dd>
<dd>Just as the Wikipedia entry should contain information about the gameplay, in which Stateofshock has not been shy in adding, it should also contain information on the controversy surrounding the games inception, in which Stateofshock has not been shy in removing.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Should we delete every article for every game that isn't out yet? Following Lost Colony there are many people who want to see it fail, including a rival company. A base for deletion needs more then the fact that the game isn't out yet and that people don't like it (or want it to succeed). The only merit in deletion that there is, is that this is a hot topic. But on the same coin, why let an article die because its controversial? <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanduar_e714.html" title="User:Zanduar">Zanduar</a> 05:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As a representative for the game itself, Lost Colony, I am all for deletion of this Wiki article. There's no way we can fairly provide information about the game while both Vashner and OMaHTLD are running this speculative crusade. All they have done at Wikipedia, according to their logs, is to pick on this game and to stir up more controversy. Yes, there was a thread posted on GarageGames which was CLOSED because of the speculative nature. Lost Colony is VERY much involved with the community, you can see that from our website. We also have involved community members in the game using some of the faction logos they created. We have done a lot of development for this game, using Torque's Shader Engine early adopter, which the "early adopter" doesn't even provide a running game engine. Thus, we had to make several development changes to make it work for Lost Colony. By default, TSE (TGEA) early adopter is not a runable game engine.We have argued these truths, but both Vashner and OMaHTLD keep coming back with "you're running the Torque Demo". This comes from the same 2 people who originally thought we were using "Torque", which we are not. We are using a different engine made by Torque known as "Shader Engine", or TGEA. All of this fuss is a waste of time, and the only reason Vashner and OMaHTLD want this article to remain, is so they can further confuse the public about our video game. Enough already. I say get it off Wiki if this is the way it's going to be. We've had enough of this nonsense. Stateofshock 22:05, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. Raw totals, disregarding one likely puppet, are 4-2 Delete. Keep arguments are not strong: one indicates that having a single book published by a non-vanity press is sufficient for an article on the <i>author</i> (rather than the book), which seems dubious to me. The other points to a review in the online edition of the Guardian, but it is after all of the "briefly noted" variety, two paragraphs. And that is the only thread on which to hang the article - one brief notice. These arguments do not to me seem sufficiently convincing. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:49, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article on the book suggests that there have been multiple independent non-trivial reviews, though the references are not well sourced. I went through 20 pages of ghits, and there were no non-trivial reviews. The concerns over verifiability, notability and apparent conflict of interest make me support deletion.

<dd>Well done in finding that review! I searched for the other one referenced in the book article, but couldn't locate it online. If an actual citation for that review could be dredged up, I could support keeping a merged article as having multiple nontrivial sources. Short of that, WP is not a crystal ball, so we don't know if the article would meet the guidelines in the future. If you are confident, you could always preserve the contents in user space, pending further career developments.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 23:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> with less POV name change. All are sourced and with a random walk through the sources, they look reliable. Perhaps "Known cocaine users" may be a better name. And remind people that an entry must have a Wikipedia article already. People sipping in names should not be an excuse for deletion, people already do that for every other acceptable "vice" category. This is less subjective than the "alcoholic" list, everyone has a drink, but not everyone uses cocaine and then mentions it in an interview, is arrested for possession, or dies from an overdose. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 23:11, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Subset of the fabled List of non-notable people. A list of non-notables is not made notable by including a lot of them.

<dd>Would agree, TV shows shouldn't be cited. Of course, for plot summaries and the like, there's usually the tv.com's and such of the world which offer plot summaries-that would be a secondary source, but in that case, you're not posting <i>your</i> interpretation, you're posting <i>theirs</i>. That's the definition of source research vs. original research-basically, with proper sourcing, someone who has <i>never seen the show</i> should be able to verify everything in the article. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 04:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But isn't that like...I mean, if I'm talking about the character of Hamlet, shouldn't I make references to William Shakespeare?

<dl>
<dd>Oh of course not! However, primary sources should be used in conjunction with secondary sources, not in place of them. I don't think anyone would be hard-up to find reliable third-party analyses of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>. There'd be nothing wrong with citing the part of Hamlet the critic cites in addition to citing the criticism-just not <i>instead</i> of the criticism. However, per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, we still shouldn't be offering our <i>own</i> interpretations of Hamlet, only reporting on others' evaluations. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 04:44, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Right. So it seems like "TV shows shouldn't be cited" is a little stronger a statement than what you meant--oftentimes the best commentary on any work of fiction will be in the work itself, like when a character talks about himself. I think the real issue is that TV shows need to be cited very exactly, which is to say, without any extra commentary, unless that commentary is coming from somewhere else. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 05:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Right. I think direct quotes from the characters would be perfect candidates for direct sourcing. However, interpretations (such as plot summaries) should be secondarily sourced. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 05:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, no, I think I'm quite comfortable with relating simple facts from television shows and other fictional media as quite acceptable. Why? Because anybody else can also observe the thing. It is not an experiment, it is not a theory. It is reporting directly from the media. It is really no different from saying "And Author So-and-So says this about that" . Basically, I don't need some third-party book to tell me Hamlet is about a Danish prince who returned home from England to find his father dead, and his uncle married to his mother. Analysis beyond that, yes, that would need further sources, but to say that we can't report what occurs in a television show (or other fictional work) unless we can find some other source that says it? Far too strict an interpretation of NOR. Sure, if there's some dispute or disagreement as to what happened on a show, or to some specific detail behind it, that'd mean checking other sources, but even then, given that the episodes were named here, I would say a link to a book on B5 or a website would be quite feasible if you desired to do it. Might even be references in the Wikipedia articles on those episodes already. Anyway, the real point is, I don't see that objection as possessing much merit. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I still disagree, but I'd suggest moving this to user talk-I don't think an individual AfD would be the place for such a discussion. I'm also not sure how it's "too strict" an interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>-the policy is <i>no</i> original research, not "Only a little bit of original research." Anyone can get hold of a lemon and make a battery out of it, but to say "I did this and it works" is OR, regardless of "anyone can do it"-and even regardless of the fact that it's dead-on correct. On the other hand, reporting on a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> stating that this can be done is sourced and verifiable to anyone. Also remember that Wikipedia is worldwide-while probably most anyone can get hold of Hamlet, some of our readers in various parts of the world might find it difficult or impossible to obtain a Babylon 5 episode, at least legally. Using reliable sources would mean that <i>any</i> reader, anywhere in the world, can verify the information. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 05:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Primary source" is the problem-if some part of a TV series/movie/etc. has not been covered in secondary sources in some form, it isn't <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 07:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding notability - I think the main thing we need to establish is that the work of fiction is notable. If the work, as a whole, is truly notable, then by extension, so are its characters. Minor characters, however, don't earn their own articles - that's why, according to <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a>, it's best to combine them in a list. I made this minor chars list to address that exact concern - I don't really care what list these character bios end up on, but they shouldn't be split up.</dd>

<dd>If the plot summary says "Bob shot Greg", this is verifiable by anyone who watches the show. We don't need a movie reviewer to say "Bob shot Greg" before we're allowed to say it. The key question here is, when does a plot summary turn into original research? I wrote up a "<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_WikiJournal_4020.html#Case_study:_quoting_material_from_fictional_sources" title="User:Quack 688/WikiJournal">thought experiment</a>" on this a while ago - it's not really finished, but given that it's relevant here, I'd appreciate any feedback. I'd just like to re-emphasise the disclaimer at the very top of the page that most of it is shite in its current state - it's just a scratchpad. Still, if you've got any comments, feel free to start up a discussion page there and speak your piece.

<dd>Actually, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is much more verbose than just "No original research" even the nutshell statement is far longer: "Articles may not contain any unpublished arguments, ideas, data, or theories; or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published arguments, ideas, data, or theories that serves to advance a position." As these episodes were unquestionably published, the data from them is not a problem. Access to Babylon 5 episodes is not an especially big issue, there are plenty of books used as references I could not easily obtain. And if you really want to do so, there are plenty of books and other material on Babylon 5 you could review and use as a reference. So basically, as a deletion reason, OR is not especially applicable in this case.

<dd>I'm also still concerned about <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> here-earlier, you suggested "notability by association", if the show is notable so by definition are all its characters, with which I (and <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>) strongly disagree. <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a> is notable.

<dd>I agree that shouldn't be extended to truly insignificant characters (e.g. the guy who opens the door for someone, then is never seen again).

<dd>There already is a perfectly good <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Babylon_5_characters_c8c6.html" title="List of Babylon 5 characters">List of Babylon 5 characters</a>. You do bring up another point though-who determines what a "minor character" is? If these characters had major plot impact, they may not have been minor. As an example, take Q out of Star Trek-he only appeared in a pretty small minority of episodes. But was he minor? I really don't know you could say he was. By placing anyone on this list, we're editorializing. (On the other hand, placing Q on a "List of Star Trek characters" would not be an editorial, there's no doubt he certainly was that.)

<dd>Considering there are quite a lot of Lists of minor characters on OP, this probably opens yet another discussion we really shouldn't get into on AFD.

<dd>Well, on minor vs major, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> says "the main criterion is how much non-trivial information is available on the character.", but it's intentionally vague on the matter.

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b>. I think it goes very slightly beyond the dicdef by including the <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultism.html" title="Adultism">adultism</a> thing, and it certainly has the potential to expand into a good encyclopedia article. Why not add an expand tag instead of deleting? Plus, it is referenced to an article by an anti-ageism group.

<li><b>Delete</b> The key is the source of the name. Some web sites have created lists of many hundreds of phobias. (Spartaphobia is fear of Sparta, etc). What are the sources that say this is a psycological fear? The fact that this word exists on the net and a web article discussing ageism puts the word in a box is not enough for me. Is the word used other than on web lists? With no better sources I think no article and redirect to <a href="../../../a/g/e/Ageism.html" title="Ageism">Ageism</a> is fine.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 22:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>By way of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_thinking.html" title="Critical thinking">critical thinking</a>, I've gotta ask why the articles about child and youth related oppression continually run up against this type of resistance within the Wikipedia community. I look up terms like <a href="../../../g/y/n/Gynarchy.html" title="Gynarchy">gynarchy</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androcracy.html" title="Androcracy">androcracy</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manx_cat.html" title="Manx cat">manx cat</a>, and all of them lack citations of any kind - yet their validity is undoubted. However, <a href="../../../e/p/h/Talk%7EEphebiphobia_fc14.html" title="Talk:Ephebiphobia">ephebiphobia</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/u/Talk%7EAdultism_6a62.html" title="Talk:Adultism">adultism</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;page=Student%20voice" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;page=Student%20voice" rel="nofollow">student voice</a>, have all been extremely scrutized - and now this. How biased is the Wikipedia community against young people and the realities they face every single day? Unfortunately, with the call to delete this article I am afraid the answer is coming clearer. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 05:58, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> While it is similar to ephebiphobia, they talk about two different groups of people (teens vs. children) and some people may fear children but be ok with youth and vice versa.

It's highly questionable whether there ought to <i>be</i> an article on "pedophibia", and if there should it would probably be better to delete this one and start from scratch. We have had the same problem over at <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephebiphobia.html" title="Ephebiphobia">Ephebiphobia</a>... the technique used is the same: establish (or try to) the existance of an obscure medical condition and then use that for leverage to write a social advocacy essay. OK, first: as to the <i><b>medical</b></i> condition "pedophobia": there's no question that the number of people who are subject to actual phobic reactions (panic, shortness of breath, sweating, etc.) brought on by the idea or presence of children is not <i>zero</i>. The number of people who have phobic reactions brought on by the idea or presence of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spam.html" title="Spam">spiced ham</a>, Bob Hope, slotted spoons, or most <i>anything</i> is usually not zero, either. We don't have articles for each of these; I think we have one article where obscure phobias are given a one-line listing. <i>I think that "pedophobia" rates a line in this list</i> and no more. Second: as to the <i><b>social</b></i> phenomena "pedophobia", I'm not at all convinced that fear/scorn/hatred of <i>children</i> is sufficiently well established by verifiable neutral respected authority that the assertion of its notability is not original research. (Unlike <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephebiphobia.html" title="Ephebiphobia">Ephebiphobia</a>, which article deserves existence because Ephebiphobia (fear/scorn/hatred of teens) <i>is</i> a real enough phenomena.) Yes, some people think that children are ridiculous or despicable. That does not in any way require this article's existence. Lots of people think that <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullet.html" title="Mullet">mullets</a> are ridiculous or despicable; lots of people hate cheese; lots of people think frogs are slimy and disgusting; and so forth. We don't have separate articles for these. The article looks on the surface to be scholarly. Closer examination shows that it is not, and ought to be deleted. And I don't say that lightly. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:44, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Since when is it the domain of Wikipedia editors to decide the relevance or veritability of established scientific study? Is this discussion really about the legitimacy of this article, or individual editors' opinions about the subject at hand? Are those two things synonomous, or does meeting the encyclopedic premise of Wikipedia supercede personal perspectives? Also, Herostratus, it would be good to see where your "closer examination" shows that the citations are not scholarly - and I don't say that lightly, either. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 23:10, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Uh, we judge the relevance and verifiability of sources and material all the time; that's what we <i>do</i> here. The discussion of is about the legitimacy of the article, the point being that, basically, <i><b>there is no such term as pedophobia</b></i>. Wikipedia is not the place for articles about terms that you yourself have made up. It is also not your personal soapbox. Get yourself published in sociological journals, establish the term "pedophobia" as an <i>actual term</i> in the literature, and we'd be happy to have the article. Not til then. However, I doubt that anyone will publish your work until you use more rigrorous reasoning. Your essay (and this is what it is, not an encyclopedia article) transparently attempts to conflate medical and sociological terminolgy for advocacy purposes. Scholarly journals don't fall for that. Sorry to be harsh, but there it is. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Despite the decidedly uncooperative behaviour of the article creator, I think Mr Cole has the potential to be notable, as chairman of a government agency and an academic. <i>If</i> Petedaly stops his abusive editing, formats the article appropriately (including removal/rewriting of copyvio material), and provides reliable sources for Mr Cole's academic achievements (see - <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>) then the article can stay. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 19:06, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Tevildo, I certainly agree that if Petedaly is being uncooperative as you say that behavior would need to be addressed. But I don't think that deleting an article that would otherwise merit inclusion is the right way to handle it. There are various dispute resolution processes, and in cases where the 3RR or other policies are violated (e.g. continually inserting copyvio material), the individual may be blocked. I haven't looked at the article to determine whether I think it should stay, but I suggest that we look at based on its own merits rather than the behavior.

<p><b>Delete</b> - states right in the article that it's a neologism and that there's no consensus as to when or how the term is used or to whom it can refer. No ghits I can find using the term to refer to the character grouping outside of Wikipedia and the occasional bit of fanfic. Nothing in the article that can't be appropriately housed in one of the many other articles dealing with one or another of the four characters. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:57, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Don't Delete</b> - the article provides some information that I can not see being placed on the character's individual page. In addition, the page provides a way for readers to see gathered and summerized information about the four vampires all on the same page. Further more, the title of the page can be changed to something that is not a fan neologism. In conclusion, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and my opinion is to keep the article. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMeraculas_9a9f.html" title="User:Meraculas">Meraculas</a> 14:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - So we should keep the article because of who wrote it? AFAIK that's not how we measure notability. Honestly, all the articles you listed seem to serve the same purpose (self promotion). FWIW I've also AfD'd the other articles you mentioned.

<dd>I believe Johan meant the <i>strip</i> is written by Crosby, not the article.

<li><b>Clear Delete</b>, fails pretty much all our content policies as Wikipedia is not an internet guide and this is original research with no third-party reliable sources, let alone enough to write from a neutral point of view. This also fails the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline, not that we could keep an article that meets a notability guideline but fails multiple content policies. The idea that "The Comics Buyers Guide review ... satisfies Criteria 1 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as do the print collections themselves" is incorrect. First, The Buyers Guide <a href="http://www.keenspot.com/pressbox/" class="external text" title="http://www.keenspot.com/pressbox/" rel="nofollow">article</a> doesn't even mention this webcomic. Second, the single brief mention on that web page of this comic is in a press release, and a single mention in a press release is not independent of the site, or non-trivial, or for that matter multiple non-trivial and independent. Third, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sore-Thumbs-1/dp/1932775242/" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Sore-Thumbs-1/dp/1932775242/" rel="nofollow">self-published book</a> (with the Amazon sales rank of "none") is not an independent source either. My searches for non-trivial reliable third-party sources at my library have turned up nothing, let alone anything that suggests notability. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 07:40, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - You misunderstood the Comics Buyers Guide review I referred to. What I referred to was <a href="http://www.cbgxtra.com/default.aspx?tabid=42&amp;view=topic&amp;forumid=56&amp;postid=352" class="external text" title="http://www.cbgxtra.com/default.aspx?tabid=42&amp;view=topic&amp;forumid=56&amp;postid=352" rel="nofollow">this index of Comics Buyers Guide reviews</a> that lists Sore Thumbs Election Special 2004 as a previously reviewed title in said print magazine (the review itself does not appear to be available for viewing on the internet). Secondly, the Sore Thumbs book you link to is not yet published (despite Amazon's incorrect publication date), and to call it "self-published" is (arguably) somewhat of a misnomer, as its publisher (Keenspot) is only partially owned and run by Crosby. Past events indicate that he is in far from full control of what Keenspot publishes, such as his failed attempt to get his brother's comic "Pumpkin" accepted by Keenspot's board of directors, among other comics. 66.35.99.183 05:19, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. Which I think is unfortunate, but there it is. First of all, a goodly number of editors were kind enough to comment. The raw vote total by my count is 13-7 Delete. That's not counting a "Keep only if expanded and modified" - since there's no guarantee that this will happen, that's probably more a Delete than A Keep, but I didn't count it either way. Two of the Keeps were Weak, as was one of the Deletes. Granting that AfD is not a vote, when 20+ editors comment with 2/3 in one camp, that has to be taken into account.</p>
<p>A couple of notes: first, the fact this this person <i>was</i> a crank counts against him, for this reason: his work is not and cannot be the basis for any later research. He's a complete dead end. Thus he's never going to <i>gain</i> any more notability than he already has. So that's a point against him. Second, the article as it stands is mostly copyvio and must go. (You can use short passages for illustrative purposes, not glom whole paragraphs to create the body of an article. This doesn't really bear on this AfD either way, though.</p>
<p>Now on to the arguments. A synopsis of each Keep editor's comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>'"Seems to pass WP:BIO" <i>(but not further elucidated)</i></li>
<li><i>"probably passes the professor test on the basis of having published more material than the average college professor"</i> (but it is not clear if he has, although it's not clear that he hasn't)</li>

<li><i>"Juergens' co-authors to The Velikovsky Affair Alfred de Grazia and Livio Stecchini both appear notable, as does the subject of the Affair, Immanuel Velikovsky."</i> (but de Grazia at least appears to have many other accomplishments, and the notability of the subject of one's work is not really germane)</li>
<li><i>"[Arguments] that an article on an unconventional scientific theory cannot be notable because the unconventional theory does not find support in the conventional literature is at best tautolgical and at worst insidious censorship"</i> (but this does not really address the issue at hand (notability), nor does this editor's later comments)</li>

And <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> is mostly cited for articles about someone's professor. Here's a guy dead 30 years and someone wanted to write a highly researched article about him. He's around halfway to meeting the 100-year test right there.</p>
<p>Basically, it seems that this article hangs on Juergen's co-authorship of The Velikovsky Affair. There's no question in my mind that The Velikovsky Affair <i>is</i> notable. Is Juergens's 1/3 authorship of that book sufficient for his inclusion?</p>
<p>No, not as I see it. The 13-7 supermajority clinches it. (A shame, because I think we ought to have the article, but there you have it.) <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:39, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm willing to reconsider, but it brings up an interesting point: just how much does the average college professor publish? Thus far, the professor test is somewhat subjective since it is defended on the basis of someone's subjective opinion of whether someone publishes more or less. Some concrete information on this would be helpful! Incidentally, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> does not state that the professor test is based only upon publications made only in peer-reviewed journals, although I can see why one might wish to interpret it that way. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 20:50, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> It depends on subject, but one can attain tenure &amp; Associate professor rank in most colleges with 3 or 4 articles, if at least 1 is in a major journal. At Ph.D. -granting research universities the requirement is much higher, depending on the university--but the difference is quality, not quantity. In most fields, top universities do not go by quantity. But the test says merely an academic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But read it again--WP:Prof is a guideline, not policy, and the test as it stands makes no reference to number of papers written, no matter of how high their quality. It requires that they be written about, that is, cited. The frequency again depends on field. The average article gets 1 cite, and there is no WP specification for how many more are needed, but I think a tenurable person at a college would have at least a few articles with more than 5 or 10 cites--in most science fields, including this one. Below that is definitely not notable. There's an active discussion on the criteria, and no consensus whatsoever.</p>
<p>In this case RJ has published no papers whatsoever in the mainstream literature. Therefore he is not a scientist, notable or otherwise, and should not be judged under this test. Zero is certainly not notable, and non peer-reviewed papers are simply not considered RS in this context--especially when ALL of them are not even mainstream non-peer-reviewed. (and no evidence that his work, whatever it may be thought to be, has been written about except in self published souces.)</p>
<p>He has no graduate degree either, only a BS. A BS by itself does not make someone a scientist.-there is no requirement for conventional graduate education, and a BS and notable published peer-reviewed work would certainly count. But he has zero peer-reviewed work in physics or astonomy journals. He is simply not a scientist. If he is to be notable, it must be on other grounds.</p>
<p>The electric universe article was judged non-notable, so he must be judged on the basis of the first paragraph alone, whether he is a notable supporter of Velikovsky. He does not seem to be, having written only one non self-published article on the subject. Therefore a<br />

Whereas, to me that would be censorship, and I think wikipedia should have have a concise mention of the idea in question, and explain that mainstream science rejects it.

<dd>The idea that Velikovsky has an "ongoing legacy" is fairly contentious. He does not receive the media attention he once enjoyed when Sagan was all the rage. Certainly the electric universe and Ralph Jeurgens do not seem to rise to the level of notability in popular culture which is all that is left since (I think) we agree that these subjects defy scientific notability. It may be that Ralph Jeurgens can be mentioned at the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Velikovsky_1537.html#.22The_Velikovsky_Affair.22" title="Immanuel Velikovsky">Immanuel Velikovsky#"The Velikovsky Affair"</a> section but to insist that he be a biographical subject in his own right or that the Electric Sun/Electric Universe articles be subjects in their own right doesn't seem to have any justification. They just don't seem to be notable enough. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 20:34, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

(Maybe the sections could be merged with other articles, except that the Electric Universe article is now deleted.) Deletion makes me think of a witch-hunt. Do we really have to drown this stuff entirely, so in the future it will seem not to have existed? Can't we just hang a sign around its neck to indicate that mainstream science either ignores it or holds it in low regard? I am not suggesting that those arguing for deletion have bad intentions, because, as far as I know, those who pursued "witches" had perfectly good intentions. Its just that deletion seems over-the-top - it is less informative and more destructive than keeping the article in some form with some notes to guard against a naive reader thinking the theory is more highly regarded than it actually is. Also, perhaps, a note that Kronos does not meet WP's criteria for scientific notability because it is not a mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journal. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Whittle_fb98.html" title="User:Robin Whittle">Robin Whittle</a> 01:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

On the other hand, most of the individuals in question have copious amounts of time in which to sing the praise of their ideas, and rebuke the unfaithful with yet more praise and misunderstanding.

<dd>Oh what a load of waffle, and from a self-professed sock puppet too! From time to time, people will go to wikipedia and type in "Electric universe" or maybe even "Ralph Jeurgens" (most likely led there by summat on <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Velikovsky_1537.html" title="Immanuel Velikovsky">Immanuel Velikovsky</a>). If the wiping-pseudoscience-off-the-face-of-the-interweb brigade get there way, wikipedia will just say "No article with that name exists", when it could quite easily have one or two paragraphs summarizing what the theory is and calmly noting how it is rejected by current mainstream science, all in compliance with the various necessary policies. It just makes for a less informative and useful encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 13:07, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's just the problem. We do not believe that we can have an article like that in compliance with policies, as I have described. If you would like to show that we are incorrect, then I would suggest that you create an article like the one you describe, and put it here. It is quite probable that if it were to be respectable while complying with policy, a significant number of these votes would change. That has happened before in these cases. Furthermore, please note that, as I said, I am a sock puppet only on a technicality, since the definition of the term in policy is very different from the meaning that most people understand and expect. With the policy definition, for example, many administrators are sock puppeteers (all bots are sock puppets). --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 18:40, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, a cynic might note that since the eradicate-pseudoscience-from-wikipedia brigade seem so deeply versed in what does and doesn't constitute compliance with wikipolicies, they should find it relatively easy to lobotomize any article into compliance... conversely, having checked out the behaviour of some of these characters on wikipedia in recent times (I note Science Apologist was before the arbitration committee not so long ago...), I'd be reluctant to spend the time editing something only to have it all just erased by that lot.

To be honest though: I feel that you yourself make things personal, because of your self-professed antipathy to what you deem "pseudoscience". When other editors read your comments, despite them being packed full of diligent references to various wikipolicies, it is all too easy to think "here is a guy with an agenda".

<dd>It is my opinion that nearly all of these articles are neither verifiable <i>or</i> notable. I don't consider notability to be an important point of Wikipedia policy, and instead think that verifiability and neutral point of view obviate the need for notability restrictions in most cases, including these. For a response to your reply to my last comment, I will agree that we are deeply versed in Wikipedia policy, and know enough to understand that we cannot create articles of this sort that comply with the policy. There have been attempts by some of us to change the policy in the past to allow for proper coverage of topics like these, but they haven't been accepted, in part because they would require changes in the non-negotiable fundamentals of Wikipedia. As for ScienceApologist being before the Arbitration committee recently, that is of little detriment to his character: requests for arbitration against decent editors are often created by pseudoscientist supporters, who often then find that the process backfires. I am currently a party in arbitration as well, for example, by my own choice.

<p>The subject of the article is a young actress who has so far only appeared in one movie where she is a minor named character; this does not sufficiently pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for an actor/actress. Internet searchs provide nothing reliable besides mention of her minor role in <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_of_Rock_0488.html" title="School of Rock">School of Rock</a>. The page has also been subject to extraneous and trivial information added by IPs. If reliable, third party sources can be provided that further her notability, this shouldn't be a problem. I have not problem with there being a page if and/or when she takes part in more movies, or at least a larger role in a notable one. -- <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoeron_c492.html" title="User:Moeron"><font color="darkblue" size="2" face="Constantia"><b>moe.RON</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoeron_169b.html" title="User talk:Moeron"><b><font color="red"><i>Let's talk</i></font></b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Moeron_ba14.html" title="Special:Contributions/Moeron"><b><font color="green"><i>done</i></font></b></a></sup> 19:09, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think it should stay, for various reasons. Firstly, she has more than a few lines in these films, and I'm sure people would like to search up on her! As well as this, she is likely to be in films more in the future, meaning that her popularity is only going to improve, and then this will already be here, like it should anyway with her being an actress. And she isn't that minor at all really. I can't really explain it too well, so I'm not making it sound as good as it really is, but it should really stay here though, and a lot of people do actually like her also!</li>

<li>I think it should stay. Wikipedias goal is to have as much knowlege as possible correct? Well by deleting this it would limit the knowlege and show decreases. Plus if you look back on any actors or actresses career a lot of them do one commericial when they are 11 then stay out of Hollywood until they are 22 (finished University) then they work there way up to the top with smaller roles than this. She had around 20 somelines which is pretty big, plus she had to act without roles constinatnly. For example; when she Was listening to Zach's song, or when she was with Franky when he told Miss Mullens "your the man", or how she had to act enthusiastic at the end. She may not have been the star of the scenes but imagine Zach singing to nobody "that would be weird". Ok, directors will also most likely use her as tributes to Schoool of Rock. This can boost her popularity tremendously and thus make her the next Star. And wouldn't want you to have her a site on WP when that happens?

<li>No, Wikipedia's goal is <i>not</i> to have "as much knowledge as possible". That's why we have a policy about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, guidelines about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and a whole list of things (policy again) that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. We don't (for example) want articles about <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">things made up in school one day</a>, even though that is, technically, knowledge. Anyway, the verifiability policy means that we're not "limiting knowledge", because everything in Wikipedia has to be traceable to other sources, which means the information is still available. If you want to create a fan page, there are plenty of free hosting services out there that will allow you to do so, but Wikipedia is not the place for it. As I said, I loved the movie, and thought Ms. Afflerbach did a fine job in it, but until she actually <i>becomes</i> "the next Star", she shouldn't have a Wikipedia page. But she can certainly have as many fan pages <i>elsewhere</i> as the traffic will bear. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 21:15, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I say we keep the page and merge it with other the Other School of Rock Groupie to make a "school of Rock groupie page" or you give her or her fan base several days to create a fan hosting page which when created will be given 2 days on wikipedia saying this site has been moved away from wikipedia to a new website. Then after the 2 days delete the site. Again the merge is preferable but creating a free hosted site is quiet easy. And me and my collegues would be willing to help create and run it.

<li>I rekon this page should be kept. I agree that in the future, and even now, she will get bigger as a star, and therefore it would be better if the article was kept, and a lot of people seem to like her in SOR, where her part is definitely what I wouldn't call small! It's important, and really, quite big, it just ain't one of the main ones, but they're not just the big ones, and more importantly, they're not just the important ones. Veronica is an important one, and an important person. I reckon it should be kept on Wikipedia like it is now. I know she ain't the biggest of stars (yet, at least), but that can, and probably will, change as the time continues; Wikipedia is good for finding things out, and I actually am very surprised it's up for possible deletion. Something like this must surely be here. I say keep, for sure! And although this is just one entry, it's the opinion of many of us, here at the college.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think it deserves to be deleted. Her role in the movie is very peripheral. If she was one of the main characters then you can argue that an article about her should exist.

<li><b>Delete</b> This doesn't seem to be even a neologism, but a protologism.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I had never heard this term before today, despite being an avid gamer, and a regular magazine/website reader.

<li><i>Comment</i>: While the nomination reason isn't valid, that doesn't mean the article itself is fine.

<ul>
<li>I am sorry, but a bad nomination reason is still a bad nomination reason. If an article is going to be nominated, there should be a high responsibility to make sure you have a proper reason. If you can't articulate it, then ask someone else for help. At the least, picking insulting and demeaning language is highly inappropriate. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:24, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is the nominator's responsibility to outline the reason for deletion, but the nominator's phrasing is not definitive nor is it final. The whole point of the deletion debate process is to gather more opinions on the value of an article, and in most cases the resulting debate expands on the original nomination, as is the case here. A bad nomination reason does not automatically make the article a good one. What you're doing is disagreeing with the nomination using a deletion debate version of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. Just because you don't like the nomination doesn't mean the debate isn't valid. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 05:30, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not a matter of not liking the nomination, it's a matter of not accepting the nomination when done so poorly. I'm not saying anything about the article per se (I actually think it would best be a sub-section of some large Warcraft article), but I do find myself forced to reject the initial action. And while fostering discussion may be important, it's less likely to happen when you start it off poorly. I see at least two opinions expressed that don't even have an iota of reasoning behind them. Maybe you should say something about that? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:26, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What's there to say? The nominator put forward an argument you don't like, we put forward arguments that are more relevant. Just because the nomination doesn't refer to any policy doesn't mean the whole process is invalid. Why don't you put forward your own valid argument instead of "I don't like the nominator's argument"? --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 14:34, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have offered my rebuttal to comments that this is OR. You even replied to me. What more do you want me to do? If you want a stronger argument, I don't much care. My initial concern was that the process was tainted by a poor nomination. That remains a problem. So are the bad arguments spoken by others. I can accept that people who think this is OR have a valid (if mistaken concern). That includes you. Other people? not so much. Do I really care about this article? Not so much. I think it would be better done in the articles on the subjects in question, rather than one base article. Still doesn't mean I can't speak out against bad nomination reasons. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:35, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your responses to our OR concerns are fair enough. I'm pointing out that your initial post was a Keep because you didn't like the nomination rather than the article's merits. If you had intended otherwise, it certainly was not conveyed in that contribution. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 14:00, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not a matter of not liking the nomination, that implies I have some interest in the page, a more accurate description is I don't like the nomination reasons given. This would apply regardless of the subject. I suppose I could have been more verbose, so I'm sorry if that confused you. Whether the article should be kept or not, well, I don't have the opinion that there's anything sufficiently wrong with this article that warrants deletion. Clean-up yes, diffusion elsewhere? Maybe. But deletion? Nope, don't see it. And like it or not, I'm not going to look for reasons to delete an article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:00, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia does not consider itself to be a credible source, so naturally other Wikis would also be considered the same.

<li>If you can demonstrate where the source given is wrong on this thing, then that would be something, but just saying "NOR!" when it's another site doing the research? Doesn't make sense.

They think that American history (and English history before America) can be divided into distinct generations, each of which has a distinct archetype, be it 'Hero', 'Artist', 'Nomad', or 'Prophet'. It sounds like cobblers, and most of the articles are wholly uncritical.</p>
<p>I'm nominating this particular article for deletion principally because it's a <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">non-notable</a> <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>, confined to the books of Strauss and Howe.

<li><b>Keep</b>. <s>The William Strauss and Neil Howe books are influential, published by mainstream publishers, and the names they use for each generation are in some use outside of the context of just Strauss and Howe fans. At worst this is comparable to having articles on each Star Trek or South Park episode, what some might consider "fancruft". That and the characterization of the authors as "lifestyle gurus" doesn't reflect well on this nomination.</s> The article does need some work and expansion, starting with an explanation of where the term originated and who coined it. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 01:26, 6 January 2007 (UTC) Interesting, googling turns up that this is not a Strauss and Howe term. Strauss and Howe use the name <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilded_Generation_294a.html" title="Gilded Generation">Gilded Generation</a> for this generation. "Abolitionist Generation" does appear to be in some use though.

In any case, since this is not a Strauss and Howe term, it is even less notable than before.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Nydas, I think you are right that there are serious issues with this whole series of articles. All the "names" for generations are or were <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologisms.html" title="Neologisms">neologisms</a>, though some have clearly become sufficiently notable for articles (e.g. Greatest generation). Some of the names are basically Strauss and Howe inventions, others are more widely used, and still others are somewhere in between. This one appears to be somewhere in between - I found more mentions of the term in respected sources -<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_26/b3789048.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_26/b3789048.htm" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> <a href="http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:_i3_qbYCOdEJ:www.usc.edu/schools/college/politicalscience/gillman/documents/klarman_rethinking_000.doc+%22Abolitionist+Generation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=66" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:_i3_qbYCOdEJ:www.usc.edu/schools/college/politicalscience/gillman/documents/klarman_rethinking_000.doc+%22Abolitionist+Generation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=66" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. It seems to me that the whole panorama of generation name related articles needs to be cleaned up, perhaps centered around an improved <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_generations.html" title="List of generations">List of generations</a> article. Some of the content from this article could be merged there. It's a can of worms that may be better resolved through a process other than AfD.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 23:37, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Those two sources just use the term in passing, though. It's also unlikely that they refer to 'abolitionist generation' as defined in this article, with a strict start and end date. 'Thatcher generation' gets almost as many Ghits, and includes plenty of respected sources using the term. They're both just a stock phrases, like Red armchair or Second hand car, and not worth including in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>As for the Strauss and Howe generations, I'm concerned that articles on commonly used terms like <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generation_X_5b7c.html" title="Generation X">Generation X</a> are dominated by their perspective. I agree that a list might be more appropriate than a series of articles.--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 14:29, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't disagree with you, and I have no heartburn about seeing this article deleted. My larger point is that deleting this one article will do little towards cleaning up the larger morass of the generations articles. If you are using this as a first step towards a larger cleanup, then you have my wholehearted support. It seems to me that the article on the Strauss and Howe book should be expanded a bit to include a little info on each of "their" generational definitions - there's no need to have separate articles for each.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 15:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Re-reading the above discussion, I recalled that "abolitionist generation" is not even the Straus and Howe name for this generation. Therefore, I agree that this needs to be deleted as an insufficiently sourced and notable neologism. At most, it could be listed as one name on the "List of generations". I still hope that some bold editor(s) will tackle the current generations scheme and template.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 16:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have now edited the article to place more emphasis on the media speculation. It's an undeniable, sourceable fact that five high level posts related to the Iraq war are being changed, that the press is reporting on a "surge" and that in the many NOTABLE sources cited above ALL sources use the words "new way forward" to describe this series of initiatives. Whether or not a speech happens, it is clear that the Bush administration is leading the press to use the words "New Way Forward" or "The New Way Forward" with respect to these changes. Please reread the article and reconsider. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 21:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's the second time that you have asked me to reconsider, and for a second time, I will say Delete. So, it is confirmed that this is going to be the title for Bush's speech. But the contents of the speech are only speculation, as I said above. Wait until Bush does his speech, and THEN write the article. You said above "I have now edited the article to place more emphasis on the media speculation.", when it's the speculation that we are trying to avoid. Wait until Bush makes his speech, and THEN make the article. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 21:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>but what about the <b>contents</b> of the stragegy change? It is abundantly clear (to the media-- i.e., independent citeable sources) that these changes are already taking place... the series of initiatives listed in the article. If you are suggeesting a name changes that is one thing, but to delete the article is to delete perfectly good (and sourced)content.

<dd>Clearly a bad faith comment, MPS, and I expect you to retract it. This has nothing to do with "trying to hide" anything, and completely with trying to keep propaganda and speculation out of an <i>encyclopedia</i>. If you want to write your or other people's speculations on a blog somewhere, that is certainly your right, but we expect encyclopedia articles, not somebody's expectations. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 22:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not a bad faith comment; just frustration coming out, and for acting on this frustration I do apologize. Re: the topic, I have two responses....(1) These opinions aren't just opinions (the annouced personnel changes aren't opinions... the term "new way forward" is not some opinion I made up or the media made up -- it was introduced used by Bush to describe his coming changes, and reinforced by his subsequent press secretary statements at whitehouse.gov) the media is reporting on this set of changes with more than speculations, more than just opinions. (2) The WSJ, Time magazine, reuters, USA Today, and CBS News are not just "some people" as you suggest.

<dd>The sources cited <b>are most certainly</b> reliable sources. Let me put this into terms similar to the earlier football analogy. Lets say experts predict that Eagles will win. We cannot state that the Eagles will win as a matter of fact, but we can state that experts predict the Eagles will win the Superbowl in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XLI_893d.html" title="Super Bowl XLI">Super Bowl XLI</a>. Thats what is being done in regards to the commentary. But not all of the information is speculation, neither in this article or in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XLI_893d.html" title="Super Bowl XLI">Super Bowl XLI</a>. For instance, the date has been officially announced, the logo has been officially announced, the location has been officially announced. The fact that <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XLI_893d.html" title="Super Bowl XLI">Super Bowl XLI</a> has not yet happened does not keep us from having an article on it, does not keep us from stating the information we know, and does not keep us from stating information that is being speculated in reliable sources. The situation for the New Way Forward, or any other subject matter, is no different.

<dd>Well Zoe, your stance has moved from thing to thing and reached a point where its merely your perspective and not actually an argument meant to change peoples minds. The simple fact is that a lot of people are talking about it, its a speech thats going to happen, its a policy thats going to be implemented. We can only create articles for future events when we are quite certain that this said event will occur - and we are quite certain this event will occur. Please read the guideline again where it clarifies this. As for what will be said, what changes will occur, all we have are breif statements and things that the media expects. We can, and most certainly should represent these things as they are, expected announcements. We wont know if they are right or wrong till it happens, so we wont say they are right or wrong, we will just say that these are what the experts are expecting, or what the government has said thus far. ~<b><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">Rangeley</span></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERangeley_d899.html" title="User talk:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">talk</span></a>)</b> 00:26, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think your method is wrong. First, you should search on "new way forward"... second... CNN website search comes up with blogs, but that seems to be a failure of the way news websites do searches. When I do a "<a href="http://news.google.com/advanced_news_search?svnum=10&amp;as_scoring=r&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wn&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=&amp;as_mind=7&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_maxd=6&amp;as_maxm=1&amp;q=%22new+way+forward%22+source:new_york_times" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/advanced_news_search?svnum=10&amp;as_scoring=r&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wn&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=&amp;as_mind=7&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_maxd=6&amp;as_maxm=1&amp;q=%22new+way+forward%22+source:new_york_times" rel="nofollow">google news search</a>" of CNN, this turns up many articles, as seen <a href="http://news.google.com/news?svnum=10&amp;as_scoring=r&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=%22new+way+forward%22+source%3Acnn&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?svnum=10&amp;as_scoring=r&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=%22new+way+forward%22+source%3Acnn&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>My bad. But in all seriousness, I'd like to end this debate in a way that makes everybody happy. To do that, I think there are a couple things that need to be said: what you want in the article, what I want in the article (along with anybody else), and a way that we can incorporate those two (or more) things in the article. The only problem I have with this article is the abundance of media crap, to put it bluntly. Even the better links you provided above are plauged with speculation (to quote one, "...House has refused to talk publicly about any of the decisions that Mr. Bush has made about his plan, which is tentatively entitled “A New Way Forward"..."). I would support not doing anything with this article until the speech is done, and then write the article, as I have said a couple times before above. Comments? Concerns? Let's work together here, not against each other. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 00:57, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>PTO... let me first start my comment with a degree of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilove_b832.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilove">wikilove</a>...by saying that I have absolutely no ill will towards you or anyone else leaning towards a delete vote. My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Wikistress3D_1_v3.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Wikistress3D_1_v3.jpg" rel="nofollow">wiki-stress</a> level is now set to copacetic, and I respect your opinion even if I disagree with it. The reason we call these <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Article for Deletion</a> instead of <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">Vote For Deletion</a> is because this is not just a vote but a discussion... among equals. Viva Wikipedia!!! Group Hug!!! <b>Secondly</b> I want to respond to the content of your post by saying that the subject of discussion is <b>whether</b> there is notable content here. The discussion over <b>how</b> to frame and present the notable content is better left to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_New_Way_Forward_00bc.html" title="Talk:The New Way Forward">Talk:the New Way Forward</a>, a page that is at present red-linked. If you agree that there is subject matter here worth writing about, then change your opinion to <b>Keep</b> IMHO, we can mercilessly edit the media links as better ones emerge. If you think there is grounds for deletion, you need to be clear about why... I think I have shown that the article documents the verifiable political <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/machination" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/machination" rel="nofollow">machinations</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intimation" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intimation" rel="nofollow">intimations</a> that have occurred prior to the speech, and the natural starting point for this narrative is the Nov 2006 Democratic Takeover, followed by the progressively higher profile meetings that the president has held leading up to his often-promised speech. The section on "the Speech" was deliberately left empty because we don't know what he is going to say, only that many of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec20/0,4670,BushText,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec20/0,4670,BushText,00.html" rel="nofollow">his actual recent speeches</a> have alluded to an upcoming "new way forward" plan to change the situation in Iraq. In short, believe I have made the case for preservation of the article, and I agree that the links and references should be mercilessly edited (per <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>) as further information emerges.

<dd>I changed my vote to conditional keep. Doing some homework and reading the links you posted has revealed to me that the term is more of a blanket term than I thought...originally, I believed that the article was only going to be on the speech. Therefore, I've found that the article does have redeeming value, and I am willing to keep it if we don't use any media sources to speculate on what Bush's speech will be on.

<p>PTO and MPS – Thank you both for your most recent posts. I think they’re certainly moving this discussion in the right direction. I wanted to return to a question raised earlier by JWSchmidt that seems to me to be a threshold issue in the deletion debate. That is, does this topic merit a stub? Would you two (or anyone else reading this page) be willing to agree that the New Way Forward is a media title for potential changes to Bush’s Iraq strategy? If the answer is no, then there should not be a stub, let alone an article. Only if the answer is yes should we shift the discussion to the content of the article – and, as MPS suggests, that discussion might be better conducted in the Talk forum.

<dd>Wikipedians are omniscient :D. We have had a few threads on you all at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. Back on topic, though, after thinking this one through and doing a little homework, I've found that this warrants at least a stub discribing Bush's opposition about his Iraq policy and his promise to deliver a new plan. However, I still feel that the media garbage about Bush's speech should be left out until they can produce something that isn't just an educated guess. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 02:21, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We can state it as mass media speculation, we just cant pass it out as truth. There is wide speculation that there will be surge, for instance, in troop numbers.

<dd>Sean, it's a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">wikipedia:stub</a> only because the content is partially there, not because the article is only partially merited. I think the many (NYT, Fox NEws, CNN, Time magazine) google citations I gave to PTO above establish that the media lumps Bush's strategy change under the <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubric.html" title="Rubric">rubric</a> of "New Way Forward." In short, yes, I believe the content is there to merit an article. IMHO It's a stub for now because we all recognize there's still more research to be done. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 20:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your comment seems to be phrased as if you don't expect a clear topic to be identified. This article is about the very public Bush response to the Iraq Study Group that he has repeatedly referred to as a "new way forward in iraq". Bush has consulted several conservative think tanks and high level officials and promised a speech that most of the mainstream press reports indicate will propose a <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=troop%20%22surge.%22%20%20&amp;btnG=Search&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=troop%20%22surge.%22%20%20&amp;btnG=Search&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" rel="nofollow">troop "surge."</a> I mean we could call it proposed troop surge of 2007 but that's a matter for <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_New_Way_Forward_00bc.html" title="Talk:The New Way Forward">talk:The New Way Forward</a> to sort out, not AFD. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 20:37, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>
<ul>
<li>Even though it is a speculation, the speculation has congealed as a thing of its own. Don't we want wikipedia to include famous media speculations (e.g. predictions of who will run for president)? In other words, a significant speculation can be viewed as a news event in itself. If it turns out to be wrong, that update should also be added to the page.</li>
<li>This page is useful for people who hear the term on the news and don't know what it is. Is there any rule about including pages that are useful?Bobrudin 16:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> – Even if there is currently uncertainty about the scope of this topic, there does seem to be a foundation of cited material and factual developments to justify the stub. More importantly, if Bush delivers this speech soon there may be many more people looking to read and edit this article. Abgb23 00:26, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but with reservations. I think it's silly to have an article about what some people think a not-yet happened speech will be about, but it does not seem to violate the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystal ball</a> rule because it is sufficiently documented in the press and it seems that the speech will happen in some form or another. As more details become clearer the article can be updated accordingly (but perhaps some of the sections, such as the personnel changes that may or may not be attributable to the New Way Forward speech/doctrine, are still to speculative for inclusion even if the article as a whole is sufficiently nonspeculative). I don't find any glaring neutrality issues, at least none that can't be cleaned up. And the bottom line to me is that by the time this debate settles on whether or not to delete the article the speech <i>will</i> have happened and then there will definitely be enough material for an article. But if, on the other hand, a couple weeks go by and it becomes clear that the New Way Forward speech will in fact not go forward, then there is certainly a strong argument to delete the article (as opposed to keeping it, and having the article be about the media speculation of a speech that never was).

<p>Reading the comments above, it sounds to me like the arguments for deletion are two fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) <b>Neutrality:</b> The positive phrase "The New Way Forward" seems to endorse the Bush Administrations policies and is therefore not neutral.</li>
<li>2) <b>Speculation:</b> The speech "The New Way Forward" is in the future and not certain to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you all think about trying to address these concerns by making some changes to the article? To make the article more <b>neutral</b>, perhaps the article could include a small section describing--but not endorsing--criticism (by opposition politicians, people in the media, etc.) of the new strategy and/or the phrase itself? To make the article less <b>speculative</b>, perhaps the focus of the article could be on "The New Way Forward" as a policy or strategy rather than a speech. As others have pointed out, parts of the strategy associated with "The New Way Forward" have already been implemented, and are therefore no longer speculative. The article could still mention that the President is expected to lay out the details of this new policy in a speech. --3L Senioritis 19:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm... How do I say this... I appreciate your proposal, 3L. But ... there is already an expectation at wikipedia that this article is going to improve over time (become more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) as editors weigh in with new sourced content. Any wikipedia article becomes more neutral over time. The AFD page is a discussion of whether the article should exist at all. This article <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a> is less than 72 hours old. If you want to suggest neutrality improvements and <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPage_move_167f.html" title="Wikipedia:Page move">title changess</a>, I will start this discussion at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_New_Way_Forward_00bc.html" title="Talk:The New Way Forward">Talk:The New Way Forward</a>. In the mean time, <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and feel free to update the content as you see fit. As for the discussion on <b>wikipedia:speculation</b> and the merits of this article even existing (IOW, this AFD), I really believe that the article currently documents quality information on Bush's publicly advertised Iraq strategy change (nicknamed "new way forward" ). IMHO, it's solidly referenced content about actually occurring historical events ... and for that reason I think it's not <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - After hearing and reading the speech and reading and hearing comments about the speech, I find the article to be an unfocused mess that misinforms and is unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 09:30, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>IMHO, It is absurd that we have not closed this vote yet. There very obviously <b>was</b> a speech last night, and it did lay out Bush's new strategy in iraq based on criticisms made by the Iraq Study Group. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=in&amp;q=New+Way+Forward" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=in&amp;q=New+Way+Forward" rel="nofollow">As evidenced by press reports</a> many refer to this as Bush's "New Way Forward" speech. The name is immaterial. If the article is unfocused, then edit it to make it better. As far as content, most everyone would acknowledge that this was a hugely notable speech about a hugely notable policy change, so why are we talking about deleting the article? If you want to page move this to Bush's speech announcing his new Iraq strategy January 2007 then talk about that on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_New_Way_Forward_00bc.html" title="Talk:The New Way Forward">Talk:The New Way Forward</a>. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 16:37, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The title of the article is inappropriate for the title of an article about the speech and the article has very little to do with the speech (being written before the speech might have something to do with that) so that a speech was given means nothing as the speech and the article have little in common. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 17:18, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The speech and the strategy change were both formulated prior to January 10. The article cites sources to trace the development of the strategy change as it developed.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now - At this present time, this is a really hot topic, and seems to be talked about widly in American media right now.

<li><b>Keep</b> but why not rename it? If it sounds like Wikipedia would be <b>endorsing</b> Bush policy by using the White House's name for his policy change, try to think of a more neutral article title. But don't delete it while there's a link to it on the Current Events page. But surely we have articles on anti-Bush (or Democratic Party initiatives) which have similar titles. We need a policy for describing government initiatives whose offical titles have a positive spin. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 18:35, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Typical Countdown octochamp that has not seemed to transcend the boundaries of the show in terms of receiving major press coverage, nor has he broken a major record on the show. He also does not seem to be notable for any non-Countdown endeavors.

<li><b>Um.</b> There is a big, huge, titanic, enormous problem with this article: the hypothesis has zero basis in peer-reviewed research. 100% of the sources are conspiracy theory websites, whose reliability is slightly below that of an alcoholic crack addict. Why are there no rebuttals in the professional journals? Because the professional journals, without exception, treat the theory as the twaddle it clearly is and won't give it house room. But it <i>has</i> got a lot of coverage in the popular press, albeit again mostly borderline incredulity. I'd say it needs drastic pruning and the lead needs to eb rewritten to reflect the fact that nobody who had not already made their mind up has lent any support to this nonsense. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article documents a social phenomenon - that of the facts of the hypothesis and the existence of the hypothesis. It does not argue for the hypothesis, nor does it argue against it. It simply, correctly and competently documents it as a hypothesis that exists. The topic is suitable for encyclopaedic coverage and the article simply gives it that. There was a certain inevitability that, as soon as a <a href="../../../p/e/e/WP%7EPeer_Review_1eff.html" title="WP:Peer Review">WP:Peer Review</a> was asked for, someone would take the opportunity to propose it for deletion. There is no issue with that since an AfD is, in many ways, a review process. However it is important to make the distinction between the article which documents the demolitionists' hypothesis, which this handles correctly, and the hypothesis itself. A correct and encyclopaedic article, which this strives to be, documents that citable facts of the existence of the hypothesis without either validating or invalidating that hypothesis. The article needs to be judged on the merits of how it handles the topic - a notable, well reported topic - not on the merits of the various opinions people have about the truth or otherwise behind the destruction of the buildings. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 22:48, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The comment "POV Fork" in the nomination is incorrect. The article was created as a <b>content fork</b>, which is a valid, recommended and documented procedure when the parent article has grown too long, and the content which formed it was deleted from the parent article. As for trolls and POV pushers, as someone who has been working on the article itself while absolutely not supporting any thoughts about controlled demolition being respinsible for the destruction of the buildings, I do find that comment rather hard to swallow.

I would not support this hypothesis on the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> page, but there is a small fringe group which support this theory, and which have written a lot of articles supporting the theory.</dd>

<dd>I think these editors who disagree with this theory should spend there time adding condemnations about this theory on the wikipage, instead of attempting to silence these conspiracy theorists. This takes work and research though. It is much easier to simply delete ideas you disagree with, then researching why those ideas are fallacious and have no merit.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Exactly. Wikipedia does not operate on the basis of a single known truth - it operates on the basis of reporting verifyable facts. It is easily verifyable that the 9/11 conspiracy theorists include people who hold this opinion of what happened, and that they've written extensively about it. It's notable because enough people believe them. It would be neglegent of us not to report that people believe this, even if every single reasonable rational human being thinks that only crazy people think that way. We should (and do) report on the fringe opinions that we don't agree with; this is no exception. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 08:28, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - The references included don't seem to verify that the term is in general usage. The existence of one song doesn't make it a real slang term any more than "Polythene Pam" or "Mean Mr. Mustard". It is possible that a bit more work could remedy this, however. I found a couple other examples with a simple search, definitely better than footnote 5 (which is really stretching it). ANY reference from a slang dictionary would be welcome, whether general or specific to the U.K. I'm also not sure it means what the article says it means in most cases: it seems to be used as an adjective mostly, not a noun. (But who knows; maybe it will BECOME a term in use one day, like "Truthiness".) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 17:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I believe the answer to (1) is no. The phenomenon is real but not very well-defined or autonomous. The references seem more to prove the term exists than to define what precisely it means, who it is applied to, and by whom.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article should be about the phenomenon and not solely on the history/usage of the phrase, obviously, but it is easy for me to imagine that we'll have a reasonable encyclopedia article here, given the existence of academic writing on the subject. Have the people arguing for deletion missed the notes and references in the article?

<p>Looking at the old nomination, it looks like most of the "keep" arguments were based on content, rather than notability.

One final thing, VGMix's ability to "help less-established remixers get critiques on their work" will not be impaired by not having an article on Wikipedia (ie don't even try a <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> argument). <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 22:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> It doesn't <i>prove</i> anything, but it's suggestive in this case. The examples you cite can't really compare, 'Tescos' and 'Lidls' are examples of a well known brand names acquiring a colloquial variant. That clearly doesn't apply here. A more appropriate example might be <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Savile_05ef.html" title="Jimmy Savile">Jimmy Savile</a>/Saville - but he has the excuse of having an unusual variant of the name. Clearly Tweed hasn't yet entered the public consciousness enough for people (even newspapers, as you say) to realise he's not a Tweedy. I never heard of him before today, and I'm not completely ignorant of pop culture. It may yet transpire that this guy forges a genuine celebrity career for himself in the future thanks to Big Brother, but until that time he does not merit encyclopaedic recognition outside a Big Brother/Jade Goody article. 81.159.14.140 22:10, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I have seen some articles, for example <a href="../../../t/o/b/Toby_Cockerell_9025.html" title="Toby Cockerell">Toby Cockerell</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandy_Dingle_93f5.html" title="Mandy Dingle">Mandy Dingle</a> or Peggy Skillbeck. These are all one line articles. If they can have a topic he can.

<dd>Comment, I guess it is partially true for some of the year. The <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbit_of_the_Moon_a15f.html" title="Orbit of the Moon">Orbit of the Moon</a> of the moon is close to the <a href="../../../e/c/l/Ecliptic.html" title="Ecliptic">Ecliptic</a>, so as the Sun is not visiable during winter in the far north, it might be that the full-moon will be below the horizion in the summer. Still not canadian specific, could be worth including something in <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbit_of_the_Moon_a15f.html" title="Orbit of the Moon">Orbit of the Moon</a>. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 23:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The article, though, implies that the moon is <i>never</i> visible in those locations and any photographs showing it are forged, which is clearly untrue. I suppose the article could be rewritten to say that as opposed to flat deleted, but it's an unlikely search term in any event. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:00, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm in <a href="../../../o/u/l/Oulu.html" title="Oulu">Oulu</a> (65° North), and the Moon is clearly visible (at least often enough when I've actually had any chance to go out of this home of mine at dark when the moon is not new). I spent my childhood in <a href="../../../m/u/o/Muonio.html" title="Muonio">Muonio</a> (67°57' North) and I have hazy recollections of seeing moon there too-oo. I don't have photographic proof because the Moon is so difficult to photograph, regrettably, we wolves think it's so-oo beauuutiful. My hazy knowledge of geography and astronomy notwithstanding, I can't see why moon visibility in Canada would be any different because this planet tends to kind of rotate or something. Yeah, <i>obviously</i> you can't take just my word for it in a deletion debate, but let's just blatantly assume that this is a hoax that has to justify its truthfulness, let alone existence, via reliable sources. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
