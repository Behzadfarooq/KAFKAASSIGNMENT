<li>Thank you Jaime for this information. I may be free from having any reviews or awards, however, I am internationally known as I have assisted souls here on this earth globally with readings healings and so on, as well as, my books are sold and known all over the globe and this is what the statement means. My testimonials on my webpage clearly attest to this. If I am free from being indifferent to the great mass of other souls, then I invite you to read the global articles I have published which are found on ezine articles and children of the new earth magazine, both global publications.

<li><b>Comment</b> The deletion review is not meant to imply a judgement of accomplishments by an article's subject. Rather, Wikipedia has certain notability guidelines that subjects would hopefully meet. The one that best applies for this particular topic is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which provides guidelines for notability for individual people. If any of the listed guidelines can be met, WP policy requires that this be reflected in the subject's article with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">citations</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> What you wrote is considered here on this earth as slanderous and uncalled for. You are free to your views, yes, but not to the detriment of another, which is clearly what has been written by you, which is why I edited what you wrote. This really shows the kind of person that you are and if you are to call me a vandal it is only because who you believe I am being is a mirror of who you are being. And it seems this assessment is to be so considering if you go to your page here <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> people can read all about your vandalism, thus you are correct, the fact do speak for themselves. I stand by what I have written in all of my remarks here, editing yours and otherwise as again it is free from being about me vandalizing, as I am free from being so, I am merely assisting all souls on this earth. Even you who are here being invited to learn this life lesson or soul remembering through this exchange here. I used to be as you are choosing to be right now, and I am free from this any longer. Thank you for showing me who I used to be and who I am free from choosing to be any longer.
