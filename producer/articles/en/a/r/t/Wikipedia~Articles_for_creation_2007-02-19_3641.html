While in the fourth and fifth grades, Sydney participated in the FIRST Lego Robotics Mindstorm competition (aka First Lego League), an international contest for building and programming robots made entirely from Legos. Her team had won regionals both years and on the second year they came in 8th place in the state. However, Sydney did not continue the competition in middle school because her school did not have a team. In the sixth and seventh grades, Sydney was a member of the Lincoln Middle School Marching Band. While a member she had won the Esprit de Corps award. At her eighth grade graduation Sydney won one of the only two awards for excellence in History. In the school year of 2005-2006 (while a freshman at Alameda High), Sydney was a member of the Ala-Gators, a highly respected competitive swim team. This school year Sydney has continued her interest in swimming and has joined the school swim team. Alameda High School has a reputation for excellence in most sports, including swimming. Sydney has an extensive list extracurricular activities such as surfing, skiing, and wake boarding. Her current classes include AP European History, Advanced Algebra II, English II EXP, Physical Education, Honors Chemistry, and 3rd-yr Spanish. Planning to attend in 4yr university in the fall semester of 2009, she is looking towards UCLA, UCSD, UCSC, UCSB, or USC.</p>

<p>Sun Bowl- Oregon State Beavers 39, Missouri Tigers 38- The Beavers took a gamble, going for two after they had scored a touchdown that made the score 38-37 in the Tigers' favor in the final seconds. It paid off, and Oregon State used a 356 passing yard performance by Matt Moore to sneak past Missouri.</p>
<p>Liberty Bowl- South Carolina Gamecocks 44, Houston Cougars 36- In a shoot-out in Memphis, the Gamecocks won throught the efforts of QB Blake Mitchell, who threw for 323 yards and four touchdowns. His main targets were WRs Sidney Rice and Kenny McKinley, who combined for 251 receivng yards. Cougars QB Kevin Kolb threw for 386 yards, 201 of which went to wideout Vincent Marshall.</p>
<p>Insight Bowl- Texas Tech Red Raiders 44, Minnesota Golden Gophers 41- Down 38-7 near the end of the third quarter, Tech fought back in arguably the most dramatic finish of the bowl season. Led by quarterback Graham Harrell, who threw for 445 yards, the Red Raiders made it 38-35 with seconds to play.

<p>Meineke Bowl- Boston College Eagles 25, Navy Midshipmen 24- It seemed as if BC couldn't handle the Navy rushing attack, led by a 116 yard performance by Shun White, until the fourth quarter when QB Matt Ryan hit his stride, throwing for 242 yards on the day, and led BC to within two. Then, later, with time expiring, Steve Aponavicius hit a 37-yard field goal that gave the Eagles the win.</p>
<p>Alamo Bowl- Texas Longhorns 26, Iowa Hawkeyes 24- The heavily favored Longhorns stumbled at first, falling behind 14-0 early in the first quarter, but QB Colt McCoy regained his footing and wound up passing for 308 yards and two touchdowns to win it for Texas.</p>
<p>Chick-fil-a Bowl- Georgia Bulldogs 31, Virginia Tech Hokies 24- In another great comeback, Matthew Stafford, despite only passing for 129 yards, rallied the 'Dogs from a 21-3 deficit to win. The Georgia defense smothered the Hokies in the second half, allowing only three points.</p>
<p>MPC Computers Bowl- Miami(FL)Hurricanes 21, Nevada Wolfpack 20- In coach Larry Coker's final game, the 'Canes capped off a horrendous season with a bowl win on the "smurf turf" of Boise. Leading Miami were quarterback Kirby Freeman, who passed for 272 yards, and WR Sam Shields, who had 101 receiving yards.</p>
<p>Outback Bowl- Penn State Nittany Lions 20, Tennessee Volunteers 12- In a low-scoring defensive battle, PSU needed a big 158-yard rushing game from Tony Hunt and an 88-yard fumble return for a touchdown by cornerback Tony Davis to overcome the Volunteers.</p>
<p>Cotton Bowl- Auburn Tigers 17, Nebraska Cornhuskers 14- In another game with not much offense, Auburn RB Kenny Irons ran for 72 yards and WR Courtney Taylor had 70 receiving yards to give the Tigers a tough win over the Huskers.</p>
<p>Gator Bowl- West Virginia Mountaineers 38, Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets 35- In a game a lot closer than it should have been, QB Pat White rallied the Mountaineers back from a 35-17 Tech lead with out the help of star running back Steve Slaton. With Yellow Jacket QB Reggie Ball out, the game was supposed to be a breeze for WVU, but backup Taylor Bennett picked up the slack for GaTech, passing for 326 yards, 186 to WR Calvin Johnson. Unfortunately for the Yellow Jackets, so did FB Owen Schmitt, who filled Slaton's shoes well, rushing for 109 yards. White had 276 total yards for the Mountaineers, and Tech running back Tarshard Choice had 169 yards rushing.</p>
<p><br />
Capital One Bowl- Wisconsin Badgers 17, Arkansas Razorbacks 14- Tired of being underrated, Wisconsin used their defense to hold Arkansas to only 14 points, and let quarterback John Stocco throw for 206 yards, 82 to wideout Travis Becklum. The Razorbacks put up a good fight, with star RBs Felix Jones and Darren McFadden rush for 150 and 89 yards, respectively.</p>
<p>Rose Bowl- USC Trojans 32, Michogan Wolverines 18- In a battle that some said could have been the National Championship and the first of the BCS games, quarterback John David Booty smoked the Wolverine defense for 391 passing yards and four touchdowns, with WR Dwayne Jarrett catching two touchdowns and collecting 205 receiving yards, and WR Steve Smith getting 108 receving yards alongside him. Michigan QB Chad Henne threw for 309 yards and two touchdowns, but it wasn't enough to defeat a driven USC squad.</p>
<p>Fiesta Bowl- Boise State Broncos 43, Oklahoma Sooners 42- The Cinderella Broncos shocked Adrian Peterson and the Sooners after jumping ahead 14-0, then falling behind 35-28 on a Marcus Walker 33-yard interception return for a TD. With just over a minute left on the clock, BSU quarterback Jared Zabransky, who passed for three touchdowns and 262 yards, threw a fourth-down pass to Drisan James just short of the marker, who then pitched it back to Jerard Rabb, who ran it into the endzone with seconds left on the clock to tie the game. In overtime, Peterson, just recovered from a collarbone injury, ran for 25 of his 77 yards on a TD run, which put the Sooners up by seven. The Broncos faced fourth and goal after a few unsucessful plays, then gave the ball to WR Vinny Peretta who threw a perfect strike into the endzone to tie the game...but BSU elcted to go for two. Zabransky handed it to RB Ian Johnson, who went unouched into the end zone for the winning points. In the wackiest ending of the bowl season, besting even the Insight Bowl, Johnson ran for 101 yards.</p>
<p>Orange Bowl- Louisville Cardinals 24, Wake Forest Demon Deacons 13- Wake Forest was another Cinderella story, only this time the slipper didn't quite fit. Star Cardinal QB Brian Brohm passed for 311 yards, besting Wake's Riley Skinner's 271, and Louisville WR Harry Douglas caught ten passes for 165 yards. The Cardinals fell behind 13-10 early in the fourth quarter, but then Brohm stepped it up a notch and led Louisville to a win.</p>
<p>Sugar Bowl- LSU Tigers 41, Notre Dame Fighting Irish 14- JaMarcus Russell made a case for himself as the top quarterback entering the draft as he outperformed ND's Brady Quinn, passing for 332 yards. Also helping LSU's cause were RB Keiland Williams, who ran for 107 yards and two touchdowns, and wide receiver Early Doucet, who caught eight passes for 115 yards. One bright spot for Notre Dame was running back Darius Walker, who ran for 128 yards.</p>
<p>International Bowl- Cincinnati Bearcats 27, Western Michigan Broncos 24- In an abrupt break from BCS games before the national championship, Dominick Goodman caught seven passes, including two touchdowns, for 109 yards as Cincy held off a late WMU rally for the victory.</p>
<p>GMAC Bowl- Souther Miss Golden Eagles 28, Ohio Bobcats 7- In a rather one-sided game before the national championship, Southern Miss blew by the Bobcats led by three touchdowns form the running back duo of Tory Harrison and Damion Fletcher.</p>
<p>BCS Championship- Florida Gators 41, Ohio State Buckeyes 14- The "unbeatable" Buckeyes lost an embarassing game in which they held the lead only once---the first play of the game, a kickoff return for a touchdown by star WR Ted Ginn. However, when celebrating after the return, Ginn injured himself and was out for the rest of the game, seemingly taking the air out of OSU's attack. Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith passed for only 35 yards in a poor performance outshined by a good game b Chris Leak, who passed for 213 yards and a touchdown. The Florida Gators, who weren't even supposed to play in the BCS Championship---had won it.</p>

<p><b>Mia-Sophie Wellenbrink</b> (born <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_6.html" title="October 6">October 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>) is a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> child actress and singer. Since early 2005 she is the star of a series of TV commercials for the dairy <i>Müllermilch</i>.</p>
<p>Wellenbrink was born to actress Susanna Wellenbrink and ballet dancer Daniel Ramsbott. In late 2004 the <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavarian</a> dairy <i>Müllermilch</i> casted the six year old girl for the promotion of the fruit <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoghurt.html" title="Yoghurt">yoghurt</a> <i>Froop</i>. A first series of commercials was broadcasted in German and Austrian television from early 2005 on. Due to the popularity of the commercial a second and third series were produced in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>In the wake of her success Mia-Sophie's grandfather Egon Wellenbrink recorded with her the single <i>Fruchtalarm</i> in September 2005. The song is mainly based on the popular children's song <i><a href="../../../d/r/e/Drei_Chinesen_mit_dem_Kontrabass_61be.html" title="Drei Chinesen mit dem Kontrabass">Drei Chinesen mit dem Kontrabass</a></i>. Shortly after its release it entered the German and Austrian pop charts.</p>

DipZoom, Deep Internet Performance Zoom, is an approach to provide focused, on-demand Internet measurements. Unlike existing approaches that face a difficult challenge of building a measurement platform with sufficiently diverse measurements and measuring hosts, DipZoom offers a matchmaking service instead, which uses P2P concepts to bring together experimenters in need of measurements with external measurement providers. In the peer-to-peer spirit, DipZoom participants offer measurements for the benefit of being able to access measurements offered by other participants. In the future, we plan to add an extra incentive where participants would be able to sell their measurements rather than "barter" their service.</p>

<p>Sun Bowl- Oregon State Beavers 39, Missouri Tigers 38- The Beavers took a gamble, going for two after they had scored a touchdown that made the score 38-37 in the Tigers' favor in the final seconds.

<p>Liberty Bowl- South Carolina Gamecocks 44, Houston Cougars 36- In a shoot-out in Memphis, the Gamecocks won throught the efforts of QB Blake Mitchell, who threw for 323 yards and four touchdowns.

<p>Insight Bowl- Texas Tech Red Raiders 44, Minnesota Golden Gophers 41- Down 38-7 near the end of the third quarter, Tech fought back in arguably the most dramatic finish of the bowl season. Led by quarterback Graham Harrell, who threw for 445 yards, the Red Raiders made it 38-35 with seconds to play. Then, Alex Trilica hit a 5 yard field goal to force overtime and give Tech a chance at the win, which they wisely seized. HB Amir Pinnix added 179 yards rushing for the Gophers.</p>

<p>Meineke Bowl- Boston College Eagles 25, Navy Midshipmen 24- It seemed as if BC couldn't handle the Navy rushing attack, led by a 116 yard performance by Shun White, until the fourth quarter when QB Matt Ryan hit his stride, throwing for 242 yards on the day, and led BC to within two. Then, later, with time expiring, Steve Aponavicius hit a 37-yard field goal that gave the Eagles the win.</p>
<p>Alamo Bowl- Texas Longhorns 26, Iowa Hawkeyes 24- The heavily favored Longhorns stumbled at first, falling behind 14-0 early in the first quarter, but QB Colt McCoy regained his footing and wound up passing for 308 yards and two touchdowns to win it for Texas.</p>
<p>Chick-fil-a Bowl- Georgia Bulldogs 31, Virginia Tech Hokies 24- In another great comeback, Matthew Stafford, despite only passing for 129 yards, rallied the 'Dogs from a 21-3 deficit to win. The Georgia defense smothered the Hokies in the second half, allowing only three points.</p>
<p>MPC Computers Bowl- Miami(FL)Hurricanes 21, Nevada Wolfpack 20- In coach Larry Coker's final game, the 'Canes capped off a horrendous season with a bowl win on the "smurf turf" of Boise.

<p>Outback Bowl- Penn State Nittany Lions 20, Tennessee Volunteers 12- In a low-scoring defensive battle, PSU needed a big 158-yard rushing game from Tony Hunt and an 88-yard fumble return for a touchdown by cornerback Tony Davis to overcome the Volunteers.</p>

<p>Gator Bowl- West Virginia Mountaineers 38, Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets 35- In a game a lot closer than it should have been, QB Pat White rallied the Mountaineers back from a 35-17 Tech lead with out the help of star running back Steve Slaton. With Yellow Jacket QB Reggie Ball out, the game was supposed to be a breeze for WVU, but backup Taylor Bennett picked up the slack for GaTech, passing for 326 yards, 186 to WR Calvin Johnson. Unfortunately for the Yellow Jackets, so did FB Owen Schmitt, who filled Slaton's shoes well, rushing for 109 yards. White had 276 total yards for the Mountaineers, and Tech running back Tarshard Choice had 169 yards rushing.</p>
<p><br />
Capital One Bowl- Wisconsin Badgers 17, Arkansas Razorbacks 14- Tired of being underrated, Wisconsin used their defense to hold Arkansas to only 14 points, and let quarterback John Stocco throw for 206 yards, 82 to wideout Travis Becklum. The Razorbacks put up a good fight, with star RBs Felix Jones and Darren McFadden rush for 150 and 89 yards, respectively.</p>
<p>Rose Bowl- USC Trojans 32, Michogan Wolverines 18- In a battle that some said could have been the National Championship and the first of the BCS games, quarterback John David Booty smoked the Wolverine defense for 391 passing yards and four touchdowns, with WR Dwayne Jarrett catching two touchdowns and collecting 205 receiving yards, and WR Steve Smith getting 108 receving yards alongside him. Michigan QB Chad Henne threw for 309 yards and two touchdowns, but it wasn't enough to defeat a driven USC squad.</p>
<p>Fiesta Bowl- Boise State Broncos 43, Oklahoma Sooners 42- The Cinderella Broncos shocked Adrian Peterson and the Sooners after jumping ahead 14-0, then falling behind 35-28 on a Marcus Walker 33-yard interception return for a TD. With just over a minute left on the clock, BSU quarterback Jared Zabransky, who passed for three touchdowns and 262 yards, threw a fourth-down pass to Drisan James just short of the marker, who then pitched it back to Jerard Rabb, who ran it into the endzone with seconds left on the clock to tie the game. In overtime, Peterson, just recovered from a collarbone injury, ran for 25 of his 77 yards on a TD run, which put the Sooners up by seven. The Broncos faced fourth and goal after a few unsucessful plays, then gave the ball to WR Vinny Peretta who threw a perfect strike into the endzone to tie the game...but BSU elcted to go for two. Zabransky handed it to RB Ian Johnson, who went unouched into the end zone for the winning points. In the wackiest ending of the bowl season, besting even the Insight Bowl, Johnson ran for 101 yards.</p>
<p>Orange Bowl- Louisville Cardinals 24, Wake Forest Demon Deacons 13- Wake Forest was another Cinderella story, only this time the slipper didn't quite fit. Star Cardinal QB Brian Brohm passed for 311 yards, besting Wake's Riley Skinner's 271, and Louisville WR Harry Douglas caught ten passes for 165 yards. The Cardinals fell behind 13-10 early in the fourth quarter, but then Brohm stepped it up a notch and led Louisville to a win.</p>
<p>Sugar Bowl- LSU Tigers 41, Notre Dame Fighting Irish 14- JaMarcus Russell made a case for himself as the top quarterback entering the draft as he outperformed ND's Brady Quinn, passing for 332 yards. Also helping LSU's cause were RB Keiland Williams, who ran for 107 yards and two touchdowns, and wide receiver Early Doucet, who caught eight passes for 115 yards. One bright spot for Notre Dame was running back Darius Walker, who ran for 128 yards.</p>
<p>International Bowl- Cincinnati Bearcats 27, Western Michigan Broncos 24- In an abrupt break from BCS games before the national championship, Dominick Goodman caught seven passes, including two touchdowns, for 109 yards as Cincy held off a late WMU rally for the victory.</p>
<p>GMAC Bowl- Souther Miss Golden Eagles 28, Ohio Bobcats 7- In a rather one-sided game before the national championship, Southern Miss blew by the Bobcats led by three touchdowns form the running back duo of Tory Harrison and Damion Fletcher.</p>
<p>BCS Championship- Florida Gators 41, Ohio State Buckeyes 14- The "unbeatable" Buckeyes lost an embarassing game in which they held the lead only once---the first play of the game, a kickoff return for a touchdown by star WR Ted Ginn. However, when celebrating after the return, Ginn injured himself and was out for the rest of the game, seemingly taking the air out of OSU's attack. Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith passed for only 35 yards in a poor performance outshined by a good game by Chris Leak, who passed for 213 yards and a touchdown. The Florida Gators, who weren't even supposed to play in the BCS Championship, had won it.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-19_3641.html" title="Edit section: First North Americans (novel series)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First North Americans (novel series)</span></h2>
<p>The "First North Americans" is a series of historical novels by W. Michael Gear and Kathleen O'Neal Gear, published under the Tor label of Tom Doherty books. Begun in 1990 with "People of the Wolf," the series is still ongoing, with the most recen. Several of the books have been USA Today and international best-sellers. The books are narrative adventures, set during various significant periods of North American prehistory. Although comparable to the better-known "Earth's Children" series by Jean M. Auel (set in Ice Age Europe) the "First North Americans" series is of broader historical scope and is less concerned with individual character development. The novels range in time from the first peopling of North America by Siberan hunters c. 13,000 BC (the Gears subscribe to the Clovis theory of American settlement) to the Missisippian florescence of c.1300 AD, and in locale from the Alaskan interior to the Atlantic coast of Florida. Written by two professional archaeologists, the series is generally well-regarded for its archaelogical accuracy, but it also contains speculative as well as mystical elements such as dream visions and visitations by gods and spirits to the protagonists. Each novel generally contains a non-fiction foreword briefly describing the culture described in the novel and the archaeological finds associated with it; as well as an introductory chapter set in modern times in which archaeolgical relics of some kind are discovered.</p>

SDEE specifies the format of the IDS alerts as well as the protocol used to communicate events generated by security devices. SDEE is flexible and extensible so vendors can utilize product specific extensions in a way that maintains messaging compatibility. In addition, SDEE will provide corporations and security vendors better management of multiple vendor environments by having all alerts communicated in the same format. SDEE builds upon the XML, HTTP and SSL/TLS industry standards to facilitate adoption by vendors and users by allowing them to use existing software that implements these standard interfaces."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-19_3641.html" title="Edit section: Englands Asian Gang Culture - Keighley focus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Englands Asian Gang Culture - Keighley focus</span></h2>
<p>In the summer of 2001 Keighley made the news for it's extremely violent drug and turf wars that lead to the murder of 4 Young asian men in the space of a few months. During these few months the police launched 36 related invetsigations including a full bloodied street battle where bullets were fired.</p>
<p>At this time the streets were under the control of the "bottomenders", gangmembers who resided in the lawkholome lane area which is in the bottom echeleon of Keighley lead by Showfield kingpin "Baldy". Their rivals the "topenders", gangmembers who reside in the top echeleon of Keighley lead by Highfield kingpin "Gilly".there were minor skirmishes between the gangs all year but it all exploded in the keighley Mela an asian festival held in bottom end territory Victoria Park. A group of bottomenders got involved in a fight which lead to the violent beating of Gilly and another associcate.</p>
<p>After the mela the topenders turned up the heat on their rivals carrying out several beatings and shootings in retaliation. In return the bottomenders ending up beating down a fellow bottomender as they believed he had set them up. On the sae night all hell broke loose on the streets of Lawkholme.</p>
<p>A heavily armed gang from nearby Bradford apparently backers of the topenders and whose leader known only as Chokey was a cousin of the bottomender beaten up by bottomenders. Several expensive cars such as Subarus showed up at night in parson street to take revenge for the earlier beating this lead to an almighty street brawl between a hundered young men on parson street which left bullets, boulders, glass, smashed cars and badly beaten, stabbed and shot gang members all over the area. The outcome wasn't pleasing for no side as both sides had casualties.</p>
<p>In the coming days the bottomenders beat many topenders and carved lucrative deals on the streets which meant they made a lot more dirty money than the topenders. This made various topend gangmembers switch sides and join ranks with the bottomenders who they saw as more powerful and as the people who were making money.</p>
<p>In 1 incident a former topender turned bottomender picked up an old topend aquaintance who had no idea of his switch and took him for a ride where he stopped at a bottomend base his passenger was pulled out and given a brutal beating which meant the victim spent several weeks in a coma and to this day has not fully recovered. The bottomenders carried out several beatings like this but one in particular was different.</p>
<p>A topender was beat up in a simlar way but this was one who had left the "gangster" ways and after the beating he did something which is seen as bad for your "street cred", he went to the police. Which led to a identity parade held at a Bradford Station.</p>
<p>3 bottomenders were made to attend but didn't take part. On their way back they stopped at a Heaton Petrol station, in the drivers seat was 16 year old Yasser Hussain. As he sat parked in the forecourt of the shell petrol station a car puled up at the passengers side and a man calmly fired 2 rounds from a sawn of shotgun, leaving 2 bullets in the head of Yasser Hussain. The 16 year old managed to drive a hundered yards before slumping dead at the wheel.</p>
<p>In coming weeks the police stepped up efforts to calm the situation but it failed his was just the start. In comin weeks gangmembers were shot at, chased, kidnapped, beaten and maimed. And soon things took a turn for the worse as gangmembers started thinking they were untouchables.</p>
<p>A former topender turned bottom ender Zubair Hussain took a ride up to his old hangout spots picked up a few fellow gangmembers and spotted Yasser Khan who wasn't known for gang acitivites but was in fact a law graduate. He was chasen through alleyways by Zubair Hussain and his associated and eventually caught where he was beaten down and then with a piece of Yorkshire slab had his head caved in this brutality cost him his life but this was a killing of someone who lived in top end territory by a bottom ender and this meant he had to be careful but as Zubair Hussain ran towards home after the Killing of Yasser Khan he was met with immediate retribuiton by a topender. Zubair Hussain was stabbed to death only minutes after putting Yasser Khan on his death bed. A man accused and later cleared of kiling Zubair was seen being driven away from the scene by a certain Qadir "kaddy" Ahmed. No one has been conviceted for any of the three killings.</p>
<p>After the murders many elder local people hoped that the killings would be a warning to gangmembers and they would put their weapons down to call a truce but they were wrong yet again.</p>
<p>On July 12 2001 feared bottom end leaders Monkey, Zulfi and Taff purchased a hammer and an axe each.</p>
<p>Other bottomenders under the command of Zulfi had bought 7 balaclavas and 4 pairs of golfing gloves.</p>
<p>Other gangmembers bought a shabby looking Volvo 840 and a Rover 820. The list of items showed that the bottomenders were playing this deadly game in its most deadly way. At 11pm on the 13th - the time Qadir "kaddy" Ahmed the man who drove away the man cleared of Zubair Hussain's killing usually finished playing football at the Keighley Leisure Centre which is situated in the heart of Bottom end territory and at the same place where the 1st beating of Topend leader Gilly had happened. Kaddy and an associate pulled on to the road driving on a busy route and the bottomenders began tailing him heavily armed. Before anything could be done Kaddys car was rammed of the road. Kaddy and his friend made a run for it his friend escaped but Kaddys wasn't as fortunate. After a 300 yard chase KAddy was caught and was murdered in devastating fashion. In just a few seconds his killers had caused 28 seperate wounds including the killer blow - an axe to the head.</p>
<p>The bottomenders headquarters was raided and found stashed were drungs, many weapons and hung on the wall was a poster of their idol, Al Capone who was an influence in the killing of kaddy as it happened on valentines day parallel to Capone's valentines day massacre.</p>
<p>This killing was different in another way as the killers were bought to justice by the police and what was first seen asa good sign for the town of Keighley things emerged differently. The killers of Kaddy were the leader and the backbone of the bottomenders most were given life sentances. Police had thought this was good news for the community but in reality it was only good news for the topenders who within a few years took full advantage.</p>
<p>For 5 or 6 years the situation was left to just few skirmishes between the gangs but nothing major as the bottomenders no longer had their leaders for intuition and to the ganeral fear some topenders had vanished when they were put behind bars.</p>
<p>Now in 2007 the streets are ruled "og kingpin" Gilly and his fellow topenders but ruunning on the streets are 2001's younger teenagers who aftera few years have stepped into the shoes of deceased gangmembers and incacerated gangmembers. As both gangs especially the bottomenders are now full of young hard-headed adults. The end of 2006 showed signs of 2001 and it has become more revealing in 2007.</p>
<p>Several incidents of bottomenders being hammered by top enders have occured which have resulted in bottomenders retaliating with bullets. The youngsters of Keighley see them selves as being failed by the police, schools and the government believing that not enough hs been done and learnt from 2001 to stop them from seeing Drug gealing as an only option to make money in the town as most graduates quikly move out of the town, keighley is being overrun again by gangmembers.</p>
<p>In between the 2 gang territories lies the "middle end" another poverty stricken area mainly home to asians, Showfield. Showfield (car road area)was once home to norious bottomend kingpin Baldy and like 2001 gangmembers from the showfield area have made an alliance with neighbouring bottomenders. Next to Showfield are 5 rows of houses home to mainly 4 families 1 which is split into another sector. 1 half of the split family have had many altercations with another family who have had a brutal feud with a 2nd of the 4 families but these families are seen as hard working and honest livers by most but still because of the society they live in do have their share of "beef". The 2nd half of the split family are protected by the much feared "Skellyz" from Bradford.</p>
<p>Al in all nothing has changed Keighley remains a place that you would expect to see in the "ghettoes of keighley" with communites becoming more and more segregated and the racist BNP campaigning for election on the towns council. The quality of life is still poor. Being a drug dealer is 1 of the most common jobs amongst Asian youth. No go areas have been created in Asian areas as the police fail to protect people of the locality.</p>
<p>Many have predicted a repeat of 2001 to come sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>5 Acres of Fear was a Surf/Punk/Experimental band that formed in San Francisco in 2006. The lineup consisted of Guy Garrison (bass), Pete Sciacca (guitars), niveK (drums), and Nate Huggins (guitars, vocals, keys). Their style reflected a large range of influences, including Dick Dale inspired surf tunes, punk rock, Spanish guitars, metal, and just plain weirdness. The band recorded many studio tracks in a short amount of time, including extensive work with Willie the Mailman of Grave Brothers Deluxe. Guy Garrison left the group in October 2006 in order to move to Seattle, Washington. In February 2007 the group broke up for good, citing creative differences. They did, however, in the time they were together, manage to record enough songs to have material for a CD. The initial title "Death Brigade" was dropped, but the album is still slated for release, pending final mixes, in 2007.</p>

<p><b>Noble Kale</b> is the man who would be <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_Rider_%28comics%29_d54e.html" title="Ghost Rider (comics)">Ghost Rider</a>. Noble, grew up with his abusive father Pastor Kale, and his younger brother, Dante, in the eighteenth century. One day Noble fell in love with a young, black girl named Magdelena who worked for the Quentin Carnival. Because of Magdelena's skin color Noble hid his love for her from his father. Noble was forced to tell his father that he loved Magdelena when Magdelena gave birth to Noble's son. Eventually Noble and Magdelena married. Shortly after their marriage, Magdelena discovered Pastor Kale's dark secret, he is the servant of the dark lord, <a href="../../../m/e/p/Mephisto_%28comics%29.html" title="Mephisto (comics)">Mephisto</a>. Because of Magdelena's discovery the pastor accused her of witchcraft and had her burned at the stake. Knowing that Noble would object, the pastor had him drugged, tortured, and beaten, in the church's cellar. Unbeknownst to anyone, Magdelena sent a curse of her own shortly after her death. She sent the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furies.html" title="Furies">Furies</a> to take revenge on the pastor and his town. After many townsfolk's died at the hands of the Furies, Pastor Kale struck a deal with Mephisto. Mephisto would turn Noble into a demon, and claim Noble's soul. The deal was made and Noble became the avenging spirit of vengeance, the Ghost Rider. When Ghost Rider had destroyed the Furies, the pastor offered him human flesh, Noble's son. Unwilling to eat his own child, Noble killed himself. When Mephisto appeared to claim Noble's soul, Mephisto's brother, the archangel <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uriel.html" title="Uriel">Uriel</a> appeared and demanded that the soul of Noble Kale be spared. Since no agreement could be reached, a compromise was made where Noble's soul was to be claimed be neither realm; instead, his soul remains in the void unless called upon by one of his descendants. To make sure that each realm would live up to the bargain a spell of protection was placed upon Noble and his descendants. Thus, the legend of the Ghost Rider begins.</p>
<p>Seeking the <b>Medallion of Power</b>, Noble battled the demon <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zarathos.html" title="Zarathos">Zarathos</a>. During their battle the medallion was broken into three pieces. Each recovered a piece; the third was believed lost until being found as part of the Badilino family.</p>
<p>The Blazes were separated as a protective measure by the Blood. Mephisto confronted Naomi Kale. She attempted to join with Noble and battle Mephisto. She was killed, and Noble's father hid the body. Mephisto apparently made Pastor Kale immortal and tormented him with the fact that his zealous beliefs had damned his descendants. He also tracked down the Badilinos.</p>
<p>His manipulations caused John Blaze to be bonded with Zarathos. Blaze then was manipulated to attack the Badilinos, causing Michael Badilino to become Vengeance. Noble was bonded to Daniel Ketch when his sister Barbara was shot.</p>
<p>The truth about the Ghost Rider and Noble was revealed after a penance stare from Vengeance. Kale and Ketch continued to battle evil, with Kale becoming more powerful and angrier. Blackheart deposed Mephisto and sought to up the stakes. Blackheart created his own Spirits of Vengeance.</p>
<p>They confronted Kale, asking him to serve Blackheart or die. He refused and was taken to 'hell' after being stabbed by Pao Fu. There Blackheart offered him another deal: marry both Pao Fu and the Blackrose. Ketch was able to contact Uriel, and Noble briefly was transformed into an 'angel of death.' Blackheart was defeated, and Kale assumed control of 'hell.' Mephisto soon returned and forced Kale out.</p>
<p>Noble Kale currently seems to have been bonded to John Blaze.</p>

Their goal is to give the kind folks who work the nightlife every weekend. A reason to go out on the weekdays. And so once a month a NoodlesVIPalooza is held in sponsor venues around Brisbane and the Gold Coast. The event has brought alot of hospitality workers together. Staff from other pubs whom are considered rivals attend NoodlesVIPalooza. The event has opened up new ways of networking within Brisbane, pretty much everybody you need to know attends NoodlesVIPalooza. Though its preferred for hospitality workers to attend, professionals from other fields are beginning to take part.</p>

DALE PANTALIONE-born 9/11/74-Vineland, New Jersey.</p>
<p>vocals; acoustic / electric / bass guitars; piano/ mellotron / keys; percussion / samples.</p>
<p>Influences: The Beatles, John Cale, Pink Floyd, Ennio Morricone, Van Morrison, Radiohead, Peter Gabriel.</p>
<p>GENRE/DESCRIPTION: Experimental, atmospheric, emotional, funky, melodic and haunting. Known in the South Jersey music scene for his thought provoking lyrics, great gift for melody, and "spontaneous" writing and recording.</p>
<p>Dale's explored an eclectic range musical styles. Folk acoustic, rock, funk, to electronica/noise/ambient. Dale has been the creative force of many bands since the early 1990's, most notably during the period of 1995-2001, his work in LIQUID ECLIPSE (PLAGUED BY PHASES-2001) which he founded--an experimental band with interchangeable musicians and sounds.</p>
<p>Most recently Pantalione collaborated with Kent Green on IDENTICAL STRANGERS (STRANGE IDENTITY-2003). A project born out of MIND MUSIC ALCATRAZ-Pantalione's project of ambient work released in 1999, and was the basis for Green's film PREY. The two teamed together on several music videos for both Dale's solo work ("SAD SONG"-2005) and with Liquid Eclipse ("SHADOW OF THE SUN"-2001).</p>
<p>Dale has also released a string of solo recordings, (SOLAR BY POLAR-1998, BRING THE LIGHT UNDERGROUND-2004) most recently the acclaimed THEOMINOUS DRONE-2006, which has faired well in both America and the UK.</p>
<p>He continues to record for independent film (THE HEAD BALLET-1999, THE REALITY OF DESIREE'S DREAM-2000, PREY-2000, DEAD WITHIN-2002, BARREN-2005, CARVER-2006) and televison (REEL SHORTS-2003), while continuing to push the boundaries of his own creativity.</p>
<p>In 2005 Dale briefly got back to performing live onstage after a 5 year hiatus from recording playing a handful of intimate shows that were spectacles in both light and sound, featuring fractals and projected images to accompany his atmospheric music.</p>
<p>2006 saw Dale perform his first-ever mix of original and contemporary classical compositions for a wedding.</p>
<p>Currently he reformed Liquid Eclipse and is touring to support "the Elements", a concept album, which features musicians from all different backgrounds.</p>
<p>Pantalione is also composing music for an animated soundtrack "Virtual Grafitti" with animator/writer Robert F. Kauffmann ("Masque Of Ollock").</p>
<p>Dale's original self-released recordings are available through Elsewhere Records, a small imprint he founded in 1997.</p>
<p>He currently resides in Richland, New Jersey, and accepts fan mail at dpnatz74@yahoo.com</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-19_3641.html" title="Edit section: Popface">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Popface</span></h2>
<p>Popface released their debut album Buck in 1995 and followed up with Almost Endless in 1998. Next came their EP Calling Back/Falling Back in 2001 and the album Michele, I Love You in 2002. Their latest album Eleven Pieces Of A Broken Heart is being released in February 2006. Through the years they have released their records on three different labels, and are now finally coming home to their hometown label CCAP for their new album.</p>
<p>Popface has been synonymous with the Norwegian indie scene, or more to the point the shoegazer scene, since they first started in the mid nineties. For many years the band have perfected the balance between loud and quiet, between cascading wall of electric guitars and the gentle whisper of an almost silent acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>On the new album the band has taken a step in a new direction. Instead of searching for the musical climaxes, the band is on a quest for harmony. The indie feeling is still very much there, and you can feel something building up under the beautifully build pop songs, but the wild guitars have been pretty much turned down and the band comes forward as an harmonic unity, building up rhythms and patterns underneath the pop structures. Popface 2006 balances beautifully between their artistic vision and the commercial pop of today.</p>

<p>20 Kids * 20 Kites * 20 Minutes The complete time tested instructions to get 20 kids making their own kites and flying them in 20 minutes. Material list:</p>
<pre>
   * 20 sheets of brightly colored 8 1/2" x 11" typing paper.
   * 20 8" bamboo bar-b-que shishkabab sticks.
   * 1 roll of florescent surveyor's flagging plastic tape. Available at any hardware store. A plastic bag cut in a 1" wide spiral all around will also make a great tail.
   * 1 roll 1/2"wide masking tape or any type of plastic tape..
   * 1 roll of string. (At least 200', 6 to 10 feet for each child.)
   * 20 pieces of 1"x 3" cardboard on which to wind the string.
   * Scissors.
   * Hole punch. (optional)
     Directions:
        1. Fold a sheet of 8 1/2" x 11" paper in half to 8 1/2" x 5 1/2".
        2. Fold again along the diagonal line A in Fig.2.
        3. Fold back one side forming kite shape in Fig.3 and place tape firmly along fold line AB.(No stick is needed here because the fold stiffins the paper and acts like a spine.)
        4. Place bar-b-que stick from point C to D and tape it down firmly.
        5. Cut off 6 to 10 feet of plastic ribbon and tape it to the bottom of the kite at B.
        6. Flip kite over onto its back and fold the front flap back and forth until it stands straight up.(Otherwise it acts like a rudder and the kite spins around in circles.)
        7. Punch a hole in the flap at E, about 1/3 down from the top point A.
        8. Tie one end of the string to the hole and wind the other end onto the cardboard string winder.
