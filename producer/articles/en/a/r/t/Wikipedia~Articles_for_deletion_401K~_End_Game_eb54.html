<p>The mainstream media is trying to suppress the message of this film. A lot of the links are international links and therefore don't show up on english based searches. Here is an english based link through google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:KJZNAEptHB0J:www.starfly.se/+%22vic+olam%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=18" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:KJZNAEptHB0J:www.starfly.se/+%22vic+olam%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=18" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Since when did google become the gatekeeper for what is notable or not?</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> You have posted a link to schedules. It says the film is showing. It still doesn't show anybody cares. Where's the controversy? Where's the stir? Where are the media reports? Should we ignore Wikipedia standards requiring verifiability because some anonymous person claims a deep, dark conspiracy is suppressing information on this film? I don't think so. The internet is vast and huge.

<p>Seriously, wikipedia users have more integrity than to disregard a notable film.</p>
<p>If wikipedia lists popcorn films that play in the multiplex, they have to list films that primarily exist to make a social commentary.</p>
<p>The fact it is being shown internationally shows people care.</p>
<p>I thought wikipedia had more integrity.</p>

<p>Yes, but for any film to be listed on IMDB it also has to meet strict public interest requirements. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.234.119.118 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.234.119.118.html" title="User talk:69.234.119.118">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.234.119.118_aa4f.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.234.119.118">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>LOL! Actually it does. For any short film to play more than once is very notable!</p>
<p>The different play dates spanning several countries makes it very noteable and significant for an experimental short film. We're talking a short film here. One designed not to make money. The only reason commercial films have repeat play is because of money.</p>
<p>I find it upsurd hollywood drek movies are considered more notable than a socially conscious short film that's touring internationally with nobody profiting from it.</p>
<p>I thought this was a encyclopedia, one that catalogues significance.</p>

<p>Were you one of the organizers of the international tour?</p>
<p>Do you know in fact that's the play order it played in?</p>
<p>Even if it played 13th out of 17. That would be an effective way of protecting it, due to its controversial content.</p>
<p>And that is just one of the dates.</p>
<p>If you check the IMDB release schedule, it has individual dates in Sweden, Finland, Poland, Russia and the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Hardly something a "non-notable" short film could achieve!</p>

<li>All the show dates listed on IMDB are part of the "Polyester Prince Road Show" with the 16 other films.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just being listed on IMDb is not enough to prove that a film is notable. In this case, the film receives no Google hits except from IMDb and Wikipedia.

It is a valid and much used function here at Wiki. Finally, 5) The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an article or edit or wish it to remain. Editors should therefore provide references. If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 18:06, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>SOLID KEEP</b>, Important, significant and notable. Whether people like the message or not, any film that hits several different countries (international dates have been verified), especially a short film, makes this very notable.
