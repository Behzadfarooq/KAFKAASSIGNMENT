<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia may not be a Crystal ball, but the information on this series is not speculation from Wikipedia members, but announcements that were presumably derived from existing sources such as IGN. As far as it goes, I wouldn't mind merging, but I don't see that it would really help, since it'd have to be recreated anyway. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:05, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> The reason that film articles get <i>deleted</i> for crystal balling is that we can't guarantee a film <i>will</i> be made. We don't keep articles of project announcements around just in case one day it finally takes off. It can't be for certain that the film will come around again, so a recreation may never happen anyway. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 02:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Even if it were never made, I'd say given that there is information from reputable sources out there (such as <i>Variety</i>), I would say that Wikipedia shold have information on it anyway. Either it would be "This movie happened" or "This movie was planned, but it didn't happen" and both should be on Wikipedia, given the circumstances (Of course a Jerry Bruckheimer film is going to get an article, even if it wasn't a fairly notable franchise). At the most, you might convince me of a merge, but this is AfD, not a proposal to merge. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:47, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the plot section needs to be verified or deleted but the remaining information about production has been confirmed by the IGN and IMDB link. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 02:26, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Please read why <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> and about <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28films%29_a836.html#Unreleased_films" title="Wikipedia:Notability (films)">notability with unreleased films</a>. The "event" (making/release of the film) <b>is not certain</b> to take place, and the film <b>has not entered production</b>, instead being "expected to be made". There is no assurance whatsoever that production is underway (IGN citation in the article is from March 4, 2004). --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 02:37, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I have, from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> "It <i>is</i> appropriate to report discussion and arguments about the prospects for success of future proposals and projects or whether some development will occur, provided that discussion is properly referenced." Everything in the article (now that I've killed the unverified plot section) has now been properly referenced. —<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 02:49, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Thus why it's OK to have something like <a href="../../../t/h/e/Prince_of_Persia%7E_The_Sands_of_Time_e6f0.html#Future_film" title="Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time#Future film</a>. The sentence you quoted was to indicate that information about future proposals and projects don't have to be disregarded outright. It doesn't mean that it's OK to create an article about a film just because there's been an announcement to make a film. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 03:35, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Does it? WP:NOT doesn't say where information about expected future events can be placed. It does say forward looking articles about games, movies, etc. require special care not to be advertising but that's about it. If you want to propose a merge and redirect this article to the PoP:SoT that's one thing, but that isn't a matter of deletion. In fact, if the information in this article violates WP:NOT it shouldn't be on the PoP:SoT article either. —<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 18:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
