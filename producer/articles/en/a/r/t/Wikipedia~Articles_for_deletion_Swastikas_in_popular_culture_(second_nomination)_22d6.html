<li><b>Strong delete</b> as an indiscriminate list and directory seeking to capture any appearance of anything that in the unattributable opinion of any random editor looks like it might possibly be similar in shape to a swastika, with no regard to the importance or triviality of the appearance in the fiction from which it's drawn or the real world. The arguments in favor of keeping it were largely centered around the notion that it was better to have this trivia in its own article than have it fouling the featured article <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swastika.html" title="Swastika">Swastika</a>, which argument is <a href="../../../b/h/t/WP%7EBHTT_103f.html" title="WP:BHTT">not compelling</a>. In addition to these issues, the article is redundant to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_use_of_the_Swastika_in_the_early_20th_century_3afb.html" title="Western use of the Swastika in the early 20th century">Western use of the Swastika in the early 20th century</a>, which while it still has some problems is a far superior article and actually restricts itself to appearances of the actual <i>swastika</i> and not manji or nonsense like runway patterns or comic book throwing stars or XFL team logos that are falsely labeled. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:20, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not a separate concept which can be independently researched or discussed. There is nothing you can say <i>about</i> the topic of swastikas in popular culture except what's already in the main article. It's a fundamentally unfinishable and unmaintainable list. The primary reason given for the creation of the page (and in the article's defense in the prior discussions) was to keep the junk from overwhelming the primary article. Hiding the problem on a separate page does not solve the problem or somehow make bad content better. A few examples are appropriate in the main article. Attempting to create comprehensive lists are not. Encyclopedias are not concordances. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 01:11, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Clean up</b> I agree that the article looks similar to what Crosses in popular culture would look like but I don't think it is beyond repair. If the list was organized by types of uses instead of the media it appeared in it could have some value. For example, if there was a section on "accidental swastikas" that had no intended meaning at all but people got worked up over is encyclopedic especially if the company later removed it. There are also many "misunderstood swastikas" which the author intended a manji meaning, listing them also has value. Many of the others on the list which are simply a reference to nazism should be removed ("In American History X, lead character Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a white supremacist, has a swastika tattooed on his chest.") <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> 10:57, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Jon513, I think if this article has any hope for survival it will need to be cleaned up right away, in the next few days, before the AfD closes. As it stands there seems to be little support to keep it. A serious attempt to clean it up now would give it a chance of survival, because even if the closing admin deletes it, it could be put up for review and restored, based on the fact it had been cleaned up late in the AfD process, after most of the votes had been cast. But if no one cleans it up before the AfD closes, it will be too late. How long would it take to clean up? -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 19:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swastika.html" title="Swastika">Swastika</a>. Or delete. I prefer redirect because this might be useful as notes on an actual article, so it would be good to preserve the revisions somewhere. However, I think that unless someone actually makes this an article and nukes the list of trivia by the time this AfD ends, we've given it enough time as a <a href="../../../22/i/n/Wikipedia%7E_In_popular_culture__articles_a4c6.html" title="Wikipedia:&quot;In popular culture&quot; articles">trivia article</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:38, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> per Mangojuice. I suggested a "highly selective merge" in the previous AfD, but there is really no point to such a small merge or even to argue a "merge" this late in the discussion. Yes, technically one good argument can outweigh a thousand poor ones, but I'm not a Spartan warrior and AFD is not the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Thermopylae_fd42.html" title="Battle of Thermopylae">Battle of Thermopylae</a> (and let's not forget what actually happend to the Spartans at that battle ...).
