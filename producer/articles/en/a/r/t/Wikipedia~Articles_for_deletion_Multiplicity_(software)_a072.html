<p>Originally tagged for speedy deletion under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G11" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G11</a> (spam); this was contested on the talk page and the notion that the article should be treated in a manner similar to the recently considered <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_MaxiVista_b840.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/MaxiVista">MaxiVista</a> appears valid. I am nominating as a neutral party to allay contention that might arise from a contested deletion under the speedy deletion process. User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 23:47, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> (multiple instances of independent coverage) and the proposed <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> (as WP:CORP, plus as a key product of a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stardock.html" title="Stardock">notable company</a>). Note that I am the article creator and an <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGreenReaper_a809.html#Conflict_of_interest.3F" title="User talk:GreenReaper">employee of said company</a>. I think that the deletion of MaxiVista was motivated as much by NPOV concerns raised by the removal of mentions of competitors by editors as by notability (which appeared to be established, though late in the deletion process). Wikipedia should probably have articles on both, since they both appear to meet inclusion criteria. I would most certainly have brought a speedy deletion up for review, as the article contains no promotional language, and mentions the closest free software equivalent, <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synergy_%28software%29.html" title="Synergy (software)">Synergy</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 04:46, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You are misunderstanding WP:CORP - when it says "the published works", it means the works that are being used to establish notability. Nobody from Stardock wrote the material that is used as references within the article - just the article itself. The latter is only a problem because people closely involved with a topic are considered <i>more likely</i> to make contributions that result in non-neutral articles - hence the guideline against making such contributions. If it <i>is</i> a bad article, then it should get deleted whoever wrote it. Conversely, if it's not, it shouldn't. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 03:13, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your opinion may be strongly biased here. Additionally, if <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> should not be enough, it additionally violates <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. If the article about MaxiVista has been deleted for such reasons, this article would also need to be deleted.Merithb 14:56, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> suggests writing an article based upon reliable published sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Writing_about_subjects_close_to_you" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability#Writing about subjects close to you</a> suggests writing solely using published works from sources independent of onesself and one's company. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> states that xe has done exactly that, and the citations in the article's reference section appear to bear that out. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:13, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Per the "References" section of the article, which cites two non-trivial published works from sources independent of the software's authors and vendors (and two others: one which isn't very substantial and one which is someone's web log), the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">PNC</a> of both <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> is satisfied. I applaud <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> for writing about a subject close to xyrself <i>in the right way</i>. Would that everyone did the same! <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:13, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Although I would respectfully request that <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> allow other, non-conflicted editors to directly edit the article from this point. You should, as <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> strongly encourages, <i>"submit content for community review on the article's talk page, and to let one or more trusted community members judge whether the material belongs in Wikipedia."</i> --&#160;<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 06:51, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While I am aware of the guideline and the arguments behind it, I respectfully <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_Conflict_of_interest_7d97.html" title="User:GreenReaper/Conflict of interest">decline to follow it</a>, as I feel that it does more harm than good, particularly when it extends beyond the realm of people paid to edit Wikipedia. Instead, I try to ensure that my own contributions don't become further reasons for its existence, and work towards <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> with people who have differing views (through the regular means of talk page discussion and building on their own edits rather than reverting). I think stronger measures should be the exception, not the rule. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 11:02, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then the same measure should be applied for different products. If Maxivista has been deleted for less valid reasons (autor was not affiliated with the maker), then Multiplicity should not be treated differentMerithb 15:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've not seen the MaxiVista article - I am not an administrator here, and do not have access to deleted revisions. However, reading through the deletion discussion, there seem to be several reasons proposed for its deletion, some of which ("promotional" phrasing, attempts to keep mentions of other products out of the article) may have only applied to that particular instance of the article, or to the actions of certain editors over a certain period. What I would suggest is that you create a copy of the article that you would <i>like</i> to be there at User:Merithb/MaxiVista, and then invite others to consider it at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>. If it is well-written, contains appropriate references to demonstrate the notability of the product, and if you can assure the community that the other problems highlighted in the initial deletion ("references to competing products, alternatives or even the general kvm page are frequently removed by company officials", and possibly <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> issues) will no longer occur, then you have a strong chance of being be able to overturn the deletion at review. Taking it to review has already been suggested by <a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> at <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerithb_503a.html" title="User talk:Merithb">your talk page</a>, and he offered some help in doing so. You don't have to create the copy of the article first, but doing so may improve your chances, as people will be far more likely to believe that a neutral article can be written if it already <i>has</i> been written.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 18:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
