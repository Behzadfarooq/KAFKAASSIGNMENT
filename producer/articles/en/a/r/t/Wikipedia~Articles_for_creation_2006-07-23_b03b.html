<p><b>Born</b> February 1, 1987, Funchal, Portugal. An Australian cricketer currently playing for New South Wales. Moises is an all-rounder who is a right handed batsman and a right arm medium fast bowler.</p>
<p>Moises Henriques was so young when he first came into the New South Wales squad that he could only train in school holidays and often had to catch a taxi to practice. After starring as captain of Australia's Under-19 side - he first made the team as a 16-year-old - with 16 World Cup wickets in Sri Lanka at 10.62 and 150 runs at 37.5, Moises played his second senior game in the final of the 2005-06 ING Cup. As the Blues were heading towards the tightest of victories over South Australia, Moises, the No. 9, refused to fluster and was unbeaten on 5 from 21 balls when Stuart MacGill squirted the winning run.</p>
<p>During the U-19 world cup he was described as "The most complete player on show at the tournament." The eye-catching aspect of Henriques is how technically correct he is with bat and ball.</p>
<p>Moises is the future of Australian cricket along with other young players like Michael Clarke and Shaun Tait he is set for a very bright future in the sport</p>
<p><b>Trivia:</b> Henriques was born on the same island as Cristiano Ronaldo, the Manchester United and Portuguese forward. He also holds an EU passport so is eligible to play in England.</p>

<p>The Northumbrians are a people who come from the border of England and Scotland. The Romans conquered southern Britain in 43AD and found the Northumbrian to be so difficult to deal with that they built Hadrian's wall to keep agressive Northumbrians away from the non Northumbrians. This group became known as the borders, as they subsisted on the border of Enland and Scottland. Owing to the harsh environment of alternating famines and clan war fare they became a people who were somewhat paranoid, fierce and found their social identity in fighting with others. Their prediliction for violence and their desparate circumstances made them resiliant and difficult to subdue. This group in particular has found their way as enforcers for the powerful. This group eventually came to America calling themselves the Scotts Irish. There is no such ethnic group as Scotts Irish, no country called Scotts Ireland. People of Borderer descent frequently introduce themselves as, "I am Scotts Irish, I have a bad temper." They are not kidding. To this day across West Virginia, Oklahoma, Indiana, Georgia and other southern and mid western states these people can found. In fact the southern accent is called by linguists the Soctts Irish accent. The midwest and the South is the path that the Borders took when they flooded into the states from Canada into West Virginia finding habitation in the blueridge mountains, the ozarks and many other places that were similar to their original habitat.</p>

Scroll Quest is a real live treasure hunt in which people can participate through the United States and possibly world. A coin is hidden by one of the Scroll Quest designers somewhere in the continental US and then a scroll is distributed with clues hidden within. These clues point to the exact location of the coin which if solved lead a person directly to it. The coin is then turned in and a prize is awarded to the successful treasure hunter(s).</p>

"Fetal farming" is a term that has recently entered the lexicon of opponents to the commercial harvesting of tissue from fetuses. The U.S. Congress has unanimously passed legislation that would outlaw fetal farming.</p>

Ethics of Food Production and Consumption Michiel Korthals</p>
<p>1. Introduction: the importance of ethical considerations in food choice Modern western consumers are no longer involved in food production, and have less and less knowledge of, and trust in, production processes. Food, however, is and continues to be an intrinsic good for consumers; rice, for example, in some cultures has not only monetary value, but cultural, social and ethical value as well, because it has an intrinsic role to play in individuals experiencing life according to their ideas of what constitutes a good life (Visser 1986). It is not clear how consumers’ preferences can be communicated to food producers if the gap between consumer preferences and what is actually being done by producers remains in place. After discussing some political and ethical positions that do not align with consumer’s values and responsibilities, I will go into details of current consumer attitudes towards ethics of food, as well as discussing recent trends, such as the increasing diversification into various food styles and corresponding farming and production styles. Many consumers complain about barriers which prevent them from realizing ethically conscious food choices. As a consequence of many social scientific studies framing the buying, cooking and eating person as both a citizen concerned with ethical issues related to food production, and as a (materialist, profit maximizing) consumer, researchers may neglect the fact that consumers are confronted with various difficulties, such as what and who to believe regarding the information about food and ingredients provided on product label and by the media. In this context, where conflicting and potentially untrustworthy information is being presented, consumers often decide to buy the cheapest food stuffs available. Only recently are these potential barriers to optimal consumer choice being addressed, with remarkable results. However, we can identify barriers from the producer’s side as well: the “productionist paradigm” applied to food production practices during the last sixty years actively militates against the producer taking heed of ethical concerns.</p>

Three years later in 1934, running as a candidate for the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference, he was elected to the Jammu and Kashmir Legislature,</p>
<p>He, it was who led the popular agitation against an arbitrary tax on salt imposed by the Maharaja's regime. Three years later in 1934, running as a candidate for the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference, he was elected to the Jammu and Kashmir Legislature, the Praja Sabah, from his home constituency of Mendhra-Poonch, an office he successfully held through the elections of 1938 and 1944. Later, he also served as a member of the State Council during 1969-70. He is remembered today as one of the pioneers of the struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir for their rights under the tyrannical and alien rule of the Dogras.</p>

He also successfully ran for membership of the local council, a position he occupied for eight years and during this period was also elected as President of Bar Association Kotli. In 1970, he was elected to the first Azad Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p>It is a sign of his personal popularity that he has been returned to office from his constituency in every election held in Azad Kashmir in the last 30 years, barring the years when he was President of Azad Kashmir.</p>

<p>Sardar Sikandar Hayat Khan as Prime Minister, a proven record of 'clean administration and public accountability. He is considered a tough but fair administrator, moderate as a politician and skillful as a negotiator, talents that stood him good stead.</p>

<p>The Shatkona or "6-points star" is a Hindu symbol that represents the union of both the male and feminine form. More specifically it is supposed to represent Purusha (the supreme being), and Prakriti (mother nature, or causal matter). Often times this is represented as Shiva-Shakti.</p>
<p>The Shatkona looks exactly like the "Star of David" in Semetic lore. Whether there is a correlation between the two is an interesting topic that could/should be researched.</p>

<p>There exists in the current world view about the UFO phenomenon an undertone that it is either real, and that it is being covered up, or that it is a hoax and that it is perpetuated by the lunatic fringe. Both of these points of view are inappropriate in a free society. Either there are Extra-terrestrials visting us or there are not. If there are then there is at least a Defense Interest to be investigated. One of the few sources of competant journalistic and scientific review of this issue that has entered the public realm is the COMETA Report into the matter published in france.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-23_b03b.html" title="Edit section: Senor Vivo and the Coca Lord">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Senor Vivo and the Coca Lord</span></h2>
<p>Senor Vivo and the Coca Lord is the second book in Louis de Bernieres' Latin American Trilogy, following The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts and preceding The Troublesome Offspring of Cardninal Guzman.</p>
<p>The story centres around Senor Dionisio Vivo, a lecturer in philosophy in the town of Ipasueno. Vivo becomes (in)famous for his letters to a local paper, and the novel follows the consequences of these letters, particularly on Vivo's relationship with Anica. At times the novel is desperately sad, but this is balanced well by moments of humour, particularly concerning the town of Cochadebajo de los Gatos, the town of cats that townspeople are forced to move to and colonise in The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts.</p>
<p>The book, as with all of Louis de Bernieres' novels, has many sub plots and synchronous stories which overlap at points throughout, meaning it is never possible to guess what will happen next.</p>

<p>The town is the site of an annual <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking.html" title="Viking">Viking</a> festival where Viking culture enthusiasts from around the world display reconstructions of Viking garb, handcraft, swordfighting etc.</p>
<p>Tourists with a New Age mindset enjoy a guided tour of the habitats of elves and other hidden people in the town area.</p>
<p>Locally the town is famed in Iceland for being the butt of generic jokes, such as the joke about the women of the town carrying ladders to the supermarket to check if the prices have gone higher.</p>
<p>Hafnarfjörður is now arguably considered to be the rock n' roll capital of Iceland (a title that once belonged to <a href="../../../k/e/f/Keflav%C3%ADk.html" title="Keflavík">Keflavík</a>). Popular Icelandic bands such as Botnleðja, Sign, Úlpa, Lada Sport and Jakobínarína all trace their origins to the town of Hafnarfjörður.</p>

Local elections were held in May 2006, and the people of Hafnarfjörður will vote on the future of the extension for the smelter in 2006.</p>
<p>The smelter was originally built in 1969, and it has improved it cleaning process since then, especially regarding <a href="../../../f/l/u/Fluoride.html" title="Fluoride">fluoride</a>.

<p>Hafnarfjörður takes its name (meaning <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbour.html" title="Harbour">harbour</a> <a href="../../../f/j/o/Fjord.html" title="Fjord">fjord</a></i>) from the area's excellent natural harbour. The town is first named in the medieval "Book of Settlements", and the earliest reports of voyages to Hafnarfjörður date from the end of the 14th century. Englishmen began trading in Hafnarfjörður in the 15th century, but German merchants followed in their wake and eventually drove the English out. After that, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanseatic_League_7714.html" title="Hanseatic League">Hanseatic traders</a> prevailed in town until 1602, based at Hvaleyri. At this point, the Danish monarchy established a Danish trade monopoly in Iceland which lasted until late in the 18th century. During this period, Hafnarfjörður was the nation's busiest trade centre.</p>
<p>In 1793 Bjarni Sívertsen settled here and became influential in local business and international trade, setting up a major commercial fishing operation. His enterprise and initiative signalled the start of impressive commerce in the town. Ever since, he has been called "the father of Hafnarfjörður" and nicknamed "Sir Bjarni." Around 1870 dramatic changes took place in Icelandic fishing. Residents followed the growing trend in Iceland of using decked boats rather than row-boats. This led to even more employment and rapid growth, and Hafnarfjörður attained official municipal status in 1908.</p>
<p>After World War II, more advanced trawlers and numerous motorised ships were added to the fleet. The town's first stern trawler appeared in 1973. Today, Hafnarfjörður is one of the nation's largest fishing centres and the site of Iceland's first fish wholesalers' auction market. Through the years, Hafnarfjörður's dynamic local economy has been strongly linked to fishing, although freight transport has recently become the major harbour activity. And now, the town is Iceland's second-ranked import and export harbour.</p>

<p>Hafnarfjörður is known as one of the most popular residences for <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elves.html" title="Elves">elves</a> in Iceland. The town is built on <a href="../../../l/a/v/Lava.html" title="Lava">lava</a> and around huge boulders, which are believed to be homes for elves. A popular mythology is that it is very hard, and almost impossible, to destroy these homes. Tours around Hafnarfjörður to visit the most popular elven homes are available, and even though belief in elves has diminished in recent years, these are very popular amongst both Icelanders and tourists.</p>

<p>Hafnfjörður has three swimming pools, despite its low population. This is common amongst any town in Iceland, due to the geothermal energy. In 2005, the total number of visits to these swimming pools was 350.085, averaging to 16 visits per resident.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-23_b03b.html" title="Edit section: Nicholas Perrot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nicholas Perrot</span></h2>
<p>Nicholas Perrot (1644 - 1717), explorer, diplomat, and fur trader, was one of the first white men in the upper Mississippi Valley. Born in France, he came to "New France" around 1660 with Jesuits and had the opportunity to visit Indian tribes and learn their languages. He formed a fur trading company around 1667 and undertook expeditions to various tribes and land in and around present-day <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>. He was sometimes the first white man seen by the native peoples and was generally well received.</p>
<p>In 1670 he was an intepreter for Daumont de Saint-Lusson, a French commissary assigned to "the country of the Ottawas, Amikwas, Illinois, and other Indian natives to be discovered in the direction of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Superior_3a7f.html" title="Lake Superior">Lake Superior</a> or Freshwater Sea". He continued to travel around these areas and engage in fur trading, giving the natives such items as cooking kettles and hatchets (to replace stone tools). In 1671 he married Madeleine Viennot. He was given a land grant on the river Saint-Michel, and the 1681 census showed him having six children.</p>
<p>He continued to be involved in Indian affairs. In 1684 he succeeded in bringing the warriors of several nations to Niagara to meet with the Governor' army, where a peace was signed. In the spring of 1685 he was appointed commandant in chief of Bais De Puants (present day <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Bay%2C_Wisconsin_091b.html" title="Green Bay, Wisconsin">Green Bay, Wisconsin</a>) and the neighboring regions when war broke out between the Fox tribe and the Sioux and Chippewa tribes. He worked hard to bring about peace, and was successful, at least for a time. After this, Perrot traveled to the northern waters of the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_e27c.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a>, in the territory of the Sioux, where he built Fort Saint-Antoine.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1687 he was in the region of <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>, and while taking part in an expedition fire broke out at the Jesuit mission, where 40,000 livres worth of his furs were destroyed. Perrot was financially ruined. He returned to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> where in the spring of 1688 he served as an interpreter for the treaty between Governor and Onondaga chief Otreouti, who promised the neutrality of the Onondagas, Cayugas, and Oneidas. In 1689 he built Fort Saint-Pierre at the mouth of the <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin_River_6e70.html" title="Wisconsin River">Wisconsin River</a>, and established peace among area tribes. In subsequent years he was involved in the discovery of lead mines brought to his attention by Miami chiefs.</p>
<p>In 1695 Perrot brought the Miami, Sauk, Menominee, and Potawatomi and Fox chiefs to Montreal at the governor's request, regarding war with the Iroquois. Perrot returned west where his concern was to maintain unity and peace among them in their efforts against the Iroquois. However there was danger, and on two occasions he was almost sent to be burned at the stake with the Mascouters and the Miami tribe.</p>
<p>Perrot then settled on his land grant at Becancour. The Indian chiefs whom he had known saw him for the last time in 1701 at a peace treaty signed in Montreal. He still served as interpreter, but this period of his life was marked by financial difficulties and harassment from creditors. He asked the authorities for a compensation he said was due to him, and a pension in consideration of services long provided, but was not satisfied. He was involved in court cases involving lawsuits filed by and against him.</p>
<p>Nicolas Perrot died on the 13th of August 1717 at about the age of 74 and was buried the next day in the church at Becancour. Nine of his eleven children outlived him. His wife died in 1724.</p>
<p>Perrot was often unappreciated even during his lifetime. He was France's best representative among Indians in the western territories of French North America in the late 1600's. He was able to learn languages and customs of native tribes and earn their esteem and confidence.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perrot_State_Park_97c4.html" title="Perrot State Park">Perrot State Park</a> near <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trempealeau%2C_Wisconsin_dbe0.html" title="Trempealeau, Wisconsin">Trempealeau, Wisconsin</a> is named after him. It is located in a place he used as headquarters around 1685 and 1686.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-23_b03b.html" title="Edit section: Russian and Turkish Baths">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Russian and Turkish Baths</span></h2>
<p>From the Roman Baths of Caracalla to the sumptuous marble pools and steam rooms of the Ottoman Turks, the ancients new instinctively that bathing and sweating are good for you. Not only does sweat carry off toxins from the system, but the process produce's a sense of sweet, overwhelming relaxation. To this day, that makes bathhouses among the favorite places for Russian's to sweat away their afternoons. Since 1892 The Tenth Street Baths between First Ave and Avenue A in the East Village of New York has been the place for Russians and Americans alike to sweat the day away. Generations of Celebrities have passed through its doors over the years, Frank Sinatra, John Belushi, Bill Murray, and more recently the likes of John F. Kennedy Jr., Darrel Hannah, Robert De Niro, Veronica Webb and L.L. Cool J. Now after 100 years as one of the most literally "hottest" spots in New York, The Russian and Turkish Baths has come to Miami. The Russian and Turkish Baths, 5445 Collins Ave at the Castle Beach Club is the place where the Old World blends with the new. The baths on Collins Avenue are an experience, an unexpected paradise, and you're liable to take off a few pounds with the routine. What does the day look like? You might start the day (12:00p.m-12:00p.m.) in "The Cave"- a cave like setting where you can relax in the Salt Water Jacuzzi as the heated natural ocean salt water pounds at your body, massaging every part of you, from a well 95 feet below the ground. Try a few minutes under the ocean waterfall and you will feel like you've been instantly swept away thousands of miles from civilization to your own personal island. You will notice at the Bath's that the mood is more than relaxed, it's almost zen. Guys will be stretching, girls are assuming yoga positions, or even meditating. A couple might be frolicking in the Jaccuzi, or engrossed in conversation in the Steamroom. "Dunk!" one woman instructs a newcomer as she comes out of the Steam Room and gets into the ice-cold pool nearby. Another ten people are hanging out in the Russian Room, filling up buckets-and before passing out-dumping it over their heads. "Feels Good", says a lady named Paula, who barbecues herself once a week here. "I've been to spas that are much more elegant, " says Paula's friend, an aerobics teacher, 'but here there's a lot of tile and the steam room is all stone and it's like walking into the 1900's." No one seems self-conscious, lounging or walking in almost naked bliss, whether their body resembles Jackie Gleason or an Olympic Russian Gymnast, no one seems to care, and the feeling of total freedom from worrying about appearances is the big attraction. The goal at the baths is to get in touch with your real self; to be free and un-burdened and in the process to truly enjoy yourself. Here at the Baths you will be free to do just that! Now that you are free, there are so many options from here: Try the Turkish Steam Room, built in the same manner as centuries ago, once in, you will be surrounded by the same marble walls and columns that the ancient Turks used to bathe in. Maybe the wet steam room with eucalyptus is the thing you need to get rid of your head cold. The aroma bath will tingle every cell of your body. Try our gym for a great workout or play tennis after you loosen up. After an hour or two, head to one-of- the- many massage rooms for a Swedish massage or shiatsu. Here the Russian strongman or woman, will pound, squeeze, un-wind and de-tense muscles you didn't even know you had. If you can't take the pounding, one of the more easy-going massage experts, will more gently ease, kneed and work out your kinks. After your massage, you can nosh on bagels and cream cheese, eggs, salads, or take-a-stab at one of the Russian traditional meals. Maybe after all that shvitzing: a huge bottle of seltzer, or fresh carrot juice is the thing you'll want most. At the "restaurant" you can gain back some of that weight you lost, while enjoying cable TV and lounging around in one of the robes supplied to you when you enter. After eating, you might want to take a short nap, at the baths there is even a relaxation room where a very comfortable "Log Bed" awaits you.</p>
<p>Now that you're relaxed, and out of bed, lets get down to the real business, and head on down to "The Russian Room" where a huge cavernous chamber awaits you. There on two tiers of benches, surrounding a huge rock-walled furnace where women and men alike will be immersed in a most wonderful 3-part routine called The Schvitz. Here's how it goes: First you go into the bath-a very hot, very steamy, stone furnaced "radiant heat" room. When the heat starts to get unbearable, take one of the dozens of buckets around the room, fill it with ice cold water, and like the Russians hundreds of years before you have done, dump it over your head. Now don't be self-conscious because as you will soon notice, everyone is dousing themselves with buckets of water. In that sheer moment as the ice cold water pours over you, comes one of the most enjoyable moments you will ever experience. It is sheer delight. Now for the third part, lie down on the uppermost bench, and the platza specialist will scrub you (actually beat you) with a broom made of fresh oak leaves, sopping with olive oil soap. The oak leaves contain a natural astringent, which will open your pours, remove toxins, and actually take off layers of dead skin. The sensation is so relaxing that one client described the platza as "Jewish acupuncture". Now, for the real men or woman: outside the Russian Room is an ice-cold bath, equal to the coldest region's of the Russian Front. Now, the trick here is to dunk yourself in as fast as you can. Once in the water, the transfer of your body from hot to cold will be the most exhilarating feeling you will ever have. Once dunked, you will probably feel like a car that just passed through a car wash, so here there is another rest area where bathers relax between stints in the sauna. There is a sign overhead that says, "There are no places like this anywhere within thousands of miles from here, so this must be the right place", at this point, you will nod your head and certainly agree! The late John Belushi and others used the baths in New York to steam away the after effects of too many drugs and booze. Actress Tia Carrere likens the place to a depressurizing time zone. "I walk through the door and my biorhythms instantly slow down, she says. It reminds me of the kind of place where Cleopatra would have gone." "The Dead Sea mud treatment is great for the skin." Rap impresario Russell Simmons views the baths as the perfect place for unwinding and impressing his model of the moment, he insists it's the ideal place to conduct business. You got two guys sitting there half-naked on the rock; you're talking, you're bonding, you're solidifying your relationship. It's a good place for making deals, especially if you're good with the heat and the other guy is getting his brains fried." Either way, it doesn't matter, whether you're rich or poor, fat or small, actor or struggling waiter, whether making a deal, or you're there to get the most reasonably priced massage of your lifetime. It just doesn't matter! What a way to rejuvenate! "There's no competition, like when you go to the gym, says Margaret, a 28-year old viola player who has been coming once-a-week for the last year. "At the gym, you see everybody trying to build up his or her bodies. Here, we just are the way we are- big, fat, tall, short, tiny, large breasted or flat-chested. You don't have to pretend," she says. "There's no need to defend against the beauties or the beasts." So don't be self-conscious, Take a one-day vacation and treat your body and soul to the deal of a lifetime. At only $25.00 dollars a day, it's a wonderful opportunity to do yourself a world of good. Stay by us! And for those of you who would like to stay longer we have luxurious ocean front townhouse vacation rentals which are only a step away from the Atlantic Ocean and a giant pool!</p>

WCVG-AM 1320 is a radio station licensed to Covington, KY and serving the Cincinnati, OH market. WCVG operates with 500 watts during daytime hours and 430 watts during nighttime hours from its tower site behind the Latonia Shopping Center in Covington, KY. WCVG's daytime signal is directional, and resembles a "figure-8" pattern that covers the Cincinnati market inside the I-275 loop. WCVG's nighttime pattern points to the south and west and does not cover much of the Ohio portion of the market. The northern Kentucky counties still have a listenable nighttime signal.</p>
<p>As of July 16, 2006, the station had flipped to a Regional Mexican format under Davidson Media Group.</p>
<p>WCVG started life in 1965 as WCLU, owned by WCLU Broadcasting Company headed by former Kansas City radio executine Irving Schwartz. WCLU was a daytime-only station that played "Modern Country" music and that went by the "Big CLU Country" nickname. The station also ran auto racing, Notre Dame football, and Cleveland Browns football. In 1981, WCLU switched to a rock and roll format. The city's former AM Top 40 station, WSAI, had flipped to country in 1978. WCLU had a decidedly "New Wave" sound until about 1983, when the station became "Cincinnati's Hit Playin' AM" and was dubbed "CLU-132." It was a moniker that sounded very similar to the city's FM Top 40 powerhouse station WKRQ, or "Q-102." In 1985, announcers on the station stopped calling it "CLU-132" and went with the easier to say and remember, "AM 1320 WCLU." In April 1987, Schwartz sold the station to Richard L. Plessinger, who also owned WJOJ-FM in Milford, Ohio. Plessinger immediately moved the station from Covington to the WJOJ studios in Milford. WCLU's call letters were changed to WCVG and the format became "Kwick-Sell Classifieds." During this format, the station played Soft Adult Contemporary music from the WJOJ library, and ran free on-air classified ads at specified times. The station also received permission from the Federal Communications Commission to operate with nighttime service during this time. In late 1987, WCVG flipped to a contemporary country format. That didn't last long as WCVG became the country's first "All Elvis" station in late 1987. According to a web site operated by former WCVG General Manager Rod Williams (<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~rodwilliams/" class="external free" title="http://members.tripod.com/~rodwilliams/" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/~rodwilliams/</a>), WCVG discontinued the "All Elvis" format on August 1, 1988. On that date, WCVG became an affiliate of the Business Radio Network with 24 hours of business news and talk. WCVG later became a County/Sports Talk mix format as "Sports-Country 1320" in 1992, with an emphasis on northern Kentucky high school and Cincinnati professional sports talk. In 1993, WCVG started a long run as the city's "Urban Gospel" station under LMA agreements with groups such as Kingdom Life Ministries. That ended in April 2006, when Plessinger flipped the station to Classic Country. A deal was made in July 2006 to sell the station to Davidson Media Group, an operator of Latino and Inspirational stations. Davidson flipped WCVG to Regional Mexican as "La Ley 1320" on July 16, 2006 under an LMA. An application to sell WCVG has been filed with the FCC.</p>
