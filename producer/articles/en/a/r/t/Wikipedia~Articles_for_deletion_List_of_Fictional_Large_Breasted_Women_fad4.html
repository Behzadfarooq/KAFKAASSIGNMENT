<li><b>Delete</b> obviously.

<li>Object on any grounds you want. There are many ways to set criteria for this list that would allow <i>verifiability</i>, just like with any other list. The point is, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lara_Croft_4ba5.html" title="Lara Croft">Lara Croft</a> as well as many fictional female characters, are known for breast size- a fact that also significantly inflated Angelina Jolie's bank account. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:27, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I've edited the article to make it possible to achieve verifiability; listed the single character for which we currently have a source citation; and moved the rest to the article's Talk page. If nobody reverts my changes and there's general consensus that the criteria I propose (bust measurement of 38 inches or more, attested by a verifiable source citation) I'll change my vote. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:00, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I, for one, have no problem with any criteria you want to impose, although I believe it's more a matter for contributing editors to hash out over time on the article talk page. Naturally, I would welcome your switch to keep.

<li>There is nothing indiscriminate here.

<li>Undoubtedly there is scope for an article on the fictional representation and objectification of women. No question. Whether it can be done without straying into OR I don't know, it probbaly can. And it will need to cover periods when fictional breasts (and the semi-fictional "ideal" portrayed by models) were small as well as large.

<li><b>Delete</b> - POV, or rather, two POVs. Seriously, in many cases, verifying a "38-inch breast" would be difficult to do for many fictional characters... and virtually impossible for cartoons. Does <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blondie_%28comic_strip%29.html" title="Blondie (comic strip)">Blondie</a> qualify?

<li><i>Does <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blondie_%28comic_strip%29.html" title="Blondie (comic strip)">Blondie</a> qualify?</i> Unfortunately, pending verification, no. We need more than visuals. Sorry. But these are good questions that need to be asked. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:33, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Difficult? Indeed it is very difficult. Fact-checking is always difficult. <i>But it is what is needed to build an encyclopedia.</i> What's required, of course, is not a measurement of Blondie's bust, but a good verifiable source citation in which someone says what her bust measurement is. It can be an estimate, but it needs to be a <i>published</i> estimate by someone reasonably <i>authoritative.</i> It can't just be the opinion of a Wikipedia editor. Perhaps there's an interview with Chic Young somewhere or something like that. If you think a specific bust measurement sets the bar too high, you could argue that all that should be required is a verifiable source citation describing Blondie as "busty" or "chesty" or "large-breasted." (Might be easier to find such a citation for L'il Abner's Daisy Mae... <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Newmar_b55c.html" title="Julie Newmar">Julie Newmar</a>... Mmmm....) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:43, 13 December 2005 (UTC) P. S. Or "buxom." "Buxom" is always good. I've already found a reference to Edie Adams playing a "buxom and bouncy Daisy Mae," but of course that is saying that Edie Adams was buxom, not that Daisy Mae was. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:47, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you may have mised an important part of the word "fact" there - this list is not about facts, it's about trivia relating to <i>fictional</i> characters.

<li>Well, here we go. Catherine Donaldson-Evans of Fox News—and you can't get more authoritative than Fox News, right? says <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137204,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137204,00.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> "By now, you'd think Blondie would be ready for retirement—after all, the buxom suburban housewife and star of her own comic strip recently turned 74." Anyway, a verifiable designation of Blondie as "buxom." You could say, her endowments are fair and balanced. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:30, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
