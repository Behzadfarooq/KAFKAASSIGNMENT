<li>There are heaps of people that write for the popular media, it doesn't necessarily make them notable. I could find no biographical information, birthdates etc. for this guy, with the information available he doesn't qualify for a biography. Also google isn't the ultimate measure of notability. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 04:05, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>If Geraghty got a few hundred hits or even a few thousand, I'd agree that the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Test_bb8b.html" title="Google Test">Google Test</a> might not support his inclusion. However, he gets over <b>40,000</b> hits.

Geraghty has had numerous articles (such as these <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/geraghty/geraghty200410081124.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/geraghty/geraghty200410081124.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/geraghty/geraghty200409150625.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/geraghty/geraghty200409150625.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) published in the print version of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Review_8dfa.html" title="National Review">National Review</a>, which has a much higher circulation that 5,000.

<li><b>Strongest Possible Keep</b>.

<li>Geraghty has mainly worked for <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Review_8dfa.html" title="National Review">National Review</a>, but he has also worked for States News Service <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Jim+Geraghty%22+%22States+News+Service%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Jim+Geraghty%22+%22States+News+Service%22" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and his work has been in major publications such as the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Globe_1f5c.html" title="Boston Globe">Boston Globe</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_%28magazine%29.html" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate</a>. National Review has many contributors and trying to include all their information on that article would be impractical. We keep obscure writers with a few hundred hits and schools that no one has ever heard of. Geraghty is a notable writer for a <b>major</b> publication. Someone with over 40,000 hits on Google deserves their own page. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 14:03, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Also note that Geraghty has been highly involved with the controversy over <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eason_Jordan_7e73.html" title="Eason Jordan">Eason Jordan</a> and has appeared on television for debates such this very recent one on PBS <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june05/blog_2-14.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june05/blog_2-14.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 14:11, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Ironically, Geraghty is linking to this page, gosh could this be a ploy to swing the vote? Hardly worth a debate unless you think censoring out people without your own viewpoint is a worthy endeavor.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Perhaps I'm overcompensating for my own bias by falling frequently on the keep side of pundits whose opinions I do <b>not</b> agree with, but this guy does seem notable: when PBS wants a conservative blogger voice, it sometimes picks him. &lt;POV&gt;Personally, I would have chosen <a href="http://allahpundit.com" class="external text" title="http://allahpundit.com" rel="nofollow">Allah is in the House</a> (except it appears to be offline, darnit) or <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com" class="external text" title="http://littlegreenfootballs.com" rel="nofollow">Little Green Footballs</a>, but that's because I prefer my right-wing nutjobs funny.&lt;/POV&gt; Anyway, he clears the notability bar for me. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperzonk_e38e.html" title="User:Hyperzonk">HyperZonk</a><sup><a href="../../../h/y/p/User_talk%7EHyperzonk_d4a7.html" title="User talk:Hyperzonk">talk</a></sup> 17:58, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. He's a fantastic writer, has done much for the conservative movement, and is read by tens of thousands of people a day. The only people who are trying to get him deleted are those who are politically motivated and want to stifle free expression.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just another blogger. Contrary to the article's claims, he did not play a key role in the <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killian_documents.html" title="Killian documents">Killian documents</a> story, he was just another voice in the chorus. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 05:10, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Leaning delete</b>. Haven't found evidence of him appearring in print. His name, by itself, gets &gt;50k hits, but if you try to get rid of the online-only hits, eg <i>"Jim geraghty" -online -nro</i>, it quickly drops to 6k hits, many of which still refer to his online presence. Anyone can boost hits via blogs/forums/rss. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 18:24, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I noted above, Geraghty also meets the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> because he's had articles published in the widely circulated print version of <i>National Review</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 19:46, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DEFINITE <b>KEEP</b>ER because he is a part of the history of the 2004 Presidential Election. He had scoops about the CBS story and the internals of the Bush 2004 campaign that will be important for future historians to know just how the Blogosphere was developed and how it became a force in American Politics. Liberals may disagree with him but I would say he is just as important to add to the wikipedia as probably Kos is. Because without telling either of those two names how are future historians going to know about this election? <i>unsigned comment from 70.21.52.143</i></li>
<li><b>Keep only if merged</b> with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Geraghty_0526.html" title="Jim Geraghty">Jim Geraghty</a>. No need for separate articles. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 22:21, 2005 Feb 27 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Recycling_Troll_5389.html" title="User:The Recycling Troll">The Recycling Troll</a> 09:41, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Agreeing with his politics should not be a criteria, it is whether he was involved with or has done anything significant. He was involved in the CBS document story and other stories pertaining to the election and his a current writer for NRO. All the other writers for NRO are considered worthy of Wikipedia. Needs to be merged with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Geraghty_0526.html" title="Jim Geraghty">Jim Geraghty</a>.<i>unsigned vote from 24.18.59.229</i>
<ul>
<li>No one is suggesting his politics should be a criteria. Many writers and reporters were "involved" with the CBS document story, he was not involved in any significant way. See <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killian_documents.html" title="Killian documents">Killian documents</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 21:25, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Geraghty did not break the forgery story but he reported it extensively on a day by day basis (essentially running the story) for NRO and National Review. That is what reporters do. While I would agree it was not to the same level as Powerline and LGF, it was significant. Most of the writers for <i>The Nation</i> have seperate pages as do all the other contributors for <i>National Review</i>. To describe Geraghty as "just another blogger" is not true.</li>
<li>KEEP: He's influential.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, primarily on the basis of being regularly published in print. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 20:38, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
