<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> (vote transfered to more recent comment) it is referenced in 60+ articles on the Wikipedia. The LFS site (which is non-commercial) as a whole attracts 25K page views a date with the wipipedia making up 6K of those. Alexa.com is OK for ranking the major sites but not relaible for medium sized sites as it has a limited reach with it’s toolbar so a small change in site visitors can represent a huge change in Alexa rating. Alternate sexuality has a large presence on the Wikipedia, supports this and provides a useful complementary service. It also published its own orginal articles and does not only republish Wikipedia stuff. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 22:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Fair point</b> but the content is mirrored in its entirity by Informed Consent (ranked 14880 by Alexa) and republished as the encyclopervia. while that does not fully comply with the criteria I think it does gives some independent evidence of its notability. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 06:31, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have evidence that Wipipedia meets the third criteria, which says that an article is notable if, "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." The website <a href="http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/encyclopervia/" class="external text" title="http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/encyclopervia/" rel="nofollow">InformedConsent.co.uk</a>, the largest BDSM in the UK (It is practically the first entry if you type BDSM in google) has a "Encyclopervia" which says that, "The articles are derived from the free-content London Fetish Scene Wipipedia and the Wikipedia." <a href="../../../i/s/d/User%7EISD_262f.html" title="User:ISD">ISD</a> 07:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC) <small>(Double vote crossed out, <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:21, 19 June 2006 (UTC)) I have swapped stikeouts since more recent <i>keep</i> is supported by relavent information <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 09:35, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>Hmm. I'd contest that assertion - there's no real indication that this "Informed Consent" site qualifies as a <i>well-known newspaper, publisher or broadcaster</i>. I understand what is meant by that is more in the way of traditional mainstream media outlets. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 15:24, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Within the BDSM community Informed Consent is a highly regarded and popular website dealing with serious issues about the lifestyle. Also, this is alternative sexuality we are talking about. I would think it highly unlikely that the New York Times would ever run a major feature on bondage safety and then cite the Wipipedia as a source&#160;:-) You have to look for notability with the the community who will make use of the the knowledge. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 16:51, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You could create the article Informed Consent (website), then - with proof of notability, as required per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. As it is, we have only assertions regarding the notability of either site - but what we need are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. And, no, we do not look for notability in an arbitrarily defined "community" - everything would be notable, then, depending on the definition of the community. We look for encyclopedic knowledge notable to the world at large, as measured by, again, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.</dd>
<dd>Forgive me if I am making an unwarrented assumption but I assume you have very little personal experience of the BDSM lifestyle or its resources. Surely it should be for editors with knowledge in this area to pass judgement on if a site is notable. The fact that Informed Consent is in the top 15,000 sites on the web should at the very least make it a serious canditate. You seem to be rejecting it without giving it a fair consideration. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 23:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Final Thought: I can understand the basis for wanting to delete this article. As has been stated, the Wikipedia is not a repository for every scrap of informtion however obscure, there needs to be a standard by which articles can be considered of sufficient merit for inclusion. If not then the Wikipedia risks drowning in a sea of trivia. The advantage of specialist Wikis like the Wipipedia is that they provide a repository for articles which, while being relevent to the community to which they apply, would not otherwise be considered notible enough for inclusion in the main Wikipedia. If they are to fulfill this function then people should be aware of their existance and links should be fostered between the Wikipedia and the specialist wikis. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 08:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I understand your point, too, but it's not the purpose of Wikipedia to foster the growth or success of external content providers, regardless of whether or not they are also wikis, and regardless of their content. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for advertisement. However, a mention of Wipipedia in an article on specialist wikis might be quite appropriate, and we could even redirect the "Wipipedia" link there. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 15:24, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the key issue is is the wikipedia making a valid contributon to the BDSM store of knowledge. If the wider audience feels that it is then commonsense might suggest that background article about the Wipipedia would be a legitimate entry on the Wikipeda. I think your point about being part of a wider article on specialist wikis is a valid one but would it be as much help to those readers wanting to exploring the BDSM subject matter? I think the rules need to be applied with a degree of flexibility. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 16:51, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The issue here is not whether Wikipedia is contributing (or ought to contribute) to BDSM knowledge. The issue is only whether Wipipedia is notable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, as attested by reliable sources. BDSM knowledge, or any knowledge for that matter, is not furthered by Wikipedia becoming an accumulation of non-notable trivia. Please understand, we do have to look at it that narrowly - otherwise any random accumulation of bytes is worth keeping as being somehow interesting or useful to someone. We, however, <a href="../../../8/w/_/WP%7E8W_03c1.html" title="WP:8W">are a general encyclopedia</a>, and no more. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 19:03, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You would not ask a non mathamatician if a mathamatical site was notable, the 'community' of mathamaticians would have to make that call. Within the sphere of BDSM you would be hard pressed to find a more non trivial site than Informed Consent with comparable reach. I accept that it does not have the same gravitas as Nature or the Times, but again this is AltSex we are talking about, if you applied the same rigour to the body of work on the topic as you are applying to this article you would loose 90% of the content and Wikipedia (in my opinion) would be the poorer for it. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 07:54, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
