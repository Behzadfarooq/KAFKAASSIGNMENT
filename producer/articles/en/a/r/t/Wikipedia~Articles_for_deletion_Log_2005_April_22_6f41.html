His multimillionaire wife "who owns six chemical industries" doesn't show up either. Some of his famous ancestors appear to have existed outside of this entry, but I'm dubious as to whether they were actually <i>his</i> ancestors.

<p>While plant hormone and the way that the control plant development and respond to stress is perfectly acceptable material for Wikipedia, these articles are not the way to do it. First of all they're essays and may include original research, <i>I hypothesize</i> pops up frequently in the text. Second, the way it is written both simplifies and complicates the issue at the same time, so anyone that read it and is not a plant biochemist (and even then...) is going to come out confused. Third, nothing is cited (which is why I'm not just merging the articles), this knowledge doesn't just exist it has come from years of research, this brings up two problems, people aren't being credited for their work, and everything in these massive articles would need to be fact checked and referenced, since it has been written to meet the authors hypothesis, literature has also been left out. So weighing all that up I am recommending that these be <b>deleted</b></p>

<p>I like this topic and 95% of the content, but the articles need to be overhauled and made "encyclopedic". To preserve them, remove speculation and any first person observations. Remove author's research unless truly widely recognized as field-advancing. Add links and references. Then it could be better than any of our endless cruft on tv and video game characters. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 03:04, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point! I said "probably", but even so I didn't quite word it correctly. I'm not worried about it sounding offensive, but I'm just saying that someone may take such offense that they vandalise or start an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a> to get rid of the content. I mean, if you started an article about, say, rapidly increasing gay suicide rates or something (potentially) objectionable like that, there'd be bound to be someone offended by it and would want it taken care of. So do Catholics count in the same "Political Correctness protect-o-bubble" as ethnic/sexual-orientation groups, or not? EDIT: I'm not saying that term to offend anyone/any group, it's just the briefest wording to explain how those groups are protected. Just thought I'd clear that up. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 23:45, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b>. I'm putting this article up for a vote for deletion after finding it in the articles to be cleaned up section. On the talk page a few people have commented on the ambiguity and POV nature of the article and I simply have no idea what to do with it. The article talks about two authors who already have seperate articles written about them. If you take away those two sections of the article, then there really isn't much substance left to the article at all. It's such an obscure and non-notable subject that I feel it would be best to delete it. I don't see any hope of a merger or cleanup. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandolph_ad84.html" title="User:Randolph">Randolph</a> 14:44, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete.</b> The article is not only factually bare, but also seems to be a mockery of the song. It provides no <i>real</i> information as to the nature of the song, its recording, and its significance. Although it does outline the "plot", the song really doesn't have much of a story. As such, an entire page devoted to the "story" is an insignificant waste of space.<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkinDownThirtyThree_318f.html" title="User:WalkinDownThirtyThree">WalkinDownThirtyThree</a> 16:05, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

Don't saddle admins with the responsibility of carrying out such merges; regular users can do this just fine, so they usually won't do it anyway.

All of these supposed elaborations on the power of a Discordian Pope are entirely in the mind of the author(s); the Principia just says that everyone is a Discordian Pope, and empowered to make up their own powers. None of this stuff reflects any sort of community consensus (this is Discordianism we're talking about) or any sort of canon (again, Discordianism). Any article that suggests some sort of structure or consensus in Discordianism should be taken with a massive grain of salt. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> 12:59, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment (not a vote)</b>. I'm the curator of Nathan's online gallery and was honored to find it listed in Wikipedia. There was a conference I attended in Canada where I spoke about Nathan and his art. There were numerous comments about how moved people were by his story and I'm speculating that someone wrote this Wikipedia entry based on that. You probably haven't heard of him before and you won't see his art in traditional galleries (it's all privately owned). As of today, Nathan McClain would be considered an underground artist with loyal supporters. The awareness of his art and who he was is getting greater attention. Nathan's listing here appears to be a very brief high-level summary; an extensive biography can be provided if needed. Hope this helps provide a context. Nmadmin 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Can you provide evidence that would help the community make this decision? For example, does McClain meet one or more of the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>? If so, can you cite <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> evidence of that? (You might also want to look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. It's not written for visual artists but it might give you a sense of the kinds of evidence that the community usually considers appropriate.

<li><b>Comment (response)</b>: After reviewing the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>, here's some supporting evidence. <i>Has the person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in the specific field?</i> There was a grassroots fundraising effort in the Fall of 2004 to save an 16 foot x 8 foot mural that Nathan painted. Because of Nathan's popularity, the Middle School he attended now owns this painting and it is displayed in their cafeteria. The saving of the painting involved people who did not know Nathan and was reported in the local paper, a local art zine, &amp; the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. A dedication ceremony/career retrospective is being planned for early June to not conflict with school activities. Also, there is a current effort to locate an Ozzie Smith painting that Nathan created which was auctioned off in 1996 when Ozzie retired from baseball. There was a feature about this and Nathan on the St. Louis Fox news affiliate. <i>Verifiablity</i> In addition to being the curator of his gallery, I was his best friend of 20 years - we met when he was 4 and I was 5. So all biographical details would be accurate and independently verifiable especially as more articles are written about Nathan. Presuming this Wiki entry is kept, I would be more than willing to supply a fuller biography than what exists today. Nmadmin 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Merely info about an all volunteer, free clinic. Not an advertisement at all. <b>Keep</b>. - bstone 03:43, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>C.A.L.M. is a non-commercial, volunteer-run, free health care clinic which operates and functions in order to provide 100% free health care to those in need. It functions at the annual Rainbow Gatherings in the summers, also a non-commercial event. It could not be further from an advertisement. Please go to <a href="http://www.welcomehome.org/rainbow/calm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.welcomehome.org/rainbow/calm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> CALM to check out CALM for yourself
<ul>
<li>I never said it was a commercial adverisement. (I called it a promotional and said that it didn't establish notability.) But <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a place to promote any organizations, whether commercial or not. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 21:57, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>You seemingly know nothing about Rainbow Gatherings. By definition, they (the people who attend) are non-members of the largest non-organization in the world. (Stone)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. Despite what others have said, these guys are pretty notable. They're crosslinked by a lot of alternate healing web sites, and have been written up in serious newspapers maybe a half-dozen times. It doesn't make sense to merge them with <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainbow_Gathering_8806.html" title="Rainbow Gathering">Rainbow Gathering</a> because they do operate away from the annual gathering. I do suspect that they're simply another name for the collective that runs the Rainbow Gathering, but that bunch doesn't have an article to merge with. ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 23:24, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
