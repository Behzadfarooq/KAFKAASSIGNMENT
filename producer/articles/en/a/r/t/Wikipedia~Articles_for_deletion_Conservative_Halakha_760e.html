This question should be addressed in an AfM discussion, not an AfD. Finally, the Conservative movement made a very controversial decision last week about the issue of homosexuality. This article is the only place in Wikipedia that contains a detailed discussion of that decision. The AfD process should not be used to eliminate valid information about controversial (and notable) topics.

<li><b>Comment</b> <s>The nominator has clarified that the AfD nomination is based, not on a POV fork, but on a personal religious disagreement witht the subject of the article. The nominator wants this article deleted because he believes that "Halakha is not a concern in Conservative Judaism," and has gone so far as to clarify that he believes that articles on "<i>decision-making bodies</i>", such as the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_on_Jewish_Law_and_Standards_b696.html" title="Committee on Jewish Law and Standards">Committee on Jewish Law and Standards</a>, also "qualify for an extra speedy delete", not because they fail to meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, or other legitimate Wikipedia policy criteria, but because the nominator personally disagrees with them on religious grounds.

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrummerThanThou_10f7.html" title="User:FrummerThanThou">User:FrummerThanThou</a>'s blanket statements, such as&#160;:"Conservative Judaism and Jews rely on traditional <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halacha.html" title="Halacha">Halacha</a> when they seek a ruling" and that they "are entirely dependant on Orthodox Jewish halachic decision-making bodies and rabbis for their ruling, when they seek one" reveal an utter lack of familiarity with the present-day Conservative movement and if anything only reveals the nominator's POV tilt (it's there if you know the issues well.) But it's all done by a kind of twisted faulty logic, which goes something like this: "Conservative Judaism uses Halakha like everyone else (meaning like the Orthodox, because the Reform don't use it at all) in that they 'rely' on the same (read: 'Orthodox') Halakhic books and rabbis in making decisions, which means that their 'Conservative Halakha' is really 'the same' as the standard (read: 'Orthodox') Halakha and should not be classed differently. Real-world issues and facts that the Conservatives dispute, such as accepting the Divine origins of the Torah, that it was given in its entirety by <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_God_in_Judaism_474b.html" title="Names of God in Judaism">God</a> to <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a> at Sinai, the sanctity and observing the <a href="../../../6/1/3/613_mitzvot.html" title="613 mitzvot">613 mitzvot</a>, and very up-to-date issues such as ordaining gay rabbis, are either not mentioned or overlooked, because, after all, the Conservatives do give official <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lip_service" class="extiw" title="wikt:lip_service">lip service</a> to (read: 'Orthodox') "Halakha" even though as the Conservatives go about their lives in reality they <b>neither</b> respect <b>nor</b> practice <i>any</i> Halakha the way <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Judaism</a> does." The point here being, that one cannot at the same time do contrary functions: To <i>claim</i> absurdly that the Conservatives practice a Halakha that is also central to Orthodoxy at the same time that they (the Conservatives) openly and publicly break with the Halakah (as understood and practiced by Orthodoxy) and that is the very <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lifeblood" class="extiw" title="wikt:lifeblood">lifeblood</a> Orthodoxy -- but not of Conservatism since they are not bound by the <i>literal</i> strictures of the Halakha and the <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shulkhan_Arukh_691a.html" title="Shulkhan Arukh">Shulkhan Arukh</a> (how many Conservatives even know what the <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shulkhan_Arukh_691a.html" title="Shulkhan Arukh">Shulkhan Arukh</a> is or means?) This is what is called a <b><a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_argument.html" title="Circular argument">circular argument</a></b> that underlies the faulty premise behind this nomination in the first place, and borders on a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/farce" class="extiw" title="wikt:farce">farce</a>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 01:02, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

On the other hand, if the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">Halakha</a> page described Halakha and fairly summarized Conservative, Orthodox, and any other points of view (with pointers to specific articles for more detail), then there certainly is enough material about Conservative Halakha to merit its own page, like <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a> and Conservative Responsa. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEqualsMCSquared_05c5.html" title="User:EqualsMCSquared">EqualsMCSquared</a> 23:23, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>How about this</b>: Merge the section "Specific Jewish-law decisions" to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_responsa.html" title="Conservative responsa">Conservative responsa</a>, merge "Jewish observance in the context of Conservative Halakha" into <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a>, merge "Differences from Orthodox theology" into <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_on_Jewish_Law_and_Standards_b696.html" title="Committee on Jewish Law and Standards">Committee on Jewish Law and Standards</a> or <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">Halakha</a>. The title <i>Conservative responsa</i> is better than <i>Conservative Halakha</i> for the bulk of the material since it only refers to responsa that are rejected by Orthodox Judaism.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is obvious from the above discussion, and particularly IZAK's comments, that Conservative Halaka is a different code than Orthodox Halaka, and that most people outside the Conservative branch of Judaism probably do intend Orthodox Halaka when they use the word Halaka. This proves the need for 2 separate articles. (There is also Reform H, let others say what they will). The two traditions have diverged, and one of them denies the legitimacy of the other--IZAK is not eccentric in saying this. But while he is entitled to his POV that only OH is legitimate, it is clearly a POV, and he has no right to try to impose it on a neutral encyclopedia. The name here can be shown to be what the movement itself uses, and that makes it the standard name.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would use the name "Halaka" for the orthodox, traditional code. Not because it is necessarily the authentic code or tradition, for it is no business of WP to deny or affirm that. Rather, because when Halaka is used by itself outside Judaism, the traditional Halaka is what is intended and it is thus the standard name.</dd>
<dd>But two articles. It would otherwise be like discussing Australian and New Zealand Law in the same article. Considering the natureof this discussion, and the very intense religious meaning it has for many, I think i need to say that I haven't the least connection with any Jewish denomination. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 01:50, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I will reinstate my position as somewhat more neutral then before but still for a stead fast <b>delete</b> as apposed to a <b>merge</b> or <b>rename</b>. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> has made me aware of a conservative rabbinical body I was previously unaware the role of in the Halachic field, but I have examined the article and its sources and am not swayed. I obviously can't nom this "halachic body" for deletion, since they seriously think themselves to be a halachic authority and made plenty of press releases which the press payed attention to which makes them notable in a crazy world. I still dont think, how ever crazy the world is, this body have established a Halachic doctrine that can call itself "Conservative Halacha". They have only made some rulings, allowances and decisions to keep their own boat afloat. It would take allot more off their behalf to establish a "Conservative halacha" then with their current activity.</li>

<dd>Here is the definition of halcha according to the <b>Random House Unabridged Dictionary</b>.</dd>

<ol>
<li>{often lowercase) the entire body of Jewish law and tradition comprising the laws of the Bible, the oral law as transcribed in the legal portion of the Talmud, and subsequent legal codes amending or modifying traditional precepts to conform to contemporary conditions.</li>
<li>A law or tradition established by the Halakhah.</li>

<dd>What they would need to do in order to get their own Halacha is to reenact the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Mount_Sinai_73d2.html" title="Biblical Mount Sinai">revelation at Sinai</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> per DGG we should have two separate articles and make it clear that "Orthdox Halachah" and "Conservative Halachah" are very different things. Now, one could argue that "Halachah" should maybe be renamed "Orthodox Halachah" however that would be a discussion issue on that page, not here. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:55, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>In response to Frummer's revised posting, I comment:</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a basic tenant of orthodox Judaism that there is only one Judaisim, and only one Halakah, and it is the one that they profess. Thus for them there can be no Conservative Halakah, or Conservative Judaism--the followers of these paths are heretics, though perhaps nearer to the true religion than Reform Halakah and Reform Judaism. The only people who believe this are Orthodox Jews. Whether or not they are in truth the only authentic tradition is a matter of faith. Conservative Judaism is quite clear that its traditions are equally old, are equally based on the same Revelation, and continue the tradition of earlier Jewish law--which, as Frummer knows very well and in more detail than I, has never been uniform.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>His argument is a statement of purely religious point of view--and in what I fear is the most inappropriate form, within and without WP--not letting others have their say in their own words.</dd>

<li>Perhaps this is just an issue of semantics, but the reasoning that DGG is giving (i.e. "its traditions are equally old") is precisely why there is no such thing as "Conservative Halakha". Both the Orthodox and Conservative movements believe that they are following the same body of laws. The difference lies in each movement's respective interpretation of those laws. There is no such thing as Orthodox Halakha or Conservative Halakha -- only <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">Halakha</a>. This is a fundamental tenet of the Conservative movement. I stand by my original vote to rename. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 23:49, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I second you DLand, also DGG claim that Conservative Judaism's traditions are "equally old" to Orthodox Judaism and "equally based on the same Revelation", and "continue the tradition of earlier Jewish law" are unfounded. The term "Conservative" in relation to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a> has actualy nothing to do with "conserving", traditional Jewish beleif and Halakha. They are a secular denomination with no interest in forming their own Halakhic doctrine. <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrummerThanThou_10f7.html" title="User:FrummerThanThou">frummer</a> 04:35, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> My prior vote for <b>Keep</b> still stands, but given the general desire to merge or rename, if a merge is to be the outcome of this AfD, I believe the best place to merge would be <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_responsa.html" title="Conservative responsa">Conservative responsa</a>. The article title "Conservative responsa" acknowledges that the Conservative decision-making process is based on a different philosophy which in an important minority of cases results in different outcomes from the Orthodox approach, while sidestepping questions of the meaning of those differences. Whether Conservative Halakha is "the same" as Orthodox Halakha in some philoophical sense, Conservative responsa, the records and products of the decision-making process, are acknowledged as being different in a way that appears to be less controversial.

<dd>I think merging it to Conservative view of Halakha or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_responsa.html" title="Conservative responsa">Conservative responsa</a> would be more suitble then its current title, yes. <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrummerThanThou_10f7.html" title="User:FrummerThanThou">frummer</a> 03:43, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
