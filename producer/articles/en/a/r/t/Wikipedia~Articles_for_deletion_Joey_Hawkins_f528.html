<li>You haven't given a valid reason to delete the post. You're uncertain Hawkins "is even remotely notable", but you fail to articulate what is notable, at least for an entry on Wikipedia.

<li>I suppose if I said I could care less about 85% of these entries, that wouldn't suffice. We can't all have common interests. But even people for fail to appreciate high school football can appreciate a man who is one of the best in his field. He's reached the pinnacle of his profession four of the last five seasons.

<li>Whilst that might be your opinion, it is not actually the policy of wikipedia, see <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">Wikipedia:sock puppet</a>. Whilst a user is encouraged to create an account, they are not required to. Whilst a closing admin may choose to ignore suspected sock puppets, they are not required to. As the policy stands right now, an IP address can vote. If you think that this should be changed, your should comments in the sock puppet channel. As it stands, the current definition of sock puppet is someone who creates additional accounts to impersonate someone else. This is not the case here. This is merely someone who has yet to create an account. Please be nice to newbies and encourage their participation.

<li>Thanks. I assume that you are the author. Please sign yourself with 4 tildes (~~~~) at the end so that we know who you are. As you have already voted here, you can't vote again. It is unfortunate that a lot of people are suspicious of new users at present. I hope that you continue to contribute, and even if this is deleted, that you are not disheartened, and that you continue to try to have a go. Why not try to add to existing articles? It is a lot safer, and less likely to raise questions about you. Consider following redlinks and create articles that are requested to be created rather than creating your own, at least for a while. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 09:43, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Comment: Is it really necessary to make a separate section to accuse someone of sock puppetry? Sock puppetry is supposed to be when someone is impersonating someone else. I see no evidence of this. This is just someone who has yet to make an account.

<li><b>Weak keep and dab</b>; this is the kind of article which Wikipedia should definitely include some day. The question is when? Considering the recent work on <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Academy_7655.html" title="Jackson Academy">Jackson Academy</a>, and the detail of the article, I think we can keep this one. I do wish the contributors would also fix up <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianola%2C_Mississippi_dcf9.html" title="Indianola, Mississippi">Indianola, Mississippi</a>, though. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj">+</a> 13:40, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No vote, but this is a very well done article and I think that if we were at the point that [[User:Sj] thinks we should be at someday, I agree that this coach (with that many state championships) would be included. I am not sure that we'll ever be there and right now this doesn't fit our criteria, IMO. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 00:13, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as this is one of the best articles ever that never should've been written. I hope we never reach <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">Sj</a>'s point, and keep high school coaches forever out of the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 02:49, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
