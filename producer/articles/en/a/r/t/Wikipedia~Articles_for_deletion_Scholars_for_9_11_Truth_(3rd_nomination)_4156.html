<p><b>DELETE</b> - Simply, there is no claim to noteability. The article asserts no more noteability than the fact that it exists, and websites aren't entitled to articles simply because they exist.

<li><b>RESPONSE</b> - No, it does not. The criteria listed at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> are: <i>"1)The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself. 2)The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation. 3)The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster</i>." To the best of my knowledge, it satisfies none of those. - <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 01:51, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Mass deletions of content seem to have been made to make this article appear more deletable. There are at least a few notable individuals who are members of the group. The whole 9/11 revisionism issue is a hot one, and I don't see why the encyclopedia would benefit from removing a reference to such a group. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">Dick Clark</a> 02:20, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - the page history demonstrates that all the notable information has been removed before the deletion tags have been placed.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, they've gotten some news mentions and have an online presence, but I didn't find any articles about the group itself in a major publication. Instead, they appear to be mentioned when a journalist needs a quote from the conspiracy side or, more commonly, when someone writes a commentary or a letter to the editor (sometimes written by the group itself). As others have suggested, an article about 9/11 revisionism might be good. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:55, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, not sure if this is worth an article, but it is evident that the current version has been reached through massive trimming of what appears to be a better article. Granted, even the less mutilated version needs massive work, but <i>"needs work"</i> is not equal to <i>"delete"</i>. <b>Merge</b> sounds reasonable.<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <font color="green"><a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a></font><sup><a href="../../../n/e/s/User_talk%7ENescio_071f.html" title="User talk:Nescio"><font color="blue">Gnothi seauton</font></a></sup> 11:07, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article was clearly vandalised before the deletion mention was put on.

<li><b>Delete</b> The organisation is notable but this article is awful. And in the current political climate on wikipedia, no move to improve it will be tolerated by some POV pushing users and admins. Much better that it is deleted until wikipedians mature a little and a proper article can be written. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Seabhcán</a> 13:56, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Does anyone else find it odd this article would come up for deletion after almost its entire contents had been removed including the published articles by proffesors? Links to radio shows removed, list of members etc. Oddly enough on of the members wiki page he is stated to be a member of this group yet, he was removed for it not being sourced. Who else would state its members other then the organization itself? I have reverted the article before the wholesale deltion of contents occured. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> 14:00, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The organisation is clearly notable, is frequently mentioned in news articles (today hits on google news as well as yahoo news), was also described in the foreign press (e.g. Junge Welt, Germany, French articles). The organisation does not need Wikipedia to be known, but Wikipedia would loose content that is useful for the interested public. Efforts should be made, though, to keep certain users from vandalizing the article. Rkrichbaum 14:10, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

From the website: "I have just spent several frustrating hours trying to revise and improve the entry on "Scholars for 9/11 Truth", only to discover that my rewrites were being over-ridden by someone at Wikipedia." <i>Bottom line</i>: This guy is a POV pusher, trying to use wikipedia as a web server in an attempt to give credibility to his project that is looking more dubious the more i look into it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">THE KING</a> 18:45, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So are you suggesting that Fetzer created the article, or that he is inappropriately editing it? It seems to me that the latter claim shouldn't be grounds for deletion, but rather grounds for caution about POV-pushers lurking about. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">Dick Clark</a> 18:53, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The latter, and i agree that that in itself is no grounds for deletion. But it is a warning about POV-pushers, hence the comment. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">THE KING</a> 18:59, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think its even more harmless then that if you read the link listed, he was simply trying to add information to the article, albeit POV centric. However alot fo the information he tried to add that was removed is actually legitimate. Also this group obviously meets the popularity standard. The google hits alone show that. Also I used that link as a source cause Metzer himself is admitting to being in the group something one of the vandals who removed all the information repeatedly stated need citing as their member list needs to verified by a secondary source, which is pretty ludicrous assertion. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> 19:03, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, unfortunately. The group is notable, although seriously misguided (IMHO) (The article should assert the group's notablility, though, which it doesn't, at present.)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Much of the support to delete articles on this subject, see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/9/11_Truth_Movement" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/9/11_Truth_Movement" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, is obviously intended as censorship. The language used to describe the advocates of the article; ‘crackpots’, ‘loonies’, ‘conspirators’, ‘worthless’, ‘tin pot wackos’, etc., shows strong subjective bias. ‘Not Notable’ entries ignore the tens of thousands of hits on Google, proving this article outranks many other articles found here. Most impressively notable is the recent Zogby poll <a href="http://www.911truth.org/images/911TruthZogbyPollFinalReport.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.911truth.org/images/911TruthZogbyPollFinalReport.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> which demonstrates extremely strong public interest. Isn’t it the purpose of Wikipedia to provide information for those who wish to learn more about a subject at hand? Does it not degrade Wikipedia to allow censorship by those who simply do not subscribe to certain views on a subject? If people aren’t interested, or don’t want to learn about this subject, they can simply bypass it. But those who are interested should find it here. After all, who needs reference material that disallows controversial subject matter?--<a href="../../../k/o/l/User%7EKolateral_339b.html" title="User:Kolateral">Kolateral</a> 05:35, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Excellent point. And to add to it, a lot of the initiative to close down this page and other controversial pages like it, seems to be coming from those who look to the mainstream media for what is true and authoritative. It is useful to remember that much of that media is owned by huge corporate interests. For example, GE, one of the world's largest munitions manufacturers, owns NBC. And the Carlyle Group, also a munitions investor, and with whom the Bush family has strong ties, has a huge <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3995.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3995.htm" rel="nofollow">contract</a> to rebuild infrastructure in Iraq after those munitions companies have made a fortune blasting it to hell, on the pretext of WMD. So as far as trusting mainstream to give a full and balanced picture, remember the vested interests behind the media, and also the fact that the only unifying voice that objective and concerned citizens really have is the Internet. So let's not knock the groups they form there too much. They are not crackpots until proven so, which is why a proper 9/11 inquiry is needed. Let's have some respect here, and recognize their existence on the <i>people's democratic Wikipedia</i>.--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPureLogic_0f7c.html" title="User:PureLogic">PureLogic</a> 20:23, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
