<li><b>Decline</b>. Please note that articles should be written in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. How cool you find someone is not appropriate for an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> article. Also, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> plays a role here. Aspiring is not enough to get an entry in Wikipedia. A person needs to have actualled released CDs or starred in films.

<p>Anthony Carr is an alleged ‘Psychic’ residing in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Born on 6 December 1943 in Canada, Mr Carr alleges that he ‘discovered’ his psychic powers late in life, which he attributes to his alleged <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohawk.html" title="Mohawk">Mohawk</a> ancestry. Mr Carr claims that he is the ‘seer without peer’ and that the is the ‘world’s most documented psychic’ and a ‘modern day ‘<a href="../../../n/o/s/Nostradamus.html" title="Nostradamus">Nostradamus</a>’. He is also associated with ‘Boss Communications’, and has been accused of fake readings, and retailing mass produced ‘readings’ and cheap jewellery. Mr Carr runs his business via the internet, and also via mail outs.</p>
<p>In May 2001 the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_New_South_Wales_2c70.html" title="Supreme Court of New South Wales">Supreme Court of New South Wales</a> (<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>) issued a <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injunction.html" title="Injunction">injunction</a> pursuant to section 65 of the NSW Fair Trading Act(a State based piece of consumer protection legislation similar to the Commonwealth <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Practices_Act_5c1f.html" title="Trade Practices Act">Trade Practices Act</a>) on Mr Carr, for <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misleading_and_deceptive_conduct.html" title="Misleading and deceptive conduct">misleading and deceptive conduct</a> (unreported). Allegedly, Boss Communications (operating under the names of Anthony Carr, Valerie Taylor and United Equity Limited) sent out letters offering cheap jewellery for inflated prices (i.e. ‘genuine diamond necklace’ for $19.97, valued by the regulator at $1.50), ‘psychic readings’ of good fortune (for $30), and ‘personnel guidance’ (for $30).</p>
<p>The Court found that these readings were mass produced, and that the products offered were substandard. The Court judged this conduct to be in contravention of the Act, which provides variously that a person shall not engage in <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misleading_or_deceptive_conduct.html" title="Misleading or deceptive conduct">misleading or deceptive conduct</a>, give false representations, or engage in ‘unconscionable conduct’. The NSW Office of Fair Trading was successful in securing an injunction under s 65 of the Act, preventing $150,000 in return payments (over 5,500 cheques and credit-card payments) from reaching Boss Communications. Furthermore, an injunction was placed pursuant s 75 of the Act, preventing NSW residents from sending cheques, credit card payments or money to Boss Communications (or the other joint defendants).</p>
<p>The case was hailed as the first major victory against con artists via mail in NSW, and was praised by the then NSW Minister for Fair Trading, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Watkins_179e.html" title="John Watkins">John Watkins</a>. The case was one of the reasons that the Australian/New Zealand Scam Mail Working Party was formed.</p>

<p>Alan Wolffe (June 21st, 1959 - May 26th, 2001), was a cell biologist known for his pioneering demonstration that the chromosomal organisation of genes is a dynamic phenomenon determining their expression, cell division and differentiation.</p>
<p>He married Elizabeth and had two children, Max and Katherine.</p>
<p>Wolffe was born on June 21st, 1959 at Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. He was successful at biology early on, receiving the Biological Council Prize upon leaving secondary school. He then attended Oxford University, receiving a first class B.A. degree in 1981. He did his PhD under Prof. Jamshed Tata at the National Institute for Medical Research, London. He was awarded an EMBO long-term postdoctoral fellowship in 1984 and moved to the laboratory of Donald D. Brown at the Department of Embryology, Carnegie Institution of Washington in Baltimore. He joined the National Institute of Health in 1987, working firstly with Gary Felsenfeld in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases). In 1990 he was appointed Chief of the newly founded Laboratory of Molecular Embryology (LME). He left NIH and moved to the biotechnology firm Sangamo BioSciences Inc. in Richmond, California in 2000, as Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Office. He was a prolific writer, publishing hundreds of articles, reviews and two books. He will be known mainly for his work in promoting the idea that chromatin plays a dynamic role in regulating gene expression.</p>
<p>He died as a result of injuries suffered in a road accident in Rio de Janerio on May 26th, 2001.</p>

<p>This refers to a flight operated by Continental Airlines between Agana, Guam (GUM) and Honolulu, HI (HNL). The reason it is called the island hopper is because it makes several stops in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Marshall Islands and for at least some of these islands, is the only scheduled commercial service to get around. The flight used to stop at Johnston Island, a US millitary installation but no longer does so. The flight is currently operated with Boeing 737s certified to fly over water, however in the past it was operated by a 727. Continental also operates a nonstop flight between Honolulu and Guam with a larger, two-aisle 767 jet. The term "island hopper" only refers to the smaller 737 that makes all the stops. Currently, the flight makes stops in Chuuk (Truk), Pohnpei, Kosrae, Kwajlein, and Majuro. Guam is a hub for Continental Micronesia</p>

<p><b>C</b>uento (pl. cuentos). According to the <i>New College Spanish Dictionary</i>, the Spanish word <i>cuento</i> literally means "story" or "tale." Idioms using this word, translated into English, include: <i>contar un cuento</i> - to tell a story; <i>cuento de hadas</i> - fairy tale; <i>cuento de fantasmas</i> - ghost story; <i>cuento de viejas</i> - old wives' tale; <i>va de cuento</i> - the story goes, or it is said; <i>cuento folklórico</i> – folk tale. Cuentos may specifically refer to folktales, a category of folklore that includes stories passed down through oral tradition. The word <i>cuento</i> may also be used as a verb to say "tell," as if you are "telling" a story ("Cuento").</p>
<p>Latin American tales are unique in that they may represent a time before European invasion, and they may combine those traditions with the history and culture that arrived post-conquest. When the Spaniards came to Latin America in the 16th century, the indigenous people were forced to assimilate their culture with the Europeans'. Likewise, the content of the stories differed between the ages. However, there are few resources on cuentos for pre-conquest indigenous peoples in South America. A folklorist specializing in Spain and Spanish-originated folklore, Aurelio M. Espinosa discovered that "most of the Spanish folklore which is found today in the Spanish-speaking countries of America is of traditional Spanish origin" (Espinosa 128). Pre-conquest information can only be found in what is left; this includes archaeological artifacts, sculpture and pottery, stories engraved in bone, shell, and stones, and codices. Only seventeen codices are intact, "fifteen of which are known to predate the Colonial era, and two of which originated either before the Conquest or very soon after" (Read and Gonzalez 15).</p>
<p>With the knowledge that the natives in Latin America were made to blend culturally with the Spaniards when they arrived, are Latin American stories very similar to Spanish stories, or do they deserve separate study? Terrence L. Hansen, a Latin American folklorist, attempted to index 1,747 folktales into 659 indexes such as "animal tales," "magic tales," “religious tales,” and "jokes and anecdotes." The purpose of the study was to make "accessible to folklorists both the individual types and the broad picture of the folktale in a large part of Spanish America" (Hansen 90). Ralph S. Boggs, a folklorist who studied Spanish and other European folktales, also compiled an index of tales across ten nations, one of these nations Spain. Hansen notes that in Boggs' "A Comparative Survey of the Folktales of Ten Peoples," Spain also had a large number of animal tales, pointing out the "marked interest in such tales in Spain and in Spanish America" (Hansen 93); however, he indicates that Boggs' study showed Spain with a much lower percent of magic tales. After several such comparisons showing very close similarities as well as almost-opposite differences, he concluded that the index-analysis should be conducted for the other Spanish-speaking parts of the Americas before any explicit conclusions can be made about folktales in Latin America. Whether or not Latin American folktales should be compared to Spanish folktales as if they were a subcategory was not mentioned in the article; however, with differences in religion, tradition, history and other such elements that can turn a story into an entirely new direction, it is possible that folklorists will regard Latin American tales unique to Spanish tales in the future.</p>

Wtfux originally started as a joke to make fun of the current head moderator of 4chan, WTSnacks, but it evolved into a haven for those banned from other message boards like iichan.net and 4chan.org. Among the message boards available are the very popular camwhore board, a plethora of porn and hentai boards, and a few niche boards like gaming, user art, and technology.</p>

<p>Although there have been many intentions to redevelop the shopping centre, nothing had even materialized. The major changes within the shopping centre during this time were the closure of the Myer Department Store in the mid 1990’s, and its replacement with a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harris_Scarfe_c86b.html" title="Harris Scarfe">Harris Scarfe</a> Department Store. In 2001 the collapse of the Franklins supermarket chain resulted in the Colonnades store being purchased by <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woolworths.html" title="Woolworths">Woolworths</a> Australia’s largest supermarket chain. Due to the small size, and odd shape of the store Woolworths, a chain that prides itself as ‘the fresh food people’ opened with limited fresh produce lines, no in-store bakery, no service delicatessen, and limited fresh meat.</p>

<p>Centro, who had recently purchased the centre, announced their plans to redevelop. Work on the redevelopment started in 2005. On completion the centre will contain a new mall comprising a full line <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woolworths.html" title="Woolworths">Woolworths</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_W_b7de.html" title="Big W">Big W</a> Discount Department Store, and over 100 new specialty shops. The centre will also contain a Best for Less and JB-HI superstore.</p>
<p>On March 27th 2006 the second stage of the redevelopment was opened, revealing the new Woolworths, Big W and over 60 specialty shops.</p>
<p>The entire project is expected to be completed by late 2006.</p>

<p>A term used in geology and paleontology for a problematic structure that looks like a fossil, but whose biologic origin is uncertain.. (From Latin <i>dubius</i>, + fossil). It has been mainly used for remains found in rocks dating from the early history of the Earth (Precambrian rocks), but is also applicable in other settings, such as, for example, problematic microbe-like forms in meteorites.</p>
<p>Although ultimately such structures are either biogenic (i.e., fossils) or abiogenic (i.e., pseudofossils), the information available at the time of study is insufficient to make an unambiguous determination. They belong to the dubiofossil category temporarily, awaiting additional evidence that will allow them to be removed from this category and attributed to the fossils or the pseudofossils.</p>
<p>Living systems are capable of metabolism, reproduction, mutation, and propagation of the mutations. Lines of evidence for biogenicity, called biosignatures, come in various forms and appear at various scales, ranging from the atomic to the planetary dimension. Molecule-building, cell division, colony formation, respiration, excretion, active motility are amongst the biologic processes that effect changes in the environment and can leave distinctive morphologic features or signature chemical by-products in the geologic record. These are susceptible to be modified or obliterated over geologic time, making it more difficult to recognize them in the rocks. The case for biogenicity is most robust when multiple lines of evidence converge.</p>

The E.P is download only this caused some problems on the first day of release as errors in the download system meant that some fans had a lot of problems reciving the files after paying for them.

They consist of a deep hole into which the user can defecate or urinate. Provided they are not used too frequently they require little maintenance. Longdrops are most often used at remote campsites and are sometimes sheltered by a wooden outhouse.</p>

<p>January 8, 2002 at 1:30-1:40 pm, artist Tom Hendricks created a conceptual art event that attacked the abuses of conceptual art and suggested a possible end of modern art. Hendricks was walking home from a Taco Bueno fast food restaurant on Lemmon Avenue in Dallas Texas when it dawned on him how to protest the abuses of modern art. Specifically he would attack Martin Creed who won the annual Turner Prize that goes to the best art work from a British artist younger than 50. The prize was a check for $31,500 handed to Creed by pop star Madonna.</p>
<p>Hendricks, "I worked hard to have some scope to my art: portraits, landscapes, still lifes, abstracts, and just about everything in between." In contrast Creed got the check for his exhibit of flashing light bulbs in an empty room. Previous works included a scrunched-up piece of paper and a ball of clay stuck to a wall. British art curator Simon Wilson said about Creed's work, "He wants to make art where he is doing as little as possible that is consistent with doing something. The fact that many people find his work so baffling indicates that he's working on the edge." Hendricks, in his protests, suggests that modern art at its worst is consistently depressing, disjointed, lacking in the ability to communicate, and seldom has scope.</p>
<p>Hendricks said, "And then it dawned on me. I would bring modern art to its end. I would suggest the ultimate, the ultimate in baffling minimalism. I would get the plastic check from Madonna."</p>
<p>"So on Tuesday, 1/08/02 at 1:30-1:40 p.m., as I, Tom Hendricks was walking home from the taco place, I took art to its ultimate. This was the last minute of modern art. It could go no further. Where Creed had flashing lights in an empty room, I would imagine a gallery in my mind that would have no lights on at all! And that moment marked the end of modern art."</p>
<p>Publishing history of The End Of Modern Art manifesto: It's first printed version was in the zine Musea #108, March 2002 It was posted on the ULA website, literary revolution.com It was posted as 'The Last Minute of Modern Art' on artellawordsand art.com</p>

<p>Lincoln Greens, located in Springfield, Ilinois, is a public golf course owned and operated by the Springfield Park District.</p>
<p>As of 2004, the par 72 course measured approximately 6,500 yards from the blue tees. It is one of the yearly hosts for both the Central Illinois Amateur as well as the Springfield (IL) City Tournament. It also hosts the 14-16 year old division of the Bob Drysdale Junior Golf Tournament every July.</p>
<p>The course was built in 1957 by Robert B. Harris and was originally a privately owned course. Declining revenues and poor course maitenance in the 1990s prompted the Springfield Park District to purchase the course. In 2005, the signature hole, the par three 8th (130 yards), underwent new changes. A pond (originally there up until a few decades ago) was reimplemented on the right half, as well as an assortment of new bunkers on the right side of the green. Over the last 20 years, the front and back nines have flip-flopped numerous times, now resting at its original placement.</p>
<p>Lincoln Greens is partially surrounded by Lake Springfield, with the lake coming into play on two holes.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, Lincoln Greens hosted the IHSA Boys' Golf State Tournament, and has hosted regionals and sectionals sporadically throughout the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>In 2004 Lincoln Greens hosted the IHSA boy's golf Rochester regional, with the advancing teams being Rochester (326), Decatur St. Teresa (327), and Raymond Lincolnwood (324). Low place medalist was Tommy Bleifnik with a 4 over-par 76.</p>
<p>As of 2006, the pro at Lincoln Greens is James (Jim) Sutzer.</p>

<p>The Blotto Box was a concept designed by "King Blotto", a telephone <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phreak.html" title="Phreak">phreak</a>. The box was designed to cause every phone within an area code (or an even greater area) to ring, and if answered, emit a huge amount of voltage from the handset. This would be done by wiring a high voltage generator to a terminal and activating it, causing a huge amount of voltage to be forced into the phone line, to the central office, through the switchboard and to every phone connected to it.</p>

<p>A man. A poet. A philosopher. An Indian. Jesal Kansagra was an Indian Saint who lived in the Northen parts of India during the 15th Century. His greatest work was as a poet, artist and a historian. Much of his work can be seen in the Maharishi Wasu caves in India. Here the legendary Kansagra's scribe was writen. Much of his work was done dispite the evident threat of the invading Moghul forces at the time. The Kansagra's scribe was essentially a time line of events of the history ongoing during this period of time. His other work included many illustrated poetry works showing not only an understanding of literature but early views on science and the cosmos. His work gave insight to the physical world but also the metaphysical in the sense of the his concepts of achieving a greater spiritual well being and how it could be obtained through good thought and good actions. Apart from Kansagra's scribe not much of his work can be seen as it was destroyed during the conflict of the Vedic wars but a small bronze staue remains in central Gujarat in North West India.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-11_a00a.html" title="Edit section: Potzee">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Potzee</span></h2>
<p>The streets already got the word, because the word hit the streets, blazing like Southern smoke. It takes a fierce skill set to go to bat with the best MCs in the hip hop game, but Potzee is redefining the meaning of a St. Louis slugger. The rest of the world is about to find out about St. Louis’s unsung lyrical force when Potzee’s full-length Hongree drops in 06 (Unauthorized/<a href="../../../a/s/y/Asylum.html" title="Asylum">Asylum</a>).</p>
<p>Potzee’s already got fans licking their lips in anticipation. He said “Good Evening” to weak MCs with the breakout buzz record in summer ’05 with longtime partner <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murphy_Lee_5bd2.html" title="Murphy Lee">Murphy Lee</a>. Now the club banger “Dat Girl” is making its way into the clubs and airwaves on both coasts. As Potzee claims as his alter ego "Mister Good Evening,” “I’m on the way up and I ain’t never comin’ back down.</p>
<p>“Round here they call me the hook master,” Potzee says of his trademark talent, with that Midwestern twang that rides easy over the beat. But Potzee’s got that flow that comes with blending regional styles. “Being from the Mid, we’ve been watching everybody all the years,” he explains. “We’re a combination of everything. Not too fast, not too slow. We ride that line on everything.”</p>
<p>Potzee’s given name is Akio Gray, which means bright boy, a christening that has proved true time and time again. A protégé of <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murphy_Lee_5bd2.html" title="Murphy Lee">Murphy Lee</a>, Potzee earned his respect the old fashioned way — grinding his way up the food chain. 23-year old Potzee first hit the scene in ’99 still in his teens turning up on fiery cuts “Whatever” and “Potential Baller.” He’s been touring with the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Lunatics_a70d.html" title="St. Lunatics">St. Lunatics</a> and spitting rhymes practically since his high school days in St. Louis’s Jennings neighborhood. But things weren’t always sugary sweet for Potzee. He caught a case straight out of high school that blemished his record with a felony. “While I was in there I closed my eyes and saw every conversation my father and I had. I always been in the streets in some kind of way.” When Potzee worked his way through his legal troubles, he changed up his focus, reuniting with his crew forming the foundations of his group— Quor made up of Adonis, Beezy, Youvee and Koole. “I’ve been through it. You can make mistakes but you have to learn from mistakes.”</p>
<p>While success doesn’t come easily in the industry nor the streets, music does to Potzee. It’s in his blood. Raised on the riveting funk of the <a href="../../../s/t/y/Stylistics.html" title="Stylistics">Stylistics</a> and <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Players_1935.html" title="Ohio Players">Ohio Players</a>, the group his father toured and sang with, Potzee was exposed to artistry early on. “At that time to get in the industry you had to be on point in every aspect,” Potzee says with admiration. He takes these lessons to heart with his own approach to songwriting. “I take the time to come up with a concept and put a song together. I get a concept then I write my hook. If the hook’s not right then the songs not going to be right.” As sure as a good hook, some things stay tried true. Potzee might be a young cat, but he’s takes the route of an old soul, favoring antiques, old cars and nostalgic TV sitcoms. “I’m on the old school, that’s what I get from the old heads, you got a little sense.” He grabbed his name from the 1950s TV show <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Days_98db.html" title="Happy Days">Happy Days</a>. “People say you smoke a lot that’s why you did it. I made the name fit to people in the street. The older people will say” Happy Days,” so it won’t scare them. My mom is like how you talking about old TV shows when you so young? I’m like they show reruns. “Good Times” started before I was even born.” Wherever he draws his motivation, it’s a gift that turns up on songs that jump off at first play. “Dat Girl,” produced by Hardley Davidson (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamillionaire.html" title="Chamillionaire">Chamillionaire</a>/<a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretty_Ricky_1b64.html" title="Pretty Ricky">Pretty Ricky</a>), is a track that has pure club banger written all over it. Also, keeping the ladies moving is the flavorful “Bootch” which is all out good time St. Louis speak and bounce. “I just ride the track, throw in a few metaphors and make them dance a little bit,” Potzee says. “I have the metaphors, but I don’t make that my whole verse.”</p>
<p>He keeps it real and raw on “I Ain’t Playing With You” remembering exactly where he comes from. “I want to make sure the verses are relatable. The average everyday man, he’s going through what I went through. I try to keep everything on that level.”</p>
<p>Fresh off <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelly.html" title="Nelly">Nelly</a>’s Sweatsuit tour, Potzee is a self-professed studio rat when he’s staying still in the Lou, buckling down to knock out tracks at every opportunity. With mixtape teases “Starvin”, DJ Smallz &amp; Potzee’s colab “Reloaded’ and two hot singles, Potzee has blasted the heat, but he’s standing firm on home plate. “I have a fam where getting by is what we do. As long as we can pay these bills its okay,” he says revealing his humble side. Potzee is the type of MC who lets his skills speak, while he takes the humble, be real road and the practical with his indie imprint U-C-Me. He quotes himself on a joint he calls “More Problems.” It’s hard as hell waking up/No job, no swerve, no herb/More problems more money just can’t solve/I’ve been down so long can’t help but take it out like/Once I get it ain’t no coming back.</p>
<p>Wherever he goes, Potzee’s finesse for cooking up rhymes gets the fire burning. “I’m going to keep it real St. Louis,” he informs. And once he gets his fill, no one’s gonna have room for seconds.</p>

<p>What Drives The Weak are a metal band hailing from Port Stephens, New South Wales, Australia. This bands strong stance on pro-hommosexuality has been surrounded by controversey. Every band member in WDTW are all indeed raging hommosexuals. Except the drummer, Corey. With songs like 'enter me tonight, enter me alright' featuring graphic images in the lyrics about hommosexual intercourse has been a big issue in the australian metal scene. Many in the metal scene look down upon it, whilst others embrace the bands flamboyant lifestyle. You can find WDTW parading in there gay pride marches, to dark metal clubs. Either way there obvious gay pride is extremley evident. Often kissing each other on stage and making obscene gestures to the crowd can stir tempers in the crowd. These gay metal pioneers are truley a hero to us all to be our selves, and to never give up hope.</p>

<p>Autocollimation is a process by which the focal length of a diverging lens is determined. Autocollimation involves placing a light source at the focal length of a converging lense on one side and a screen at the same distance on the other side so that the image produced is the sharpest possible image. When this is achieved, the screen is replaced with a mirror and the diverging lens is inserted between the converging lens and the mirror so that the light rays that hit the mirror are parallel to the principle axis and when the light returns through the diverging and converging lenses, it produces a sharp image ontop of the luminous object.</p>
