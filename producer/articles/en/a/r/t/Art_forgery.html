<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_forgery.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Art forgery dates back more than two-thousand years. <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> sculptors produced copies of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a> sculptures. Presumably the contemporary buyers knew that they were not genuine. During the classical period art was generally created for historical reference, religious inspiration, or simply <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesthetic.html" title="Aesthetic">aesthetic</a> enjoyment. The identity of the artist was often of little importance to the buyer.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, many painters took on <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apprentice.html" title="Apprentice">apprentices</a> who studied painting techniques by copying the works and style of the master. As a payment for the training, the master would then sell these works. This practice was generally considered a tribute, not forgery, although some of these copies have later erroneously been attributed to the master.</p>
<p>Following the Renaissance, a redistribution of the world’s wealth created a fierce demand for art by a newly prosperous middle class. Near the end of the 14th century, Roman statues were unearthed in Italy, intensifying the populace’s interest in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiquities.html" title="Antiquities">antiquities</a>, and leading to sharp increases in the value of these objects. This upsurge soon extended to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary.html" title="Contemporary">contemporary</a> and recently deceased artists. Art had become a commercial <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodity.html" title="Commodity">commodity</a>, and the monetary value of the artwork came to depend on the identity of the artist. To identify their works, painters began to mark them, these marks later evolved in to signatures. As the demand for certain artwork began to exceed the supply, fraudulent marks and signatures began to appear on the open market.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a> imitators of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_3199.html" title="Albrecht Dürer">Albrecht Dürer</a>'s style of printmaking added signatures to them to increase the value of their prints. In his engraving of the Virgin, Durer added the inscription "Be cursed, plunderers and imitators of the work and talent of others" <sup id="_ref-multiple_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiple" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Even extremely famous artists created forgeries. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> forged a marble cupid for his patron, Lorenzo di Cosimo De' Medici.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> art market has favored artists such as <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD_43d7.html" title="Salvador Dalí">Salvador Dalí</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/b/Pablo_Picasso_5952.html" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Klee_7d23.html" title="Paul Klee">Klee</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matisse.html" title="Matisse">Matisse</a> and works by these artists have commonly been targets of forgery. These forgeries are typically sold to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_gallery.html" title="Art gallery">art galleries</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auction.html" title="Auction">auction</a> houses who cater to the tastes of art and antiquities <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collector.html" title="Collector">collectors</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_forgery.html" title="Edit section: the Forgers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">the Forgers</span></h2>
<p>There are essentially three varieties of art forger. The person who actually creates the fraudulent piece, the person who discovers a piece and attempts to pass it off as something it is not, in order to increase the piece’s value, and the third who discovers that a work is a fake, but sells it as an original anyway <sup id="_ref-multiple_Hoving_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiple_Hoving" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Copies, replicas, reproductions and <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastiche.html" title="Pastiche">pastiches</a> are often legitimate works, and the distinction between a legitimate reproduction and deliberate forgery is blurred. For example, <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Hain_73c4.html" title="Guy Hain">Guy Hain</a> used original molds to reproduce several of <a href="../../../a/u/g/Auguste_Rodin_e687.html" title="Auguste Rodin">Auguste Rodin</a>'s sculptures. However, when Hain then signed the reproductions with the name of Rodin's original <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundry.html" title="Foundry">foundry</a>, the works became deliberate forgeries.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_forgery.html" title="Edit section: the Artists">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">the Artists</span></h3>
<p>An art forger must be at least somewhat proficient in the type of art he is trying to imitate. Many forgers were once fledging artists who tried, unsuccessfully, to break into the market, eventually resorting to forgery. Sometimes, an original item is borrowed or stolen from the owner in order to create a copy. Forgers will then return the copy to the owner, keeping the original for himself. In 1799, a <a href="../../../d/u/r/Image%7EDurer_self_portarit_28.jpg_812f.html" title="Image:Durer self portarit 28.jpg">self portrait</a> by <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_3199.html" title="Albrecht Dürer">Albrecht Dürer</a> which had hung in the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg.html" title="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> Town Hall since the sixteenth century , was loaned to Wolfgang Küffner. The painter made a copy of the original and returned the copy in place of the original. The forgery was discovered in 1805, when the original came up for auction and was purchased for the royal collection.</p>
<p>Although many art forgers reproduce works solely for money, some have claimed that they have created forgeries to expose the credulity and snobbishness of the art world. Essentially the artist claims, usually after he has been caught, that they have performed only “<a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoaxes</a> of exposure”.</p>
<p>Some exposed forgers have later sold their reproductions honestly, by attributing them as copies, some have actually gained enough notoriety to become famous in their own right. Forgeries painted by late <a href="../../../e/l/m/Elmyr_de_Hory_ad5e.html" title="Elmyr de Hory">Elmyr de Hory</a>, featured in the film <i><a href="../../../f/_/f/F_for_Fake_ef0f.html" title="F for Fake">F for Fake</a></i> directed by <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Welles_8fe7.html" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a>, have become so valuable that forged de Hory’s have appeared on the market.</p>
<p>Forgers usually copy works by deceased artists, however a small number imitate living artists. In May 2004, Norwegian painter Kjell Nupen noticed that the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristianstad.html" title="Kristianstad">Kristianstad</a> gallery was selling unauthorized, signed copies of his work.</p>
<p><a name="the_Dealers" id="the_Dealers"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_forgery.html" title="Edit section: the Dealers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">the Dealers</span></h3>
<p>Claims have surfaced recently, alleging that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_dealer.html" title="Art dealer">art dealers</a> and auction houses have been overly eager, by accepting forgeries as genuine, and selling them quickly, to turn a profit. If a dealer finds the work is a forgery, he may quietly withdraw the piece and return it to its previous owner - giving the forger an opportunity to sell it elsewhere <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup>. Some potential buyers may not be concerned with the provenance of the item, as long as it can pass for the genuine piece in their social circles.</p>
<p>Experts and institutions may also be reluctant to admit their own fallibility. Art historian Thomas Hoving estimates that various types of forged art comprise up to 40% of the art market. <sup id="_ref-multiple_Hoving_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiple_Hoving" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Some forgers have created false paper trails relating to a piece, in order to make the work appear genuine. British art dealer <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Drewe_c551.html" title="John Drewe">John Drewe</a> created false documents of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provenance.html" title="Provenance">provenance</a> for works forged by his partner <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Myatt_3335.html" title="John Myatt">John Myatt</a>, and even inserted pictures of forgeries into the archives of prominent art institutions <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The most obvious forgeries are revealed as clumsy copies of previous art. A forger may try to create a "new" work by combining the elements of more than one work. The forger may omit details typical to the artist they are trying to imitate, or add <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a>, in an attempt to claim that the forged work is a slightly different copy, or a previous version of a more famous work. To detect the work of a skilled forger, investigators must rely on other methods.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_forgery.html" title="Edit section: Technique of Examination">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technique of Examination</span></h3>
<p>Often a thorough examination (sometimes referred to as Morellian Analysis <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup>) of the piece is enough to determine authenticity. For example, a sculpture may have been created obviously with modern methods and tools. Some forgers have used artistic methods inconsistent with those of the original artists, such as incorrect characteristic brushwork, perspective, preferred themes or techniques, or have used colors that were not available during the artist’s lifetime to create the painting. Some forgers have dipped pieces in chemicals to "age" them and some have even tried to imitate worm marks by drilling holes into objects (See image, right).</p>
<p>While attempting to authenticate artwork, experts will also determine the piece’s <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provenance.html" title="Provenance">provenance</a>. If the item has no paper trail, it is more likely to be a forgery. Other techniques forgers use which might indicate that a painting is not authentic include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frames, either new or old, that have been altered in order to make forged paintings look more genuine.</li>
<li>To hide inconsistencies or manipulations, forgers will sometimes glue paper, either new or old, to a painting's back, or cut a forged painting from its original size.</li>
<li>Recently added labels or artist listings, onto unsigned works of art, unless these labels are as old as the art itself, suspicion should be aroused.</li>
<li>While art restorers legitimately use new stretcher bars when the old bars have worn, new stretcher bars on old canvases might be an indication that a forger is attempting to alter the painting’s identity.</li>
<li>Old nail holes or mounting marks on the back of a piece, might indicate that a painting has been removed from it’s frame, doctored and then replaced into either its original frame or different frame.</li>
<li>Signatures, on paintings or graphics, that look inconsistent with the art itself (either fresher, bolder, etc.).</li>
<li>Unsigned work that a dealer has “heard” is by a particular artist.</li>

<p><a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">Statistical analysis</a> of <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_image.html" title="Digital image">digital images</a> of paintings is a new method that that has recently been used to detect forgeries. Using a technique called <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavelet.html" title="Wavelet">wavelet</a> decomposition, a picture is broken down into a collection of more basic images called sub-bands. These sub-bands are analyzed to determine textures, assigning a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency.html" title="Frequency">frequency</a> to each sub-band. The broad strokes of a surface such as a blue sky would show up as mostly low frequency sub-bands whereas the fine strokes in blades of grass would produce high frequency sub-bands <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup>. A group of thirteen drawings attributed to <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieter_Brueghel_the_Elder_79e6.html" title="Pieter Brueghel the Elder">Pieter Brueghel the Elder</a> was tested using the wavelet decomposition method. Five of the drawings were known to be imitations. The analysis was able to correctly identify the five forged paintings. The method was also used on the painting <i>Virgin and Child with Saints</i>, created in the studios of <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pietro_Perugino_bcc4.html" title="Pietro Perugino">Pietro Perugino</a>. Historians have long suspected that Perugino painted only a portion of the work. The wavelet decomposition method identified that at least four different artists had worked on the painting.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_forgery.html" title="Edit section: Problems with authentication">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Problems with authentication</span></h2>
<p>Art specialists, whom we now refer to as experts, began to surface in the art world during the late 1850s. At that time they were usually historians or museum <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curator.html" title="Curator">curators</a>, writing books about paintings, sculpture, and other art forms. Communication amongst the different specialties was poor, and they often made mistakes when authenticating pieces. While many books and art catalogues were published prior to 1900, many were not widely circulated, and often did not contain information about contemporary artwork. In addition, these specialists lacked many of the important technological means that experts use to authenticate art today.</p>
<p>The fact that experts do not always agree on the authenticity of a particular item makes the matter of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provenance.html" title="Provenance">provenance</a> more complex. Some artists have even accepted copies as their own work -<a href="../../../p/i/c/Picasso.html" title="Picasso">Picasso</a> once said that he "would sign a very good forgery” <sup id="_ref-multiple_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiple" title="">[1]</a></sup>. <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Baptiste_Camille_Corot_702a.html" title="Jean Baptiste Camille Corot">Jean Corot</a> painted over 700 works, but also signed copies made by others in his name, because he felt honored to be copied. Occasionally work that has previously been declared a forgery is later accepted as genuine; Vermeer's <a href="../../../j/a/n/Image%7EJan_Vermeer_van_Delft_005.jpg_643c.html" title="Image:Jan Vermeer van Delft 005.jpg"><i>Young Woman Seated at the Virginals</i></a> had been regarded as a forgery from 1947 until March, 2004, when it was finally declared genuine.</p>
<p>At times <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_restoration.html" title="Art restoration">restoration</a> of a piece is so extensive that the original is essentially replaced when new materials are used to supplement older ones. An art restorer may also add or remove details on a painting, in an attempt to make the painting more saleable on the contemporary art market. This, however, is not a modern phenomenon - historical painters often "retouched" other artist's works by repainting some of the background or details.</p>
<p>Many forgeries still escape detection; <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_van_Meegeren_0d9f.html" title="Han van Meegeren">Han van Meegeren</a>, possibly the most famous forger of the 20th century, used historical <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canvas.html" title="Canvas">canvasses</a> for his Vermeer forgeries and created his own <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pigments.html" title="Pigments">pigments</a> to ensure that they were authentic. He confessed to creating the forgeries only after he was charged with <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a>, an offense which carried the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a>. So masterful were his forgeries that van Meergeren was forced to create another "Vermeer" while under police guard, to prove himself innocent of the treason charges.</p>
<p>A recent, thought-provoking instance of potential art forgery involves the Getty <a href="../../../k/o/u/Kouros.html" title="Kouros">Kouros</a>, the authenticity of which has not been resolved. The Getty Kouros was offered, along with seven other pieces, to The <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Paul_Getty_Museum_a3da.html" title="J. Paul Getty Museum">J. Paul Getty Museum</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malibu%2C_California_1c5a.html" title="Malibu, California">Malibu, California</a> in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. For the next twelve years <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_historian.html" title="Art historian">art historians</a>, conservators, and <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archeologist.html" title="Archeologist">archeologists</a> studied the Kouros, scientific tests were performed and showed that the surface could not have been created artificially. However, when several of the other pieces offered with the Kouros, were shown to be forgeries, its authenticity was again questioned. In May of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, the Kouros was displayed in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens%2C_Greece_0172.html" title="Athens, Greece">Athens, Greece</a>, at an international conference, called to determine its authenticity. The conference failed to solve the problem; while most art historians and archeologists denounced it, the scientists present believed the statue to be authentic. To this day, the Getty Kouros' authenticity remains a mystery and the statue is displayed with the date: "Greek, 530 B.C. or modern forgery <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup>."</p>

<p>Recently, photographs have become the target of forgers, and as the market value of these works increase, so will forgery continue. Following their deaths, works by <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_Ray_b06e.html" title="Man Ray">Man Ray</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansel_Adams_4d06.html" title="Ansel Adams">Ansel Adams</a> became frequent targets of forgery.</p>
<p>The detection of forged photography is particularly difficult, as experts must be able to tell the difference between originals and reprints.</p>
<p>In the case of photographer, Man Ray <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup>, print production was often poorly managed during his lifetime, and many of his negatives were stolen by people who has access to his studio. The possession of the photo-negatives would allow a forger to print an unlimited number of fake prints, which he could then pass off as original. Provided the forger was able to find a supply of unused photo paper produced 50 to 80 years ago, these fake prints would be nearly indistinguishable from originals. Further complicating matters, following Man Ray's death, control of printing copyrights fell to his widow, Juliet Man Ray, and her brother, who approved production of a large number of prints that Man Ray himself had earlier rejected. While these reprints are of limited value, the originals, printed during Man Ray's lifetime, have skyrocketed in value, leading many forgers to alter the reprints, so that they appear to be original.</p>
