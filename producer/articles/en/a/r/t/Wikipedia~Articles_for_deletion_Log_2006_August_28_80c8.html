<li><b>Strong Keep!</b> Track and Field is in general competed in age and gender classes, staring with young kids (who would be somewhat discouraged, I think you'll agree, if they had to compete against 20-30 year old Open athletes) and commencing again with 40-44, 45-49 and so on. Without this highly developed and organized system, Athletics would be restricted to the elite, all of whom were once kids, so the sport would die out in a matter of years. There are international organizations (in particular the WMA) which govern and certify Masters Track and Field (MTF); every other year there is a World Championship, frequently involving thousands of athletes. So you need to check your sources before you go referring to this as "a POV essay". Ken Stone is probably the most eloquent spokesman for MTF, and is highly respected as a journalist. If you find his input too opinionated or colourful, well, revise it to your taste; I'm sure many others will too -- that's what a wiki is for. But don't insult a large, earnest and respectable community by deleting the topic.JHBrewer 03:08, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I just redirected it to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardomain.html" title="Cardomain">Cardomain</a>. Almost all the information was nearly word-for-word the same. Anyone can do a redirect, it's quite simple really. Just type #, then REDIRECT with no spaces, then do a standard link to the destination.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Well, there is no official policy on notability, <i>but</i> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is an official policy on English Wikipedia. And with all due respects, I have to disagree with your statement by stating that this article is a <i>clear joke</i>. For instance, please view this <a href="http://www.greydragon.org/library/cambok.html" class="external text" title="http://www.greydragon.org/library/cambok.html" rel="nofollow">website</a>. Notice that the footnotes at the end of this page contains some credible sources on this subject as well. However, I am not sure if it is <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Moreover, the first sentence of this article states that the game was invented by a certain Addkq Dääd, which I feel is likely to be an untrue statement. Perhaps a major re-write of this article is required here. And let me add that the nominator's statement is incorrect. Google shows about 300 hits for this term and quite a number of them refers to different websites on this topic. Further research have to be done here before making a conclusive decision about this article. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 03:16, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Please note that the game of cambok as described on <a href="http://www.greydragon.org/library/cambok.html" class="external text" title="http://www.greydragon.org/library/cambok.html" rel="nofollow">website</a> is substantially different than the one described in this Wikipedia article. I do not dispute that there is a game called "cambok" that exists/existed, but I don't think it relates at all to the version of cambok presented in this article. I cannot find a link to anything similar to this article that doesn't reference this exact same Wikipedia article as their source. At any rate, by the author's own admission, the sport "is not very popular", which, if I understand the guidelines correctly, is not acceptable, anyway. Am I correct in my assumption? I'm new here and just getting the hang of the processes involved with major editing/deletion, so please forgive me if I've stepped on any toes. <a href="../../../m/u/t/User%7EMutableye_ab7c.html" title="User:Mutableye">Mutableye</a> 05:18, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Though I believe Wikipedia should definitely try to include as much info as possible. This really appears to be nothing more than information taken from very unreliable sources. This article also fails in the sense that it uses unreliable sources to make very unsubstantiable and very inflammatory remarks. The likely motivation for the quotes that were made were likely racist in nature (not the contributor who posted this article, but the quotes used in the statements). An article that is heavily dependant on quotes like these from unreliable sources which are heavily POV generally fails to meet the NPOV requirement, even if the article itself is not giving any credibility to these quotes. This is because posting these quotes gives inherent credibility, and no attempt has been made to counteract the statements. I feel the article should deleted due it s inherent inflammatory nature, and the fact almost no real facts are presented as support. <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 04:59, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

They're not pejoratives, unless you want to tangent into the factionalism/anti-factionalism debate. However, as he has said himself, this is more about <i>process</i> not <i>nn</i> for him; I respect that. As for the Google link... if you actually look at it, there are numerous travel guides online which independently reference Johnnie Walker for tours of Kyoto. It seemed to me more sensible to refer to the list-o-links than to mirror them here. Also, I did mean to imply, for CanadianCaesar who began the <i>nn</i> claim, that a quick Google search would have done more to clarify the notability issue than an immediate deletion. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuryadas_b641.html" title="User:Suryadas">Suryadas</a> 03:27, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This discussion illustrates why it is usually best to compose an article off-line rather than using Wikipedia as a word processor.

<li>Could you explain what you mean by "using Wikipedia as a word processor"? My understanding is that the whole point of Wiki (i.e. <i>fast</i>) is precisely to make lots of little edits, rather than a few big ones. Or is that not what you meant? <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuryadas_b641.html" title="User:Suryadas">Suryadas</a> 15:00, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That it's best to make sure a new article is demonstrably keepable before you place it in the main article namespace, instead of creating a new, empty article, and expecting to be able to write it a sentence at a time, then getting all upset when someone speedys it before you've written the second sentence. This is not missing the point of a wiki: the point of a wiki is that an existing article can be corrected and expanded quickly, and requiring new articles to be easily distinguished from vanity or spam does not negate that point. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:14, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Well, yes, but you know what I mean</i>. It's not google-the-web, it's google-sciency-stuffs.

Non-notability should be less of an issue as this article may not be particularly popular, given the specialized topic, however, it does provideuseful information that some users would enjoy.

<li><b>Keep:</b> It is not the least bit obvious what the terms "average notability" or "inherently notable" mean, yet they are used by <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> to convey some kind of pseudo-scientific aura of justification. Reality shows done well are comedy / dramas. They are crafted to make us interested in the contestants for 15 or 16 weeks. They are in effect mini-soap operas. As such, winning is beside the point to the "notability" of those involved. Read the blogs on the show as people passionately defend the "good guys" or berate the "bad guys". Indeed, given that the producers do not need to worry about keeping fans interested in the same characters for year after year (as is the case in traditional television fare), they are freer to pump up the story lines and the resulting emotions. One can be a snob about all of this and think that notability should be something more than having hundreds of thousands of people wonder whether or not you are going to be eliminated on a TV reality show. But then you would just be a snob.</li>

<ul>
<li>The claim seems to be that unless you have notability outside of a Reality TV series, you are not entitiled to space in Wikipedia (space being such an increadably precious commodity within Wikipedia. Oh wait it isn't, is it?). By this logic, all Wikipedia pages devoted to fictional characters should be marked for deletion. After all, a fictional character's notability is almost by defintion a construct of the fiction in which he or she occurs. For example, Col. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> has a very nice article despite the fact that he is a character on Stargate / SG-1. Presumably, his notabilty is solely a function of the movie and the TV show and all the web references about him will be in the same contexts. Jack O'Neill will never write a book or run for president or do anything else notable, other than be a character of fiction. The contestants on a Reality TV show occupy an interesting niche. There notablity may be nothing more than that given by the show on which they appear. But if being a character on SG-1 is sufficent for notablity for Jack O'Neill, then it strikes me that it is sufficent for Kayne Gillaspie, Keith Michael, Bradley Baumkirchner, and all the rest. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 17:56, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A follow-up to my note above. One might argue that as main character on a series that has run for 10 years, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> has acheived some kind of notableness outside the context of the show. If so, one would still be hard pressed to justify the pages of <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._and_Mrs._Stoppable_e7d9.html" title="Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable">Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Mankey_5daf.html" title="Josh Mankey">Josh Mankey</a>. These may not ring any bells for those not plugged into day-time Disney fare. The former are the parents of <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Possible_5e05.html" title="Kim Possible">Kim Possible</a>'s sidekike <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Stoppable_eb80.html" title="Ron Stoppable">Ron Stoppable</a> and the later is Kim's love interest in several episodes. Again, my take is that the characters on Project Runway et.al. are in fact characters in a drama. The standards of notablity for inclusion in Wikipedia should be based on the standards for Television characters. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 18:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It does seem to me that a little bit of an unfair set of criteria in use here. Reality television characters can be notable <i>only</i> for things other than what makes people want to write and read about them? It's a bit like saying that bands are only notable if they have done something notable besides create music. I think the criteria for including reality tv characters should be pretty straightforwardly related to their Ghits and the same criteria that applies to other bios. Ghits for blogs and reviews about a band's latest album or tour aren't discounted immediately are they? Minor reality show characters are rarely mentioned in articles or blogs about the shows and don't have as many Ghits, therefore there's an argument there for not including them. Or a new set of guidelines relating to reality tv should be hammered out. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 21:12, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Bad analogy. It's not at all like saying that bands are only notable if they have done something notable besides create music. The nomination is based on the lack of notability outside PR, not outside their field of expertise. One is not the subset of the other. Not all PR contestants were put up for AfD.<a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I guess what I'm taking issue with here is the basic assumption that appearing on PR does not make a person notable. What these people are primarily known for is appearing on this show -- why is that rejected out of hand as sufficient notability? Some are more notable than others within that ie. <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santino_Rice_a0c8.html" title="Santino Rice">Santino Rice</a> is a more notable Project Runway contestant than Marla Duran, not because of things he did outside the show, but because he did more things on it, and was mentioned in articles and reviews with greater frequency. Why must their notability be dependent only on factors <b>besides</b> what they're actually famous for? And anyway, non-notability is not a grounds for deletion.<a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 15:37, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm wondering if it's just that people are surprised, shocked, and even a bit offended, by the idea that a reality show contestant, let alone an aspiring fashion designer, can warrant a Wikipedia article, while skads of other anonymous folks are dismissed as not worthy of such an article because they are "not notable." Look, I'm equally shocked when I see lengthy articles on fictional characters from video games. But apparently these characters are notable in some circles, even though I wouldn't know them if they were sleeping in bed next to me. Maybe we should just accept that Santino Rice, Kayne Gillaspie, Katherine Gerdes et al are as notable to afficianados of reality television or fashion design as (fill in your favorite fictional video game character) are to their followers. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 23:49, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I heard through the grapevine that Santino was offered a spot on "The Surreal Life"</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>. This is ridiculous. These people are notable now. We can't just say "Who will care in a few years?" because <i>someone will care</i>. As an active member of the Olympics Wikiproject, I can tell you that we have pages created for Olympians that placed from 1st all the way to 8th place in a single event over 100 years ago. Most of these are not Olympic medalists, but they get a WP page because they were notable <i>at the time</i>, and <i>in their field</i>. One of the things that drew me to WP in the first place was that it had obscure information like this, that I wouldn't be able to find anywhere else. This is the sum of human knowledge, and that includes Reality TV, whether you or I like it or not. As for notability on Reality TV, OhConfucius says that the zoo may be notable, but Monkey A and Monkey B are not. This does not come close to applying here. Imagine if millions of people across America were interested in these two monkeys - they knew Monkey A and Monkey B by name, could tell them apart by looking at them, knew their mannerisms, and went to places like WP to learn more. Then we'd have a comparison. <font color="#08457E"><b><a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomtheman5_0ad4.html" title="User:Tomtheman5">tiZom</a></b></font><sub><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomtheman5_2ea6.html" title="User talk:Tomtheman5"><font color="black">(2¢)</font></a></sub> 15:51, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>. I completely understand why, in a year or so, we might want to re-evaluate the relevence of these pages. Probably in 5 years they won't all need their own pages. At the moment, however, the show is a not insignificant part of popular culture, and I have trouble beleiving people (especially casual and rerun veiwers of the show) don't come here all the time looking for more information. None of these individual pages are inappropriately long or detailed, and besides, if we eliminated these we'd just end up trying to cram these details into the season 3 page, which is pretty massive as it is.<a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunkyrice_13_9440.html" title="User:Chunkyrice 13">Chunkyrice 13</a> 22:52, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep:</b> It is not the least bit obvious what the terms "average notability" or "inherently notable" mean, yet they are used by <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> to convey some kind of pseudo-scientific aura of justification. Reality shows done well are comedy / dramas. They are crafted to make us interested in the contestants for 15 or 16 weeks. They are in effect mini-soap operas. As such, winning is beside the point to the "notability" of those involved. Read the blogs on the show as people passionately defend the "good guys" or berate the "bad guys". Indeed, given that the producers do not need to worry about keeping fans interested in the same characters for year after year (as is the case in traditional television fare), they are freer to pump up the story lines and the resulting emotions. One can be a snob about all of this and think that notability should be something more than having hundreds of thousands of people wonder whether or not you are going to be eliminated on a TV reality show. But then you would just be a snob. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 16:32, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> "average notability" applies to the Ghits. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding;</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>"inherently notable" means that the show is much more than the sum of its parts, and that while the show is certainly notable, the fact of having been one of the contestants does not necessarily confer notability, in much the same way that one is not notable by merely working in a successful theatre production or film, any other artistic work, or by being on the iPod development team. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:13, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am curious to know what evidence does <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> have for his claim that 'being on TV does not make you interesting in itself'? As a matter of sociological fact (as measured by the volume of web blogs and entertainment magazines etc.) it seems that being on television is enough to make almost anyone interesting. 'Interesting' of course cannot mean interesting to just you or just me. But rather it means 'is of interest to large number of people'. It seems abundantly clear that those arguing for Delete rather despise Reality TV and are not themselves interested in it. Good for them. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> makes this point expressly clear on his page. He has listed 1 Dislike: Reality TV. And clearly he has taken it upon himself to expunge it as much as possible from Wikipedia. But it also clear that there are plenty of people who tune in weekly to see the exploits of the people on shows like PR. Regardless of what else they accomplish in their lives, for 10 or 12 weeks they become very important to many people. As for whether or not anyone will care in a few years, that is completely beside the point. If the standard is that only the timeless and enduring can be in Wikipedia, I think we would have perhaps 17 articles. Part of the NPOV is that you have a consistent bar for entry. You cannot raise it for projects that you find banal, trivial, or uninteresting and then lower it for those you like. Finally, of course, even if <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> is accurate in his claim, it does not apply in these cases. If the PR contestants merely appeared on the show and where never discussed or noticed by anyone, then there could be a case for saying that they're appearance simpliciter was not itself interesting. But that is not the case. There is plenty of interest in these people by people interested in PR. That may not be your interest.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am open about my dislike of Reality TV, but I try not to make bad faith deletions, or ones based solely on my likes and dislikes. I will admit that PR is unlike BB, as many of these indivuals have skill/talent and could be known for what they do outside the show and not just how they behave on screen. I try hard to be objective justify and evaluate deletions based on wiki policies and guidelines, and in applying the same methodology and research I have been using to support all my other decisions and recommendations, these contestants come up as delete recommendations. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:31, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. When Jdclevenger says "There is plenty of interest in these people by people interested in PR," that is a reason to delete. People should be of general interest to receive an encyclopedia entry or they should have made a notable contribution in a certain field.

<li><b>Keep</b> Not only are such articles necessary for wikipedia to maintain its comprehensive nature, but Kayne is also certainly famous enough to warrant an entry.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Yes it <i>does</i> matter if the person will be utterly forgotten in five years. Wikipedia is not a collection of ephemera. No it <i>doesn't</i> matter that much if the person happens to be the particular body that crosses the screens of millions of reality TV watchers. Notability is mostly about <i>achievement</i>, achievement recognized by one's peers or in some other meaningful way.

<li><b>Comment</b> 'Wikipedia is not a crystal ball.' This is a common sentiment of the Deletionists, suggesting that the possibility of future notabililty is not enough for current inclusion. I would suggest that it works both ways. Arguing that a current article be deleted because the person will be 'utterly forgotten in five years' is a crystal ball prediction. It may be true. It may not. Come back in five years and argue that no one cares about this. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 15:28, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I tried it as a CSD for lack of context and pretty much everything else, but was told to bring it here. Technically, had I known it had previously been deleted it would be a CSD, but I snoozed and lost, so I'll put it here to make sure nobody calls me names. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 09:35, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As a further note about the initial AfD, there was a threat made to recreate the article if it were deleted. A suggestion was made to protect it, and I think this recreation is proof that someone should break out the <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">WP:SALT</a> shaker. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 09:47, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It definitely doesn't fall under an exact re-creation of an article deleted through the AfD process, because it's never been deleted in such a way (it was speedied last time). The article makes absolutely no sense to me (and Google makes things <i>more</i> confusing), and if I'd been first on the scene I definitely would have speedy deleted it as having so little context as to be nonsense.

<li><s><b>Delete most.</b> I'll agree that most of the articles are probably not notable enough (I created almost all of 'em, and some were very difficult to find info), but the Trance Europe Express series is reasonably well represented in a Google search (~15k hits), and were fairly important compilations of important artists.

<li><b>Keep all</b> Very notable series in the UK. Also, the nominator has been misguided a little - these were full length CDs of new material sold in the shops at full price, but which came with a CD-sized book.

<li><b>Comment</b> - In that case, aren't we then dealing either with individual issues of a magazine (which includes a CD) or individual entries in a compilation series of albums (which include a magazine)? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 07:47, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>Further, if the series is notable in the UK, Google seems strangely silent on the matter. There've been a lot of things about music released over the years called "Volume", but the only thing I could find specifically on this was a discussion board post asking if people remembered it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 07:49, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Google doesn't know everything friend. These were early 90s compilations and predate Google. I think you have enough comments from British music fan editors saying "important compilation series" to have your answer&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 09:37, 7 September 2006 (UTC) PS for the record, imho Volume 2 and Trance Europe Express were the best&#160;:)
<ul>
<li>Fair cop regarding the limits of Google, and thanks for clearing up exactly what they were in the first place. The question is, though, whether or not every single one of these compilation albums is notable in and of itself. I'm willing to agree that the <i>entire thing</i> (Volume Magazine) is notable, but why does each album necessarily need its own individual article? Surely the approach to take would be to give each compilation a paragraph or equivalent on the Volume Mag article itself. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 09:44, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Possibly</i>, because the articles are in a bad state at the moment. That's not an AFD issue though; the articles have a "right" to exist as does any other member of a notable compilation series. If you'd like to be bold and clean them up or do some merging it doesn't need to be an AFD matter. (Because, somebody else might want to undo it, particularly if more material becomes available - such as reviews. If an article is deleted, the history goes too and this kind of bold-revert-discuss pattern can't happen).</li>

<li><b>further comment</b> - I do think the waters have been clouded here by a misunderstanding as to exactly what Volume was. It was both a magazine and a compilation album. The discs weren't cover freebies of the type you get now (although, in British publishing, it has a clear influence on magazines like Word which always carry cover CDs), rather each was comprised of new, previously unissued material. Each edition sold at CD price. That said, each issue carried contemporaneous album etc reviews so they were certainly a periodical. PS - Volume <i>4</i> was the best&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 13:00, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

The significance of the books is unclear to me as a chunk were published by Cois Life which she is the co-founder of (according to Mark's link).

<li><b>Comment</b> - Having published books is not in itself sufficient for notability.

If the nominator wants to abstain, he can leave out the "delete" (as I have done before in AfDs where I wanted to start discussion on topics for which I had not been so sure that deletion was appropriate). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 13:58, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Actually, I thought the accepted convention was to treat the default as a delete - because the nominator usually provides an argument for deletion. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 14:44, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've seen people write something like <i>I'm in favour of deleting this article</i> at the end of their nomination, to make the issue clear. But what the nominator's done here reads (on a quick parse) like "voting twice" - and I've definitely seen people being told off for similar behaviour in the past. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:19, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Redirect</b> to Unlimited. Comment. I don't think the machinery of AfD was even necessary here; I'd already dropped a "Merge to" with a single card AfD cited, and was going to simply redirect it (possibly pulling some material along with?) very soon anyway.

<li>Sourcing a triviality surely isn't the point. The subject is not notable as a poker player (and just to anticpate the obvious, his online accomplishements were due to cheating, which makes them non-poker accomplishments). He has one casino final table in a tournament, and isn't even old enough to play ring games in a major US casino poker room. The cheating incident is mildly interesting, but *he* is not, and merits no article. Two sentences about the incident in the poker cheating article are the appropriate place to mention the incident. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 22:31, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li>(edit conflict) The added source from bluff magazine fails to establish notability in my mind because the article is not primarily about the subject (Justin) but instead about the practice for which he was guilty. The second is an apology by him, thus also fails to establish notability. Unless there is a published article more directly about him, I think he is not sufficiently notable. --<i>best, kevin</i> <b>[</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">kzollman</a><b>][</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">talk</a><b>]</b> 22:32, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Give me a break, Mikka. There's no such thing as a notable sources policy.

But anyway, Here: Source 1 is from Bluff Magazine, which is a print magazine with a website. The magazine is a real magazine, with a decent Amazon sales rank. Source 2 is from CompatiblePoker.com, a website with a 200K Alexa rank; not bad, considering that it's a niche site that caters to Mac and Linux poker players trying to play online, yet doesn't offer games itself. They have bios of only 13 online pros, and the link is the one for Justin. Source 3 is a repost of Justin's apology from his website; it is hosted on a site about honesty in online tournaments. A quick websearch reveals other sources from <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/5408790" class="external text" title="http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/5408790" rel="nofollow">msn.foxsports.com</a> (yeah, I know it's Fox but *I* think it's still reliable), <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_33/b3896121_mz070.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_33/b3896121_mz070.htm" rel="nofollow">BusinessWeek online</a> (before the cheating incident), another <a href="http://bluffmagazine.com/magazine/2006_02_28.asp" class="external text" title="http://bluffmagazine.com/magazine/2006_02_28.asp" rel="nofollow">Bluff Magazine</a> article; passing mention, but lists Justin as one of 6 "players to watch", and another <a href="http://bluffmagazine.com/magazine/2006_01_25.asp" class="external text" title="http://bluffmagazine.com/magazine/2006_01_25.asp" rel="nofollow">Bluff Magazine</a>; this time a profile of him.

<li>Please don't pretend that the <s>original</s> editor acted in good faith, as that is very offensive to editors who do and have. Frankly I don't know what you think the above proves, or even why you mention it. There is no dispute a cheating incident involving this person took place, and is mentioned in places around the web. The point is whether this person merits an article, and given after all this time there are only two sentences that are far more appropriate to either the online poker article or the cheating at poker articles, that pretty obviously answers the question. The person is a footnote of a footnote. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 06:59, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please read what I was responding to (Mikka's comment), and you'll see the point. And I don't know who you mean by the "original editor," because the article was edited by some dozen users before you nominated it for deletion. However, I certainly do assume good faith of the editors who try to improve the article in response to community demands. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">We're supposed to</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:29, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. So when did Wikipedia fall into the hands of these strict, authoritative, big-brother types who say "No no no!" to every minor article and edit, using the one-size-fits-all excuse of "Notability"? (No personal attacks notwithstanding, I point a big fat finger at <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">User:2005</a> as the embodiment of this negative attitude). I, for one, envision Wikipedia to be a source of ALL knowledge, big or small. In fact, I am the creator of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unity_Young_037b.html" title="Unity Young">Unity Young</a> article, who is much less notable than Justin Bonomo, but who became (humorously) famous after ONE single bout on ESPN2. Does the Unity Young article serve the community of curious people who stop by Wikipedia to see if there's some info about her? YES! And I will fight anyone who wants to delete THAT article. Just like I will fight anyone who tries to delete this one here. Thus, I join with my fellow Wikipedians who wish to keep the Justin Bonomo article. We are not strict disciplinarians. We want free, open knowledge. Immense, vast, all-encompassing, searchable knowledge. I used to be a random user who searched Wikipedia for ANY and ALL knowledge. As long as there are curious people who come to Wikipedia to search for "Justin Bonomo", to see what Wikipedia has to say about his cheating, then that is notable enough for me (and most others). This article shall remain. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloudreaver_a68f.html" title="User:Cloudreaver">Cloudreaver</a> 21:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>These two points</b> are so important, let me re-emphasize: SEARCHABILITY and CONTENT. If enough people SEARCH for it, Wikipedia should have it. And focus on increasing CONTENT, the more content the better. The more entries the better. 1,000,000,000,000 entries on Wikipedia, I say. Let the knowledge and information flow.<a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloudreaver_a68f.html" title="User:Cloudreaver">Cloudreaver</a> 21:30, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Maybe some acts that eventually made it big came through the venue, but the same can be said of many other venues, like Okayz Corral in Madison, Wisconsin, which hosted such bands as <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana.html" title="Nirvana">Nirvana</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barenaked_Ladies_3f0b.html" title="Barenaked Ladies">Barenaked Ladies</a>. Are we going to have articles about all of these local venues just because some eventually famous bands once played there? True, some local venues like <a href="../../../c/b/g/CBGB_7cf7.html" title="CBGB">CBGB</a> have become legendary on a national scale, but I see no evidence of this for TBP. The first source in the article, a local publication, even refers to TBP as just a place for "mid-grade" acts. If even the local media regard the venue as being of "mid-grade" importance, why should Wikipedia regard it as important enough to merit its own article? I think it ought to be moved to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a> per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Cities_and_shops" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">precedent regarding touristic information</a> <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 00:27, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

First, I'm somewhat amused by the armflapping triggered by the absence of notability standards. Notability, regardless of what class the subject falls into, is established by evidence that the subject has been noted. Despite the number of links in the article I'm not convinced that this place has. The Daily Iowan and Iowa State Daily links are passing mentions, others are just simply listings, and Newsbank does not provide anything either (two passing mentions). So absent a <i>portrait</i> of the place in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> it should receive at best a passing mention in the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_house.html" title="Punk house">punk house</a> article, which itself needs some serious sourcing.

Im suggesting this should be investigated. I do not believe that we should have a article on every building where something happens but this seems notable to me due to the fact that it appears the building was host to <i>notable</i> people. Also I would like to say if very little information is available about the building itself (which I would bet is true) then maybe this would be better off in a list since many lists host information when there is little available to make a fair length article on each list item. <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>- Tutmosis</small></a> 00:19, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> There is nothing inherently notable in United Flight 923. There are several of them every week. This article deals with a miniscule part of the flight's history etc., a false alarm which has received 'one coverage' as defined in wiki notability criteria in WP:BIO. I contend that it is not a signicant event in aviation or terrorism history or the history of the airline in that it would not have a significant impact on future events that suggests that it would pass a 5 year test, let alone a 100 year test. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:43, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This hospital, per its article at time of nomination, was founded less than 100 years ago. I am not certain that those who are suggesting that this article is simply misnamed are correct, though I would agree that the hospital in question that was founded in 1639 and has a mention in the article about the city already would be a notable hospital deserving of an article. What makes you think this is the same hospital? <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 18:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I assumed the date of foundation in the article (and in one of the links) was correct. 1928 seems to be when the oldest part of the current hospital complex was completed. In either case, I think a major university hospital is notable (at least as notable as schools, community colleges, suburban railway stations and most sportspeople), even if it would be founded only in 1928. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 18:38, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A teaching hospital such as this one is as individual and distinctive as a university. The areas of specialization and the early founding of this hospital make it even more notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This AfD serves as a good example of the dangers of labelling a non-English-language institution as not-notable. If you suspect that such an organization is not notable, ask for advice from someone with the relevant language skills rather than moving immediately to an AfD. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 17:51, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I disagree with this premise. This is an issue involving erroneous naming of the hospital and an erroneous founding date when I proposed this AfD. If this were an English language article that was one sentence in length with an incorrect name and incorrect factual data, the same result would have likely occurred. I am withdrawing this nomination even though I think the article I nominated was deserving of deletion because the change in subject matter to one that is clearly notable destroys any need for deletion.<a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 18:13, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>— Intended to let this one go as a done deal. But I couldn’t resist the temptation to weigh in on TruthbringerToronto's comment. Periodically we kill useful material because someone with English as a second language (ESL) does a poor job of starting it. The question often is, are we dealing with an 11 year old boy feeling his oats or a less than articulate ESL contributor. It is always a great pleasure to see this process correctly sort out an AfD nomination. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 01:50, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Is this article really NOPV? I have looked at the article and looked at the website it describes. The text in the article seems to closely reflect the text that the website uses to promote itself. Furthermore, though it is not mentioned in the article, the website described in the article is apparently a for-profit website. External links that consumers are encouraged to click on to see recommendations of how to save money, result in the website itself receiving money from the commercial websites that the consumer links to. I am concerned that this article is in effect advertising a for-profit website. I think we should look into this more carefully before deciding. Dendennis 21:35, 29 August 2006

<li>'<b>Comment</b> (from article contributer). The text of the article does closely reflect the the text the site uses to promote itself, but how else could the article be done and properly reference sources? If you look at newspaper reviews and mentions (e.g. <a href="http://browse.guardian.co.uk/search?search=moneysavingexpert.com" class="external text" title="http://browse.guardian.co.uk/search?search=moneysavingexpert.com" rel="nofollow">here</a> or search for it <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">here</a>) of the site then possibly you may be able to find more NPoV reviews, but from what I can see newspapers (being lazy) just seem to reprint information from press releases or just lift text directly from the site themselves. I could put up things I find negative about the site, but without finding someone in print who agrees to quote, it would be my personal review. It does say in the info box that the site is commercial and more could be said on this, but I didn't see any Wikipedia articles mentioning how other sites were funded and I wondered how appropriate it was. I'll would gladly write a whole section on this right now, but I'm reluctant to change the article during a review <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldaden_4802.html" title="User:Aldaden">Aldaden</a> 08:21, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> on many counts. Let me declare an interest though, I came to Wiki after reading one of Martin Lewis's blogs recently and am a regular user and fan of the site, which is a huge vast resource of help to many people; and widely acclaimed as such in the UK. It's interesting to compare it to similar UK money sites. We have an entry for Moneysupermarket (Alexa rank 5414 compared to MoneySavingExpert 3083) and even Housepricecrash (Alexa rank 15,000). This site even has a motion in the UK House of Commons supporting its work. As for the finances, I've just been reading through it and can't see any conflict. Having read the linked source on the subject it seemed clear to me that this site is 'ethical stance with the principles of being free to use with no advertisements[3], independent, unbiased and journalistic in all its research and money-saving articles' whilst at the same time commercial (as noted in the info box). Perhaps its also worth us all having perspective we're on Wiki, this article can be changed and amended we're really talking about whether the entry is worthy and its clear to me it is.

<p>Thank you. Sorry for the confusion.</p>
<p>Here are the possible reasons for keeping this article as is: (1-3) the quotations by Crichton, Josephson, and Paltridge in the "History and Background" section; (4-5) the Lindzen and Lomborg examples in the "Resistance to Contradiction" (??!!) section; and (6) the widespread use of the phrase, as attested by the fact that Google turns up a large number of hits when you type in "'consensus science'". Reasons 1-5 are dealt with by Dicksonlaprade (me) on this article's discussion page. All that's left of these reasons are the quotations by Crichton and Paltridge. Not enough to save the article by themselves, in my view.</p>
<p>As for the Google thing, a perusal of the first twenty search results for the phrase "'consensus science'" shows that the vast majority of them fall into one of the following categories: the Wikipedia entry which I am discussing and the related entry at Answers.com; references to Michael Crichton's speech; things which have nothing to do with "consensus science" at all (e.g., the book title <i>Forged Consensus: Science, Technology</i>, etc.); or blog entries (for, e.g., fare.livejournal.com and blogcritics.org). Conspicuously lacking are references by scientists or by historians or philosophers of science to the concept.</p>
<p>I also did a search for articles and reviews in the science and history/philosophy of science journals in the database JSTOR. The only references to the phrase "'consensus science'" which I turned up were to the aforementioned book title. Considering that JSTOR indexes articles from such prestigious journals as <i>Science</i>, <i>Evolution</i>, and <i>Philosophy of Science</i>, this absence is especially damning.</p>
<p>As per the "Verifiability" policy, it would appear that the best resource for this concept is Michael Crichton of <i>Jurassic Park</i> fame--hardly a philosopher or historian of science--and his epigones. This being the case, I see no reason for this article not to become a subdivision of "scientific consensus." Giving this dubious concept its own entry makes it appear that some reliable professionals give it credence--an appearance for which I can find no evidence.</p>

<dd>Insofar as this article's primary purpose is to "describe potential pitfalls of scientific consensus," it seems that the material in this article would be better placed on the "scientific consensus" page. Insofar as "consensus science" is a distinct concept/term with relatively wide usage in scientific circles, it would deserve its own article--but I see no evidence for this. By way of comparison, Ann Coulter's recent book <i>Godless</i> uses the term "flatulent raccoon theory" to describe the theory of evolution because, in her mind, it is such a ridiculous theory. There are many Wikipedia articles where this fact about her could be mentioned, but since the term itself comes only from Ann Coulter and her epigones, there is no need to give it its own entry. The same applies here: without Michael Crichton and those who quote him approvingly (<i>outside</i> of the scientific community), there is no "consensus science." <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicksonlaprade_3bc8.html" title="User:Dicksonlaprade">Dicksonlaprade</a> 16:11, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good searching. HOWEVER: the article "Climate Consensus and the End of Science" is written by Terence Corcoran of the "Financial Post"--not exactly the best source in terms of <i>Verifiability</i>. Item #3 on your list refers to the term "consensus science" only in a Michael Crichton quotation. Item #4's only citation to the phrase "consensus science" is a link to one of the 7 articles in <i>Nature</i>, the one by Pielke (Pielke is also the author of #4).</dd>

<dd>I checked and it turns out that JSTOR, the database which I used, does not include <i>Nature</i>,which explains the absence of these articles which you mention. HOWEVER: the first of the 7 entries in <i>Nature</i> makes no reference to "consensus science" except in the title, while the second is by Pielke (referenced by entry #4 in your own list). Out of all the journals catalogued by JSTOR <i>plus</i> the journal <i>Nature</i>, there are thus only half a dozen actual <i>uses</i> to the term. The case for KEEP is stronger than first appears, but 6-7 clear references in dozens of journals (JSTOR catalogues 62 journals in "Biological Sciences" alone) and in over 20 Google search results is still not a very strong case from the standpoint of Verifiability. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicksonlaprade_3bc8.html" title="User:Dicksonlaprade">Dicksonlaprade</a> 21:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Out of over 20 Google search results and over 60 journals, the best resource for this concept is a half-dozen references in a single journal and TV and novel writer Michael Crichton. Thomas Kuhn doesn't use the concept and neither (to my knowledge) do Karl Popper, Daniel Dennett, Paul Feyerabend, or any respected zoologists, botanists, physicists, epidemiologists, astronomers. . . .</dd>

<dd>Crichton is not a scientist. He is a TV and novel writer who went to medical school and (according to his Wikipedia entry) taught anthropology at Cambridge for a while. <i>Nature</i> is a good source, but the problem is that it is the <i>only</i> good source which uses the concept of "consensus science." When several dozen peer-reviewed journals fail to turn up more than six uses of a concept, this says that the concept does not deserve its own entry. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicksonlaprade_3bc8.html" title="User:Dicksonlaprade">Dicksonlaprade</a> 12:54, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Absolutely do not delete</b>This a real profession that has a fair amount of searches per month. Some of the sites listed are 100% SPAM and should not get a link. The ALNC and NALNC are the two main organizations according to all of my research.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as I quietly raise my hand as a legal nurse consultant - I've worked for myself full-time since 2002. The article does need a rewrite and there are definite differences between AALNC and NACLNC - <a href="http://www.nalnc.org" class="external free" title="http://www.nalnc.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.nalnc.org</a>. The Legal Nurse website, owned by the Vickie Milazzo Institutes, is a for-profit enterprise - one woman's company with claims of earning $150 per hour as a legal nurse, which are entirely false and mistleading. (I recognize some of the article's text - it's from the company that holds conferences and advertises false and misleading statements. NALNC - <a href="http://www.nalnc.org" class="external free" title="http://www.nalnc.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.nalnc.org</a> - is the only real organization. The profession, however, is a serious subspecialty of nursing, just like critical care nursing and the other subspecialties. I don't need Wikipedia validation to continue with my work because you guys don't pay me. However, the nursing articles are atrocious. Deleting articles about recognized nursing specialties with which lay editors aren't familiar doesn't help the encyclopedia as a whole. <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 09:44, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>He is notable because he was a two-term lieutenant governor of his state, a member of the state legislature, and a city judge.

<p>So he was an American lawyer who dabbled in politics.

<p>Serving in a state legislature alone makes one notable to be included in Wikipedia. He was in the legislature for 12 years. He was in Who's Who in America, 1984.</p>

<li>A mathematical paradox which happen to be labeled as Wright's paradox. No matter from where a paradox is extrapolated, be it a joke, a race by a tortoise and Achilles or some guy from Crete; a paradox is a paradox. I am well aware of the "No original research" rule, and this one is not. (If it was, I'd not be able to resist naming it after myself) Though I can not verify or give a link to a author or another place that it was published as this paradox was 'picked up' circulating around the campus. A search in Internet does not give even a close result neither to the type of the paradox or to its name. It certainly is an original work but not of the author of the article. Hopefully someone will come forward after seeing it published and claim authorship or a info will emerge latter here or somewhere else. Because the authorship can not be verified it would be bad to delete it from wikipedia just for that reason, as the paradox itself is a solid one and a very fine sample of the nature of geometric progression. Paradoxes don't come by very often and should not be 'killed' so fast when they do. --Otritos 21:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Then Uncle G, how did <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bible_5d21.html" title="The Bible">The Bible</a> ended up not being deleted? Ok, I know this is not exactly a proper example but my point is this article simply can not be verified for time being, it is unverifiable. Even though as a piece of information it is self evident, it is not something you can sit over and wonder if it's true or not. It is a mathematical demonstration. Just because the author is not known and there is a possibility that he will probably not be known, what is the next step according the wikipedia rules? To delete it? That is, as I said a paradox is a rare phenomenon and to think that one of the few paradoxes of this century does not get to find a place on the wikipedia because no one claims an authorship and a source can not be found Isn't this self defying for the purpose of wikipedia? The only thing that will help the cause for wikipedia with this case is to leave it there as it is and if a verifiable info emerges, good! If not, what is the reason and point of deleting it? I'd like to stress on this again, the article by itself is a unique entry of a paradox. And I am sorry I can't verify or state a source but this does not contradict the core idea behind verification i.e, validity and value as knowledge. It is simply sad to think something as rare as a paradox will have in its early history the fate of not finding a place in the corpus of wikipedia because physically it was not possible to track down an author or source. The best thing to do I think will be to give the article a chance and let it live for at least a month and if no verification can be obtained during that time then do whatever you think is proper.--Otritos 23:14, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll do my best to provide a verification. To the users who for some reason imagine the paradox described in the article is not a paradox I just want to say - you guys have a very powerful tool and a huge database right under your fingers. Please use it! Seriously people, do your research before you post a stupid comment on something you don't quite understand. Damn, I can't believe you are voting for deleting the article while you don't even have a clue what paradox is. It is a classical paradox derived from an exponential function describing linear function. Many of the present and Greek paradoxes are based on that. --Otritos 02:01, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>I say it needs an article because playing chicken with 381 lives is an excedingly noteworthy occurence. Also, there will likely be a large number of very noteable safety recomendations related to this accident when the investigation is completed, regarding the design of airports, how Air Traffic Control works and why the automatic collision avoidence systems failed. The page for the Teneriffe disaster links here. The cattegory this is listed in is not just 'accidents', it also contains 'incidents', where there was no major damage or injury, but still an important occurence. If almost hitting another jetliner isn't a noteable incident, I don't know what is.

<li>Sorry to add <b>yet another comment</b> to this discusion, just to say, the reason incursions like this are rare and unheard of is that usually the collision avoidance systems designed to prevent this sort of accident/incident from happening usually tell the aircraft involved to stop before they ever get going. Before this incident, the <a href="../../../f/a/a/FAA_42fa.html" title="FAA">FAA</a> had thought these systems to be unfailible. The fact that they failed on both aircraft and in the control tower and left two aircraft hurtling towards each other with engines at max power for take-off is a very serious and very noteable occurence. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 23:28, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As a private pilot, I would like to add a few words here. Incursions happen more often than most realize, TCAS or not (the equipment sandman talks about). The power setting on take off are higher than at cruise however that doesn't mean anything when you are dealing with inertia. A jet traveling at .93Mach has much more inertia than a jet rotating (lifting off speed) at 140-160knots no matter what the engine settings are. Crashes are notable. Incidents like this happen many times a year, though most civilians never hear about or realize they occurred. I suggest that this be removed.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not really. Many other flights have happened that have changed national or international flight rules. A large majority haven't any article on them. There are MANY near misses or 'deals' that occur over a standard year. There is nothing special about this one. In fact, I can note two more where aircraft in the past two years, have had this EXACT incident happen (all commercial airliners, all nose to nose on the runway). In fact I have one where one airliner was landing while another was lining up to take off right at the landing aircraft. Incidents happen. Nothing is notable for this one other than the media decided to make a big deal out of it. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 14:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sandman, no. TCAS does not work on the ground, nor would it detect aircraft on the ground, especially since the transponder was not turned on (they normally are only turned on after liftoff).

<dd>I have heard reference made by the NTSB to a secondary, less well-known system for ground use, the acronym and name for this escapes me. I was never refering to TCAS - although if it were switched on, as I understand it, (although I'm unsure of this) it can detect aircraft on the ground, but would simply transmit continuous false alarms since what is too close in mid-air is perfectly reasonable on the ground. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 19:10, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Runway incursions of this nature are not "common", its not very often you see over 300 people on a collision course with each other. Had the pilots not noted the other aircraft then we may of had another Tenerife, which I think makes it more than noteworthy. In addition, the fact quite a thorough investigation is taking place asserts the seriousness of the incident. 82.195.109.147, 22:05, 5 September 2006 (GMT)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It's these types of exaggerations, like the one above, that I'm afraid will get this article kept. Three hundred people were not on a collision course. Pilots are trained to handle very difficult situations. Do you think only on the ground is where those passengers faced danger? All through out the flight they were(just like all aircrafts in the air as I speak right now) in danger. Turbulence, weather, staying clear of other planes, minor malfunctions. All of that is danger. Do you purpose we make articles on those too? Make articles for every aircraft in serious danger. Traffic congestion is going to become a real big problem in airports around the world; the world isn't getting smaller, so we shouldn't be shocked by these near-misses in the future. Believe it or not, they will be happening. We can't have articles for each one of them. Wikipedia is becoming another newspaper source. TripleH1976 01:31, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - But what you just wrote is an exaggeration too. The dangerous parts of a flight are taking-off and landing. Planes rarely just fall out of the sky (maybe plane poop). I am not sure this falls under a "current events" category. Besides, you are using the "slippery slope" argument which is justifying current action by some unproved hypothetical. I agree to "keep" or delete only with some limitations. But if one of the pilots got an award from his peers for that, then it must have meant something.(see original vote above)<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_Joseph_38f4.html" title="User:Gary Joseph">Gary Joseph</a> 06:23, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I know planes don't just fall out of the sky. However, there is danger while in the air. Mainly from turbulence and bad weather. Many years ago, a Japanese airplane experienced some very turbulence. Enough so to toss around some passengers that weren't seated. My point is that near-accidents shouldn't be sufficient enough for an article. I see Wikipedia has rules, but they don't seem to be reinforced. The criteria for an article seems to be way too flexible around here. TripleH1976 09:14, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> Yes, I think I remember the Japanese incident - my only comment at the time was "that's why most regular air travelers keep their seatbelts on when they aren't moving around the plane, even if the little light says you can take them off". In the air, yes, there are a lot of small incidents involving some danger. I myself have been on a plane carrying over 100 people that had to divert to a longer runway after a mid-air brake failure, they even rolled the fire trucks for us and i've been on a <a href="../../../c/r/j/CRJ-200_e77a.html" title="CRJ-200">CRJ-200</a> that had an engine seize up shortly before landing, and during final aproach the pilot struggled to maintain control because he payed more attention to trying to restart the engine than anything else. As they take-off and land, that's when the real danger is, because a tiny little thing like that happening then could be disasterous. but they can at least expect to be clear of other aircraft on the ground - unlike in the air, the rules are "one at a time", so it's fairly easy to keep things in check - as soon as theirs a problem on the ground, ATC just says "Stop!" and they all do. The planes should never have been allowed to even get their take-off rolls started. That ATC left them on a collision course is almost unheard of, Tenerife being the obvious exception. A few more seconds, and it would have been too late to stop the plane taking off, and the planes would have collided, killing most or all of 381 people. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 11:43, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This article should be kept. All articles should be kept! If there is one person willing to write it and another interested in reading it, then why delete? The only articles which might ever be deleted should be those which are false, and those which distract from another, more correct article on the same topic. I think it is simply absurd that there are people out there who wish to get rid of articles simply because they personally judge them unimportant.

<li><b>Keep</b> One point of subject's notability during the 80s in addition to her bodybuilding awards is evidenced by 1986 membership in the Author's Guild, which at the time had strict requirements for membership...members needed at least 3 major publications with credible publishers. None of DeBarra's articles were "self published." I am a researcher who specializes in health and wellness research as well as other areas. Various writers and researchers have profiled DeBarra Mayo. Library or newspaper archives can provide validation. I have done clean up on the article and can do more if needed. I have also created other pages to provide historical reference of the "fitness craze" of the 80s. Thank you.

I plan to add many more articles related to health and wellness and I plan to add many more authors and writers who are not yet listed on Wikipedia. I am indeed the author of this article and will be happy to delete or change whatever is needed on this article to conform to the policy. I welcome any other help or comments.

<li>A slightly bizarre and somewhat ammusing allegation, oh anonymous person. Anyway my vote still stands. For the record I have nothing to do with these racist *tards other than a bizarre interest in the site they have created. Had I attempted a wikipedia prank I would hope that I could have come up with something that isnt a painfully derivitive pastiche of Mr Colbert! As I stated previously I dont think it merits inclusion in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalimfadhley_a4fd.html" title="User:Salimfadhley">Salimfadhley</a> 01:17, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Two main reasons <b>to delete this disambiguation page</b>.</p>
<p>1) The page has two links, one is empty with no corresponding article. So, really there is no ambiguity as to who is being refered to under the name of 'General McAuliffe'.</p>
<p>2) The 2nd person referenced in this article (General <i>Arthur</i> McAuliff) may not exist. There are some Internet resources that attribute quotes from this second listed General, but there is also evidence they are actual attributable to the first General.</p>
<p>Bottom line: The second General probably does not exist as a notable historical figure. -- <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERorndoff_61da.html" title="User:Rorndoff">Rorndoff</a> 22:30, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - Nine nexis hits, but six of them are just notices of his upcoming preaching at some church, listed alongside dozens of other local preachers in a routine scheduling notice akin to movie times. There is one reference to his participating in a conference, again alongside a list of other names without any notable detail provided. However, nexis found two editions of his <i>Who's Who</i> listing. This listing provides my reason for a 'weak keep' rather than full delete. <i>Who's Who</i> lists about twenty publications, ten board memberships, plus some awards and society memberships.

Now running down a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Pizzelle2%22++-forum+-forums+-blog+-blogs+-journal+-journals+-maker+-recipes+-recipe&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=RRp&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Pizzelle2%22++-forum+-forums+-blog+-blogs+-journal+-journals+-maker+-recipes+-recipe&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=RRp&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">search</a> that excludes forums, blogs, and journals (which are NOT acceptable as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> by wikipedia) and also excludes recipes for pizzelle, and pizzelle makers...and we come up with 34 unique hits (many of which are from youtube itself).</p>
<p>The only articles/acceptable sources I could find were the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/arts/16carney.html?ex=1302840000&amp;en=393710cf6b4e5c90&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/arts/16carney.html?ex=1302840000&amp;en=393710cf6b4e5c90&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">NYT</a> and a newsvine/online paper article (a weak source on it's own) which is a copy of the first article anyway. The NYT article borders on being trivial because it mainly talks about YouTube and other people's reactions (like "James") than Pizzelle2 herself. She has a sentance or two out of the article. The Teen People article is not referenced in the article and none of the webpages I can find online refer to the article. The Teen People website does not list any information about the article (though a library search may be done tomarrow as I have a few books to return)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>: I suspect the reason why some want the ICH entry deleted is because it provides an antidote to the deluge of propaganda we are fed every day, and therefore jars with their preferences. There are many original articles posted to ICH as first, or first equal, publisher and therefore it is worthy of its modest entry. If ICH goes then so should Alternet, Indymedia, Aljazeerah.info, and all the rest. Wikipedia has bigger problems than this issue, especially the tendentious character of many articles on controversial topics. On Google with this query, which excludes the site itself: -site:informationclearinghouse.info “Information Clearing House” Results 361 - 370 of about 911,000 for -site:informationclearinghouse.info “Information Clearing House”.

<li>'<b>Keep'</b>. It is a far more reliable source of world information than any other I have found on the net. It is a true antidote for the corporate media which tends to publish mostly government approved propaganda. If the NYT or WP or Fox rate an entry (and they fail every criteria for puplishing "verified" information) then Information Clearing House must have its entry retained. The fact that Information Clearing House has an entry is not an endorsment of its publishing philosophy. It is worth pointing out to the geniuses at Wiki that "verifiability" implies a statement of truth not that the statement comes from a "reliable source" even reliabe sources have been known to mislead. Learn your Latin. I would also point out that the reasons given for deletion are bogus.

<li>Keep: Who needs YOUR web rules? The original anarchy of the internet is the best illustration of a free market in action. Markets are inevitably self-organizing to the best interest of participants, provided state control and corporate-backed state regulation/manipulation don't interfere (Wikipedia is a prime example). Those who ask that ICH or any other web page conform to the standard seek just such control and manipulation. Freedom is present when one is free to say no. The free market will determine if ICH is relevant, not some geek-speak defined standard. Apparently, some among us can handle "free-markets", just not ones that involve the free exchange of ideas.

<li><b>KEEP</b>: We live in a highly polarized world where commercial media is largely no longer used to educate and report, but instead targeted to form opinion and guide the reader toward the desired result. Corporate media has uncritically helped the current US government spread misinformation about Iraq in order to get the desired result of war backed by the American people. Corporate Media is largely responsible for misleading the populance as well as lawmakers, and therefore the statement “reliable published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles,... television documentaries,...” is an oxymoron in itself. Corporate Media is the modern State Propaganda tool. ICH uses news sources that include foreign media as well as providing original editorial content. It is a legitimate form of media and should therefore be kept.

<li><b>Keep</b> I fail to see why ICH shouldn't be included in Wikipedia. Perhaps someone would be kind enough to translate the original complaint into simple English for me. Is it a question of whether ICH presents "reliable" or "verifiable" information? I don't read the mainstream press or watch TV news because I don't trust the mass media to give me an honest report of what's going on in the world. Instead I look through the offerings at ICH and several other sites each day and click on the links that interest me. Some are news items and some are opinion pieces. IMO, the news articles often have an implied pov, while most opinion pieces include factual information to support their views. I'm old enough to distinguish between fact and opinion, and between one person's alleged facts and those which can be substantiated. What I'm saying is that I feel ICH serves a valuable service to the community and I don't automatically agree with everything I see there.

<li><b>Keep</b> Information Clearing House is a better source of information than most of the 'mainstream' drivel that is fed to us a news.

<p><b>Keep</b>: As mentioned before "reliability" is not guaranteed ... even by NYT (remember Judith Miller's story about WMD in Iraq!). This article fits perfectly well in the context of alternate media. By definition, alternate media does not aim for popularity like the mainstream media which rely on advertisement revenue and have to be "popular". IMHO, this site provides one type of viewpoint and I find it valuable. The article seems to be neutral in mentioning that it has leftist slant. So visitors have been warned about the orientation.

<b>KEEP</b>: What ostensibly validates existence at Wikipedia is "reliable published works" in newspapers, etc. There is an article in today's ICH, <a href="http://www.chris-floyd.com/index.php?optionfiltered=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=825&amp;Itemid=135" class="external free" title="http://www.chris-floyd.com/index.php?optionfiltered=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=825&amp;Itemid=135" rel="nofollow">http://www.chris-floyd.com/index.php?optionfiltered=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=825&amp;Itemid=135</a> which explores the removal of a story from the NYT website, available in the UK, as it is in the U.S. The story is removed only to UK readers. In addition, "The Paper of Record" was not even delivered to the UK, yet the story that was blocked was printed by other papers that depend on "reliable published works." The NYT continues to sully its supposed reputation by this blatant censorship. Why on earth would Wikipedia want to follow that path and call it 'upstanding'? Is ICH to be censored because they, somehow, do not follow the shameful and unreliable paths that are taken by too many other "reliable published works"? This self-serving phrase is like a well-known other: "All the News That's Fit to Print." Which is to say, neither of these phrases are accurate or truthful. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.136.245.160 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.136.245.160.html" title="User talk:24.136.245.160">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.136.245.160_c309.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.136.245.160">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 24.136.245.160 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.136.245.160.html" title="User talk:24.136.245.160">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.136.245.160_c309.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.136.245.160">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></p>

Whether they would survive an AfD popularity test is a different quesiton. As you see here, we have a lot of motivated one time accounts. For example, Roberts is notable in his own right but his sole contributions to ICH do not necessarily make them notable (ICH carrying articles that are published elsewhere does not make ICH notable). --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 02:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b> - There is no coherent case against the retention of ICH in Wikipedia. The charges contained in the first entry above and several supporting entries are without any credible foundation in fact. The supporting arguments are spurious for they rely entirely on the unsound presuppositions contained in the original indictment - ie. the first entry.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I read lots of newspapers on line. Most of them give a very one sided view of the news. There are websites like ICH who publish a different view eg. Democracy now. And it is in Wikipedia. So I cannot understand why all this rubbish is about. Is it political agenda to take away our freedom of information? Or is it personal attack against some one who is trying to bring some sanity into the media? It will be tragic if this entry is deleted for all of us who believe in free information.

<p><b>proposed deletion</b> of non notable contestant designer who was eliminated in Project Runway. Alexa score of 534,900, linked to by 16 sites. Scores 19200 Ghits of which 637 unique. Of these, the vaaast majority are Blog entries discussing him, some others where PR is the primary subject of the article. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:19, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep:</b> Reality shows done well are comedy / dramas. They are crafted to make us interested in the contestants for 15 or 16 weeks. They are in effect mini-soap operas. As such, winning is beside the point to the "notability" of those involved. Read the blogs on the show as people passionately defend the "good guys" or berate the "bad guys". Indeed, given that the producers do not need to worry about keeping fans interested in the same characters for year after year (as is the case in traditional television fare), they are freer to pump up the story lines and the resulting emotions. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 16:36, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The claim seems to be that unless you have notability outside of a Reality TV series, you are not entitiled to space in Wikipedia (space being such an increadably precious commodity within Wikipedia. Oh wait it isn't, is it?). By this logic, all Wikipedia pages devoted to fictional characters should be marked for deletion. After all, a fictional character's notability is almost by defintion a construct of the fiction in which he or she occurs. For example, Col. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> has a very nice article despite the fact that he is a character on Stargate / SG-1. Presumably, his notabilty is solely a function of the movie and the TV show and all the web references about him will be in the same contexts. Jack O'Neill will never write a book or run for president or do anything else notable, other than be a character of fiction. The contestants on a Reality TV show occupy an interesting niche. There notablity may be nothing more than that given by the show on which they appear. But if being a character on SG-1 is sufficent for notablity for Jack O'Neill, then it strikes me that it is sufficent for Kayne Gillaspie, Keith Michael, Bradley Baumkirchner, and all the rest. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 17:56, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A follow-up to my note above. One might argue that as main character on a series that has run for 10 years, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> has acheived some kind of notableness outside the context of the show. If so, one would still be hard pressed to justify the pages of <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._and_Mrs._Stoppable_e7d9.html" title="Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable">Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Mankey_5daf.html" title="Josh Mankey">Josh Mankey</a>. These may not ring any bells for those not plugged into day-time Disney fare. The former are the parents of <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Possible_5e05.html" title="Kim Possible">Kim Possible</a>'s sidekike <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Stoppable_eb80.html" title="Ron Stoppable">Ron Stoppable</a> and the later is Kim's love interest in several episodes. Again, my take is that the characters on Project Runway et.al. are in fact characters in a drama. The standards of notablity for inclusion in Wikipedia should be based on the standards for Television characters. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 18:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> actually, as a nomination made by a banned user. Take a look at article history. The AFD tag was added by a mostly vandalism AOL user and the "2" was added by an impersonator of admin Tony Sidaway. Given that the impostor's edit was four minutes after the IP added the AFD tag, I think it's reasonable to assume that the two are one in the same. Thus, <b>speedy keep</b> as a nomination made by a banned user. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 18:58, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No original research. Unverifiable and not well-defined. There is no apparently no widely accept meaning of "Gainax Ending" other than an ending that doesn't satisfy the viewers. This is objective and not worth a wikipedia entry. The concept doesn't exist outside a select few anime circles, and is not even well-known in the anime world itself. No verifiable use of this term outside wikipedia, or other "answer" sources which borrow from wikipedia has been shown. There is no published record of this term. Mgio 05:29, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Up until early this month, the only other changes that happened to the article were the bolding of the person's name and the addition of the {{<a href="../../../p/o/r/Template%7EPorn-stub_2f4d.html" title="Template:Porn-stub">porn-stub</a>}} tag. The most recent edits have been to identify him as being from Australia and to add an additional sentence asserting the importance of the person. There is no source for the claim that he's gay; just because he won an award for being in a gay movie doesn't make that so. Articles like this are not stubs, they're a waste of time. If the original editor can't come up with more than a one-sentence article, they shouldn't start it; this should have been Speedy Deleted when it was first created.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I agree there is not enough content. I would contend though that, as I understand it, the reason for deleting Cole Tucker was not his lack of significance but the lack of quality content in his article. I would further argue that Joe Foster is as deserving as the many porn star entries that are currently in existence for a quality entry but this is obviously not a quality entry. Lastly, I take some exception to the statement about Joe Foster being gay. There is no statement in the article about him actually being gay but it is well documented that he worked in gay pornography.Fillups44 17:02, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: If I misinterpreted the sentence, "Joe Foster is a gay porn actor", I'm sure I'm not alone. It could very well be read as describing his sexual orientation rather than the type of porn he appears in. The latter is acceptable provided a gay porn film that lists him in the cast credits is referenced; the former is potentially libellous unless specific veriable sources that state that he is gay are found.<font color="#FF6600">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 00:21, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>speedy keep</b>. It should not take a half hour to write a nomination. If you can't write an AfD now, stick the tag on the article later. If people do this, it's not a big deal to just delete the tag. Given the indication that the page is useful (by the way, that should be "Keep" not "Oppose") and lack of reasoning for deletion, and the likely little attention this will receive because it's the end of the day anyway, I'm closing this. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 02:38, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Oppose</b> Hmm, well, not sure why this disambiguation page was put up for deletion, since the nominating editor didn't explain his/her reasoning. So since I created the page I'll start. As I noted when moving the original MOTY article to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_of_the_Year_%282006_film%29_a28b.html" title="Man of the Year (2006 film)">Man of the Year (2006 film)</a>, I'm planning on writing an article about one of the other films of that title. I may write one about one of the other MOTY movies too. It strikes me as completely reasonable and logical to have a disambig page for a topic that has at least five and possibly more potential articles. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:51, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's an encyclopedia, and thus notability should be strictly construed. A person of note to a specialist in a field is not necessarily notable, unless there has been a popular strain in that field. Again, I know of oodles of published, intelligent authors who are not on Wikipedia, and do not belong. Weed out the ones who are on here just because they have a fan club. That's where I'm coming from. Since the material has been added, it's possibility it's only a <b>weak delete</b>, but again, a Marxist historian who published 13 books no one read?

<dd>I fail to see how the spectrum of notability has anything to do with the fact he is a person of note and worthy of inclusion on an encyclopedia.

<dd>I would vote to delete State Route 385 even as I modified it--and we all know how much you hate driving on it, Shazbot. I would vote to delete it because it's nn. However, there are other state routes on here, so you want to be consistent. "References" are not enough to determine notability--it has to be notable. And you have to quantify this. About one million people in Memphis, plus another one million who used to live in Memphis, could tell you what State Route 385 or Nonconnah or Bill Morris or Paul Barrett was. I don't think two million people in the entire world could tell me who Raphael Samuel was.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 00:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Raphael Samuel had a profound effect on the historical profession in Britain and elsewhere. His published work is notable but does not reflect his influence on generations of students and historians. He has an entry in the Dictionary of National Biography and a portrait in the National Portrait Gallery. A entry should stay but not this one as it fails to capture Samuel's importance to the New Social History of the 1960s, to the project of 'history from below' and later to his writings on culture and memory. It is also inaccurate in places.

<li><b>Keep:</b> Reality shows done well are comedy / dramas. They are crafted to make us interested in the contestants for 15 or 16 weeks. They are in effect mini-soap operas. As such, winning is beside the point to the "notability" of those involved. Read the blogs on the show as people passionately defend the "good guys" or berate the "bad guys". Indeed, given that the producers do not need to worry about keeping fans interested in the same characters for year after year (as is the case in traditional television fare), they are freer to pump up the story lines and the resulting emotions. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 16:36, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The claim seems to be that unless you have notability outside of a Reality TV series, you are not entitiled to space in Wikipedia (space being such an increadably precious commodity within Wikipedia. Oh wait it isn't, is it?). By this logic, all Wikipedia pages devoted to fictional characters should be marked for deletion. After all, a fictional character's notability is almost by defintion a construct of the fiction in which he or she occurs. For example, Col. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> has a very nice article despite the fact that he is a character on Stargate / SG-1. Presumably, his notabilty is solely a function of the movie and the TV show and all the web references about him will be in the same contexts. Jack O'Neill will never write a book or run for president or do anything else notable, other than be a character of fiction. The contestants on a Reality TV show occupy an interesting niche. There notablity may be nothing more than that given by the show on which they appear. But if being a character on SG-1 is sufficent for notablity for Jack O'Neill, then it strikes me that it is sufficent for Kayne Gillaspie, Keith Michael, Bradley Baumkirchner, and all the rest. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 17:56, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>A follow-up to my note above. One might argue that as main character on a series that has run for 10 years, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> has acheived some kind of notableness outside the context of the show. If so, one would still be hard pressed to justify the pages of <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._and_Mrs._Stoppable_e7d9.html" title="Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable">Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Mankey_5daf.html" title="Josh Mankey">Josh Mankey</a>. These may not ring any bells for those not plugged into day-time Disney fare. The former are the parents of <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Possible_5e05.html" title="Kim Possible">Kim Possible</a>'s sidekike <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Stoppable_eb80.html" title="Ron Stoppable">Ron Stoppable</a> and the later is Kim's love interest in several episodes. Again, my take is that the characters on Project Runway et.al. are in fact characters in a drama. The standards of notablity for inclusion in Wikipedia should be based on the standards for Television characters. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 18:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Mars-Sekhmet, UABVulcan, and Jawed3 all make good points. Wiki is not the right place for political disagreements. Groups like TheVanguard.org, Move-On, NOW, ATR, etc. are all important players in America's democratic process. TheVanguard.org has influential board members and a high profile president, plus the article is thoroughly referenced. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurkey2020_76fa.html" title="User:Turkey2020">Turkey2020</a> 15:25, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> UABVulcan is right. Disagreements with an organization are not grounds for its removal from Wiki. It's certainly no more "promotional" than the Move-On, NOW, or Act Up articles. The article is accurate, well-referenced, and does not resort to puffery. Mars-Sekhmet 13:10, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> The continued character assassination using wiki as a political POV vehicle is appalling. Besides, this article is a NPOV entry which states merely the facts about a political organization. As such, my vote is to keep. <a href="../../../u/a/b/User%7EUABVulcan_a32d.html" title="User:UABVulcan">UABVulcan</a> 15:36, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> For all the reasons just stated in my comment below, I think this article should be here (which is why I wrote it in the first place). Everyone knows about the big names like Dobson and Kennedy and Falwell, but they need to know who else is in the room when Rove is doing his thing. These people have access, they are privy to things the rest of us are not, and everyone has a right to know that. And whoever's trying to cover it up is doing everyone a real disservice. Maybe they're stooges for the RNC. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelosHarriman_4570.html" title="User:DelosHarriman">DelosHarriman</a> 16:57, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Over half of the Arlington Group's member organizations are actually part of another Arlington Group member organization (e.g., there are at least three on the list which are headed by D. James Kennedy, at least ten headed by James Dobson). The number of principles in the room is reputed to be about thirty; and they have constant access to Rove, Bush, etc. If that's not notable (especially to the majority of Americans who don't like George Bush and Karl Rove), I'd like to know what is. I think all of this should be known, and I think you're engaging in a cover-up. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelosHarriman_4570.html" title="User:DelosHarriman">DelosHarriman</a> 16:54, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
