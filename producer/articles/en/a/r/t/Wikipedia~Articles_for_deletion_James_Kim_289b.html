<p>This article is a hot subject, and I understand that. I can relate to people who want to talk about and commiserate after the tragedy of this brave man's death. Nominating this article for deletion is going to make me a villain to some, but so be it. <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/07/MOOD.TMP" class="external text" title="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/07/MOOD.TMP" rel="nofollow">It has been noted</a> that this story garnered a great deal of attention from media spectators, particularly on the internet. I imagine with so much attention being paid, it was inevitable that this story should come to Wikipedia. Be that as it may, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BLOG" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia isn't a blog.</a> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia isn't a memorial.</a></p>
<p>There was no article for <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Kim_20f8.html" title="James Kim">James Kim</a> prior to his being featured in the 24/7 news cycle. The <a href="../../../j/a/m/Talk%7EJames_Kim_71c7.html" title="Talk:James Kim">talk page</a> for his article mentions his notability through his journalism career. This can only be seen as a revisionist justification; no one had seen the subject as noteworthy until the news media placed so much focus on it.</p>
<p>Others have argued that his death may serve as a lesson to others; that some may learn from the events. I can see from the article and the talk page that there is even discussion of "mistakes" made. Personally, I find the subject extremely distressing. I actually got a little nauseous reading what I felt was morbid overanalysis of a horrifying series of events. Personal feelings aside however, if people are looking for lessons on <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survival_skills.html" title="Survival skills">Survival skills</a> or to read about the dangers of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothermia.html" title="Hypothermia">Hypothermia</a>, then let them go to those articles. I can honestly say that I don't think anyone will come here seeking knowledge on subjects of this sort.</p>
<p>I think it is best to leave current event stories to current event story outlets, regardless of the emotional component. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMael-Num_eb75.html" title="User:Mael-Num">Mael-Num</a> 08:03, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: <b>hugely inappropriate for deletion.</b> This is a truly bizarre suggestion, given that anyone who has published anything with an ISBN number attached to is appropriate fodder for a wikipedia article, no matter how obscure and insignificant they are. Some people become known through life, and others through death. The article is quite thorough and factual, and these facts are thought-provoking and capable of stirring public debate about travel safety. Case studies of particular people are relevant to these debates. This is Wikipedia at its finest. If this is a candidate for deletion, then I am going to recommend the 5,000,000 nobodys who have been awareded publishing contracts and now have stubs that say "John Doe is the author of..." for deletion. If there is ever another family stuck in the woods through misfortune, and the news says "In an incident reminiscent of the demise of James Kim..." people should be able to come to Wikipedia to find out who this man was, how he came to be known to millions, and how he died. Aron Ralston has an article here because he got trapped in a canyon under a rock for days, cut off his own hand to free himself, and live to write a book about it. Kim, already in the media due to his career, walked 16 miles through the remote winter wilderness to save his stranded family and died. While we're at it, should we delete both of these articles using the very logic of Mael-Num? Or is it the book written by the survivor that makes all the difference? <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.108.68.7_e498.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.108.68.7">86.108.68.7</a> (talk) 11:29, 16 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: <b>Inappropriate reasons given for deletion.</b> Mael-Num, your reasons for deletion do not conform to Wikipedia guidelines. For an individual to be included in Wikipedia <b>that individual does NOT have to be noteworthy before the events for which he garnered media attention</b>, whether he is alive or dead. If there was no article about James Kim prior to his notoriety in the 24/7 news cycle it would be irrelevant and has no relation to Wikipedia guidelines; again <b>Wikipedia guidelines do NOT state an individual must be noteworthy prior to the events for which that individual garnered media attention</b>; obviously if that was the case, innumerable articles regarding individuals like <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polly_Klaas_adaa.html" title="Polly Klaas">Polly Klaas</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mark_Karr_8053.html" title="John Mark Karr">John Mark Karr</a> would also be deleted. James Kim need not have been noteworthy for his journalism career. Furthermore, <b>Wikipedia guidelines do NOT state that an individual's death necessarily has to provide "lessons" or useful information regarding survival skills, any other skills, or practical information about the physical ailments from which they died</b>; whether the events surrounding the individual's notoriety are practically useful to the reader or not and whether or not those events provide "lessons" is <b>absolutely irrelevant under Wikipedia guidelines</b>. Furthermore, you cite emotion and memorializing in this article, but no such emotion or memorializing is present in the article (perhaps you could cite specific instances of it?). The only memorializing I see is a link to CNET's memorial of James Kim; whether that link is valid to include <b>within</b> the article (rather than solely as an "external link") is another discussion. If you feel this article should be deleted, please provide reasons for deletion that conform to Wikipedia guidelines. Blacksun1942 22:41, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. One could argue that an article was warranted before his disappearance, but sufficient information about the man was not available to those who would write it. If his career was significant enough and he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, he should stay. There certainly isn't a lack of interest in information about him. For what it's worth, I'd be quicker to keep this article than the one for, say, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Jordan_%28basketball%29_9acd.html" title="James Jordan (basketball)">Michael Jordan's father</a>, which is there pretty much solely because of his untimely death (after passing an AfD). -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 08:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Let's not muddy the waters. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Jordan_%28basketball%29_9acd.html" title="James Jordan (basketball)">Michael Jordan's father</a> is a separate issue. All the same, as you clearly demonstrate in your response, you take exception to the fact that this similarly unnotable person received a Wikipedia entry due in part to popular media attention to the subject. You make the argument that <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Jordan_%28basketball%29_9acd.html" title="James Jordan (basketball)">Michael Jordan's father</a> should be deleted because the man was little known outside of his association with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_jordan.html" title="Michael jordan">one of the best known basketball players of all time</a>. So why shouldn't that <i>exact same logic</i> apply to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Kim_20f8.html" title="James Kim">James Kim</a>, because if I bumped into James Kim (or his father, wife, brother, or son) before or after this event, I would not recognize him at all. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMael-Num_eb75.html" title="User:Mael-Num">Mael-Num</a> 20:00, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Mael-Num, your rationale that James Kim was not notable before the events surrounding his death which garnered media attention <b>is NOT part of Wikipedia guidelines regarding inclusion OR deletion</b>. Neither is the fact that you wouldn't recognize him in the street. <b>Wikipedia guidelines do NOT state that an individual must be noteworthy before the events which garnered media attention and focus on that individual, whether that individual is alive or dead.</b> <b>Wikipedia guidelines do NOT state that an individual must be personally recognizable to you before or after the events which garnered them media spotlight.</b> You have NOT used standards which conform to Wikipedia guidelines in order to justify your nomination for the deletion of this article. Using your rationale, countless other articles would be deleted as well; Was <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polly_Klaas_adaa.html" title="Polly Klaas">Polly Klaas</a> noteworthy before her death? Would you recognize her face even now? How about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mark_Karr_8053.html" title="John Mark Karr">John Mark Karr</a>? Was he note-worthy before the events in which he was involved that garnered him media attention? How about the climber <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aron_Ralston_3d55.html" title="Aron Ralston">Aron Ralston</a>, the man who became stuck in Blue John Canyon and amputated his own arm to escape and survive? Was he famous before that event? Would you recognize him before or after that event? Once again, <b>if you feel an article should be deleted, you MUST provide reasons for deletion that conform to Wikipedia guidelines</b>. You have not done so. Blacksun1942 22:41, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well, don't muddy the logic either...I didn't say that two individuals were comparable. I used Mr. Jordan as an example of a case where an article was kept solely for the situation surrounding his death; before death, James Kim was notable for other things (of course, James Jordan did beget Michael, but I'd generally say that biological notability is a little different). I'm sure that if it stays, the article will ultimately be about his life and career, not about his death. And again, for what it's worth, if I had bumped into James Kim before his death, I definitely would have recognized him. Notability doesn't mean that everyone everywhere will know the individual&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 21:11, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Article is tightly sourced and provides a biography of a person that has been in the news recently.

<li><b>Comment</b> I didn't look at the talk page, but to me the article doesn't contain any morbid analysis. It's actually quite well written. I'm not sure what your point is about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a blog, since this has plenty of major non-internet media outlets. Similarly, the nom seems to be incorrect about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a memorial, as that section is really intended to prevent family members from creating vanity pages about dead relatives or lists of 9/11 or Iraq victims or such. The real concern, as usual, is notability. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <i>used to</i> have some line about treating coverage of one day's events as only one instance of media coverage, but I've got a sense that the fact this ordeal got stretched out over several days would provide just the loophole needed to keep the article. Excluding that consideration, which seems to be moot, he clearly meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 08:47, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If you didn't look at the talk page, which is what my comment was addressing in part, then perhaps you should try to read it before attempting a rebuttal. If you had, then you might understand my statement about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a blog (i.e. that people are gathering on the talk page do <i>exactly</i> what bloggers do on pages dedicated to that pasttime: chat and exchange opinions). Your opinion based on the intentions behind the creation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a memorial are moot. This isn't a memorial. Light a candle; this isn't the place for people to, again, log in and commiserate which is <i>exactly</i> what the talk page is being used for. Blog space. As you mentioned the perceived intentions of Wiki's founders, so shall I. <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">WP:IMP</a> states that one flaw in the current definions of "what is worth writing about" do not <i>"explain the difference between items that are of lasting significance and items that are of fleeting interest"</i>, the obvious statement there being that <b>items that are of fleeting interest don't belong in Wikipedia</b>. Your reaction is worth noting, but reactionary people should keep it to themselves; there's been enough of that in this case already. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMael-Num_eb75.html" title="User:Mael-Num">Mael-Num</a> 20:00, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't look at the talk page because it doesn't have any bearing on whether we delete the article. The blog section of not is to prevent people from abusing user space and server space. Similarly, if the talk page is a memorial, that has little bearing on the article. I'm not sure what you mean about "the perceived intentions of Wiki's founders", but <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">WP:IMP</a> has been superseeded by other criteria that people are citing properly in this AfD, such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 20:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong and Speedy Keep</b> With all due respect, I find this nomination for deletion to be self-evidently absurd in the extreme. The emotional components and memorializing that you cite are not included in the James Kim article, so I am unsure why you cite them as reasons for deletion. James Kim and the events surrounding his disappearance and death had focused media attention and headlines not only nationwide throughout the United States, but throughout the world as well. To suggest this article should be deleted means that articles about Eizabeth Smart or Nicole Brown Simpson should be deleted; neither of them remotely qualified as noteworthy people under Wikipedia guidelines until the media focused on the unique events they were involved in. For a person to be noteworthy <b>that individual does *NOT* have to be noteworthy prior to the circumstances in which the individual garnered media attention</b>, furthermore <b>Wikipedia contains *NO* guidelines regarding an article's deletion or relevance merely because its details make you "nauseous"</b> and finally <b>Wikipedia has *NO* guidelines requiring that an article pertaining to an individual must contain some usefulness regarding lessons to others or survivial skills</b>. None of the reasons you have given regarding this article's potential deletion conform to Wikipedia standards and rules, and until your reasons for deletion conform to those standards, they must necessarily be considered irrelevant. James Kim qualifies as a noteworthy person under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines, and his article conforms to those guidelines. Therefore, under the circumstances, and provided that you have so far given no reasons for deletion that are relevant to Wikipedia guidelines for inclusion or deletion, I am bound to recommend this article be kept.

<dd>Sorry, media coverage (even by major souces) does not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability and I don't see the equivalence of Klass, Karr or Ralston. Klass has a foundation and an arts center in her honor. Karr represented a major turn in a culturally significant murder case (supersensationalized by the media, but had long-running ramifications and reverberations for the contemporary moral debate over US culture), and Ralston has authored a book which has been nominated for at least one national book award (Quill Awards 2005). In addition, none of these articles have been subject to afd discussion. If the Kim incident has a substantive impact on a law, or leads to creation of a significant foundation or something, that would increase his notability in my eyes. What I object to is the immediate inclusion of stories simply because they receive news coverage without judging if there is evidence for long term significance or substantive current social impact beyond the news story. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, and its a not a news archive (that should be Wikinews's role). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:35, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I must point out that your reasons for deletion do NOT conform with Wikipedia guidelines. Your comments about whether an individual has a foundation in their name or has written a book and what impact that would have on a person's eligibility for inclusion in Wikipedia are completely arbitrary on your part and do not in any way conform to Wikipedia guidelines. Your rationale justifying the inclusion of John Mark Karr (his relevance to some kind of debate over US culture) is extremely subjective and highly debatable at best. Aron Ralston may not be "remembered" years from now, whether he has written a book or not; and if the creation of a foundation or book is some kind of subjective pronouncement of worthiness, you would be naive to think that the James Kim story will not find future outlets in various American media forms. Nevertheless, even if the creation of a "book or foundation" with James Kim's name on it never comes to pass, they would have little if any relevancy to Wikipedia guidelines. Foundation or no, James Kim certainly meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and his is arguably the most famous wilderness ordeal story in recent American history. Indeed, fame alone *is* enough to warrant inclusion. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> does not state that an individual must have a lasting impact on law or a foundation named after him.

Then too would my passing be memorialized by throngs of internet users on wikipedia. Not to insult the late Mr. Kim, but can anyone say with a straight face that but for his death, a wikipedia article on him would have endured? I doubt it. Let's be honest: there is a massive selection bias going on here; the majority of wikipedia editors are probably in the tech community, and thus they're a little more invested/interested in the story - this much should be obvious when someone actually takes the time to chart out his walking path with a google maps graphic. I don't think it speaks well of Wikipedia (in terms of preserving neutrality/non-bias) that just because a member of their own community has passed, there's a rallying to ensure that the general public will never forget their lost colleague. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that screams "memorial". Bottom line, information-seekers 5 years from now aren't going to be saying "shucks, I really wish Wikipedia hadn't deleted that article on James Kim, because I was really looking forward to learning all about him".

<li><b>Comment</b>: Why does becoming famous after or as a result of a death mean that a subject isn't worthy of a Wikipedia article? There's even a whole article -- People who became famous only in death -- populated exclusively by such people. By that criterion, that an article is only acceptable if the subject was well known during his or her life, we'd have to delete the articles on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polly_Klaas_adaa.html" title="Polly Klaas">Polly Klaas</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandra_Levy_52b3.html" title="Chandra Levy">Chandra Levy</a>, and even <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_van_Gogh_769c.html" title="Vincent van Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a>. James Kim was on the cover of <i>People</i> magazine, and saying that only people in the tech community (not that I agree that most Wikipedians are in said community) are interested in this story just isn't accurate. You may find the story unappealing or unimportant, and wish that others shared those sentiments, but the fact is that it was a major story. Wikipedia, like any good encyclopedia, isn't in the business of molding reality to some ideal form, but rather we should be describing reality as it is as NPOV as possible. The fact is that this was a notable story, even though you may wish that it was not and you might personally dislike the media that propelled it forward and dislike the reasons it became a major story. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 19:03, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think that's my point. Anne Frank and Vincent van Gogh (save Polly Klaas and Chandra Levy; the propriety of those article I'll put aside for a moment) have had some significant contribution to society. The majority of people (and I don't even know who decides on the qualifications for inclusion on that list) on that "List of people who became famous only in death" have notoriety for reasons other than the mere fact they died - their death was notorious because of a resulting change in social policy or notorious because of their association with a bona fide famous person. To address your argument "well what about the Chandra Levy's of the world" I would submit that a victim of violence, especially where the situation surrounding the murder is somewhat notorious, is a lot more intrinsically "worthy" of note than a mere accidental death. The headline for that aricle says it all: "Those on this list have become famous in death to a degree beyond the immediate release of the notification of their death." In my opinion (and of course you're entitled to yours, that's the point of this forum) is that he's not famous in any degree worthy of inclusion in wikipedia beyond "the immediate release of the notification of their death." If you want to pursue the argument that he was famous prior to death, so be it, but you (not you in general) can't conflate the two and make a circular argument that goes something like "ok, he died, nothing really special. but now we're going to highlight his pre-death accomplishments to make his death special." And if you're able to make some argument for inclusion absent of his death, I'd simply ask "where was his article before he died?". Ocap8 20:35, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your personal standard for the notability necessary to generate a Wikipedia article seems to be much higher than the Wikipedia consenus and that outlined in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and I suppose you would want to delete the articles of every obscure B-actor, and people like <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelyne.html" title="Angelyne">Angelyne</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_McClure_e28b.html" title="Jessica McClure">Jessica McClure</a>, who have not necessarily made any "significant contribution" to society but who are known to many people nonetheless. Since Wikipedia is [<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper|is" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper|is" rel="nofollow">not paper</a>] and because there is willing free labor to build Wikipedia, and since Wikipedia has become a unique one-stop/first-stop resource for who-knows-how-many users, such people have articles about them, and their articles (and countless others like them), if well-written and factual, do nothing to harm or detract from Wikipedia. If you think James Kim isn't notable enough for a Wikipedia article (yes, only in death and only because the media and public attention on his death made him notable, whether the media or Joe Q. Public "should" have given him that attention or not), and you wish not to provide a resource on Wikipedia for people who will turn here and have turned here for information on Kim*, then all I can say is that I sincerely wish you well, as your fight for massive deletions will be an arduous and uphill battle, to say the least. *(If this James Kim article were deleted, which obviously it won't be, I wonder how long it would be before someone new started a new one. Ten minutes?) <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 21:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would just add explicitly that I never said that fame prior to death was a necessary condition for wikipedia inclusion. And to the extent that there's a huge difference between posthumous recognition of a person's societal contributions (i.e. famous after death) and poshumous recognition merely because of the circumstances surrounding death (i.e. famous because of death), I would reference my above comment.

<ul>
<li>I suppose I was reacting to this comment -- "Not to insult the late Mr. Kim, but can anyone say with a straight face that but for his death, a wikipedia article on him would have endured?" -- to which I would respond: I'm not sure -- if well-written, my money is on yes -- but it's a moot point. He became notable <i>because</i> of the attention generated upon his disappearance and death. And so what? That's reality. I don't see the need even to justify whether or not he was notable before he died. Personally, I would never have thought to start an article on Kim before he died (nor would I have thought to nominate it for deletion if it was decently written), just as I never would have thought to start an article on, say, <a href="../../../l/a/c/Laci_Peterson_cec6.html" title="Laci Peterson">Laci Peterson</a> before she died. They both became widely famous only in death. And? So? This fact doesn't trouble me as a Wikipedia editor; it's just the way reality panned out. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 21:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

It must have been a slow news week. He was not "assassinated," so why that even mentioned? There are certainly as many news stories about the 3 lost guys as for Kim.

<dd>The harm to Wikipedia is that they serve as a vandalism honeypot and that they will not receive, by dint of their impending obscurity, the collaborative effort and attention that we use ensure well-written, verifiable articles. Bad articles, even those infrequently read, taint the wikipedia project as a whole and detract from the credibility of even our best articles. Our bandwith may be well-nigh infinite, but our editors are not. Is this the type of article that will be policed five years from now and ten? That <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a> must be understood to include the project's longevity as well as its bandwith. <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPop_Secret_7c4e.html" title="User:Pop Secret">Pop Secret</a> 22:24, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia has grown exponentially since its founding, so deleting an article based on what <i>could</i> or <i>might</i> happen to articles in the future seems unecessarily pessimistic to me.

I daresay they would be like other brave pioneers, remembered only in the dusty scrapbooks of their descendants, or possibly in the town's historical society. Human history revolves around the triumphs and yes, the tragedies of ordinary human beings caught up in greater events. Whether or not they were noteworthy before these events has no bearing on whether or not they will be noteworthy in the eyes of history, and as baby jessica and the donner party have, perhaps one day this article will move from the realm of current events into history, and this article help someone who wasn't around to know what happened to him.
