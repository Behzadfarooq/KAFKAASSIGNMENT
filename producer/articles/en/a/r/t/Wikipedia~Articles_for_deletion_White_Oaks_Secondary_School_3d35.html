<li>It's a waste trying to explain things to some, who don't wish to listen. With any reason I give, you'll say "but that applies to lots of schools". When people nominate tiny municipalities (smaller than this high school), I don't see similiar demands for specifics. The fact a municipality has the same signficance as other municipalities, which are notable, is a reason to keep it. By the same token, its reasonable to beleive this school is as legitimate a topic for an article as most other high schools. You assume, by default, this high school, is as unimportant as any other high school. I, assume, it's as important as any other high school. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:06, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't assume that you know what my assumptions are&#160;:) Why would I ask for reasoning if I wasn't willing to evaluate the response? Perhaps the problem is that the "schools are inherently notable" argument is extremely weak, and does not stand up to detailed scrutiny. Faced with defeat in a reasoned debate, people voting keep for a school <i>because</i> it's a school invent all sorts of excuses to <i>not</i> justify their position. It is quite obvious from the present state of AfD's that assumptions of inherent notability are doing far more harm then good to Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 21:49, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

People need to be able find the school, in order to be able add info about it. Also if/when somebody adds a detail, like an actual notable alum, are they going to add that to the town's article instead of a school article?

<li>Why respond to a comment, without addressing the point about categories? The prior voter suggested a merge (you want a delete). Now, deletionists, while consistently wrong, are at least consistent. My comment, was about mergers, who wish to toss information, in various places, sometimes in town article, sometimes in district articles, and sometimes in its own article. This makes categories useless for finding information. It's pointless having information in wikipedia, if it's not where it can be easily found. Also, the "crystal ball" reference is silly, since I'm not suggesting we make a prediction in the article. However, we certainly can make allowances for future article improvement, in advance. We should organize information in a way, that allows for it to be found and updated, in an effecicient and reliable manner; which in this case, means a separate article. I don't call that a crystal ball. But, of course, if we blindly mass-delete articles, we needn't worry about organization. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 12:27, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The use of labels like "inclusionist" and "deletionist" are part of why these AFDs generally fail to generate useful discussion or consensus. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:20, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I've voted to keep a couple of schools that had some interest attached to them and I guess someone at least made an effort here: however, I can't bring myself to vote for a high school just because someone notable went there. Like I said, most notable people went to school somewhere. Maybe if the school he went to was in some way relevant to what made him notable. <b>Abstain</b>. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 15:16, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>While it's appropriate to assume good faith, it's also appropriate to assume unverified information is quite possibly false, and shouldn't be included. Initially, I assumed a mix-up between "visiting a school" and "attending a school". When I see a new school article in AFD, before I vote, I try (as best I can) to start with the assumption the school may not even exist, and check to see it's actually real, along with other info (usually that takes mere moments with the school's web site on a district web site). The only mistake "Last Malthusian" made was expressing his cynicism aloud. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 18:50, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If there is continuous bickering and AfD's, there is no clear concensus, right? So why should we <b>not</b> debate the issue?

<li>If Edit followed that discussion, s/he would realize that there is no consensus to delete schools and that this nomination was therefore doomed. You are rather tending to confirm my suspicions: I believe that all established schools are notable enough to be considered part of the sum of human knowledge, you disagree and you plan to change my mind by continuing to nominate schools and repeat the discussion. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:37, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I've never nominated a school article for AFD or VFD, as far as I can recall, and I don't plan to do so in the future; I simply continue to vote delete because I don't want there to be the illusion that there's firm consensus to keep school articles just because everyone interested in conversing about the subject has been chased away from the AFDs. I don't plan on trying to convince you to delete school articles, just to not ascribe bad faith to those who in good faith attempt to delete them. "You plan to change my mind by continuing to nominate schools and repeat the discussion" is the sort of thing I was warning about above; you're starting to ascribe uniform motivations and methods to those who share an attribute.

<li>The discussions might be reasoned and wide-ranging, but the result would be incomplete, biased and semi-random coverage of education. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 03:21, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thats more like it. An encyclopedia does not need to have full coverage of every school in the world to be "complete" - that's a Yellow Pages standard of "completion". Ideally, it should convey the general principles of organised education, and give more detailed treatment to particularly notable schools. The coverage <b>will</b> be biased, by design, against non-notable schools. Note that including every school by default is also a form of bias (just like the current standards of AfD are biased in favour of keeping). So it's not necessarily a bad thing. Semi-random? I doubt it. Do you mean because AfD's depend in who happens accross them? In which case the solution is to fix the AfD process, as opposed to claiming inherent notability status for schools (which would actually create the bias and inconsistency that you seem opposed to).--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 04:02, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is not supposed be a selective encyclopedia, or it wouldn't aim to have every Simpons episode.

<ul>
<li>But Wikipedia <i>is</i> selective - otherwise why are we bothering with AfD?&#160;:) To further that point, while there may be an article on every Simpsons episode, there isn't one for every TV show, because not all are as notable as the Simpsons. Including excessive and unnecessary information can indeed prevent people from finding what they want - like the difference between giving someone a page reference from a book, and giving them a library.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 04:52, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're labelling people again.

<li>This entire exchange illustrates how pointless all of this "discussion" truly is. The fact is, that those who routinely vote to delete school articles (since you don't like "labelling"), such as <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a>, come to the debate with an equally pre-conceived philosophy, ie. "Educational instutions are <b>not</b> noteworthy in and of themselves, simply by virtue of their being educational institutitons. Other characteristics of such institutions need to be established in order to consider them noteworthy". This position is <b>every bit as much</b> a pre-conception, and opinion-oriented, inherently unjustified philosophical position as the position held by myself and others that: "Educational institutions by virtue of the importance they hold solely as institutions of learning (public or private) carry a noteworthiness to society and the culture by their existence and delivery of education. No other defining or illustrative characteristics are necessary to establish their noteworthiness and thusly their eligibility for inclusion in Wikipedia" (otherwise known as the "schools are inherently notable" view). It clearly, (after hundreds and hundreds of VfD/AfD on schools in the last 2 years) is a <b>matter of opinion</b> over which we <b>fundamentally</b> disagree on the philosophical nature of the issue. Wikipedians accept (for the most part) that *MANY* things are inherently notable: Battleships, Towns (even with miniscule or insignificant populations), Countries, Train stations, Submarines, Simpsons episodes, etc etc etc etc. There simply is no objective standard to determine if and whether schools are inherently notable - either you believe it, or you don't, and most people (even those unwilling to admit it) come to the debate over schools with one or the other position in mind. As to all of the other arguments for and against, we have debated them over and over and over and over and over. They have been regurgitated, re-invigorated, rehabilitated, re-ventilated, swalllowed and re-gurgitated again and guess what - NO FORMAL CONCENSUS EXISTS - gee what a surprise. Whether or not people state "schools are inherently notable" has virtually nothing to do with it. It has to do with a philosophical approach to whether or not schools, in their own right, justify having an article on Wikipedia (just like towns, battleships, countries, pokemons, etc.) or if you believe some other characteristic is required. Saying "schools are inherently notable" is, frankly, just a way of cutting through all the bullshit of these pointless arguments over and over and over and over. We already know that no formal concensus has or will be reached. "Those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles" continue to nominated and continue to vote to delete (all the while knowing the nominations and the votes will fail to get the article delete) and "Those who routinely vote to keep school articles" continue to vote to keep them. 85%-90% of all nominated school articles in the past year <b>have survived the VfD/AfD process</b> and the great majority of them do so because at least a plurality of editors who vote believe that schools are "inherently noteworthy" and thusly deserving of an article. The <b>real</b> acrimony exists because "Those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles" refuse to accept these results and continue nominating school articles for deletion in what is quite clearly a vain attempt to get even one school article deleted (as much has even been stated by one or more of the usual suspects). All tactics have been tried, multi-nominations, mass-nominations, region or country specific nominations, and they all fail. While there may be contention and disagreement over school articles, one thing is an incontrovertable <b>fact</b> - school articles do not get deleted on Wikipedia because they are "non-notable". You may not like the policies or the processes of AfD, or the results that they generate - but that is the way that WP works. Certainly, school AfD pages are not the place to hash out differences of opinion over the AfD process. This is the tool we have - and it is working. The results are so completely overwhelming that it <b>might as well be policy</b> - "School articles are not deleted on WP simply because they are 'non-notable'". You might disagree, but in practice it is already a fact - the best thing at this point is to accept it. Accepting the results over the last year, <b>will</b> end the acrimony over these articles. There can be no question, that as articles continue to not be deleted at AfD that it is pointless to continue nominating them on the basis that they are "non-notable". Nominating a school article that you know, in advance, will <b>never</b> be deleted on the basis of its lack of noteworthiness engenders acrimony and wastes everyone's time (including your own)- <b>EVEN IF YOU THINK IT SHOULDN'T BE HERE</b>. In summary, "Those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles" must accept the results - schools simply aren't deleted on WP because they are "non-notable", like it or not, it's a <b>fact</b>.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 22:46, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You've overlooked an important distinction - I treat all articles equally, and single out no particular class of article for special treatment. Every article I've voted to delete has failed to prove it is worthy to be here. Every article I've voted to keep, I have done so on its merits. To me, no article is inherently notable, and each has to be individually meritous, be they schools, battleships, or Simpsons episodes. Inherent notability is being used as a crutch to sidestep proper discussion.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 02:02, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>With all due respect, that is balderdash. I doubt very much that you look at an article about a nation-state (like say, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Marino_54a0.html" title="San Marino">San Marino</a>) and make a decision on whether or not it "should" have an article on Wikipedia on it's own merits (and if you do, than the absurdity of your position is manifest). Anyone who sees an article about a nation-state on Wikipedia rightly concludes that it has a place here, irrespective of it's "notability" because it's status as a nation-state confers inherent notability upon it, regardless of it's size, population, impact on world affairs, or any other <b>subjective</b> assessment of it's relative "notability". The assumption made by almost anyone who looks at an article about a nation-state is that it is inherently notable. Even if you do hypothetically assess nation-states in this way, it makes no difference whatsoever. Your insistence that others use your deletion philosophy is condescending and elitist. Other editors are (and should be) free to determine for themselves that certain groups or classes of things (like nation-states) possess inherent characteristics of noteworthiness as a legitimate philosophical approach to building a comprehensive encyclopedia. Your assertion that "your way is superior" is noted, but I just think you are plum wrong. Certain classes of things <b>are</b> inherently notable, and I believe one of those classes of things is schools. To try to suggest that those of us who hold and advance a certain philosophical view about notability in good faith, are to blame for the acrimony in this debate is both false and irresponsible. Despite all of this (pointless) back and forth, your response still refuses to respond or take accountability for the main point of my obscure and lengthy dissertation above in the first place. That is, that "School articles are <b>not</b> deleted on Wikipedia on the basis of being "non-notable"." As I have stated, this is a <b>fact</b>. The obvious question that arises is, "Since schools are not deleted on this criteria, why is it that 'those who routinely nominate and vote for school deletion' continue in their pointless and arguably bad-faith crusade to delete school articles "on their own merits", when it is <b>clearly</b> contrary to what the obvious outcome of these attempts will be? I am not simply trying to be rhetorical here - I am asking for a legitimate explanation from the other side, why they are continuing to nominate and vote to delete in the face of the <b>overwhelming</b> history of VfD/AfD results that demonstrate that school articles simply do not get deleted on the basis of being "non-notable" or being a stub?? Please, please explain what is achieved by repeating this process over and over and over? At this point, "those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles" aren't even making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> anymore. Of the last 100 or so schools nominated for AfD, the <b>only</b> candidate that was successfully deleted was an article about a school that didn't exist, which was created by an editor who "routinely votes to delete school articles" on the basis of their lack of notability. You think your approach of "determining how to vote on each article according to it's merits" is better than my system? Well good for you. Just tell me what the point of all this is when the school articles in question will <b>not</b> be deleted?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 02:47, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Apples to Oranges. You're comparing schools to countries. If it were possible to have several million countries in the world, I'm sure we could argue that some are not notable enough to be mentioned here. The point is that if concepts of inherent notability were not used, we could have a reasoned evaluation of each school on it's own merits, and then those that don't deserve an article can be deleted. If schools truly are as important as you assert, what's the harm in dropping inherent notability?--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 04:10, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

Finally, you can't accuse me of wasting time if you're also here - by your definition, if there was no opposition to a delete vote, there would be no time "wasted" either&#160;:)--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 23:00, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Possible micro-agreement: If somebody creates an article for 5 kids in there mom's homeschool, I'll likely delete it. I guarentee you, that you will never, be able to vote delete on multiple real muniicpalities with any real powers, however small they may be (at least in North America). I have wasted time in these school AFDs, mainly at the request of those demanding explanations, that they're not satisified with. But, a vastly greater waste of time would occur, if schools started being deleted. All the time I (and others) spent, creating and improving articles, would be lost. I'm forced to decide which is a bigger waste: time in AFD or loosing the time spent creating/editing school articles. You on the other hand, have no need to waste any time, whatsoever. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 23:44, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Municipalities, townships, towns, etc. are kept on WP even if they have zero residents - that is settled concensus. Your statement shows your clear willingness (manifest in this very debate) to defy concensus in favour of your own opinion (which is the problem in the first place). As to wasting time, there are a number of areas where your argument is nonsense. First, by deleting articles about schools that are created by editors in good faith, you are wasting those editors' time (there are many of us that have a good faith intention to create verifiable, well-written articles about schools for Wikipedia) and waging a war against those who wish to participate in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools</a> in good-faith on the basis that you (and others "who routinely nominate and vote to delete schools") subjectively find such schools non-notable. The next waste of time, is crying foul everytime someone (like me) who has explained their reasoning on schools a thousand times (ok, a hundred times) to explain and justify <b>every</b> vote on <b>every</b> school. Some of us are tired of screaming at the brick wall that is "those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles" and just vote <b>bicycle</b>. The next waste of time is your own. Nominating school articles <b>that will not be deleted</b> for AfD is an undeniable waste of time that is only perpetuated in order to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>. I have asked repeatedly for some justification why nominations and voting and arguing to delete school articles persists, when if nothing else can be agreed upon, it surely could be that as a matter of precedent, school articles are <b>not</b> deleted on WP on the basis of "non-notability".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:06, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I realize this is a contentious subject, <i>but stating that an argument is weak is not a personal attack.</i> (Sorry for the gratuitous italics, but this is very important.) "Your argument is stupid" is uncivil, but it's not a personal attack. "Your argument is weak" isn't even uncivil; it's a strongly-stated disagreement. Everyone needs to distance themselves a bit, and realize that an attack on the position that they hold, however strongly, is not an attack on the person that holds it. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:55, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
