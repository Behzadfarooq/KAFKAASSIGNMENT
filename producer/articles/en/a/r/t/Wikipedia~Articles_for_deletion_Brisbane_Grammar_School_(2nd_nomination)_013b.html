<p>This article is too biased, and it is poorly formatted, to the point that I believe that it is a lost cause. For example, the following line is of concern to me: "The academic program holds a strong reputation". I'll ask but one question, WHO'S OPINION IS IT THAT THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM IS GOOD? There is no indication as to where this 'strong reputation' originated. Also, the article is badly formatted, and feels more like dot points. If a proper article cannot be produced, none at all deserves to be on this site. I vote for <b>STRONG DELETE</b> 19748 08:21, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I belive that what I'm doing is called 'meatpuppetry' and that there is nothing wrong with it. All these people are fighters. I don't know them personally, but we intend to sweep through wikipedia purging it of all its greivances and blemishes. we are the purifiers, and we have banded together. As for the user page scandal devised by Cvene64 to bring us down, we want to use other's templates only, to further our pages. There is no law against that, but we haven't yet started to change the pages to our own designs because of this little scandal. Wikipedia states that you must not assume that a person is a sock puppet before you assume that they are a meatpuppet which is a group of people who combine to bring a page down. These are not single use accounts. We are all new here, and we are in a group so that we can defend ourselves from people who are out to be a detriment. We intend to grow and expand our horizons on this site, but this is our first crusade. We will purify the site of this page. We will not be accused of 'sock puppetry' as we are individuals who are fighting as one to destroy and neutralize this pathetic page. --19748 01:00, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

You all think this is some sort of 'bandwagon' right? WRONGWRONGWRONGWRONG. This ain't no bandwagon. I think this article is bias in several sentences which have been IGNORED. Now, I don't know about the school to actually change the article, and that is why it must be deleted. <b>everyone keeps saying 'it must be cleaned up, it must be edited', but they are not doing anything about the article!!! If everyone wants it to stay, DO SOMETHING</b> I am a member of the brotherhood of purifiers and am also an individual. I consider this article 'purifiable'. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaanxiquake_988d.html" title="User:Shaanxiquake">Shaanxiquake</a> 09:29, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG Delete</b> Brothers of purification, I agree with this crusade. The purgatory must be enacted. NUM QUAM POSTEA! No more will this article blemish the site. My other brothers have jumped the gun and told you they want it to be deleted. Let me outline WHY:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1. The article is clearly bias. There is no doubt about it.</li>
<li>2. The article looks like a note point summary of some kind. Wikipedia IS NOT about note point summaries.</li>
<li>3. The populous are accusing the BP (Brotherhood of Purification) of not acting and changing the article. As Brother Shaanxiquake said, we know nothing about the school! I am from Bahrain! Why doesn't the populous change the article? Let me guess, the article is incorrect so this AFD was instigated. Now everyone in the populous is going to argue to bring the BP down, saying that the BP should fix the page. When the AFD is finally removed, the article WILL NOT HAVE CHANGED ONE BIT, and it will continue to be a blemish. The BP is bringing forward incredibly valid points. If no one will fix the article, it must by neutralized. The site must be purified.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is in this vein that I call all the bretheren of the Brotherhood of Purification (the number is growing) to merge as one and yet retain their unique individuality, to bring down this pathetic page which obviously has some sort of fan base from the school itself. Don't pretend you weren't from the school, populous! I've looked at members' of the populous userpages, and they mention this school as part of their education! This is obviously some sort of school push, but it will not be tolerated. Wikipedia does not accept people FROM THE SCHOOL spreading lies and deceptions, or even more importantly defending an article worthy of nothing. The Brotherhood of Purification will see to it that this pathetic display is neutralized forever, because it serves no purpose and people continually whine for others to fix it, and no one does. --<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurification_41db.html" title="User:Purification">Purification</a> 09:39, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
