<li><b>Delete</b> This article seems to be based solely on subjective opinions about which Southern colleges are "Ivy league-caliber." To its credit, the article now states that this is a "colloquial term" and that "the designation of "Southern Ivy" has no official meaning." However, unlike other Ivy League colloquialisms with no official meaning, "Southern Ivy" does not appear to have published material ("<a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Ivies_e052.html" title="Public Ivies">Public Ivies</a>"), historical context ("<a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit_Ivy_7d0c.html" title="Jesuit Ivy">Jesuit Ivy</a>") or documented usage ("<a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivies_fe2e.html" title="Little Ivies">Little Ivies</a>") to support its listing as an encyclopedia article. The sources provided (an entry from a Job-Seeking chat room and a reference to a 1960's letter to the editor from a sports blog) suggest that "Southern Ivy" has very limited currency, official or otherwise. They also reemphasize how subjective this term is. In fact, the apparent "neutral" criterion for inclusion in the article--a ranking among the top-50 in US News &amp; World Report--does not legitimize the term any more than a similar criterion would legitimize an article on the "Midwest Ivies," the "Harvard of the West," or other inherently subjective colloquialisms. 129.105.35.130 17:44, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The question on this one is whether or not this phrase really stands on its own, or whether calling a school a [name of region] "Ivy" is just a way of opining that it is a very good regional school. I am going to try a test. I do not know yet how it will turn out. I am going to try an online search of The New York Times for the exact phrase "Southern Ivy" and the exact phrase "Southern Ivies." If either of them gets any (relevant) hits, I'll vote keep, on the assumption that if it's really a well-defined, frequently used phrase at least one mention of it should have crept into The New York Timies sometime. Otherwise, I'll vote delete. Here goes. "Southern Ivy," 2000-2005: Nope. "Southern Ivies," 2000-2005: Nope. "Southern Ivy," 1857-2000: Three hits. One reference to "Southern Ivy" as a church Easter decoration in 1902; one to a horse named "Southern Ivy" that ran in a race at Aqueduct on Nov. 24, 1999; and one to an athletic sports meet listing "Automatic NCAA Bids" where a table in which "Appalachian State...Southern" and "Pennsylvania...Ivy League" was erroneously picked up by the search engine as a reference to "Southern Ivy." "Southern Ivies," 1857-2000 picks up exactly the same hits.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Before I act precipitously, a reality check on my self-chosen criterion. A search on "little Ivies" plus "Amherst" turns up a hit mentioning "Amherst College, a partner with Williams and Wesleyan in the Little Ivy League." "Public Ivies" turns up several relevant hits, with headlines like "Ivy League Finds Itself Locked in Bidding War For Prospective Students" and "An Eminent Voice Pleads for the Soul of Rutgers" and "Suddenly, State Universities Have More Allure." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:42, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> "Public Ivies" and "Little Ivies" are well-enough known and frequently-enough used to have been mentioned in the New York Times; "Southern Ivies" is not. You need not agree with my criterion, but that's the criterion <b>I'm</b> using. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:42, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Waffling.</b> On the other hand, a search in Google Groups for exact phrase "Southern Ivy" gets 25 hits, which is reasonably high for Groups (other things being equal you usually get about 1/4 to 1/10 as many hits in Groups as in a Google Web search) and most of these are colloquial uses to describe Southern schools, although a couple are to the racehorse. There are a couple of posts that suggest there <b>is</b> a Southern Ivy League athletic conference; is that right? My vote above stands for the moment... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:50, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> From some of those hits I got the impression there might be an actual athletic Southern Ivy League, but there isn't. <a href="http://baylorbears.collegesports.com/genrel/040104aaa.html" class="external text" title="http://baylorbears.collegesports.com/genrel/040104aaa.html" rel="nofollow">this 2004 web page</a>, answers the query: "Is there any truth to the possibility of an Ivy League South forming? Baylor, Rice, Vanderbilt and other like schools like this would form the new division" with the reply "I have not heard any serious discussion about a 'southern ivy league' forming and believe it to be highly unlikely. I believe that most of the schools that would be under consideration for such a league are fully committed to their current conferences." A Google search on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ncaa+conference+%22southern+ivy+league%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ncaa+conference+%22southern+ivy+league%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">ncaa "Southern Ivy League"</a> does show that such a conference <b>has</b> been frequently proposed. <a href="http://tulanegreenwave.collegesports.com/genrel/102702aac.html" class="external text" title="http://tulanegreenwave.collegesports.com/genrel/102702aac.html" rel="nofollow">An article about Tulane</a> says, for example, "From the late 1950s, there was growing talk that the Green Wave could no longer compete in the SEC. A 'Southern Ivy League' consisting of schools like Rice, Southern Methodist, Duke, Vanderbilt and Tulane was constantly advocated, but each of the other schools decided to stay in their league." I'm not changing my vote, at least not for the moment; delete, but allow re-creation without prejudice <i>as a history of the various proposals and failed efforts to create a "Southern Ivy League" athletic conference,</i> as such an article could obviously be objective, neutral and encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:02, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: I <i>still</i> have to vote to delete. The meaning of the term is better covered at Wiktionary. The question is whether there is substance for an encyclopedia article on the Southern Ivies as they are. Since <i>who</i> they are is still and evermore shall be a debate (is Emory one? why not? is Tulane one? why? is Davidson one? why and why not?), there is little chance to talk definitively <i>about</i> what they are and what they do and what they hope for. The context is virtually impossible to establish, other than as a testimony to the inferiority complex we in the South have been handed about our schools. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:03, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, again. Seems very close to the just-deleted Southern Ivy League article to me.

<dd>If it's well-known, used often, and a part of southern culture, than it should not be difficult to provide much better <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">source citations</a> than the very sketchy ones we presently have.

<dd>Let me try one more. Once again, I haven't tried this yet and don't know yet how it will turn out. To see whether the University of Vermont calls <i>itself</i> a "public ivy," I will perform a Google site search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=site:www.uvm.edu+%22public+ivy%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=site:www.uvm.edu+%22public+ivy%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">site:www.uvm.edu "public ivy"</a>. 38 hits (although interestingly enough the self-references seem to be mostly to its having <i>formerly</i> been a "public ivy!"). Now let's try a similar search on Duke: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=site:www.duke.edu+%22Southern+Ivy%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=site:www.duke.edu+%22Southern+Ivy%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">site:www.duke.edu "Southern Ivy"</a>.

<dd><i>The institutions of higher learning best understood by the North are the comparatively new private universities, such as Vanderbilt, Duke, and Emory, which are new in the sense that through large private endowments they have developed from small church colleges (Methodist in the case of the three mentioned). A university of this type will sometimes refer to itself as "the Princeton of the South" or as a member of the "Southern Ivy League."</i> (J.

<dd>Interestingly enough, "Princeton of the South" exact phrase gets quite a lot of Web hits, and a much larger cross-section of schools seem to get into the Princeton action than the Ivy action: Sewanee, Davidson, University of Richmond, Samford, Stewart, Rice, as well as Duke and UNC. Which leads to the question: should the Southern Ivies include all of the Princetons of the South? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:49, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Only 37 on "Yale of the South." Some of the usual suspects appear, but here we also find "University of Louisville School of Law, the Yale of the South." Is the Yale of the South a Southern Ivy, then?

<dd>Wow, I must admit I had never heard of some of these universities, such as <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewanee%2C_The_University_of_the_South_e979.html" title="Sewanee, The University of the South">Sewanee</a>, for instance (but it looks nice, judging from their website). <a href="http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/H.html" class="external text" title="http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/H.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> was funny, but I can't really understand why anybody going to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Virginia_2eaf.html" title="University of Virginia">University of Virginia</a> would want to be at the Harvard of the South rather than at The University Actually Designed by Thomas Jefferson.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps, as a foreigner with no connection to either the American South or the Ivy League, I may be regarded as a somewhat neutral observer. My take on this issue is that an article like this should be <i>about</i> (an aspect of) <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">academic boosterism</a>, and about what appears to be a Southern inferiority complex, and include a discussion on the use of epithets referring to individual Ivy League universities, such as "Harvard/Yale/Princeton of the South", as well. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 21:23, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As a U. S. citizen living in a state was not in the Confederacy: before checking our <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewanee%2C_The_University_of_the_South_e979.html" title="Sewanee, The University of the South">our article</a>, I vaguely knew Sewanee as a "good small liberal-arts college." I'm surprised that they call themselves "The University of the South" and quickly peeking at their website I don't know where they get the "University" appelation; I suppose because they have a College of Arts and Sciences <i>and</i> a School of Theology. They are best known to me (and many others) as publishers of the "Sewanee Review," which carries some weight in lit-crit circles. It seems bizarre to me to make a serious comparison between it and Harvard or Princeton, unless you are only comparing undergraduate colleges... I suppose it <i>might</i> bear comparison to Williams or Amherst, which would presumably make it a "<a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivies_fe2e.html" title="Little Ivies">Southern <i>Little</i> Ivy...</a>"</dd>
