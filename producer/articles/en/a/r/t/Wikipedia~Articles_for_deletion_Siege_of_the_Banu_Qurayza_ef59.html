<p>This article, created by <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">User:Striver</a> is a quote farm and a content fork of a section in the existing article <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a>. Splitting a daughter article from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a> is unnecessary, as the article is only about 26KB long, but it contains pretty much all the necessary material about its subject. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 21:30, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This is a POV fork designed to get around ongoing content disputes at the main article. Its main purpose appears to be to excuse the killing of the Banu Qurayza men by erroneously asserting that the massacre was conducted according to Jewish law; at best, this is a fringe theory unsupported by the extant sources. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 21:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a> is the article of a tribe, this is the article about a notable event that the tribe underwent. The tribe is notable for many things other than this event, including its pre Islamic history and the events that occurred before the siege. When the article was created, i had worked to expand the siege part of the article, and my addition, including the previously large amount of text that was there ended up in the siege part of the article taking over 2/3 of the entire article. At the time of the split, no material was removed, it was not an attempt to dodge any consensus of any kind. On the contrary, this very siege has been a hot topic for long and has several times ended in the lock down of the entire tribe article. Considering the highly controversial and notable nature of this siege, it is nothing more than normal procedure to give it it's own article. Remember that this is not "the X perspecite of the Seige" or anything, it is just <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_the_Banu_Qurayza_bdb0.html" title="Siege of the Banu Qurayza">Siege of the Banu Qurayza</a>, a NPOV and accurate name of a event deserving a article that devotes full attention to it. Other precedence can be seen in the article <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khaybar.html" title="Khaybar">Khaybar</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Khaybar_e1e4.html" title="Battle of Khaybar">Battle of Khaybar</a>. It is true that the content of both this and the original article are in dispute, but the split was not done to dodge or evade any consensus, on the contrary, this article has been prominently linked to from the main article and a section describing it has been introduced. But without giving any good reason, a part of the editors have refused the split of this highly notable event and want it confined to one single article. I have invited them to expand the article on this event, but they have refused to do so, and now is one of them trying to get ridd of the article, claiming it is a "POV Fork". My question is: How can an article about a battle be a POV fork of an article about a tribe? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:49, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, btw, regarding content dispute, i again urge you to edit the article. Some editor undertook himself to rewrite the siege section, but did it on the main page and choose to ignore the article devoted to the siege. On the talk page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABanu_Qurayza&amp;diff=94915087&amp;oldid=94891007" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABanu_Qurayza&amp;diff=94915087&amp;oldid=94891007" rel="nofollow">i commended him for bringing more material</a>, but also asked him why he deleted other views that existed on that article while doing so. Now that the main article has dramatically changed its POV, this article is accused of having the other POV, something that was never intended. right now, i am working to incorporate that new material to this article. The effort is on having a ALL POV article, and doing so in detail would end up giving one aspect of the tribes history undue weight and overshadow the rest of it's history. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:55, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your use of "Undue weight" is totally inapposite here.

<dd>Yes, and that includes much more than this notable but single event. Right? and btw, if you read the article, you will see that it has substantial pre-Islamic sections, sections that will be totally overshadowed in size if we merge all the siege content, as is being done right now, and then add it to the main tribe article --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 00:12, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Since all we know about the Banu Qurayza consists of their fatal interaction with the Muslim community at Medina, as reported by Islamic sources (which makes what we "know" rather nebulous), taking this out of the article and leaving a shell with nothing in it is contra-indicated. The title of the new article is also misleading, since the meat of the dispute is 1) the events leading to the siege, and the credibility of the reasons given for it and 2) the aftermath of the siege, the killing of the adult male Banu Qurayza. The title "Banu Qurayza" is truly NPOV, since it takes no position on the morality of the conflict and its conclusion. No POV forks, please. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:05, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sure, lets rename the Battle+aftermath article, no dispute on my side. But the fact remains that <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a> is the name of a tribe that lived for several hundred years, and having a tribe article consisting of 2/3 about a single event is not neutral in it self, quoting <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>. If the argument is that the event is not notable, then keep it small, if the argument is that the event is notable, then it most surely deserves it's own article.

<li>Khaybar is a place about which much can be written outside of the battle. Moreover, the "Battle of Khaybar" is well known as a distinct event. The Banu Qurayza are a tribe, not a place; moreover, they are a tribe about whom virtually nothing is known beyond the fact that they were massacred. There is no comparison between the two. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 15:33, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>"virtually nothing is known beyond the fact that they were massacred"</i>? That is most certainly untrue for anyone bothering to read the main article, why is this sort of false statements continually repeated in his afd? In fact, the main article has <i>more</i> infomation about other aspects of the tribe that it has about ths siege and killings. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 16:33, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
