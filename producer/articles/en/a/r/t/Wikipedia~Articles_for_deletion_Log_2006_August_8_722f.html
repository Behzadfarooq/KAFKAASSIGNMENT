<p>This is basically the result of the deletion of the List of successful automobiles - see nomination/Afd page <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_successful_automobiles_%28second_nomination%29_b606.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of successful automobiles (second nomination)">here</a>. The reasoning/rationale is the same (see the above AfD), as those are corresponding articles, and I believe since the last decision was unusually unanimous and widely-supported, I think this should go smoothly too, so that everything remains logical and just.

Please note that the mentioned reasons for keeping do not contradict the valid reasons for deletion raised here, and the reasons for deletion listed the last time have not been addressed by the edits made since that time (chiefly because they can't).

<li><b>Delete</b>, although to my own surprise I found myself initially leaning to <i>"Keep"</i>, at least in theory.

<li><b>Delete</b> pn. It is POV in most cases to say something is a failure, even if sourced.

<dd>Not at all. Indeed it is non-neutral to say that some car <b>is</b> a failure, but it is perfectly neutral to say that a certain car has been <i>called</i> a failure. We can and should have "facts about opinions." But we need to indicate <b>who,</b> exactly, called them failures. And of course the editors would need to hash out which sources fairly represent a substantial body of opinion. Surely we would all agree that, whether or not the Edsel "was" a failure, many people certainly <i>called</i> it a failure... and it shouldn't be hard to cite someone who has called it that. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:32, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Updating Comment</b> Thank you for informing of the previous AfD results. Having read and considered them I still feel the article is ambigious (e.g. what qualifies a car as a commerical success?) and therefore leading onto dangerous territory. It is not for wikipedia to inform consumers as to what cars not to buy. Whilst that isn't the aim of the article it is a byproduct. Sorry, I still need a very good reason to change my vote. But thanks for brining that to my attention, I'm slightly worried I didn't notice it had an earlier AfD nomination... Must be tired. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianProlific_7186.html" title="User:WikipedianProlific">WikipedianProlific</a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedianProlific_3841.html" title="User talk:WikipedianProlific"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 01:22, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Again to clarify my vote per the talk page: Firstly my basis for deletion is as follows: There are no set criteria that qualify a car as a commerical failure. It is an ambigious description to give a car. Some vehicles have terrible safety records, sold less than expected but still made profit...are they commerical failures? Is it sales profit alone that qualifies a car as a commercial failure? is it the safety record? is it how well it sold in the USA or how well it did globally? is it how the first models sold, how well subsequent designs sold or how the entire design as a whole sold. For example, some cars like the ford fiesta have gone through nearly 20 years of development, to the extent that the current fiestas are totally different (and incompatable) with the original design. Is it the technical performance specifications i.e how fast it can go?...the list is absolutely endless. Well, the answer is its probably all or most of those above things that qualify a car as a commercial failure. But where we draw the line is a totally subjective choice made by the editor, it can never be anything but that. Therefore the article is inherantly a POV farm. So in accordance with my above explanation it qualifies for deletion by breaching:</li>

<li>I have read the arguments from the article's previous AfD. I'm not changing my vote to delete, but another alternative would be to <b>move</b> the page to a title that states more specific guidelines (e.g. "List of automobiles that caused their manufacturer to lose money", "List of automobiles that sold less than <i>x</i> units", etc.).
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - it would require much more than moving, it would require effectively recreating the article according to a newly-set standard. As concerns your first proposition, it was already mentioned that it is very hard to establish what financial result the production of a given model had for the manufacturer. Even assuming we would in some mysterious way get hold of such information, a financial result of such a project can be presented differently depending on the accounting procedure employed (e.g. Chrysler in the 1970s did not account for development costs when appraising individual models' profitability)<br />
As concerns your other proposition, the list would be unbelievably long and very hard to keep completed, as an inexplicable number of automobiles were and are manufactured as one-offs or in short-series. Besides, it does not always equal a failure, many successful exclusive models are sold in small quantities, which are on the other hand sometimes even exceeding manufacturers' expectations.

<li><b>Keep</b> From what I can see, this article presents a NPOV list of cars which could be considered unsuccessful, and the reason as to why that is. Note that all brands are represented, as per all brands having had flops. Someone above has said that 'commercial failures' is a subjective term. I would disagree with this. Something is a commercial failure if it has not made enough money - this seems like a simple enough thing to determine. Nevertheless, I would suggest that this article be changed to something like, "List of automobiles which are considered unsuccessful" or something along those lines. The article has also been described as difficult to maintain - I would disagree with that also. It seems to have a fairly comprehensive list of flops already, and they are not that common an occurence that more would need to be added on a regular basis. This sort of unusual article is the sort of thing that makes Wikipedia great, but it needs to have sources added to it, rather than being deleted wholesale. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrett_ca1d.html" title="User:Drett">Drett</a> 16:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I wholeheartedly disagree. First of all, not <b>all</b> brands are represented, only a small fraction of them, and this list is perhaps "fairly comprehensive" only with regard to some automobiles sold in the United States in recent years. It is a "list of automobiles considered unsuccessful by somebody that the editors could think of" and it will inherently be one. Almost any vehicle can be considered unsuccessful in some aspect, and you would find the strangest arguments for that. For example, the original Ford Mustang could be labelled a success, but then some subsequent versions can be argued "not to have lived to expectations" and there you go, Ford Mustang is an unsuccessful vehicle. We do not (at least I hope) maintain a List of politicians described as fraud or stupid, which could be similarly pointless and infinite by definition. Such expressions of somebody else's POV do not belong in an encyclopedia either.

<dd>Although somewhat illustrative I agree with <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel">brendels</a> assessment. One wouldn't for example write an essay about the domestic cat and call it "An essay on mammals", although that title is not essentially wrong as domestic cats are mammals, it is equally not correct as the essay is only about cats, not directly about mammals. 'A list of automotive commercial failures' isn't what the list shows. It cannot show a list of automotive commercial failures because there are no set criteria that qualify a car as a commerical failure. Therefore what it shows is "A list of cars deemed by various random sources to be considered commercial failures". Consider as well some cars are hugely successful in the States but utter failures in Europe and vise versa. This is way too ambigious for me, it represents a level of information wikipedia shouldn't be hosting as wikipedia is not a vehicular review website. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianProlific_7186.html" title="User:WikipedianProlific">WikipedianProlific</a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedianProlific_3841.html" title="User talk:WikipedianProlific"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 01:42, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I'm sorry-event though this article was created by respectable editors, the article currently does not cite sources and fails to deliver an at least somewhat objective definition of what a "commerical failure" is. This could hurt WP's credibility and I have put in too much effort into my article's here to let that happen. While, yes, for some cars such as the Yugo or Edsel it is clear that they were failures. It is not nearly as clear with others such as the Toyota T100 (which I think was a failure, but...). The name, "failure" also provides a problem as there is no definition for "failure." If, however, the article starts featuring sources and perhaps a name change would be initiated, I will change my vote to keep.

<li>Gazpacho, you have shot yourself in the foot actually - don't you see how laughable your argument for the Dymaxion looks like compared to the others? I, for one, never heard of the Dymaxion or Mr. Fuller (though I will gladly read about them when I finish writing this), so it is by no means famous by my standards.

<li>Well, it's quite obvious that the <a href="../../../d/y/m/Dymaxion.html" title="Dymaxion">Dymaxion</a> would attract interest of Mr. Fuller's fans. If <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> somehow made a car and tried to sell it unsuccessfully, it would obviously be of notice to her fans, even if it wouldn't attract too much attention anyhow else. The Dymaxion just had the luck of being promoted by a person known for something else, but this is a rather poor claim to failure fame.

<dd><b>Comment</b> By the way, there is a lot of good information here that was never put on the main car articles, I would recommend going into the history and moving over everthing into the main articles before these good people succeed in erasing all the useful information in here so no one else will be able to enjoy it again. This may have started with an editor who found TWO entries I wrote in a "worst of list" of airplanes among other things. and suceeded in deleting the whole kit and kaboodle just to hurt me. I tried to document this on the main WP article, but got knocked out, likewise leave a comment on the process, also kicked out by someone that also does a lot of deletion. I found it almost impossible to stop an AfD once started because it's appears on a list that thousands of users look at and routinely add delete votes to. Most articles do not have enough users to counter these people who vote delete who have never even looked at the article before, but very popular similar list that can survive are all over WP, and there is no rule against such lists. It depends completely on the people who want to kick down such sandcastles, and there are lots of them on the automobile project.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This suspiciously was followed by a very similar assasination attempt on this article, and the companion successful automobile article which also suffered an undeserved death when a similar editor nominated his own edits for execution just to get at mine. He withdrew his nomination, but was renominated by another one of the auto project gang, and it's dead too. They also want to remove every toy, every car review, every mention of any TV show or movie appearance of car and anything else they can figure out how to delete within the WP rules, not to mentionally massively uncivil behavior to enforce these rules. But I'm the bad guy. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 00:07, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comments</b> Whilst I concur there is additional information here to other car articles. I do not feel that it is encyclopedic. This article fails because it is impossible to make an unambigious version of it. What qualifies a car as a commercial failure or success?, can a car fall into neither category? Is it's failure or sucess based on sales? safety? politics (i.e. where it was manufactured)? or a combination of these things? As a result this article is dangerous, it seeks to inform readers (themselves potential consumers) of cars which might/may have been worth avoiding. Wikipedia is not a vehicular review site. For car reviews try Autotrader.com. This article by nature is too biased and ambigious to possibly ever be of <b>any</b> encyclopedic value to <b>anyone</b>. Finally I want to say I really am sorry to those who have put a lot of effort into it, but I think looking over the AfD's the reoccuring nomination isn't a sinister attempt to destroy your efforts, but rather a genuine concern over the underlying nature of this article.

<dd>You may be quite right that being unreliable and cheap does not label a car as a flop, but that does not concern me. Strike it from the list.I'm arguing a much broader point.

<dd>Thanks for saying that, DeLarge. Adam, for the definition of a peninsula, see <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsula.html" title="Peninsula">peninsula</a>. A list of peninsulas would be fairly redundant, a category serves the purpose just as well. Besides, peninsula is not a judgemental term.

<dd>Before you try to make me look like an idiot, tell me where in the "peninsula" article it clears up any ambiguity. It does not, and my point remains. Also, calling Mussolini a dictator may have a negative charge amongst supporters, but that does not mean it is not true. Saying the Delorean is a flop will not have such a "charge" in anyone with common sense, and if it does, the controversy is to be explained next to the entry.

<dd>I am not trying to do anything personal, don't ake my replies as such. I am only trying to fend off your arguments.

<dd>You can be assured that I was not trying to hide that--even though the authorship irrelevant. The cited section of that essay explains a logical connection between "List of automobiles that were commercial failures" and "Commercial failures in the auto industry. It was far from an attempt at imposing the proposal on anyone else, or presenting it as authoritative. But The Literate Engineer presented the same exact idea which is the centerpiece of my essay, so I see no reason for conflict. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 18:46, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>However, I don't think "obviously and self-evidently related" cuts it. When dealing with a list, I see it as a double question: 1, Does the topic merit a regular article to begin with? 2, Does the topic merit a list in addition to a regular article? And in the case of "Commercial failures in the auto industry", I answer question 1 with "no", which makes question 2 irrelevant. However, just because a topic merits an article, it does not necessarily follow that the identical topic merits a list. A mere "logical connection", then, is far from sufficient. My opinion regarding the final disposition of the entry remains unchanged. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 03:57, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Many of these failures are notable and encylopedic. The fact that a list is not being maintained is not listed as a reason to delete anything. Also, I'm not sure that there have been that many notable failures of late.

<li><b>Comment</b> - of course some failures were notable and encyclopedic, but how do you define notability, not to mention failure (which we already discussed above)? If an automobile is said to have failed in the marketplace for this reason or another, and it is notable, it should go into its article with appropriate references. A list should have very specific criteria for inclusion, otherwise it is going to be unstable. Moreover, including an item in such a list applies a negative quality to it, which is a fantastic decoy for all POV-lovers.

<li><strike><b>Keep</b></strike> (<b>User apparently believes he's entitled to multiple votes</b>) Hey, Bravada, there's another wikipage for you to delete! It's all my fault, I admit it. I wrote an entry on the F-111 tha Mmx1 didn't like and a mirror page of successful scientific projects, and he found out how easy it is to delete these things unless you have a base large enough to beat the traffic of people more than happy to 2nd a nomination for deletion, the contribution history of many of these people consists largely of deletions, instead of editors like myself that contribute heavily, despite the heavy efforts of delete-happy editors who I shall not name here, but many of them have signed here. It seems suspicious that so many copycat deletions have since taken place. The ONLY valid reason for deletion is if NOTHING can be salvaged, no matter how many so-called votes have been cast. You cannot vote on the value of PI, as my math teacher said, and it only takes <i>one</i> person to be right (I just made that up) The good guys need to fight exclusionists like Bravada that currently dominate and bully other editors in the Automobile project. Just try to put upa picture or mere mention a model of a car or say that it was on Adam-12 and try to make it stick without gettting disembowled, tarred, feathered, drawn and quartered. I did (and actualy suceeded in getting pictures of model cars and mentions of cars on Adam-12, and lived to tell about it) Wikipeople should concentrate on building this baby up instead of tearing down each other's work! (patriotic music playing in the background) Remember, the good guys always win in the end.

<li>The only thing I know about Mmx is that this is some user you have clashes with regarding some aircraft. I don't know of any dossier and I am not interested with your aircraft business at all.

<dd>O RLY? Please see the above discussion - all objective definitions of commercial failure proposed proved either impossible to apply or not applicable (did not equal commercial failure). How in the world are you going to OBJECTIVELY name "authoritative" sources? Again, if there is "common consent" that something was a failure, it's a reason to mention that in the article, but one cannot start a list based on that!

<dd>Listed in a book of automotive failures, for one thing.

<dd>OK, I can write a book of automotive failures and argue that DeLorean was a great success that was ahead of its time and moved the automotive industry forward by aeons, while at the same time arguing why the Toyota Corolla is an utter failure. And if you think this is irrelevant, I assure you people write such things. So, does every car mentioned as a failure in a source have a place here?

<dd>Sure, if you can find a publisher. People will laugh in your face, of course... To describe the deLorean and Edsel as failures is entirely uncontroversial, there is broad agreement in a large number of sources. We can debate the appropriateness of individual models one by one, but the <i>subject</i> is encyclopaedic and the <i>list</i> is capable of being referenced to reliable sources. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:48, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Go and browse some stuff that gets published. Start with reading what Jerry Flint writes, he sometimes even claims an existing model does not exist, not to mention that you can reference contradictory statements from his different "works", as he changes his mind quite often. Anyway, do you realize you have just expressed POV? Referencing to POV is still POV, it is just finding somebody's POV good, and thus it is POV&#160;:D What are your precise criteria for "broad agreement in a large number of sources"?

<dd>Go back and read the policies and guidelines. As long as we can attribute to a known identified authority such as a motoring journalist or team of journalist (as would be the case with a book published by a car magazine) then it's not POV and it's not OR. If there is significant informed dissent, or the issue is complex (as with the Corvair and Nader) we can cover it by reference to both sides. But there are cars which are identified by multiple sources as duds, and there ios nothing wrong with listing them - either as a separate article or if there are only a few after the fact-checking then in an article on automotive duds. Sure, some people <i>love</i> their Edsels, but in the end there is no significant informed dissent from "the wrong car for the wrong market at the wrong time" analysis. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:20, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(indent reset) OK, we can argue about that forever, but tell me why do you want to keep a "List of automobiles some sources users considered 'identfied authorities' declared to be 'duds' (even though it does not equal being a commercial failure, as a commercial failure is a product that did to live up to sales/financial projections)" in an encyclopedia, especially that the corresponding list of successful automobiles (for which all the raised arguments apply) was unanimously deleted? I believe a list should be an expection in WP, used in cases when it can add valuable information that cannot be presented in any other form - like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_largest_suspension_bridges.html" title="List of largest suspension bridges">List of largest suspension bridges</a>.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>.

The fact that it exists to some extent isn't the question; its verifiability or lack of it is the key to whether we can write an article on it.

<dd>Your changes added a bunch of links, but they consist of yahoo groups, personal websites, and a couple porn sites which themselves are non-notable.

<ul>
<li><b>Points to consider</b> - It's not about liking (or in your case, disliking) this entry, but about showing dilligence in mapping out within Wikipedia all these various concepts that exist in the world.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>1. Some concepts are better cited than others, it's true.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2. However that doesn't mean that some things, which are perhaps more ephemeral, or which came into their own with the rise of the internet, can't be listed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3. Granted one can't list everything, but I suggest that if one can prove that a lot of people are involved in a concept, and that this concept exists as such, then the concept must surely merit some inclusion, even if that inclusion is limited only to what one can source.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4. As for your grandmother throwing spoons at cats (I haven't met her but I'm sure she's a nice lady), I would think that her eccentricity is too isolated to be reasonably compared with this fetish at hand. I have shown that thousands of people have taken it upon themselves to join public groups around this fetish; and found any number of websites, most which have been around for years, creating a sort of community.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5. It would be a mistake to make an article called <i>bellypunching videos</i> on the basis of the fact of such videos existing, because that would ignore the evident existence of the concept of the fetish.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>6. Granted that if one starts a blog on any obscure fetish, it can't be included here; but if 30 or 40 different organizations and people start websites, both personal websites and business websites, combined with free public groups that require membership (membership to which groups as I've stated reaches the thousands) I suggest that a certain minimum has been reached to make it a bonafide concept that some people hold.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>7. If you really believe that only things that show up in journals are worthy of existence in WIkipedia, I think Wikipedia will be much the poorer for it. It seems unreasonable to ignore the existence of something that is obvious and evident, from the links I've found (which were incidentally only a small percentage). To wit:
<dl>
<dd><i>[W]here an article (1) makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge,</i></dd>
<dd>[as the existence of a fetish called "bellypunching" may be deduced]</dd>
<dd><i>and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims,</i></dd>
<dd>[as this article does not,]</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Re your item 7, I think you are not in tune with the spirit of WP:NOR there. The idea is that we can write (eg) "an apple pie is a pastry crust with an apple filling"; finding a reliable source for that sentence might not be easy, but no-one would try to strike out (as OR) what a huge number of people already know. As it says, such examples are exceptional; extending that principle to an activity like bellypunching is not on. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Stephen_33a8.html" title="User:Mr Stephen">Mr Stephen</a> 15:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> while you are correct about alt.sex.stories, your understanding of policy toward primary sources seems to be off. <i>Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia...In some cases, where an article (1) makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikipedia article may be based entirely on primary sources (examples would include apple pie or current events), but these are exceptions.</i> A porn site selling 'bellypunching' videos is "easily verifiable without specialist knowledge." We do not need a credible third party to tell us such exists when we see it with our own eyes.
<ul>
<li>Yes, we could consider these porn sites, or the videos themselves, as primary sources, verifying the existence of videos of women being punched in the stomach. However, where does that get us in relation to this article? That leaves an article called Bellypunching, consisting entirely of "Videos of women being punched in the stomach exist", which would mean we'd need to rename the article "bellypunching videos" or something similar, which would violate <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> and need to be deleted, as the article would simply be a rephrasing/definition of the title.

Suppose my grandmother enjoys throwing spoons at her cat, and writes about it on her myspace account and makes a video of it which she posts online. Can we have a wikipedia article called Cat spooning or Grandmother spoon throwing or Spoon thrown at cat hobby? No. Attempting to grab bits from parts of policies and put them together to suggest that everything in the world is a primary source and therefore we can have an article about everything, simply won't work. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 15:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm concerned about this article. Whilst it seems hard to verify and highly unusual bordering on unlikely, that doesn't nessessarily warrant its deletion or label it a hoax. I'd say as <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> has heard of this fetish before that warrants a weak keep. Although it needs considerable improvement. Many of the sexual articles are like this though, I don't think deletion is the answer to it. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianProlific_7186.html" title="User:WikipedianProlific">WikipedianProlific</a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedianProlific_3841.html" title="User talk:WikipedianProlific"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 13:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Neither the author of the piece, nor any of us in this discussion, know of any proper sources to verify the information in the piece, though all of it seems plausible, even likely. I think thats an indication that the piece needs fixing, not elimination. Our inability to find gastergastrizophilia on the net neither proves nor disproves anything -- detailed texts on sexual paraphilia aren't left around laying open on the net, and a mild amount of googling for "erotic punching," "belly punishment" or "rough body play" (thats what they call the workshops where they teach you how to take an 'erotic punch') will show that the practice is meither "unlikely" nor even uncommon. Some of it is obviously sex play with a consenting partner; some is not so consensual, and there is a shaded continuum -- but, even in this supposedly liberated age, nobody has any real nummbers -- in part because the participants themselves don't know where the line actually divides consent and abuse. I think it's an important topic, and a research failure isn't a good reason to have no article in this instance.

<li>You're right in the broader sense of making Wikipedia a quality, fully verifiable site. But if you think AfD is going to solve that problem, dream on. For the time being, until we develop a robust system to filter out the unverifiable material, I believe it is more important to maintain consistency in what we accept and what we don't. You can argue there are rules in place for that, but how appropriate are they and how well are they enforced? I believe that articles like this tend to be mostly harmless to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcon_c4ed.html" title="User:Cdcon"><font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>&#160;Cdcon&#160;</b></font></a> 20:12, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> Google will confirm for you that "erotic punching," "belly punishment" and "rough body play" all exist, at least enouh that some are <i>trying</i> to make money with them. <b>primary sources</b> are permitted, see WP: NOR, <i>In some cases, where an article (1) makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikipedia article may be based entirely on primary sources...</i> Few here seem to have read this.

<li>If you're suggesting that we make an article called Google hits on "belly punishment", consisting of the results of a google search, I have to say I'm rather sure it would violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Seriously, though, you're looking for a loophole in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> which doesn't exist. The fact that a phrase can be found in a google search on a number of webpages, combined with the fact that this phrase is used in the title of some porn videos, does not justify a wikipedia article. You just can't make a wikipedia article by combining "some webpages have the term 'bellypunching' in them" and "Some videos of women being punched in the stomach exist, and some of these videos have the term 'bellypunching' in the title". This does not equal an article, this yields a dictionary definition, and a questionable one at best. It's not an accident or a coincidence that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> when combined disallow wikipedia articles based on nothing but message board postings and porn videos, this was done on purpose and there is no loophole. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 15:34, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Yes, this type of porn does appear to exist. (But then, what type of porn does <i>not</i>? The Internet is to porn what the proverbial typewriter monkeys are to literature.) What matters here is that there are no reliable sources for any of the statements the article makes about bellypunching - as Xyzzyplugh said above, we'd have to stub it to "Bellypunching porn exists".

Plus, the girls of Danity Kane are slowly gaining even more notability as their album release draws nearer (Aug 22) and they are appearing in more magazines. Their individual official web sites are also getting more hits and becoming more fleshed out, so there should be more information available for use by the wikipedia community (in terms of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and giving each girl their own individual entry). logsmein 23:26, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This group is becoming very popular, being constantly featured on Yahoo Buzz, being the Number 1 Music Artist on Myspace, and being on the top of MTV Artist pages. Their album will be released Aug 22, and the girls are starting to get a lot of publicity. Therefore, it would be unfair to close this page down strictly for the reason that this band is not popular. Also, if other bands have sites for their individual artists, it makes sense to allow these individual members to have their own parts as well. each girl will have their own fanbases who will want to read about the particular members.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. As BoojiBoy stated, you are misreading what <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is. I mentioned message boards to show that hockey fans find this information useful. As it is, it does not appear to me that you have justified that these lists violate WP:NOT. Given how broad your argument appears, I could use your logic to justify the deletion of every single list on Wikipedia. This clearly is not a list of loosely based topics, nor is it indiscriminant information. It is a list of one single topic: Players that have moved from one team to another. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 18:35, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> You are completely misreading <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. It says that wikipedia is not a message board and it says that message boards are not relevant sources, but you can't use that to argue about the usefulness of an article, just because some people on a board find that article useful. I am sure that people on a Jessica Simpson message board find <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a> useful; that doesn't mean we should delete that article. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 12:04, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Along that line of logic, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Federer_203b.html" title="Roger Federer">Roger Federer</a> messageboard users will find his article useful; however, the list Roger Federer's winning streak on grass is not, since it contains a series of indiscrminate information; voted for deletion for that reason here <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Roger_Federer%27s_winning_streak_on_grass_e3b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roger Federer's winning streak on grass">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roger Federer's winning streak on grass</a>. A list of trades that took place during an NHL season is no more distinguishable than the 30+ victories on Federer's recent grass winning streak. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 18:48, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Not encyclopedic. This article has a long and sad history of trying to be cleaned up, and I think the reason they have all failed is that it just isn't a good candidate for an encyclopedia entry. It reads more like a review or critical analysis essay. There is only one reference, and that reference really has little to do with the subject of the article itself. Nearly every sentence is marked with {{fact}}, but I don't see how there could even be a source that validates any of these statements. Let us end the madness and delete this article, merging any meager scraps of verfiable fact (if there are any to be found) into <a href="../../../e/2E/_/E._W._Dijkstra_a2aa.html" title="E. W.

<li>Is this really so clear cut? Large shows like Letterman will have quite large staffs of writers. When the show is nominated, the entire staff gets nominated. Making emmy nomination the bar, then, could lead to articles about thousands of minor television writers. I say we draw the line of notability at lead writers (or somewhere like that) to prevent this onslought of borderline-vanity articles. This is it, make no mistake anymore 12:43, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes. It's pretty well established that a major award, or nomination thereof, in any field (Emmys, Oscars, Pulitzar, Nobel Prizes, etc) are reason for inclusion. As for whether this leads to inclusion of "minor" people, I would say that those winning or nominated for such an award can no longer be considered "minor" in their field. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:04, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sounds good. I just followed the link provided on Hely's article and found that approximately 95 people were nominated for Emmys in 2003 for writing alone. I imagine, according to your logic, I am justified in going ahead and creating 95 stubs stating that these folks won emmys? maybe then I should proceed to other emmy categories, then to daytime emmys, then to other years, etc? Just want to make sure I have your go-ahead to create thousands of stubs about otherwise non-notable individuals. This is it, make no mistake anymore 14:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you're willing to do the work, go for it.

<li>As per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mr._Three_20fd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mr. Three">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mr. Three</a>, the blame for this remonimation lies squarely with the editor who not only didn't cite the source in the article the last time this came to AFD, <i>hasn't done so this time either</i>. The prior AFD discussion wasn't in the usual place, and wasn't linked to from the notice on the article's talk page. Please learn to cite sources. Citing sources is the way to avoid AFD, and a complaint that articles come to AFD when one has failed to cite any sources and no sources can be found (without knowing a different name for the subject that isn't even mentioned in the article) doesn't really have much foundation, especially when <i>it has happened once already</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:04, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Usually it happens. Considering that I spent two hours voting in 30-something drinking game AfDs the last time it came around, I'm not shocked that a few missed the boat.

<li><b>Comment</b> What possible relevance is there to a discussion of whether to delete an article that someone thinks it is a public health hazard? Isn't that opinion itself OR?

<li><b>Comment</b> First, it should be renamed to <i>List of hentai manga</i>, but just how do you differentiate between hentai manga and hentai dōjinshi? --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 03:06, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> With all the <s>doujinshi</s> manga of varying levels of notability, there are way too many of these to list and maintain, so what's the criterion for inclusion? I say forget red links and let each article be subject to AfD.

<ul>
<li>Considering that the prior AFD discussion was not in the usual place or linked to from the notice on the article's talk page, and that <i>even the second time around you haven't actually cited the source in the article</i>, it's somewhat unfair to characterize the renomination as bad. The root cause of the problem here is failure to cite sources in the article. You're not citing sources in the article, either. Please learn to cite sources in articles. Articles that cite sources are rarely brought to AFD in the first place, let alone deleted. This one certainly wouldn't have be renominated <i>if you had actually added to the article</i> the source that you found when the article came to AFD before. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:51, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Easily verifiable articles brought to AfD are bad nominations. I stand by that. As I said in the other discussion, when 30+ articles are brought up last time around, and you spend hours doing research to find the verifiability for them, you're gonna miss a couple. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This was <i>not</i> an easily verifiable article, as explained above. And the last time around this article was nominated individually, <i>not</i> as part of a collective nomination of 30 articles. In the prior AFD discussion, you <i>failed to cite the source that you found, in the article</i>. The cited source was hidden away on a hard-to-find AFD page, rather than <i>in the article</i>. As I said before, the blame here does not lie with the nominator, but with the editor who found a non-obvious source last time around, <i>but didn't cite it in the article</i>. Accusing the nominator of making bad nominations is poor form, given the circumstances. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:58, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then we disagree. It's not hard to look up drinking games at Amazon or Google Books, and if a source is missed here and there when you're trying to save 30 articles from deletion, it happens. The blame, by design, <i>cannot</i> lie with the nominator, as there's no requirement for the nominator to do anything other than spend the time doing the AfD. Considering the situation, we disagree on what's poor form here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:10, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Er, yes, glad to: There are as of this moment zero sources of any kind in this article, let alone <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable published ones</a>. It even has a tag that says so. As such, it appears to me that the article does <i>not</i> meet WP:V in a rather textbook manner. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 17:03, 9 August 2006 (UTC) -- <i>Update</i>: Ah, I get it now, you mean to refer to the sources cited in this and in the previous AfD. Well, the <i>article itself</i> still fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. And, sorry, it supposedly being mentioned under another name in a book of drinking games <i>could</i> meet WP:V, but I don't see any indication of even minimal notability. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 17:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So your position is, in fact, that it's not notable, not that it's not verifiable. Given that the game is detailed in a published book, could you explain how it's non-notable? I, for the record, have no problem moving the article to the proper name, but to say it's not notable seems weird. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I'm in the telephone book. I even wrote a (non-self-published) book and co-authored another. I'm still not notable. Put differently, not everything that's in a book is necessarily notable just for being in a book. It might well be, but if it were, shouldn't we have, say, some media mentions or some Google hits? Come to think of it ... <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Three+Man%22+drinking+game" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Three+Man%22+drinking+game" rel="nofollow">it does have many Google hits.</a> So a case for verifiability and notability can probably (barely) be made, and it appears that more than five people in the world play this game, although you still wouldn't know this from the article itself (as per Uncle G above).

<ul>
<li>Well, the article being poor at the moment (and I'll do some work on it again later tonihgt) isn't an automatic reason, but I'm glad you changed your mind. For the record, I think that if you've written a non-vanity press book, you *are* notable enough, but that's a different discussion. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:52, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Because the only source you can find is a published list of drinking games of uncertain provenance (how do you know the compilers didn't add some to make up the numbers&#160;?). Do you think there was any sort of editorial oversight, or a review committee, that scrutinised the contents&#160;?

<ul>
<li>How do we know some weren't added? Because we can do a search for the games and see if they're discussed elsewhere, which this one is.

<li>But I have already voiced my dislike for Wikipedia, so anything under which I am the sole documentation could not be taken seriously. It can be assumed that I can, have, and will again pass off lies as the truth just to see it documented here in the very real hopes that I can one day make a public fool of Wikipedia and it's practices. Any page you quote as a reference here on Wikipedia could easily be changed into something wildly different. My website could only be considered a source if I weren't willing to modify it just to manipulate and mock Wikipedia. See, I told you my dislike of Wikipedia was relevant to the article...--SeanHoward 07:49, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>While that may be true, you're really just attacking Wikipedia, not this article. Just because you believe that Wikipedia shouldn't exist, doesn't mean that you're allowed to falsify articles on yourself. If you do anyway, than you should be treated the same as any other vandal and denied the ability to edit or create articles. If you have a problem with Wikipedia, there are many, many outlets that you can use to express that- deliberately sabotaging Wikipedia for others serves no purpose but to be petty.--Wtstar 01:33, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think you understand. I wouldn't have to touch Wikipedia. About 90% of that article is quoted directly from me or consists of information only I could verify. You'd have a hard time finding enough reliable third party sources to say anything significant about me, and I'm telling you right now - I'm not just an unreliable source, I'm down right hostile. --SeanHoward 16:41, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you are indeed as much of a source on this article as you claim to be, then I suggest you remove your contributions and let the rest of us, with our NPOV and third-party sources fill in the gaps. I'm sure that it's very possible for us to find the information without your help, regardless of whether or not you want this article to exist.--Wtstar 01:33, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Personally, I'm not sure Sean Howard would be considered major enough to warrent a biographical article, especially if he doesn't want one. The only reason Mr. Howard even has his own article is because of the flame war that he accidently prompted, and a couple of (very amusing) web-comics. There are a variety of equally prominant web artists with no mention whatsoever on wikipedia, such as AIMO, Crimson Jassic or Nemain Ravenwood. Also, the only source of information available on this guy is what you can pull out of various forums, many of which seem to have a tendancy to bash him, and are therefore not reliable. To sum it up, what we have is a minor contemporary cartoonist, on whom we can get little to no reliable information.--Ostermana 06:11, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Oh boy, this man is sometimes more trouble then he's worth. The thing with Sean Howard's problem with Wikipedia is that it criticizes him. Well DUH! He's a jerk. I know it, you know, heck, even HE knows it! He's admitted it. He likes to cause trouble and call people incompetent, but he can't stand it when there is even a LITTLE bit of bad things said to him! If people who alter this article can't find sorces, then the reason is because there are no sources to find. Howard deleates anything that gets pissed on by other people and show him as being wrong (he's even deleated comics because people threw them back in his face). The thing is, pretty much all this information is true, and I'm sure some searching through the webarchives will prove that.

<li>Man, is it me or do a lot of these 'keep' blurbs take time out to personally attack me? If this is the quality of person who wants an article about me on Wikipedia, what does that say about how the article will be used? So far, the article has been real short on facts and real big on slander, insinuation, vandalism, gossip, and a few guys who want to use me to advertise their forum to my fans, even though it has nothing to do with me (you may recognize them above with the 'keep' votes - wonder why?).

<li><b>Delete</b> Honestly I think a major difference thats going unconsidered here is that Squidi isn't exactly rich and famous.

I know, I know, information is easy to find on the internet, but the point stands. I also agree with the Bio and infamy stuff. I ALSO also agree that Squidi is being childish and trying to use this as a way to get at Wikipedia, but that doesn't stop him from being right in that this article needs to be taken down--Juron Pilo 13:03, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Aside from the obvious fact that the subject has no desire to be in Wikipedia, the particular article currently posted is not substantial enough to warrent being in Wikipedia. How much non-AMD work is actually related to Sean Howard (and is eligible for inclusion in Wikipedia)? To the extend of my knowlege, AMD, TSD, AAA and other related works all fall under the category of "Squidi.net", do they not? If we really need an article that relates all the information, why not put it under an umbrella. We don't have enough information to really warrent a full article on Sean Howard, do we? I mean, does anyone even have something as simple as his date of birth? That's pretty standard information for a biography, isn't it? Yet, there is almost nothing actually relating to Sean Howard himself in this article. If there was enough material to write a full article, this would be a different subject. (George W. Bush, for instance, is well known enough that it would be wrong not to have an article for him.) I'm not saying DOB should be a qualifier, but look at the article in its current state. Judging by the content there alone, I would say Sean Howard is not noteworthy enough to have an article of his own. A few mentions in other articles, possibly, but not a full-fledged biographical article under his name. Figs 03:55, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The most notable part of the article, and what largely inspired its content in the first place was a section on the 'end of the comics', which detailed some events and controversies about copyright infringement in regards to pixel art, which is a large part of the reason Sean Howard is known outside of his own comic or worth looking up. An older version that has most of that section: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sean_Howard_%28American_webcomic_artist%29&amp;oldid=68307679" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sean_Howard_%28American_webcomic_artist%29&amp;oldid=68307679" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>.

<dd>But that section is crap. The first paragraphi is misleading, factually incorrect, speculative, and unverifiable. The second paragraph has NOTHING to do with why the comic ended. The third paragraph is actually decent, but along with the "Return to Comics" section is now moot because the comic is indeed back. It's nothing more than a footnote in the history of squidi.net, and worthless in the grand scheme of a biography of my life. That section you are praising is little more than gossip, and I'm afraid that you're going to try to use it as some sort of justification for starting a new section on squidi.net, which would just circumvent the (poorly enforced) safeguards on verifibility in bios so that gossip and slander would be more easily introduced. --SeanHoward 20:34, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's been mentioned in interviews with you, in material on your site available from archive.org, and on other comic related sites discussing your stances on copyright issues. A fair number of people have heard of you because of your stance on copyrights.

<li><b>Comment</b> Even though Sean is being less than polite about it, he has several points. When someone's major claim to fame is a controversy with another web comic (with sources composed entirely, so far as I know, of people who have taken one side or another), you cannot create an article anywhere near a neutral point of view and have verifyable sources. Okay, so if that's left out of the article, what's left? His personal life, his web comic, and his blog. Mr. Howard has made quite an effort to keep as much personal information about himself off of the internet, except for mentions on his own site. His web comics already have their own pages. And his blog? Well, if wikipedia starts making pages for everyone who happens to have a blog, then I guess this page should be kept. But last time I checked, there weren't 8 million articles about emo kids with live journals. Seans blog had a larger audience, but at the end of the day it was a blog (and aside from copies of the blog itself, there doesn't seem to be any mention of it by a news source). It it's a matter of making easy access for his web comics, a portal page would make more sense than a biography. If the individual being written about was willing to cooperate with (or even ignore) his own article, there might be other routes. But someone who is willing to vandalize his own web page to make sure there is no accurate information anywhere about his site (as Mr. Howard proposed above), then there is little cause to keep such an article. <a href="../../../e/l/b/User%7EElbow_b002.html" title="User:Elbow">Elbow</a> 05:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

In the case of BB, there's substantial media coverage of them, and interest in their conduct, on, and off the show, and therefore material for expansion. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:45, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result was <b>keep</b>. Never in a million years speediable. I've discounted the vote-only comments, which leaves Bustter's "notable because of x ghits" versus Dlyons's "not notable because of y ghits". I did some Googling myself, and no matter how I narrowed it down, there were always several hundred thousand hits there (the 32m figure is optimistic; while the early results tend to be relevant, not all are). That gets rid of the "only 60 distinct ghits" ... which leaves ... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 15:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>First of all, that was, like, my seventh point for why I think the article should be kept. Second, I disagree that it means <i>nothing</i>- it may mean very little, but not <i>nothing</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I find the article inoffensive. The statements about Japanese pronunciation are basically correct, though they could be touched up a little.

<li><b>Comment</b> It is not true that "su" and "shi" are pronounced "s" and "sh". They are pronounced the way they read, just quickly enough for the average person not to notice.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I didn't like the guy one bit, but of all the contestants on the show, he's easily among the three most famous (along with winner Michelle and runner-up Ruth Badger). It was a hit series that attracted high ratings - but most importantly, his private life has been featured in various newspapers on a number of occasions since the show ended.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is ofcourse a self fulfilling prophecy. Removing the only link to the article, making it an orphan article while the AfD just started, will cause even less people to visit the article and decrease the chance it will ever be expanded. We've got a lot of stubs here on Wikipedia and a stub makes it easier for the casual reader to add suitable information to Wikipedia. For now, I will replace the removed link. If the conclusion of the AfD is to delete, I will be the first to remove it again. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li>I understand that this is a non-notable webcomic to you so you feel it should immediately be deleted. However upon clicking on the 'Random Article' button I was brought to Gallo-Romance languages, which I have no idea what they are. So much of Wikipedia is unknown to most people, that is why it exists. The point of Wikipedia is to come to find information on little or unknown things. It is where many pieces of information can be brought together. Granted, not every yahoo should create an article, not all articles should be kept. However, I created this article to allow people to find unknown information for those who are unsure what this webcomic is. I did not create it for vanity purposes, only information. I will understand if you do decide to delete it but I felt it necessary to state my case and what I believe the basis of Wikipedia to be. ShadowDion 16:46, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(Edit Conflict)<b>Comment</b> Extremly notable. It certainly needs to be expanded and I prodded it a little in the right direction with some additions. As I said before, the phrase "U-Haul Lesbian" is iconic in the GLBT term and you could make a solid case regarding <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systematic bias</a>. The mention "U-haul lesbian" brings instant recognition in the community but due to systematic bias, many people in the straight dominated world may not grasp how iconic and relevant it really is--hence the reason a disussion such as this is even happening. <i>That</i> is a compelling reason to keep this article and flesh it out more because it truly is a notable context in understanding so many facets of Lesbian life. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 16:44, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Query</b> there are two separate issues here. [1] is the term notable? [2] is the concept notable? even the links posted above by Coredesat don't show use of the term other than in a few website names, and <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> has much more stringent requirements for when a neologism should be kept -- although it could be argued that <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is too strict. Agne, do you have any sources showing that this is a notable term? as for [2], i don't know. however, the article as it currently stands has very little info in it; mostly it just defines the term and links to two sites. in general, i'd assume that for any notable subcultures X and Y there's going to be a smaller subculture X*Y; but it's not clear wikipedia needs an article about all those X*Y's. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 04:01, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Kingdante87</b>, as a Gaymer myself I feel that this article should remain up. I do recognize that it needs content including links to and from other pages. The problem is that many heterosexual gamers do not recognize gaymers (or gayming) to be real. All that this article needs to be fixed is a little more content added and maybe bring up the topic of gayming in the gaming article. I am proud to see the gay culture slowly seeping into main stream culture. As an option the gayming article could be deleted if appended to an article about gay culture.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Having written a good portion of the article (and bringing it out of stub statis from a single sentence entry) I have to say that I'm glad others have as much of an interest in this topic as I do. It is important for both the gaming and gay community to have articles such as this that promote homosexual terms like gaymer as positive identifiers, rather than insults, and to help spread the word that such a community of people does indeed exist. While it may not be as pertanent of an article as some, it is nonetheless important in garnering a supportive online community for those who classify themselves as homosexual gamers. I would love to see this article grow and prosper, but if it is decided to abandon it, I would heavily suggest that the world at least be alluded to in another article.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> pending more evidence of substantial coverage in reliable sources. And a correction: The term has been used for at least a decade for gay boardgamers, not just videogamers. WP:NOT a forum for advocacy or support groups. While gay people have notably been treated unjustly and game fans have been disparaged, I've never (in thirty years of postal and tournament boardgaming) seen discrimination or violence against gaymers <i>per se</i>, nor read media coverage nor academic papers about such things. The articles cited by Coredesat are the first mainstream coverage I've heard of. An accusation of "systemic bias" is not a sufficient argument to keep an article; when it's thrown around without supporting facts, it can be just another empty epithet. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> in agreement with previous poster. expanding on my previous query, is there anything particularly notable about gaymers beyond e.g. subcultures composed of gay goths (nerds, bowlers, ravers, etc.) or black (native american, deaf, etc.) gamers? i assume that all groups that suffer discrimination or ill-treatment within mainstream society will form support groups devoted to particular activities or subcultures. but do we need to document every single one of these? it could even be argued that this article should be examined from the other side of the <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> issue: gay gamers (esp. of the video type) are likely to be of the same male, technically-savvy, 15-49-year-old, white-collar, industrialized-country-inhabitant type that is in general overrepresented in Wikipedia. (for example, i strongly suspect there is a vibrant deaf gay community, and arguably it's much more important than the gaymer community; and there's probably been a lot more scholarly research done on it than on gaymers. but wikipedia has no page on it, perhaps because the native language of most deaf people is asl (or some other signed language) rather than english, and they may not feel comfortable in english-dominated communities such as en.wikipedia.) <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 06:52, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> A couple things that I would like to point out. On <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> one of the criteria for inclusion is that <i>"we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers <b>about</b> the term"</i> (emphasis mine) One of the sources in the article is the university study <i>about</i> Gaymers--as an entity, as a group of which this terms apply. This brings the focus beyond the gay community as an extension of how the world at large relates to this sub-culture of <i>Gaymers</i>. Second, the systematic bias comes into play in that the term is being viewed through limited worldview that systematically excludes those things which are notable and relevant beyond those looking glasses. The Gay Community is a sizable minority and Gaymers are a notable subculture that is within that minority. It's Wikipedia's desire (As laid out in <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>) to <i>"to fill in the gaps left by this bias, consciously focusing on those subjects and perspectives neglected by the encyclopedia as a whole."</i>. Does the article need to be expanded? I concur and will note that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_LGBT_studies_5dc3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject LGBT studies">Wikiproject LGBT</a> has this on their list of articles to work on and expand. Actions like this help to counter that systematic bias instead of creating more gaps and, as a whole, Wikipedia benefits.<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 08:20, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As clarified in the original article the queerspawn.com url has been taken over by a new person, multiple references is due to multiple websites being hosted under the same url at different time periods. You're right that clarification in how the term is used would be good, but in several of the cases, the term is used in the title of the cited source. Additionally, the important distinction between queerpawn and parenting by same-sex couples is found in the second paragraph of the article. It is a term that identifies who the population in question is and focuses discussion and agency on their identity, not their parents.Nodesignation 22:53, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think unless someone can find some notability here, having it listed on the page for the manga zine is sufficient, we don't need a long article on a 30 page one-shot.

<dd>Furthermore, much as we have a well-meaning wish to help the reader understand whether there is validity to allegations of Israeli apartheid, it's not something that can really be covered in an encyclopedic fashion because the term "apartheid" in modern, colloquial discourse has no concrete operational criteria. (Yes, a definition of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_of_apartheid.html" title="Crime of apartheid">crime of apartheid</a> exists, but if we restricted the article to that definition it would practically disappear.) You can have a coherent, NPOV article about whether Israel practices <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a> or <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a>, because these are all well-defined terms.

<dd>Kim, you've said yourself (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Israeli_apartheid/Workshop&amp;diff=63867507&amp;oldid=63867447" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Israeli_apartheid/Workshop&amp;diff=63867507&amp;oldid=63867447" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>), that none of these sources actually allege that Israel practices apartheid. What these sources do is compare Israel's practices to apartheid. Nuanced comparison is what scholars do. Reducing a complex situation into a slogan, like "Israeli apartheid," is what activists do. <a href="../../../s/u/-/User%7ESu-laine.yeo_5d6d.html" title="User:Su-laine.yeo">Su-Laine Yeo</a> 06:46, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you talk about the term perse, yes you are correct. However, scholars do make comparisons between South Africa and Israel, and their conclusions are straightforward. On the title of the article, the current is POV, as it denies the scholary studies, but for the rest, I do not care abut the exact title, see my comment above. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 06:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, let's look at those sources. They seem to level the "apartheid" charge not only at Israel's treatment of the population of the West Bank and Gaza, but at "Zionism" as a whole -- in other words, at the belief that there should be a State of Israel as a Jewish state. That being the case, the "merge" (if any) probably should be into <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism_and_racism.html" title="Zionism and racism">Zionism and racism</a>. I know that that article has its own problems, but since it is already there, the fact that some people have chosen to use a word in another language ("apartheid") to refer to a related concept, does not merit a separate article with that word in the title. And I know the argument will be that the resulting article would be too long, but this article really does not need to be as long as it is anyway. We do not need to be citing every article in every little magazine, or every master's thesis, that refers to the issue. I think a lot of the sources are in there solely due to the controversy over the article's existence, to "make weight" for keeping it as a separate article. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 15:43, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Apartheid goes way further than racism, but merging this article with that article and renaming that to Zionism-apartheid comparison (or something like that) would be a very usefull alternative approach. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 16:14, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I suspect that there are enough scholarly, well referenced and peer-reviewed articles from professional historians and sociologists to provide an account of this topic. Maybe near the bottom of the article there could be one small paragraph for "Media coverage" and a very selective account of commentary from blogs, reporters and media pundits could be restricted to that paragraph. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 19:54, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Strong Keep</b> I have reason to suspect the nomination for the deletion of these articles is related to the deletion of the Aquygen article. However, unlike that article, both Brown's gas and <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxyhydrogen_flame.html" title="Oxyhydrogen flame">Oxyhydrogen flame</a> have good merit:
<ul>
<li>Both are long standing terms from the pre-20th century science community - as such, they have strong historical value.</li>
<li>Oxyhydrogen flame is linked to by many articles - despite it's non-20th centruy name, it's a simple and very scientific concept - oxygen and hydrogen.</li>
<li>Brown's Gas is strongly related to the Oxyhydrogen flame.</li>
<li>Both recieve a large number of google hits, indicating some level of notability.</li>
<li>Brown's Gas is a good example of a now-debunked scientific theory, whilst Oxyhydrogen flame is real dispite sounding similar.</li>
<li>The presense of these aids us in dealing with or discussing psuedoscience akin to Aquygen</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Please view the deletion discussion on Aquygen and HHO Gas for reference. Based upon the reasons both of those articles were deleted and subsequently Aquygen was permanantly deleted, and for the sake of looking like a hypocracy, this article should also be deleted based purely on the same criteria which was applied to Aquygen and HHO Gas. In fact Brown's gas has much less scientific research and evidence than does HHO Gas, which had patents, scientific peer reviewed journals, and media coverage of it usage. This article on Brown's gas lacks sufficient information on wikipedia as per the same criteria used to delete the articles on HHO Gas/Aquygen. Since it is implied within the article on Brown's gas that it is based on false information or is lacking sufficient evidence, it would be entirely hypocritical to have deleted one article (HHO Gas and Aquygen) which had more cited sources for its existance, than to keep this article which has even less cited information for it not being a hoax. HHO Gas was confirmed as being used in schools and other welding applications, while I have not seen any information provided within this article on the actual use of Brown's gas. For example, no media coverage, press releases etc. Based on these reasons I have recommended that this article be deleted for uniformity, so there are no accusations of hypocracy.

<dd><b>Reply</b> Brown's gas is a historical entity, which means all news coverage of it happened over a century ago. it was and still is quite well known, and is somewhat notable for being a quack gas. I will agree, however, that the article does need tidying and rewording to make it clear that it <i>is detailing a scientific falsehood of the past, now well debunked</i>, as opposed to a current real gas. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 01:36, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Additional</b> Brown's gas appears to the educated observer to be the correct term for things like Aquygen and HHO. Surely as, I suspect, a supporter of Aquygen you would be in favour of this article? Being the more historic and well-known term (especially within the scientific and history of science community), this would be the appropriate place to detail such creations. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 01:40, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would like to address your concerns <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a>. There is a lack of sufficient evidence to support the information provided on this article. <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a> As a historical entity, I would assume that such claims would have cited sources, yet there are none provided in the article. I dont think this is a well known or historic fact. To an educated observer like myself, your above point about Brown's gas being the correct term for HHO Gas/Aquygen only further supports the deletion of this article because as mentioned, HHO Gas was deleted on the belief that it was a hoax or scam, which alone would be a reason to endorse deletion of Brown's Gas. I think your statement misrepresents my intentions by insinuating that I am a supporter of HHO Gas or Aquygen. I simply want to ensure fairness and equality of treatment to such questionable articles, otherwise it will appear to educated observers that wikipedia's administrators and editors have an agenda of unfairness and hypocracy. And that is my primary concern with this and similar articles. User:75.108.54.176
<ul>
<li>As you should be aware, as the age of something increases, especially if it is from before the information revolution of the 1970's, the ease of finding good sources to cite increases. Searching on SwetsWise (an academic paper database), there are two results - a typical number for a matter of historical rather than current importance. <i><a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a> does not apply</i>, as this article is not attempting to be a hoax. It is detailing historical work once thought to be true but now generally understood to not be. WP:HOAX would not, for example, apply to a page on, say, the moon landings conspiracy, as this details the hoax, rather than attempts to continue it. I agree that the article as stands is poorly written, but it is an issue of some note and merit. Rewording would be the prefered solution. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:35, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> I did some research and didn't find much to note.. This is just as significant as an episode of Commander in Chief.. As far as I am concerned, even as a hoax, Brown's gas isn't even notable.. Name someone off the street who knows anything about Brown's gas.. They will probably tell you that they heard about that guys flatulence, but I doubt you will get them to tell you a thing about hydrogen.. And thats about all this article is, something which stinks to high heaven.. Also... WIKI isn't meant to "maintain bad science".. It is meant for the presentation of accurate factual information. If it is the case that Wikipedia is for "maintaining bad science", then I say bring back those supposed HHO Gas and Aquygen Articles, they had more evidence for their existance than does this article.. They were claimed as "bad science", just as this article is, but I dont see anyone trying to bring those articles back... Based on the related articles being deleted this Junk Science should not be on Wikipedia. This Article must go!</li>

<dd>Non-mainstream theories can be respectable theories, they certainly don't belong by definition to the pseudoscience category. So, a redirect to the pseudoscience list would not be appropriate. A list of theories that can be considered to be non-mainstream is very problematic. Of all the scientific theories that exist a certain percentage is non-mainstream, in the sense that most other people working in the field don't buy it but as a theory it is not obviously wrong. But you can't make a rule to demark the boundary between mainstream and non-mainstream. In case of pseudoscience there are reasonable criteria, but even in that case you can expect some borderline cases. So, this is a recipe for POV disputes. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 01:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Criteria for non-mainstream are about as easy or difficult as for pseudoscience, and it's certainly <i>less</i> a recipe for POV disputes. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 07:06, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. There are clear criteria for <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>. The only POV disputes you can get is whether or not a particular theory satisfy these criterea. Of course, you can expect the supporters of such theories to resist their theory being classified as pseudoscience, because it isn't a label they like to see attached to their theory.</dd>
<dd>In case of non-mainstream theories there don't exist unambiguous criterea at all. Supporter of a theories listed as "non-mainstream" may not object as often compared to their pseudoscience collegues, but in case a dispute does arise, there is no way to resolve it using objective criteria. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 14:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's utter nonsense. You make an excelent argument why this list should be deleted; the aim is clearly to try to get pseudoscientific theories such as creationism into the same category as non-mainstream theories such as, say, <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics_50c3.html" title="Modified Newtonian dynamics">Modified Newtonian dynamics</a> and oppose any kind of lists to which you can only add theories like creationism but not <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics_50c3.html" title="Modified Newtonian dynamics">Modified Newtonian dynamics</a>. For the record, mainstream scientists may not believe that <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics_50c3.html" title="Modified Newtonian dynamics">Modified Newtonian dynamics</a> is correct, most don't work on it (if they do they try to disprove it). But they don't label it as nonsense. Articles written on such theories are not rejected out of hand. So, clearly there is a huge difference between pseudoscientific theories and theories one could label as non-mainstream.</dd>

I fully agree that clearly there is a huge difference between pseudoscientific theories and theories one could label as non-mainstream. However, it has also been noticed that theories that simply are non-mainstream have (had?) a tendency to be included in the list on pseudo-scientific theories because a list of non-mainstream theories didn't exist. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 21:15, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I think it goes too far to call many of the topics listed in pseudoscience "nonsense" (many of them have a high level of internal consistency) what Iblis says is essentially correct. To use a related but more direct example- only a small fraction of biologists still think that birds are not descended from dinosaurs, but the opinion is very much not pseudoscience. However, denying <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_descent.html" title="Common descent">common descent</a> is.

<dd>Please do your research before spouting off claims. This is not a proposed list, this is a relic of a failed move. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudoscientific_theories&amp;diff=67884233&amp;oldid=67545498" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudoscientific_theories&amp;diff=67884233&amp;oldid=67545498" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudoscientific_theories&amp;diff=68055628&amp;oldid=67888543" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudoscientific_theories&amp;diff=68055628&amp;oldid=67888543" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Yes, it originally was at "List of alternative, speculative, and disputed theories," but that was a conceit to NPOV which opened the door to too many legitimate theories (What theory <i>isn't</i> disputed by at least one person?). The list was moved here to match the original intent of the list.</dd>
<dd>As for pseudoscience being used as a pejorative; that's completely irrelevent (besides, it's even mentioned in the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_FAQ_00b9.html#Pseudoscience" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ">official policies</a> with this word.

<li><b>Delete</b>, should be at RFD anyway but while we're here might as well get rid of it, as pseudoscientific and non-mainstream are not the same thing at all. Things which are pseudoscientific are almost always currently non-mainstream, but may have once been mainstream, and things which are not mainstream are not necessarily pseudoscientific (some are just wrong, for example, and some are just unpopular).

<dd>William, there already exists a list of obsolete theories. But a list of alternative or speculative theories is very difficult, because what are the criterea? This is inherently POV. What is bound to happen is that the list will consist of not so popular theories of which a wiki page happens to exist. Of course in certain cases it's clear that a theory is "alternative", take e.g. various theories that assume that humans are not responsible for global warming. And even in this case, how many revert wars were there about the "small minority " sentence&#160;:) <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 12:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And what about the theories it includes that are just <i>weird</i>? We could go on like this forever. Le Sage gravity shouldn't be included and should be removed if no one advocates it now, but if advocates are still around then it does qualify as pseudoscience. ---<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrLeebot_fec7.html" title="User:DrLeebot">DrLeebot</a> 13:01, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"pseudoscientific" is not more controversial from a reasonable neutral point of view at all. There are clear criterea unlike in the case of "non-mainstream". We cannot appease the pseudoscientists for opposing the the very reasonable majority view (based on objective criterea) that their theory is pseudoocientific just because they don't like it. Any list of "non-mainstream" theories is highly problematic because there are no unambiguous criterea at all. The original list before I renamed it had this problem. What happened was that the list contained almost exclusively pseudoscientific theories. That meant that you could not add theories that were "simply the minority view", because that would be offensive to the people working on that theory. Note that even if you split thelist in two parts on the same page, google's indexing methods will cause respectable theories on the list to be associated with the label "pseudocience". <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 12:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but properly sort. There are really three types of theories that would fit on such a list. <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics_50c3.html" title="Modified Newtonian dynamics">Modified Newtonian dynamics</a> as referenced above is a proposed theory that most physicists probably believe is a possibility, though they may not support it or work on it. Few would consider it impossible or nonsense. On the other hand, the Electric Universe theory (which among other things claims that black holes don't exist) is probably in the second category: most mainstream physicists believe that it is probably BS, and those who support it are generally not accepted as part of the mainstream. However, a supporter of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics_50c3.html" title="Modified Newtonian dynamics">Modified Newtonian dynamics</a> would not find himself ostricized in the community because MOND is accepted as a possibility, and isn't pseudoscience. Then, of course, there is the third category, the category of theories that are all-and-out pseudoscience and have no actual scientific backing. If the list can be properly titled and sorted, this would be quite useful. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 13:06, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Strong Keep</b> I have reason to suspect the nomination for the deletion of these articles is related to the deletion of the Aquygen article. However, unlike that article, both Brown's gas and <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxyhydrogen_flame.html" title="Oxyhydrogen flame">Oxyhydrogen flame</a> have good merit:
<ul>
<li>Both are long standing terms from the pre-20th century science community - as such, they have strong historical value.</li>
<li>Oxyhydrogen flame is linked to by many articles - despite it's non-20th centruy name, it's a simple and very scientific concept - oxygen and hydrogen.</li>
<li>Brown's Gas is strongly related to the Oxyhydrogen flame.</li>
<li>Both recieve a large number of google hits, indicating some level of notability.</li>
<li>Brown's Gas is a good example of a now-debunked scientific theory, whilst Oxyhydrogen flame is real dispite sounding similar.</li>
<li>The presense of these aids us in dealing with or discussing psuedoscience akin to Aquygen</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: This article in conjunction with HHO Gas, Aquygen, and Brown's Gas represent information on a hypothetical gas which is created through electrolysis of water, however there is no evidence provided in this article on how the gas is created or if it even exists, there is simply no cited information provided other than the source coming from the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, which cannot be verified. Also this article has been identified as a stub, and has not been improved upon bringing this article to wikipedia standards. Please view the deletion discussion on Aquygen and HHO Gas for reference. Based upon the reasons both of those articles were deleted and subsequently Aquygen was permanantly deleted, and for the sake of looking like a hypocracy, this article should also be deleted based purely on the same criteria which was applied to Aquygen and HHO Gas. Oxyhydrogen Flame does not appear to have peer review scientific journals which support the existance and properties of the gas. Without the proper citations, this article lacks sufficient evidence, and based upon the relation to HHO Gas which was deleted per the (AfD), this article should be deleted, or there is the risk that it will appear hypocritical to delete one article and not all related articles.

<li>I was not able to produce an explaination and complete the AfD Process because of a flaw within Wikipedia which allows for one to put up a deletion AfD Tag, but does not allow for the creation of the discussion page unless one signs up for an account, which I choose not to do, so I wasn't able to give an explaination until someone else with an account created the discussion page. But now that it has been created, I would like to share with you why I nominated this page. I nominated the page because it was dealing a a subject of great scrutiny of late. HHO leads one to this page, and as I did my research on HHO Gas and Aquygen and Browns Gas I found that they were all interlinked which led to to believe that all the linked subjects must all relate to the Hoax which was claimed by many with regard to the HHO Gas. My impression was the an Oxyhydrogen Flame is the "water torch" flame produced by the burning of Brown's Gas or HHO Gas. Therefore per the discussion during the AfD process for the deletion of both Aquygen and HHO Gas, I assumed that it was appropriate to tag this article for lack of information in its source references. So if one can provide sufficient evidence for the article, I would be glad to change my vote. But as it stands I still feel that this article being a redirect for HHO is tied to HHO Gas and Brown's Gas and therefore represents false information per the discussion of HHO Gas being a hoax.

<p>According to the edit summary that added the deletion text, "nominated for deletion due to non-notability". I'm not sure I could agree with that since every other comic on KeenSpot has a page too, no matter how small. Maybe the content of the article needs refocused more towards a particular goal, but that's not qualification of a deletion in my eyes. --Zimzat 10:04, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> 3 would require that <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> be "both well known and independent of the creators." Keenspot is not well-known in any sense outside of certain segments of webcomic fandom. I've also seen it, perhaps incorrectly, referred to as a "collective," which would make it less than independent of its artists. As it was founded by webcomics artists, it is certainly not independent of every creator under its umbrella.

<li><b>Comment</b>: First, we can't keep articles based on the idea that someday they may be covered by reliable sources; if we did we'd have to keep every article made up in school one day. Second, as I understand it, <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndication.html" title="Syndication">syndication</a>, whether in print, television, radio or the web, involves licensing content to multiple providers. As Keenspot's goal is to "provid[e] one steady place for readers to find what we believe are some of the finest webcomics,"<a href="http://keenspot.com/companyinfo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://keenspot.com/companyinfo.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> and they "claim[] to be the largest publisher of <b>exclusive</b> webcomics,"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenspot" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenspot" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> (emphasis mine) they sound like the exact opposite of a syndicate. As I said, I may have seen them incorrectly identified as a "collective," and it is entirely possible that they function as somewhat of an independent publisher to some or even many of their artists. They clearly aren't an independent publisher of all of their webcomics, however (take, for example, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Crosby_d655.html" title="Chris Crosby">Chris Crosby</a>'s webcomics), and they're certainly not "well known" in any general sense. If you have verifiable information on Keenspot's business practices and decision-making which suggests that they are in most cases or in this case independent of the artists they publish, then I'd be interested in seeing that. But, as it stands, I am unsure if they are "independent," I am quite sure they are not "well known," and in either case we can't write articles on topics (even allegedly well-known and independent ones) without verifiable information from reliable sources. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 17:08, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not advocating we keep every article. I think I've sent enough articles to AfD and prod to establish that. However, if I believe a subject is sufficiently important for an article, I'm not going to advocate its deletion simply because it's not dotted its Is and crossed its Ts. They are policies and guidelines, not dogma. As far as Keenspot is concerned, I really don't think it's necessary to rehash this argument every time one of its comics is nominated for deletion. Bring it up on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> instead.

<li><b>Comment</b> I know you're not advocating keeping every article; I just think that's what we open ourselves up to when we encourage an environment where we make judgments based on "I believe a subject is sufficiently important [and may someday be covered by reliabel sources]" rather than "reliable sources believe the subject is sufficiently important to cover." Requiring encyclopedia articles to be based on widely respected, fact-checked sources is fundamental to what we're doing. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 06:27, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

For a webcomic to be invited by Keenspot, it has to have achieved a degree of success beforehand.

<dd>Without a doubt. However, as in every medium, there are different levels of significance. While the likes of Megatokyo and Penny Arcade have little use for Keenspot, there's also the second tier who aren't so dismissive. I believe that second tier is Keenspot inclusive, and though they may not have the influence the biggest names do, they're considerably more important than the thousands on Comic Genesis, Smack Jeeves and the like that have yet to distinguish themselves. Now, maybe you feel we should only have articles on the most significant webcomics, but that's not a sentiment I can support. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 18:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't mean that we should delete this page, it was a tongue-in-cheek comment. Obviously Shakespeare is more significant than a webcomic, and I was pointing out the lack of sources in the article. I didn't think about this at the time, but I think it's quite fitting that the Shakespeare article I picked was "Much ado about nothing", because discussions about whether a page about a webcomic should stay or not are very minor in the large scheme of things. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarvin_Monroe_e015.html" title="User:Marvin Monroe">Marvin Monroe</a> 12:49, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment: I really don't see a reason for this entry to be deleted. The webcomic in question is viewed by albiet a small fanbase, but a fanbasenonetheless. Other Keenspot artists have their comics listed, such as Clan of the Cats. And there is no controversy over that. If the question of if entry is purely vanity is really that much of a difference, multiple fans of the comic have already come to edit it and prove that it means something to them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tin-chan (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tin-chan_c534.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tin-chan">contribs</a>) 17:31, 10 August 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>If "a small fanbase" does not mean notability on Wikipedia, then how do you explain other such articles like "Yiff" which does not list it's references or sources. It's not to my taste, I find it abhorable, and yet it's still on wiki. And no one has disputed it yet. While a "small fanbase" means nothing to you, or many users who have posted their tastes on this discussion, it means something to a different group of people. Sorcery101 has multiple visitors and daily readers, and it's wikipedia article is satisfactory to the comic and said readership. Just because it doesn't suit someone else's tastes does not make it wrong. (As for Clan of the Cats, at least someone listed detail on the matter of what Chealsea's favorite ice cream flavor actually WAS.) If we didn't care about small fanbases, we wouldn't be arguing over them on wikipedia in the first place.

<dd>Notability is a highly relative issue. While an article in a national newspaper would make anything notable it is sadly not so with the media of the various subcultures. For example, While cart racing monthly may be "the" authority on cart racing among the cart racing subculture, it isn't to me ( I am no cart racer ). The same goes for webcomics. If you would judge the notability of wikipedia articles solely from the view of Your Average Idiot ( err.. Citizen )you could remove a sizable part of her content and whipe the list of webcomics ( nearly ) clean. -Arsenic- 21:48, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see no reason for this article to be deleted. It was apparently written entirely independently of the author of the comic (thus not Vanity), and I feel that just because some people haven't heard of the comic, or don't like it, that it should be considered "non-notable". The comic is well-written, has an interesting world-concept, and actually updates regularly. And while I may not be reputable, I am reliable and a third party (not that this is verifiable as I have no Wiki account as yet) and I read the comic regularly and appreciate that there is another perspective published here in Wiki. Thanks for listening; no attacks are meant; I am only expressing my opinion.

<li>I do think your association with Keenspot is clouding your judgment. Outside of Keenspot, being printed in The Turlock Journal, a tiny twice-weekly newspaper with a circulation of 6,000, is not a sign of being "well known." By this measure, each and every one of the completley unkown comics published by my college newspaper is about 5-10 times as "well known" as these comics. If the only possible method of verifying some possible historical significance of this comic (Sorcery 101) is by talking with its small readership, then we don't have the reliable sources for an encyclopedia article. This is an encyclopedia, not a blog; we write about topics with reliable sources, not just things we find on the internet. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 20:17, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

If <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is to be invoked to justify deletion of webcomic entries, then it should be invoked to delete every page in wikipedia as a whole, seeing how every suggestion of a verifiable third party presented gets refuted with another <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument discounting the verifiability. This is nonsense. I don't see anyone recommending copying or moving to comixpedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> Let's simply face the facts, here: It's an unbiased, verifiable article on an obviously notable person. Whether or not the user is the subject (and I honestly don't care either way), the article will stay, and neither an AfD nor talking to anyone at the Wikimedia Foundation will change that. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 15:56, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I believe this may throw this whole AFD into 'bad-faith'. LB-BL has been proven, via the edit history, to be acting in bad-faith.

<li><b>Comment</b> <small>waves from under rock</small> I'm not ready to retract my nomination, as I feel this discussion is necessary. As far as notability is concerned, however, despite not watching much television, I've heard of Nautilus, and I've heard of Bowflex. Will Total Gym 1000 stand the test of time so that your average American (correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt this is an international phenomenon), will have heard of it? Millions of products are introduced each year, but they don't all rate an article in Wikipedia.</li>

<li>To answer this, I am Australian and know it. The infomercials for it have been broadcasted on late night public television for years and I have known well funded gyms that have kept this device. The infomercials are notable in themselves: "Buffed up gym junkie says to Norris: "Chuck, I have been a fan of walker texas ranger for years and I have always wanted to know how you keep in such good shape" Chuck"with the total gym 1000" with woman in swimsuits surrounding and stroking him. I did not think keeping it would be a big issue as it is available in most retail stores in Australia like Big W and K-Mart as well as on Danoz direct. I also believe that exercise generally is very badly done on Wikipedia and fitness devices are always valuable to add. Consider the Pokemon test and I am sure that this has come out on top. Everyone knows the infomercial adds at least and they have been a joke here for years. --Realms forward 05:56, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> after an extensive cleanup, as per Srose.

<li><b>Comment</b> my first reaction is to keep, since if all of the information contained in the wikipedia article (and the team's website) is true and verified, then this actually does seem notable. Sure, we don't want to keep many high school sports team's pages, but winning that many US championships, and a world championship, do convey a level of notability. The problem here, though, is I can't seem to find <i>any</i> third-party source verifying this information. For example, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hs=yQ8&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22world+schools+championship%22+rugby&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hs=yQ8&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22world+schools+championship%22+rugby&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this Gsearch</a> turns up nothing. I'm sort of surprised there is no WP article on World Schools Championship in the first place. In summary, I would&#160;!vote <b>keep</b> if any third-party sources were found, <b>delete</b> if not.

<li><b>Comment</b> Fair criticism, I'll look into finding third party sources.

I'm new to editing/creating wikipedia articles, and this is my first attempt, so help me out here please.

<li>while the actual word is new, the events and works it attempts to describe have been going on with a community of performers around the world for some time. These people create works that do not fit into the notions of dance, theater, happenings or performance art, though they draw upon pieces of each dicipline. The creation of a term that acts as a melding of a collection of ideas is an attempt to make the ideas behind it more clear, instead of constantly attempting to re-define current terms that are inadequate, and at times incorrect for the work that is being made. By creating a term, to describe something that has existed on the fringes of many fields, creates a field of its own from within which critique, structures, and development of the form may take place.--Januszj 15:57, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It would be nice if the nominator accurately described the article and gave a valid reason for proposing it for deletion. This article describes the <i>system</i> used for numbering the HK bus routes, in addition to listing the routes. There is no schedule information.

</li>
<li><b>NOTE:</b> At this point in the discussion the article underwent a major edit in efforts to improve the article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - For several reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Edited</b> - I gave the article a fairly major overhaul, but think the article has the potential to further improve, and offer an impartial perspective on this polarising phenomenon; there are those who believe that this is a topic worthy of study, and those who believe academics should be doing better things with their time. The article can grow and improve to cite sources from both sides. The study of <i>Buffy</i> has not declined since the show ended, with many acdemics finding it easier to now analyse the series as one complete and closed 'text' - so the topic will continue to grow. And I think it deserves a tiny little space here at Wikipeda. There are several things that people should take into account before voting.</dd>
<dd><b>Navigation</b> - The article is needed for navigation for anyone looking for Buffyverse academia info rather than looking for one of the specific books.</dd>
<dd><b>Dictionary?</b> - The article isn't supposed to be saying that "Buffyverse studies" is a widely used term or a concept. The article is about the study of the Buffyverse, so the article is called 'Buffyverse studies'. ..On a side note "Buffy studies" is kinda widely used by the acdemics who study the show, and Googling using speech marks for an exact phrase ("Buffy studies") gets <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22buffy+studies%22&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22buffy+studies%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow"><big>over 26 000 results</big></a>. It's mainly been popularised by the popularity of <a href="http://www.slayage.tv/" class="external text" title="http://www.slayage.tv/" rel="nofollow">www.slayage.tv</a>. But this isn't given more than a brief mention in a footnote in the article.</dd>
<dd><b>Notability</b> - I can't help thinking that this topic is a lot more notable than people realise.

<li><b>Keep</b> - very good work Paxomen - the UEA conference establishes enough notability for it as far as I'm concerned (although it would be better at Buffy studies with the redirect pointing there, as that seems to be the more generally accepted term). <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 12:51, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reluctant keep</b>. It's an excellent rewrite. Good sources.

<li><b>Keep:</b> Wow.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hello Merope, I understand you're meaning to delete this page on Behind Tinted Glasses, but please hear me out. I have read your Wikipedia page and I see that you monitor new pages like these. Behind Tinted Glasses is a movie that we used our whole summer doing and used all the resources we could come up with. We renovated out school and covered every inch of ground in out county and more. This page was not to boost our egos at all but to tell the few people that know about this movie what it is truely about. As you can see on the page we spent a lot of time making the page and it wasn't for a mere boost of ego, you have my word. This might not have had a chance to get in in movie search engines or even independent movie search engines, well that's because it is only in post production. As you see in the article, we set our own budgets, which was a lot of money that could have been used elsewhere in this Summer. We are extremely dedicated independent film directors and do way more than just home movies. We make films and we are debating holding a community gathering for the film later this year. This film might not be large yet, but it is only a beginning to our filming company, Plastic Swords Production. We are trying to get that legalized at the moment. So I really plea to you that you allow this article to stay. It is not close to being finished and will be worked hard on for the next few days. We were meaning to put a whole lot more content on there, but it was just made last night. We are 15 and 16 year old dedicated film makers.</li>

<p>Yours Truely,</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> How long before this is deleted? We would still work as hard as possible around the clock to make it a suitable and professional looking article and correct grammar mistakes and everything that goes along with a wikipedia article. Wouldn't it be suitable if we made an article about our filming company? We are not advertising at all. I've been on wiki for 3 years now and have seen indie films and companies. I am not here to argue at all, please don't get me wrong. I would so appreciate it if it would be allowed a bit more time to be polished. Yours Truely, Nathan Couch</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Unfortunately, it is not the quality of the article that is at stake--if it were a case of that, I would help.

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for all of your help, really. I understand all of your decisions to make this article deleted. But if this had one public appearence and was recognized (not on the web but in the city) could it have a shot on wikipedia? So how long until this long piece of work gets trashed? I read the articles briefly... so there's not a shot of keeping it? So I should just quit adding?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am the writer of the film <i>Behind Tinted Glasses</i>, and if the best web encyclopedia is what you are looking for, I don't understand why you wouldn't be able to include a wider variety of articles, including some that may not be as well-known as others. The Plastic Swords Team has been preparing to make the film for a great deal of time now, and I think it's even more impressive that we are just 15 and 16 year olds. We did, indeed, gain access to film inside a local high school and filmed for probably over 80 hours, which will all boil down to about an hour long movie. The article was made to inform people about the movie and the struggle to make it. At the moment, we aren't at the point yet where we can make a trailer, because I do want to be finished with the post-production process before I create one. I can tell you that I plan on making a trailer, so if I do so, is there still a shot, like we were told, about recreating the article? Thanks.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Having taken active participation in the creation of this movie, I, of course, have to side against the Wiki Overlords. As you can tell by the previous comments of my fellow film makers, we have put a lot of time and effort into this movie (as well as a lot of money!), a feat that, in my opinion, is multiplied many times over due to our young ages. We are not inherently using this wiki as a form of advertisement (though we admit that some degree of it may come from the article being read). If we were, we would be throwing the link to this wiki all over the place, yelling at the top of our (textual) lungs "Look at us! We have our own Wiki Article!" Obviously, we haven't. It may seem a little ambitious for a bunch for three teenagers, but we really are proud of the effort put into this film and feel that we can take it places instead of shelving it as just a fun summer project. We may not be known, and it is true; any potential fame brought to us in the future is unknown. I suppose that all I really can contribute to this argument is a pseudo-plea for pity. I don't suppose you'd be willing to hold out and wait for the trailer, do you? If so, maybe then you can decide whether or not we're worthy of an article here on WP.</li>

<p>"It is believed that the majority of vanity article creators forget about their vanity articles and do not revisit at all; this is evident in that they rarely defend the article during the deletion debate."</p>
<p>I think we all know by now we are not just "passer-byers" that will post a small snippet of our work and move on hoping that we get discovered by an indie film producer.</p>
<p>"Lack of fame is not the same as vanity."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject; indeed, it can also be vanity if written by a fan, or close relationship."</p>
<p>Isn't this the problem?</p>
<p>"If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them" but then it also says "Lack of fame is not the same as vanity"... So my misunderstanding here is: How could any independent movie company write about themselves if they are not that well known... because it says "lack of fame isn't the same as vanity" and isn't that why were are getting deleted... because of a not known film?</p>
<p><b>Vanity edits: examples</b> I've taken a look at that category and we are not breaking any of those rules simply because we are promoting nothing.</p>
<p>"The most significant problem with vanity articles is that they often discuss subjects that are not well-enough known for there to be multiple editors"</p>
<p>I can name multiple editors, locally, that come upon wiki everyday that know of this film that could and would edit the page. A great deal more than twenty.</p>

<p>I am insulted that you would take the article as a "school day policy"... not by the name but by what I have read. This article was NOT yo create for "new lingo" we could show our fellow classmates at school. We have webhosting, and we weren't planning on using this as webhosting. As a creator of a site I do take band-width into consideration, but this article was not going to be used just "for our own purposes". It just seemed the whole school day policy didn't apply to this situation at all... excuse me if I am wrong.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but I have read every inch of that page and can not find one thing we could get accused for. We are not spam bots, we're not votestacking, I think it's clear by now we are not campaigning, and we are not canvasing.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a></p>
<p>You are correct. I do believe that is what the world needs these days is verification. We do not have Behind Tinted Glasses in an original search, and we do not have Behind Tinted Glasses verified as a movie at all besides the author's words which we are giving you. (if that means anything at all) But doesn't this all go back to "There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia" found <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a></p>
<p>From <a href="../../../s/n/o/Wikipedia%7ESnowball_clause_239c.html" title="Wikipedia:Snowball clause">Wikipedia:Snowball_clause</a></p>
<p>"The policy also states that "[a]ny substantial debate" is a good reason not to close early."</p>
<p>"Allowing a process to continue to its conclusion allows for a more reasoned discourse, ensures that arguments are fully examined, and maintains the appearance of fairness."</p>
<hr />
<p>I really do appreciate all of you moderators who have left this discussion open, and those who have had open ears. I, Nathan, am not here to argue by any means, but just try to understand the rules thouroughly because at this point, the only thing that, I can see, is against us is a not known film. But the rules state the article does not need to have a famous-based article. So having that said, if you could clear up the rules we are specifically breaking, and just allow us this 30k space, it would be so much appreciated since the article has been worked on hard.</p>
<p>So with all the reasons and rules out why we don't want a wiki page (like egos and such), some might be thinking, "Why do they want one?" Without heroic theme music or cheesy catch lines, we belive that people should hear the story of three film makers going through anything and everything to get their film made and <i>I</i> believe that's what people really want to hear these days, a good story. A good, true, story.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Hello Themindset,</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion, but why wouldn't any article on wiki have a website? We are in the process of getting a website at the moment but we feel it is more convenient to host an article on wiki for several reasons as followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is more convenient to link article to article (like we linked REM; we would not like to explain what REM is so we link article-to-article)</li>
<li>Wiki is easy to use (not easy to advertise). We do not want it to advertise, but just be able to utilize all the features that come along with an article such as contents that are made as you make your article</li>
<li>We feel like we deserve a wikipedia article just as much as anyone else does. Why don't we?
<ul>
<li>FYI: We are getting a story in our city Newspaper, The Jackson Sun, (<a href="http://jacksonsun.com/apps/pbcs.dll/frontpage" class="external free" title="http://jacksonsun.com/apps/pbcs.dll/frontpage" rel="nofollow">http://jacksonsun.com/apps/pbcs.dll/frontpage</a>) and the story will be appearing soon in our city Newspaper... couldn't we cite their site as a source?</li>
</ul>

<p>This page only describes (incorrectly, at that) the English transliteration of the Japanese transliteration of the name Ryan. (The correct transliteration of the transliteration is <i>Raian</i>.) A Google Japan search suggests to me that I have misspelled Ryan and has no hits outside of the Middle East. There are a number of hits for Raian, but if this is the standard, we'll soon have a page on the Japanese version of every English name.

<p>Not even the main character, <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramza.html" title="Ramza">Ramza</a>, has his own page. In adition, it's horridly written, with no sources, and some obvious POV.

<li>I would argue that this page needs to be heavily edited but not deleted. I see no problem with a minor character having his own page but much of the material in the article is either made up (based on a complete lack of corraborating information in the game) or the product of what could be termed 'fanboy speculation' rather than serious though. I refer to the 'Virgo stone' idea as an example. The person holding the stone thought it reacted to Alma and it later reacted to her when Izlude was long dead. Since getting the 'right body' was of the utmost importance, if there was any chance that it was reacting to Izlude, Vormav wouldn't have killed him. Anon</li>

<li>I don't think this is so much a good argument for deletion of Izlude Tingel's entry as it is a good argument for new articles about more major characters and other minor characters. It seems like a good enough article to me, and that there aren't equivalent articles about Delita, Ramza, Balbanes, and Dycedarg's older brother. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeltopia_6c33.html" title="User:Deltopia">Deltopia</a> 01:21, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What I find pitiful about these arguments is that you guys are acting as if this site should supply information to your own personal interests and not what others would take interest in. Keep in mind this site does not belong to you. It a free place for "any type of information" as long as it is not harmful, which in this case, it is not. Your arguments are clearly personal attacks quote "Not even the main character" "some people were annoyed that this relatively minor character got a page" and have no grounds for the deletion of this article. I approve of the written article on Izlude Tingel and find it to be very helpful and interesting based on the theories that were posted. I suggest to the wiki crew that this article be left alone. Remember, not a lot of people like the current president of the USA (excluding me) but that doesn't mean you should tear his pages out of the newer encyclopedias. -- gizmo dude 1:59, August 10 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - would this article be better served by turning it into a legal case article about the crime itself? That would cement its validity as an encyclopaedic article. If it's an important ACT case it should be notable. (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 05:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>The crime itself is not particularly notable (people get run down every year), and if that were the issue, it would have never had one to begin with. The issue (and the focus of the media attention) here has been the responsibility of police for the death, and the subsequent inquiry, inquest, calls to change police procedures nationally and ongoing political ramifications stretching on for more than a year, as well as the Walk for a Rose brain injury awareness event, which saw a lot of media attention here. This is why there is only a section of the article dedicated to the actual legal proceedings. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:07, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and Comment</b> My Spanish is pretty good and I was able to read and understand almost all of it.

<p>This is a curious mix of fact and fiction, a testament to the fact that there is nothing so inherently absurd that some crackpot somewhere will not believe it. The only thing is, given that we lead the table of around 100 unique google hits, we appear to be leading the race to tell the world about this ludicrous idea. Exclude Wikipedia and the leading lights include YTMND and the Aryan Nations forums. There being no reliable sources out there, on account of the idea itself being barking mad, scientifically impossible (then and now) and 100% evidence free, this article is inherently original research. Not <i>bad</i> research, in that it documents pretty well the entire absurd conceit, but the linked sources are absolutely not what we would consider reliable.</p>

<li>Zundel's pamphlets and the Heinlein book (cited in the article) are all sources for the existence of Nazi UFO theories.

<li>Zundel's book is self-published; if it's just hijm, this could be a redirect. The Heinlein book is fictional, whereas Zundel claims it's not. It's the mix of fiction and fantasy which is part of the problem for me. The other part is the assertion that it's a notable Internet meme, when there are only around 300 hits, 100 unique. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 21:12, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is ...problematic. There seem to be a few fringe (self-published, we-publish-any-crackpottery presses) books about it. The article should have a lead that says this is a joke by fringe nuts on acid, mix of fiction and more fiction, and no real historians take it seriously in any way. But where do you find a reliable source for that statement...? This is a somewhat recurring problem on Wikipedia: crackpot theories that are so obviously loony that no reliable source even bothers to waste the ink to debunk them. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 13:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the entry qualifies at least under clauses 1, 2, and 6 on WP:SOFTWARE. We've been regularly profiled by our members and independent third parties since we launched and are pretty regularly noted as being innovative and a leader in our space. Moreover, there are several other entries on Wikipedia which detail wiki hosting services which are equally or less qualifying under these criteria than we are.<br />
We didn't create the entry originally although we've edited it from time to time to keep it up to date so I don't think it's advertising or spam. Thanks. Adamfrey 18:29, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hang on a second guys. I'm not saying there should be website specific or company specific entries on Wikipedia. Whatever the Wikipedia community thinks should be the standard is fine by me. That being said, I don't like the idea of the policy being arbitrarily applied to us and not everyone else. I've also updated the entry to show that our "content has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works" although it seems to me this article should be held to <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> rather than <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Adamfrey (<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdamfrey_cba3.html" title="User talk:Adamfrey">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adamfrey_4131.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adamfrey">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry Adamfrey, but this is not a software title. This article is refering to a website that offers a service. It is not covered under WP:Software.

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Response to Adamfrey: Of course, Adam. We hold all articles to the very same standards. If you see an article that should be deleted for the same reasons yours is being considered for deletion, please nominate it (follow the instructions at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>). <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b>Srose</b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 16:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So I'd much rather not have to go and start nominating these entries for deletion myself since they are services that compete with ours. Since I'm biased I imagine that wouldn't be the best approach. What do you recommend? Also, would another alternative be to change the Wikispaces article so that it's not so much a description of the service (i.e. remove the pricing, feature list, etc.) and just have a short entry that describes what it is and perhaps some notable uses and mentions?

<dd>I dispute the above. The article has only one link to the site itself, with more links to competitors and external resources. That is not link spam. The original text around Alexa ratings clearly said the article was not in the top 10000 sites on Alexa: that's true and not a misrepresentation.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Saying something is not in the top 10000 when the rating is also not in the top 100000 is a misrepresentation. However, this is offtopic for the AFD.

<li><b>Comment</b> You are mistaken. Criterion 2 says <i>"listed on ranking indices of important companies"</i>. That means lists like the Fortune 500.

<p>Question: the CarGurus site displays content about many cars which have had Haynes manuals written about them. Note 7 of WP::CORP specifically mentions this as an example of a notable product.

<p>This is a tough one. For the first time I'm nominating a page that I'm not certain should be deleted. The majority of the content in the article deserves to be removed as unverified and possibly original research, and the article as a whole fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> for reasons discussed at length in the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Talk%7EAl-Hama_7dfc.html" title="Talk:Al-Hama">talk page</a> for the article. Over a week ago I tagged the article with {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_verified_a8cc.html" title="Template:Not verified">not verified</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}, but nobody has edited the article since. I could simply remove the POV material, but that would leave an article too brief even for a stub ("Al-Hama is a town in Syria", pretty much) and even <i>that</i> has proved difficult to verify. I would welcome discussion from the community on the appropriate fate for this page. For now, my inclination is <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 19:19, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Considering the fact that Much More Music and it's affiliate Much More Retro play at least a Spoons video daily, and not to mention with the rising interest in 80s music, this guy is well deserving of a page on Wikipedia. Also, tonight, I heard Tell No Lies on the radio and then again at a restaurant, where everyone I was with knew the song, as well as others around us. I especially feel this article should stay because if I know the Spoons music this well, surely most other Canadians would too, seeing as I was born in 1987 and their biggest period of success was prior to that!</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see no reason to censor this information form the public. User:OsgoodeLawyer has made it a point to delete from the Tenders page the section refering to the unatural practice of governments to award multi-million dollar public contracts without tenders and I am working with him to edit that page which will make it distinct from this one. All that is required to distinguish the two pages is show the difference between Tenders as a generic term and Public Tenders which is more specific to governmental activities of noteriety.Wiki <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkred; font-weight:bold">BADASS</span> Woo 2U 23:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If we got a penny every time someone throws tantrums about "censorship" on AfD... With respect to the process being the same, though, I can't agree (see also below). From a business point of view, sure, but as a matter of law it's quite different: Tenders by governments are not only governed by contract law (i.e. civil law, here in the old world), but also by the public law that regulates such aspects of the government procurement procedure as tendering threshold values and exceptions, non-discrimination and transparency rules, possibilities of judicial review etc. All of this affects the procedure of tendering a great deal. So this is a article on public law waiting to be written, not one on commercial usages. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b> The comments the two you make in favour of censorship and watering down anything concrete about municipal government activities is appaling. It is not comming from good faith but some agenda you share with keeping people from knowing facts and details of govermnent activities in Ontario Canada most particularly. From your edits I know that you know as much as I do in many cases but are here to distract my work and to intefer with expansion of public knowledge. I am calling is censorship because you want to keep plainly written material that anyone can understand about these things off and keep adding a POV designed to mislead and confuse readers. I could just as easily call it vandalism. Only its a vandalism with the purpose of censorship and distracting a knowledgeable editor from addding interesting and important public information.Wiki <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkred; font-weight:bold">BADASS</span> Woo 2U 00:18, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can't see any content overlap at this moment. More importantly, though, as a jurist professionally involved in government procurement (or public tendering, if one prefers that term) I can attest that as a matter of law and practice it is substantially different from private tendering, at least in countries party to the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement. As such, it deserves its own article, as a merge would probably lead to inapt generalisations with regard to both types of tendering. The article needs a lot of work, though. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 16:19, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wouldn't recommend that, as Public Procurement redirects to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procurement.html" title="Procurement">Procurement</a>, which is again a very generic subject matter. We do ought to have an article on the specifics of procurement by the government, though, and I recommend moving the article at issue to Government procurement, which is unambiguous and appears to be an internationally accepted way to refer to this subject matter - at least insofar as the <a href="../../../w/t/o/WTO_1c1a.html" title="WTO">WTO</a> <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gproc_e.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gproc_e.htm" rel="nofollow">uses it for its work</a>. The previous AfD consensus, incidentally, appears to be that the <i>subject</i> is notable but that the <i>term</i> then used was unverifiable, and that the content ought to be merged because it was just a dicdef. That sort of consensus doesn't preclude recreation as an actual (although not yet very good) article, I would think.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Fame (success) is not a determiner of Wikipedia notability.

<dd>True enough that success alone doesn't determine notability. However, simply by being a film about a famous person, a film does not become notable either. Particularly not when the <i>only</i> indication that it exists that anyone's been able to find are 50% from here and MySpace. The reason that my rationale was based on "when the film is released and successful" was because that a release and some kind of independent commentary (a review, even a review saying that it was bad and that everyone walked out) is going to make it notable. Even a release could achieve that same effect. It's not a case of <i>verifiability</i> but one of <i>notability</i>. It's verifiable that I've got a film in mind about all sorts of things, but until one of them gets released it's not going to be here. If Moore's latest film doesn't appear to satisfy the notability requirements, put it up for deletion - the fact that its entry exists isn't necessarily proof that it's notable, and it certainly isn't proof of any partisan bias. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 05:00, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>:The same could be said about Moore's upcoming "Fahrenheit 9/11 1/2" movie. I have left plenty of ways to verify the accuracy of the article and the film at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:6_Degrees_from_Truth" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:6_Degrees_from_Truth" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:6_Degrees_from_Truth</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If the 6 Degrees from Truth entry is deleted, so should the article about "Fahrenheit 9/11 1/2". At this point, the reality of that movie is just hearsay. However I can, at this point in time, provide anyone with a finished copy of 6 Degrees from Truth: Michael Moore...the same can't besaid for either of Moore's upcoming films.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I've said before, if the issue is that *I* wrote the article, there wouldn't be a problem getting a third-party to either verify or rewrite the entry. I just don't believe in hiring/enslaving someone to do something that I can do myself. All of the words I used in the entry are in my view, "neutral." There are no "whiz-bang" public relations words used to describe the film.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only reason we are having this discussion is because my wallet is not as deep as Moore's and I don't have the connections to Hollywood/the media like he has. But if Wikipedia wants to knock this little man down, by all means. After all, it's their website and their servers. When the film is released, I would like an apology though if this article is deleted. --Adamreuter 21:50, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> (Full disclosure: I'm a die-hard, bleeding-heart liberal, but I also really dislike Michael Moore; since he's so pompous and self-serving, I've never even tried to watch any of his films except for <a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit_9_11_5431.html" title="Fahrenheit 9/11">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Bacon_784a.html" title="Canadian Bacon">Canadian Bacon</a>, both of which I love.) This film is non-notable, and the article is an advertisement. "6 Degrees from Truth", appropriately, gets a grand total of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%226+degrees+from+truth%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%226+degrees+from+truth%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">6 unique Google hits</a>, and of the 6, 2 are WP and 1 is MySpace. The film might deal with a somewhat controversial topic, but it's an unreleased film with no distribution deal created by a (Wikipedically) unimportant filmmaker violating <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enot.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wp:not">WP is not a soapbox</a>. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:24, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b>: Crystal ball argument: It is verifiable that this documentary will be released. I have offered to send a copy of the film to anyone who requests it. And I also have reliable third-party sources who can verify the existence of this film...as per Wikipedia's rules.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>What difference does it make whether the article is published before or after a film's release? If the announcement of my film would appear in "Variety" magazine tomorrow, all that is is a relaying of information. Apparently that's sufficient enough for a WP article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A lot of films are announced before they're even shot...and then they are canceled. Yet those films are allowed on Wikipedia. This documentary is "in the can" and will be released shortly. What's the point of deleting an article that will be reposted once the film is released to the public? I have yet to be taken up on my offer of an "at-cost" DVD by anyone who objects to this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as using Wikipedia as a promotional tool...how? This article is not linked from any other WP article...albeit it was at one time. I myself have not linked to it from my own website. You could use the promotional argument for just about any film that has been released or will be released. By the same logic, every single film that hasn't been released yet should be deleted from Wikipedia! Again, the only difference between the announcement of my film and others is that my pockets aren't deep. If they were, I'd buy big advertisements in all major newspapers tomorrow! Then it would "notable", right?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now if this film were a narrative (fictional in nature), you could argue that it's not notable. However, it discusses a very controversial filmmaker (who is controversial for the revisionist history, distortions, half-truths, etc. he puts in his films/books, not his concrete [i.e. verifiable/factual] points of view) who continues to have a career in filmmaking. And for that matter, the public's ear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Soapbox argument: According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not</a> , "self-promotion" is allowed as long as a neutral point of view is maintained. I feel that I have kept a neutral point of view. I will re-word the article if specific objections are made. As it stands, the article discusses what is contained in the film and what the series stands for.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Notability argument: Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11 are two of the highest grossing documentary films of all time. My film aims to show the audience scenes from the films IN CONTEXT and then address discrepencies in those scenes. The film is the first feature-length documentary to be released about Moore that will be made entirely free to the public. It is a large resource (4 hours of audio/visual content and text) of information about Michael Moore.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As soon as the newspaper article is ran, 6 Degrees from Truth: Michael Moore will be listed on IMDB. That will meet one of the criterion for verifiability. The article has not been released yet due to space considerations. This is beyond my and the journalist who wrote the article's control. If anyone wants to verify this, I can provide a phone number/email address for the newspaper. I will not, however, post it in this public forum.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At this point, I believe any further argument from myself is futile. I am clearly outnumbered and majority rule in this case will probably win. --Adamreuter 03:15, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I disagree. The article focuses on a historical overview of how the units were designed over the course of a popular series including eight games. I have never played these games, and it's unlikely I ever will, since they probably won't be translated into English - however, I found this very interesting and notable since the <i><a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance_Wars_7388.html" title="Advance Wars">Advance Wars</a></i> games did make it out of Japan. I'm sure there are many others, not only just fans of the Nintendo <i>Wars</i> series, but those who have a interest in strategy game design who would find this type of article encyclopedic. There was some more POV material in the article before, but I've tried to remove anything that sounds like an original speculative opinion. As for the Units in Advance Wars AfD, that article had considerably more unencyclopedic material in it, and I supported the transwiki and merge of that article. However, the rationale for deleting that article doesn't apply here. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 22:05, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - All the information here seems pretty trivial. How does it increase someone's knowledge of the subject knowing that (for example), that the train gun has a "fierce firing range" or that the small aircraft carrier holds three units instead of four? This article is <i>many</i> times larger than the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Wars_55a1.html" title="Nintendo Wars">Nintendo Wars</a> article. All of the important general information should be there, instead of hundreds of little unit details in a separate article. Also, there really aren't any reliable secondary sources on the subject of "Units in Nintendo Wars" anyway aside from game guides. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 23:41, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This will never be anything but a game guide or original research. There aren't any sources other than the games themselves for the "evolution" of the units in the game, so there's going to be a lot of original research going on comparing one game's units to another's.

<li><b>Keep:</b> per SevereTireDamage. Also, note that this isn't a game guide. You have to read closely but it's pretty apparent that it's a history of how unit capabilities changed across the entire series. With the exception of a few sentences that anyone here can easily remove, there is no "do this, do that for TEH WIN!" Therefore, not a game guide. I agree that some of the information is not of interest but this article can be pruned. I see no rationale for its full deletion. Lastly, failing to cite sources is not grounds for deletion.

<li><b>keep</b> - Thorough and well-written article. Not a game guide, because it does not tell you how to play the game. Not original research, because the article need only cite the games themselves as primary sources. This is no different from an article about any work of fiction or other artifact.

If it is missing references for verifiable but unsourced statements (like a large number of Wikipedia articles are), fix those or add a tag. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 15:37, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think it's a wider issue than just admins involved, as contemporary values mean in a play-off between minor rock stars or minor cartoon characters and minor artists, the latter can't compete to the same PR standards, although they hold an equivalent place of repute in their own field. The new edition of the reference work <i>Artists in Britain since 1945</i> will be published in the Autumn with 14,500 entries, so if wikipedia wishes to compete with that, there's going to have to be a bit of a cultural rethink on what makes artists worthy of inclusion. Let's not give admins a hard time over one decision, when they've doubtless done hundreds of unnoticed, unthanked, worthwhile tasks. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 07:55, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

Imho, this would have been a simple case of 'sorry, my mistake, thanks for fixing'.

<li>My point is that the book was being used as a reference, but nothing in the article said that he illustrated it. I am not denying that illustrators can meet notability guidelines.

<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable band. From the article's entry (copied from the MySpace link in the page): "Zombeast signed to Horror High Records to release their as of yet untilted debut album to be released in the Fall of 2006."

<dd>You have to do and advanced search under Dane County, then type "636 Langdon" under the address. That will bring up the record, showing that it's part of the Langdon Historic District in downtown Madison. More importantly, while I agree W.P. is not a directory, nor is Phoenix Coop just a building with 26 people living in it- it is a community. Nottingham Coop's article wasn't much more developed than this one when it was started in February, and now it is fully developed, showing its place and value in Madison. A previous 2004 Nottingham article was started and deleted- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Nottingham_co-op-" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Nottingham_co-op-" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Nottingham_co-op-</a> Nottingham's entry arguably lost a year or two of potential development in that.

<dd>Yes, not a directory, not the white pages... if you don't want to believe Phoenix is a historic building, fine- it is, there's a plaque outside the building that proves it, but I won't go out of my way here.

<li>Do not delete this page. Phoenix has played a notable role in Madison Co-op house history, but the article stub needs time for this to be entered. There are simply not enoiugh housing co-os in the world to say that any one of them is non-notable, and Phoenix has, in fact, survived not one but a few crises that reflect on the history of madison co-ops as a whole (again, give this time to be typed in. It will be. I will have to stand in line to get my bit in, if anything). Also, as far as madison campus life goes, this is the most immediately viisble co-op of them all--the otehrs hug the lake, along the tangled mess of streets that exist in that place--not invisible, but not daily sites like 636 langdon either--and the Co-ops that are not along lake Mendota are generally along less-travveled thoughourfars and are not buildings that stand out teh same way)--which touches on one valuable thing that Wikipedia does in the long run--it is npossible, at times, to undserstand how notbale things in a town appear or are known to people who are really in that town. I haven't even touched on the subject of notable alumni... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Clown in black and yellow (<a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClown_in_black_and_yellow_dd0f.html" title="User talk:Clown in black and yellow">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Clown_in_black_and_yellow_3473.html" title="Special:Contributions/Clown in black and yellow">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>I recommend that this page be deleted and the material, minus the silly, unsubstantiated "starvation" rumors, merged back into <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garfield.html" title="Garfield">Garfield</a>. These strips do not merit a standalone page, and the rumors and "theories" which, for all we know, originated on Wikipedia, need to be purged. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderbunny_ebbf.html" title="User:Thunderbunny">Thunderbunny</a> 00:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Keep: Although the starvation rumors are unsubstanciated and seem to have already been removed, the story deserves its own entry because of the controversy it has caused among fans.

<li>I disagree with the request to delete this page. There is nothing 'silly' about the 'starvation theories' as they are just that; theories.

<ul>
<li>I vote against deletion - either keep the page or merge the content back into the original Garfield article. The dead/starvation theories arise quite convincingly from the Halloween strips themselves. The similarity to the animated short ""Feline Fantasies" is also provocative and Jim Davis' comments about the strips provide an interesting insight that would be lost with deletion. Keep the page.

Though you have nobody's word but my own, if you click on my link in the posting, you'll be directed to my listing on creativehotlist. There, you can see my resume and some of my licensed work. Though this is hardly rock-solid verification, it does give you some reason to believe that I at least work at Hallmark (in the license design department) and there is a possibility that I went to Muncie and met with Jim... which is quite true. He said what he said and I repeated it as accurately as I could. Of course the theories are more fun, so continue to believe what you like. Cabooglio 20:43, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I looked again carefully at the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a>'s Criteria for companies and corporations, and I think that the article is not subject for deletion, even if some wikipedians are averse to articles about companies.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>A company or corporation is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</i></p>
<p>The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</p>
<p>I think the article Printakid respects those criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printakid is the first and biggest company in North America to create personalized books in which illustrations change. This allows the company to make books for groups that are normally less represented in traditional literature (mixed-race children, children with Down's syndrome, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Because of its innovative concept, Printakid (and the French version of the company Alphakid) was featured in many newspapers, including:
<ul>
<li>the Montreal Gazette (first page of the business section on July 13, 2004.)</li>
<li>CyberPresse - La Presse's website - Montreal's largest circulation newspaper. (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:JarutxLpPXYJ:www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20051206/CPARTS/512031072/5256/CPACTUALITES+noemi+berlus&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=14&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:JarutxLpPXYJ:www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20051206/CPARTS/512031072/5256/CPACTUALITES+noemi+berlus&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=14&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">See article</a>)</li>
<li>Canadian Press (that article was reprinted nationally in many newspapers)</li>
<li>the Journal de Montreal (a full page on February 7, 2004)</li>
<li>the Ottawa Sun (on December 10, 2004)</li>
<li>the Montreal Mirror - see the <a href="http://www.montrealmirror.com/2004/120204/giftguide2004.html" class="external text" title="http://www.montrealmirror.com/2004/120204/giftguide2004.html" rel="nofollow">smaller mention</a> at the lettre P, they put on their web site)</li>

<li>The Record - Kitchener</li>
<li>Elle Quebec, Clin d'oeil and other women's magazines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If needed, I could scan and provide proof of many other notable articles.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Again, because of its notable concept, in the last 3 years, Printakid and Alphakid have been featured (not paid publicity) in over 10 Quebecer and Canadian television and radio shows:
<ul>
<li>on TVA Television, six times</li>
<li>on TQS Television, two times</li>
<li>on Global Television</li>
<li>on City TV’s Cityline show, in partnership with Style at home magazine (see <a href="http://www.styleathome.com/styleathome/client/en/HOMEGARDEN/DetailNews.asp?idNews=232880&amp;idSM=176" class="external text" title="http://www.styleathome.com/styleathome/client/en/HOMEGARDEN/DetailNews.asp?idNews=232880&amp;idSM=176" rel="nofollow">smaller mention</a> put on their website)</li>
<li>CKMF radio show</li>
<li>CKOI radio show</li>
<li>Mix 96 Montreal</li>
<li>CBC Radio</li>
<li>940 News (Montreal)</li>
<li>Radio-Canada - the National station</li>
<li>CHFI Toronto Sheila Walsh show</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If needed, I could transfer and provide some Mpegs or mp3s of the actual shows.</p>
<p><br />
In the smaller Quebec market, any book that sells over 3000 copies (in its lifetime) is considered a best-seller (all categories of books included). Half the books of the company have surpassed that number, and the others will in the next six months. I don't imagine that notability, in that area, has to be comparable to Ebay or Amazon.</p>
<p>I am willing to change parts of the article that would seem too much "advertisement" to some wikipedians, because I understand their concerns. However, on the notability criteria, as defined by the actual rules, I see less ground for exclusion. --Vercasso 16:56, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Though libraries are not merely judged on size, their website claims that they are "Midwest's largest LGBT circulating library," which is significant and notable. This library also seems to have historical and cultural significance. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 02:18, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There are four modifying words here "Midwest," "largest," "LGBT," and "circulating." Should we also have an article on Scranton's largest voodoo circulating library? Fiji's largest heavy metal music collection? These aren't siginificant. Of course on their own web site they'll claim they're important; look at the web site of any NGO, church, Masonic lodge, etc. -<a href="../../../k/o/a/User%7EKoavf_1790.html" title="User:Koavf">Justin (koavf)</a>·<a href="../../../k/o/a/User_talk%7EKoavf_18ee.html" title="User talk:Koavf">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Koavf_fde1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Koavf">C</a>·<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Koavf_292b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Koavf">M</a> 02:31, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am sure that if we look long enough we could find a bubble gum wrapper library somewhere. It would not be significant either. But a library that holds materials on a topic that is of critical interest to a sizeable proportion of the population because they are being discriminated against, and to another sizable proportion because they deeply believe in the rightness of the discrimination, and that started gathering such materials when they were still relatively rare and even banned, is anything but marginal or non-notable. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 11:04, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's a subjective judgement, not an evaluation of notability. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. The reason that the hypothetical bubble gum wrapper library will not be notable will be because no-one independent of that library will have published non-trivial works of their own about it. And the reason that this library <i>is</i> notable, is that such people have. The fact that it has been not<i>ed</i> demonstrates that it is not<i>able</i>. The <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary noability criterion</a> doesn't require editors to make subjective judgements of what is important to, or famous within, any particular community. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:27, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I found over 14,000 hits on Google using "Gerber/Hart Library" (with quotations). That seems fairly notable. I don't see the harm in keeping it. Even if it were a non-notable library, I can see tremendous value to having comprehensive information on all the libraries of the world. This is, after all, a project devoted to giving everyone in the world the sum of human knowledge, and that is also the role of libraries. Someone looking for academic resources might find this useful. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 07:06, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Counting Google hits is not research.</i> A search for me by name garners (as of today) 16,000 hits, and <i>I'm not verifiable</i>. Research involves reading the pages that the search tool turns up. Research involves looking for sources.

<li>Really, do you think we are being duped into believing this is a real library? I went to Google to check out what this library was since I knew nothing about it. Every hit I looked at confirmed that it is what that article said it was, and it reinforced the idea that it was a notable library. That is more than enough for me. I am of the opinion that notability is over-sold as a reason to delete articles. I think articles about less-notable topics have to be shown to have <i>no value</i> to the project. So I've stated why I think this is of value. We can make judgements weighing many factors. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 06:52, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, Sorry I wasn't more descriptive in my first post, I tried to explain it in my second. I went to Google and at first did a search and found 171,000 hits. Then I narrowed down the search by using the quotation marks and found over 14,000. Then I looked at <i>and read</i> all the hits on the first few pages that convinced me it was real and notable. It was you who assumed that I only looked at the Library's own website.

<dd>In the spirit of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_angry_mastodons_d8c5.html#Avoid_angry_mastodons" title="Wikipedia:No angry mastodons">avoiding angry mastodons</a>, I apologize if you believe I attacked you personally. That was not my intent. I believed that the article was rushed to nomination for deletion without adequate research into the nomination or the concept of notability of LGBT-themed articles. It was the process of nomination that I was criticising. I mean we have articles such as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convent_Station_%28NJT_station%29_b16a.html" title="Convent Station (NJT station)">Convent Station (NJT station)</a> - random commuter train stop - as well as Kathy Caraway Elementary School with an enrollment of approximately 500 students. What is the differentiating factor that makes this library less notable than these established WP articles? As a library, it is ho-hum, but as a resource of the LGBT community in the Midwest U.S., the library is a big deal. Finally, if you leave a note on an article talk page without response, you may want to prompt the user you want input from with a message on his or her User:Talk page. Because some apparent refusals to respond may be honest ignorance that a discussion is happening in the first place. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 01:01, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> libraries are important cultural markers. I would say it is not the size of the collections per se <i>(&amp; before you slam me, yes I agree that there is a minimum size/circulation below which this doesn't count . . . I don't know what that would be but I'm sure someone can figure it out)</i> but it's importance. Also its availability to and actual use by the community. In this case all three criteria seem to be met.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It is my opinion that with cultural institutions of various sorts there importance <i>(and therefore notability)</i> cannot always be measured by size. I would give the examples of two <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">US</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum.html" title="Museum">museums</a>, the <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabella_Stewart_Gardner_Museum_4432.html" title="Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum">Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</a> in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston MA</a> and the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frick_Collection_9476.html" title="Frick Collection">Frick Collection</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">NYC</a>, both smallish <i>(especially in relation to other cultural institutions located in their respective cities)</i> but important.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would also like to point out that a cultural institution's raison d'être doesn't have to be to the particular taste of every Wikipedian to make it notable. I for instance think a many of the painting in the <a href="../../../m/o/m/MoMA_ec4c.html" title="MoMA">MoMA</a> are idiotic <i>(the ones where the canvases are painted all black using what appears to be a paint roller suitable for painting interior walls for instance)</i>. But this doesn't mean I'm going to put the <a href="../../../m/o/m/MoMA_ec4c.html" title="MoMA">MoMA</a> up for deletion.</dd>
<dd>So I would say that, yes if there was an important circulating library of <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodou.html" title="Vodou">Vodou</a> religious texts &amp; thought in <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scranton%2C_Pennsylvania_1cf0.html" title="Scranton, Pennsylvania">Scranton PA</a> it should be included, <i>(I realize that someone THOUGHT they were making an absurd joke, but <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scranton%2C_Pennsylvania_1cf0.html" title="Scranton, Pennsylvania">Scranton PA</a> is a heavily Catholic college town and in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Hemisphere_4a04.html" title="Western Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a> for historical reasons the <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodou.html" title="Vodou">Vodou</a> religion has developed ties to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>, so QED . . .)</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I must respectfully disagree with your decision to propose the deletion of the Pax warrior article. I do so because I disagree with you labeling it as non-notable. I feel IMHO that it is notable enough to warrant its own page. I say this because the reason I started this article in the first place was that I noticed it in TIME Magazine (8/14/06, pg 20), a highly circulated news magazine. However this is not reason enough, so to further my argument I quote the article in which it states that this program is "incorporated into thousands of curriculums in Canada, Britain, South Africa, and will hit the U.S. this fall." So those students who take the curriculum and the teachers that teach the curriculum all know about Pax warrior. I also would direct you to the PeaceMaker (game) (which is similar to Pax warrior) page, which is very similar to the Pax warrior page and has not been deleted. In closing I would remind you that I am still a bit new to Wikipedia and if this makes no sense to you, then you may ignore it.
