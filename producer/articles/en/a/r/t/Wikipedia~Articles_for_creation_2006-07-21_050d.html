<p>Although plans of building an airport near ConcepciÃ³n date back to 1954, construction began only in 1960, shortly after the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Chilean_Earthquake_2455.html" title="Great Chilean Earthquake">May 22nd earthquake</a>, as it became imperative to count with a modern airport to link Chile's south-central region with the rest of the country. The airport was finally opened to the public on January 3rd 1968. No airline accidents have been recorded in relation with the airport, although bird ingestions during takeoff have ocurred causing rejected takeoffs or emergency returns from departing aircraft. No casualties derived from such bird ingestions have been recorded.</p>

<p>Carriel Sur is not a hub for any airline. Domestic airlines' hubs are located on <a href="../../../s/c/e/SCEL_84dc.html" title="SCEL">Arturo Merino Benitez</a>. Nevertheless, the airport hosts General Aviation traffic from various clubs and flight schools located on the northern sector of the airport. Although no regularly scheduled international traffic is handled at Carriel Sur, there's permanent customs and immigration services available for charters, private flights and those diverted from Santiago.</p>

<p>In 2000, the original terminal building was decomissioned and turned over to the aviation authority for administrative use. A new terminal, operated by AEROSUR S.A., was opened north of the latter allowing the instalation of jetways(4), Customs and Immigration service, a VIP lounge and a duty free store. The old ramp was not decomissioned, thus the amount of parking spaces increased from 5 to 10 (the original 5 plus 4 jetways and one remote parking adjacent to jetway 4)</p>

A Minja is like a ninja, only in a small and compact size. One would think that a Minja would be an adversary that could be dispatched of quite quickly. This thinking is quite false, seeing as Minjas have a distinct advantage over the traditional Ninja. For one, Minjas can sneak about far more easily due to their small size and can infiltrate buildings via the smallest of openings. They also are prominent in fighting with various adversaries since they are such small targets and can move about their opponents legs, confused their adversaries quite terribly. Minjas have the devastating ability to throw ninja stars, jump upon them, and ride them into their target's neck while simultaneously punching them in the neck.</p>
<p>If one should see a Minja approaching them, one should not bother running for their time is almost up. The best thing to do is to curl up into a ball and hope that only ur farthest extremities are damaged and that the death is relatively quick and painless if they do in fact plan on prematurely ending the life of the target. If one should somehow manage to defeat a Minja in hand to hand combat, his or her victory will only be short lives for Minjas tend to assail their victims in packs. Minjas have been deemed so obviously due to the previously existence of the terms "ninja" and "midget." The word "minja" was chosen because "niget" and "migna" are far too ridiculous and difficult to pronounce.</p>

<p>Originally went by the name of Feedback (not the same band as the original U2). They are a ska band that started out in Keyser, WV. Slowly they expanded their following out to Maryland.</p>
<p>In the summer of '97 they started working on their first album using a Fostex digital 8-track recorder. Afterwards they went to a nearby studio to have the tracks mixed professionally.</p>
<p>In September of â97 Feedback changed their name to Distorted Penguins due to the fact that they shared the name with too many other bands including at one time U2. They chose their new name because they thought it was a little bit more original.They also you made a do it yourself label called Distorted Penguins Records so they could put out their demos.</p>
<p>After the release of âAinât Got None Moniesâ in December of 1997, the Distorted Penguins grew as a talented, innovative band, and expanded their fan base into Morgantown, WV, home of the West Virginia Mountaineers. They performed for the University and the WWVU (U92) radio shows, âDPâ gained a strong following of high school and college fans.</p>
<p>DP performed throughout the region over the next few years doing shows in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, trying to get their name out. After breaking into the city of Pittsburgh, PA, DP met and befriended a band called the Buzz Poets. The Poets helped DP tremendously by giving them opening spots at many shows, and by making several guest appearances on their new album.</p>
<p>DP started work on "What Would Your Mother Say" in August of 1999. The studio of choice was Soundscape Studios in McKeesport, PA with engineer Billy Rossi and producer Buddy Hall. The recording of the album was a long process since the majority of the band was starting college and had to drive a few hours each way to get to the studio.</p>
<p>Many months went by and on April 24, 2000 the final vocal tracks were recorded. This completed the recording process for the album. Then, just two days later the heart and soul and lead singer/songwriter of the Distorted Penguins, Magic Dave Mussen, had his life tragically taken from him. The following weeks and months were tough for everyone that had ever come in contact with Dave, especially the band. The future of DP was in jeopardy and no one was sure what should be done. In time however a unanimous decision was made to keep the band together and keep Daveâs music alive.</p>
<p>After a line-up switch and the addition of a few new members the Distorted Penguins were ready to venture back out into the world. It took some time to get used to the tremendous change, but their main goal was to complete their album for Magic Dave. Finances were scarce, so the mixing, mastering, artwork, and duplication process took many months. The 2001 âPittsburgh X-Filesâ CD released by 105.9 âthe Xâ was dedicated to Magic Dave and had DPâs song âCloud Nineâ and Buzz Poetsâ song âAngel Eyes (Song for Dave)â on it. That helped both bands get the message out about how much Dave meant to everyone.</p>
<p>After releasing their album âMagicâ in February of 2001, DP traveled throughout the Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia regions playing anywhere they possibly could. Performing at colleges, bars, clubs, parties, and benefits, a spot on the Vans Warped tour in Pittsburgh, and opening for national acts such as Reel Big Fish, 2 Skinnee Jâs, and Blues Traveler helped elevate the Distorted Penguins and establish them as an exceptional rock band.</p>
<p>In May of 2001, DP started recording a five-track EP in order to get out some of their new material. This also took many months due to lack of money. âWhat Would Your Mother Say?â was released on April 12, 2002 and the band received incredible acclaim for their work. Since then they have extended their reach throughout Ohio, into Eastern Maryland, New Jersey, and parts of the North Eastern United States.</p>
<p>Through radio airplay on multiple national and college radio stations, a featured song on the Pittsburgh X-Files 2001 Compilation CD, and singles included on several episodes of MTVâs âUndressedâ, DP is earning national and international recognition in the D.I.Y. fashion. Fans throughout the United States, Canada, England, France, Russia, Germany, and Australia have proven their love with over 385,000 downloads on mp3.com. DP has contributed their songs to independent movies and video games, as well as special CD compilations to help raise money for the American Red Cross, the Childrenâs Hospital of Boston, teen suicide prevention, domestic violence, and charities that help battered women and children.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2003 the Distorted Penguins did a national tour across the United States hitting 19 states and traveling 8,000+ miles. The tour was set up by the band in order to meet fans who emailed them wanting to see DP in their town. By doing this DP made thousands of new fans, as well as meeting those who have been fans for years. This fall/winter they hope to start the initial phases of recording demos for their new album, which has the potential to be the best album of the millennium. Keep your eyes and ears open and rock out to the sweet, sweet sounds.</p>

Alexander Schmautz is both a popular, and un-popular internet-guru. Alexander has been using the internet, since early 2000, and since then, has become a great programmer, hacker, tutorial writer, system administrator and user support agent. Alexander, also known as Zander, has affected the Virtual Pet Industry, by a great ordeal, by either creating his own websites on the side, helping others with their websites, or hacking other websites, giving the owners of those websites tips on how to fix any issue that possibly let Zander in to the website and/or server.</p>
<p>In his spare time, Zander visits websites such as VirtualPetList.COM, CreatureWorld.NET, Nexopia.COM, EBay.COM, PHP.NET and WebHostingTalk.COM. Zander is like any practical person, he has a life both on the internet, and outside of his bedroom. When he is not online, either chatting, programming, or surfing the internet, he is outside, riding his bike, playing video games, or hanging out with his friends. Zander has created websites such as CeloSupreme, Mystic-Pets, KikoPets, CelosPlanet, DarkCelos Networks, DarkCelos Webhosting, and multiple others, which have been held anonymous.</p>
<p>Zander has gone by multiple nicknames in the past, such as DarkWarrior, DragonSmart, DeathGod, Doomsday, mdragonxwarriorm, Mystikal, CodePhreak, Celosia, Zander, InvisibleBoy, ZMang, and SuperMang. Many know him as a "Script Kiddie", those people have not spoken with him for multiple years, therefor they are not knowledgable about his success.</p>

Born in the north-western suburbs around 35 years ago, Adam grew up in the Strathmore area outside of Essendon and attended Strathmore High School. After enjoying athletics as a child, Adam's career peaked in 2004 when he ran for Australia in the 4x100m relay at the Athens Olympic Games. Since then he has been working as part of the PE staff at Melbourne Grammar School, where he is also an athletics coach. He is known to talk a lot of crap, particularly about how many "roots he cops". His vocabulary is fundamentally colloquial, and his favourite terms are "oi youse" and "youse do a lap". He drives a VN Commodore that would fit in in his home suburb of Essendon, and is very touchy about his mobile phone, as found out by some of his athletes including Ollie Wurm and Tom Kilmister.</p>
<p>Wurm's athletic career, unlke Kilmister's, isn't going anywhere. Allegations of alcohol theft from sports stadiums, doping and of too much box smashing of Elise and Fab have hurt his career, which was nearly saved by former Japanese coach Sho Kimoto. Wurm's relationship with "shoki", as he is commonly known ended sourly when Kimoto accused Wurm of theft of many items from The Southport School boarding house, where Kimoto lived and trained.</p>

<p><br />
On the 26th of the 5th of the year 2006, the Tree Haters or WATT (War Against the Tree's) was created. It originated in Australia. The Tree Haters hate tree's, as you may have guessed. They hate trees because the two leaders were at an educational facility, and they were walking along a path, and they made the claim that one of the trees "looked at them funny", since then, they have been fighting to get rid of the trees and everything that supports them. They have formed a website, and have also recruited members.</p>
<p>They are currently recruiting (as they always are, and always will be) as they wish for more members. The Tree Haters have ranks and points. The way it works is the leaders (Known as Pringle Gods) give you tasks to do, and once you have done one, you are awarded a point. When you accumulate enough points, you will advance in a rank. Eventually you will get to a certain rank, where you cannot use points to get advance to the next rank, and you may only advance, when the leaders think you should. The rank Pringle God may not be obtained by anyone except for the founders of the Tree Haters. Eventually when you get to the last rank available (Pringle Leader) you will be able to assign lower ranks tasks, but you must have permission from the Pringle Gods first.</p>
<p>If you were to join make sure you absolutly do not annoy the Pringle Gods, as they have very strict policies.</p>
<p>This group is thought to be reckless but admirable. Many people have quit, but have come back, wishing to join again, but of course their requests for another membership is declined. This shows you peoples high admiration for the Tree Haters.</p>
<p>On their website it does show some humorous things, which may be showing they are not serious. So if you are an environmentalist, you should not take too much notice of this.</p>
<p>Thier slogan is: Changing the worlds view of tree's, one person at a time. This shows that they are trying to change what people think about tree's, but they at this stage are only able to do it one person at a time. They would love you to join, and it is free, you just have to hate tree's.

<p>Arash Nikou-Sichani, more popularly known as "Nikoo" or "Jologs", is a local icon in the Philippines. Known by most people because of his liberal notions on homosexuality and self-expression, he died of a weird strain of STD at the ripe young age of 18. In his short and pathetic life, he never succeeded in any of the fields he attempted doing; an example of which was his arrest in 2005 for child molestation and sodomy. Even in prison, his homosexual tendencies created anarchy among the inmates, which earned him a space in solitary confinement, and later on in a Mental Ward. Studies have shown that his weird ways may have been caused by early childhood experiences, many of which include accounts of gay molestation, and constant exposure to gay pornography. In a rare interview with Arash Nikou-Sichani, he has been quoted as to saying "Whether or not I am gay is your choice. If you want me to be, I will be. For you I will. I will. I will." The interviewer did not make it out alive.</p>

<p>Wumpa Fruit is a kind of tasty apple-like fruit in the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash_Bandicoot_d186.html" title="Crash Bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> series. In most Crash Bandicoot games, collecting 100 Wumpa would give you an extra life, In Crash Team Racing &amp; Crash Nitro Kart, collecting 10 Wumpa Fruit "juices up" you weapons and increase speed in CNK, but in Crash Bandicoot Purple, Wumpa Fruits are used as currency. There are no actual Wumpa Fruit in Crash Tag Team Racing, but there are Wumpa Whip and Wumpa Coins. Theres is also a CTTR screenshot with a Wumpa Fruit, but it's possible this a hoax.</p>

<p>My Nemesis is a webcomic drawn by Ken Krekeler. It updates erratically, but viewers can usually expect two new comics each week. My Nemesis is an Eyeskream Member.</p>

<p>Ken Krekeler is (or claims to be) an arts student studying at an unnamed university in America. The attached blog continually alternates between clearly fictional and non-fictional work and bemoaning or making light of his money problems, drug use or lack of a love life.</p>

<p>The comic focusses around the exploits of Kal, a narcisstic individual who exhibits antisocial characteristics. Kal appears to be constantly surrounded by black shadows, although it has not yet been made clear if these are an actual part of Kal or merely a costume. The storyline is self-referential&#160;: Kal is responsible for creating a webcomic about his life, presumably the comic being read, which is then snapped up by hollywood executives in the hopes of making it into a movie or an animated series. At the time of writing, Kal has gone on a rampage, killing some of the hollywood executives in an attempt to keep the comic from being used by anybody else.</p>

<p>Kal: The protagonist. Misogynistic, Egocentric, Narcisstic, and somewhat Artistic, Kal is responsible for the creation of Kaltopia, a massive mechanical city in the middle of an ocean, linked to his dingy apartment through use of a teleportation device. Despite this amazing feat of technological brilliance, Kal is still not recognised for his genius and turns his mind to the creation of a webcomic.</p>
<p>Rob: Kal's closest friend. Helped in the construction of Kaltopia and currently the only character who seems to understand Kal's motives and plans. Works as a supply teacher.</p>
<p>Beth: Kal's ex-girlfriend, broke up with him while Kal was busy overseeing the kidnapping of Tim Buckley (of Ctrl-Alt-Del fame).</p>
<p>Gabe: Kal's friend. Ex-army. Roommate to Truman.</p>
<p>Truman: Kal's friend. Stoner. Roommate to Gabe.</p>
<p>Mr. Hollywood: The faceless representative of the Hollywood group that attempts to buy Kal's webcomic. Mr. Hollywood resembles Kal in that we never see him as a normal human, only as a big black shadow.</p>
<p>The Wiseman: An enigmatic man who helps Kal overcome his depression after losing Beth.</p>
<p>Kalbot: After encountering the Wiseman, we see Kal losing his "mask" and taking on the appearance of a normal human being. Later, this is revealed to be a "Kalbot", a robotic double that also functions as a massive explosive. The real Kal can still be found in a big black mask in Kaltopia. It is unclear how many Kalbots have been made, although the original Kalbot was referred to as a prototype, so it may have been a one of a kind.</p>

Dew Point in meteorology is the temperature at which the air must be cooled to at a constant pressure to become saturated. The result of this is dew. Usually a higher dew point means it is less comfortable because the air is filled with more water.</p>

<b>Bold text</b>Biography Shystie is a female MC hailing from London, UK. In 2003 she was signed by major record label, Universal Polydor after she released her response to Dizzee Rascal's track 'I LUV U' and did a successful tour with Basement Jaxx. In 2004 Shystie released her debut album 'Diamond in the Dirt'. She spent much of 2004 travelling around the world promoting her new album and introducing new audiences to grime. In 2005 Shystie began working on her new album 'The Movie- All or Nothing' while simultaneously following a different path to most by starring in her own interactive TV series, Dubplate Drama. Now in 2006 Shystie is back in the studio finishing her forthcoming album and preparing for a new series of Dubplate Drama.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b>Music Shystie is a Grime Mc with a distinctive past paced style of rapping which became faster and faster as she grew older. Shystie used to hang around with a group of boys at sixth form college who would MC at lunch times, so Shystie used to write her own lyrics at home, often staying up until after midnight so that she didn't get left out.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b>Tracks Alongside the tracks from her album shystie has also written or featured on a number of other songs such as 'the battle' with Roc, Frost P and Lady Sovereign and her diss track on Lady Fury 'Murderation'. Most recently Shystie feature on the 'Kick You Out' remix alongside Baby Blue, Nolay and Ms Dynamite.</p>

On September 1st 2006, Bam Bam Slam, the worldâs first nonstop, interactive, online talent contest will hit the streets. Or rather, your computer screens. And with its revolutionary game design and hip, eye-popping graphics, Bam Bam Slam will fast become the newest massive participation web âhang-outâ in todayâs self-promotion era.</p>
<p>If you mix a little social networking (e.g. Myspace) in with a bit of online video sharing (e.g. YouTube), sautÃ©e it in the love of judging othersâ talents (e.g. American Idol) and sprinkle a heaping dash of mula on topâ¦ what do you get? A Bam Bam Slam gourmetâsuitable for all tastes. Not only will video aficionados find delight in being able to submit videos in over 25 different categories, but even musicians and photographers get a chance to prove their goods on their own specially-designed platforms. Essentially, Bam Bam Slam has enough fodder to satisfy any kind of artistic hunger. And did we already mention the Benjamins? Unlike so many other talent contests, your chances of actually winning real money that you can put in your pocket are beyond phenomenal, all due to a unique, patent-pending judging method. How this self-regulating site works: You play four players at a time, and you (the contestants) get to judge who wins. After advancing several levels and beating a total of only 24 other players, you win 100 times your entrance fee (in some games, the fee is as low as 1 buck!). If that wasnât easy enough, Bam Bam Slam gives you three chances to do all that, per game!</p>
<p>Because Bam Bam Slam is an international creative community, players can remain on the forefront of whatâs new and exciting in all creative facets, including animation, graphic design, fashion, hip-hop, graffiti art, and even become acquainted with what day-to-day life is like, all around the world. Fun, potentially lucrative, and educational? What more could you want from an internet game? So this summer, start taping, recording, and shooting away in preparation for the biggest talent SLAM to grace the planet. Also, visit www.bambamslam.com where you can enter your e-mail address to find out more about the game and to be reminded of the September 1st launch.</p>
<p>This fall, get ready to slam.</p>

<p>"To improve life here" and "To understand and protect our home planet," NASA supports research in the Earth Sciences and launches and maintains Earth observing satellites to monitor the state of the climate, atmospheric chemistry, ocean and land ecosystems. It was a NASA scientist, Dr. James Hansen, who first alerted the world to the dangers of global warming due to greenhouse gases emitted by human burning of fossil fuels. Earth Science research also provides the foundations of understanding for the search for life on other worlds through the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI), in which the focus is often on the extreme conditions for life to survive.</p>

<p>I am a cerebral narcissist.My name is kingsley Morris. I brandish my brainpower, exhibit my intellectual achievements, bask in the attention given to my mind and its products. I hate my body and neglect it. It is a nuisance, a burden, a derided appendix, an inconvenience, a punishment. Needless to add that I rarely have sex (often years apart). I masturbate regularly, very mechanically, as one would change water in an aquarium. I stay away from women because I perceive them to be ruthless predators who are out to consume me and mine.</p>
<p>I have had quite a few major life crises. I got divorced, lost millions a few times, did time in one of the worst prisons in the world, fled countries as a political refugee, was threatened, harassed and stalked by powerful people and groups. I have been devalued, betrayed, denigrated and insulted.</p>
<p>Invariably, following every life crisis, the somatic narcissist in me took over. I became a lascivious lecher. When this happened, I had a few relationships - replete with abundant and addictive sex - going simultaneously. I participated in and initiated group sex and mass orgies. I exercised, lost weight and honed my body into an irresistible proposition.</p>
<p>This outburst of unrestrained, primordial lust waned in a few months and I settled back into my cerebral ways. No sex, no women, no body.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>These total reversals of character stun my mates. My girlfriends and spouse found it impossible to digest this eerie transformation from the gregarious, darkly handsome, well-built and sexually insatiable person that swept them off their feet - to the bodiless, bookwormish hermit with not an inkling of interest in either sex or other carnal pleasures.</p>

GatorBall is a sports game that is derived from soccer. It is played on a field or "pitch" with soccer goals and with a soccer ball. Other objects may be used as a goal such as trash cans, barrels or even trees. The gameplay is identical to soccer for the most part, the biggest difference is the ability to use your hands on the ball in certain situations and locations on the court. Simply put, if someone (be it a teammate or opponent) kicks or heads the ball up in the air you can catch it provided it has not bounced. YOu can not kick the ball up to yourself. Once you have the ball in your hands, you can pass it to others and even throw it in the goal - provided you are outside the goalie box. The goalie box is designated as a "no hands" area for anyone other than the goalie. Thows made on the goal need to be from outside of the box. Scoring can be done by throwing the ball in the goal, or in traditional soccer methods (kicking, heading, etc.) If a player is tagged while they are holding the ball play is stopped and the ball is turned over to the other team. If a player touches the ball with their hands while inside the goalie box it is either a penalty kick on goal (if a defender touched it) or a goal kick (if an offensive player touched it).</p>

<p>The Fourcault Process is a process for <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manufacturing.html" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> sheet glass, invented by the Belgian engineer Emile Fourcault in 1905 and used in commercial glass production for the first time in 1914. In particular, sheet glass is drawn directly from the tank. A slotted block made of refractory material (the debiteuse or "debi") is pushed down into the molten glass. As the hot extruded glass rises through the slot it is grasped by the iron "bait". Surface tension and viscosity lead the glass to follow the bait as it is drawn up between rollers. As it rises, the glass cools rapidly, anneals and is broken at the top of the machine by automatic cutters. The drawing machines can be of various sizes to give different widths of glass. Thicknesses of between 1 mm and 6 mm can be obtained by varying the drawing speed: the slower the draw, the thicker the glass.</p>

The Stork-Enamine reaction involves the addition of an enamine to an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl acceptor in a process similar to the Michael reaction. This product is then hydrolyzed by aqueous acid to produce a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound. The process: (1) formation of an enamine from a ketone (2) addition of the enamine to and alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone (3) hydrloysis of the enamine back to a ketone</p>

<p><b>Summary</b> Famed football (soccer) striker for Liverpool in EA Sports' FIFA 2006. Trevordinho Eichbinho, wearing the number 15 for the Reds, has destroyed all competition as team captain and striker alongside greats like Fernando Morientes and Steven Gerrard. After starting his career with Liverpool, Eichbinho moved around European clubs such as AC Roma, Lazio, and spent some of his time playing for the US National Team. After 1 world title, and 3 league cups in 2 different countries, Eichbinho returned to his roots and continued his career in Liverpool.</p>
<p><b>Tricks</b> Eichbinho is best known for his unstoppable chip shot, which generally fools the keeper as he charges the ball and then watches it go right over his head and drop into the goal.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-21_050d.html" title="Edit section: What is QChat?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What is QChat?</span></h3>
<p>QChat is an interactive push-to-talk (PTT) product designed for 3G wireless devices and networks, and offers sub-1-second call set-up performance and bandwidth savings in comparison with other push-to-talk approaches on CDMA. The QChat technology is designed to interoperate with other SIP based technologies, but utilize a proprietary protocol called "QSP" to optimize its performance over wireless networks. The QChat client allows the ad hoc creation of group calls and leverages QUALCOMMâs BREWÂ® solution, offering dynamic, over-the-air upgrades and the ability to leverage other wireless data services such as messaging and multimedia.<br />
<br />
QChat is a PTT application platform for fast data call-setup services. In more technical terms, QChat is a Voice-over-IP BREWÂ® application that enables rapid one-to-one and one-to many half-duplex communication. QChat currently runs on any CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Revision A network. QChat is more signaling-efficient than standard SIP alternatives and, in many cases, involves no more than half the bandwidth cost. QUALCOMM has put over 500 engineering years into the QSP technology behind QChat.</p>

<p>QChat gives operators who offer BREW-enabled services the opportunity to leverage their investment. QChat enables operators to offer PTT services to subscribers under their data services umbrella while benefiting from the ability to provide simultaneous two-way communications and data usage in a single package. QChat can also support JAVA apps via a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). And with the BREW platform, it is possible for application developers to create new services and capabilities.</p>

<p>QChat supports predefined (or "closed") group calls, ad hoc group calls, and chat rooms. Those are just a few of many features that make up QChat: QChatâs fast call setup and delivery ensure rapid communication when itâs needed most. QChat also provides floor control to keep communication effective and ensure that users do not talk over one another. In addition, QChat gives users the ability to create personalized ad hoc group PTT sessions right away on their handset. QChat allows priority level setup so that higher-priority talkers can pre-empt others â and gives users the ability to access upgrades or downloads over-the-air (OTA).</p>

<p>According to reports, Branch left Jackson, Mississippi, was hijacked by pirates on his way to Cuba, and released at Anahuac, Texas. He lived in Liberty, Texas and taught until the spring of 1836. He served in Texas' revolutionary army and served as first sergeant of William Logan's company and as first lieutenant under Benjamin Franklin Hardin. Later Branch was elected representative to the Texas Congress, appointed judge of the Fifth Judicial District, and elected to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Branch practiced law in Liberty County and was a Mason. He married Annie Cleveland Wharton, the adopted daughter of William Harris Wharton, who also fought for Texas independence. Branch died on September 24, 1861, and is buried in a family cemetery in Liberty.</p>

My Nemesis is a webcomic drawn by Ken Krekeler. It updates erratically, but viewers can usually expect two new comics each week. My Nemesis is notable for its original art styles, its small but rabid fanbase and the quality of the author's art.</p>

<p>Ken Krekeler is (or claims to be) an arts student studying at an unnamed university in America. The attached blog continually alternates between clearly fictional and non-fictional work and bemoaning or making light of his money problems, drug use or lack of a love life.</p>

<p>The comic focusses around the exploits of Kal, a narcisstic individual who exhibits antisocial characteristics. Kal appears to be constantly surrounded by black shadows, although it has not yet been made clear if these are an actual part of Kal or merely a costume. The storyline is self-referential, although it never breaks the fourth wall.</p>
<p>Kal is responsible for creating a webcomic about his life, presumably the comic being read, which is then snapped up by hollywood executives in the hopes of making it into a movie or an animated series. At the time of writing, Kal has gone on a rampage, killing some of the hollywood executives in an attempt to keep the comic from being used by anybody else.</p>
<p>Artistically, My Nemesis is much darker than other comics and its humour tends to avoid the gags used by other mainstream webcomics. It makes use of splash pages that highlight Krekeler's control of aesthetics. <a href="http://blackwaverising.com/MN%202005%2010%2026.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://blackwaverising.com/MN%202005%2010%2026.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>

<b>Kalbot</b>: After encountering the Wiseman, we see Kal losing his "mask" and taking on the appearance of a normal human being. Later, this is revealed to be a "Kalbot", a robotic double that also functions as a massive explosive. The real Kal can still be found in a big black mask in Kaltopia. It is unclear how many Kalbots have been made, although the original Kalbot was referred to as a prototype, so it may have been a one of a kind.</p>

Orthus was known as one of the fiercest watch-dogs in history. This canine (in most legends) had the body of a humongous black wolf with two heads and a serpent for a tail, while in some it had the body of a rottweiler. His name comes from the Greek word 'orthos' which translates to 'straight.' He was the son of the medusa Echidna and and the horse-headed monster Typhon. He was the brother of some of the most famous mythological creatures such as the three-headed hellhound Cerberus, the Nemean Lion, the Hydra, the Chimaera, the hundred-headed dragon Ladon, the Sphinx, and the giant eagle Ethon. In some legends, his origional owner was the god Atlas, who was forced to carry the Earth on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Orthus guarded the beautiful red cattle of the monster Geryon on the island of Erythia. But, for one of his twelve labors, Hercules was sent to round up the cattle and bring them to the city of Tiryns. Unfortunately for the dog, when he sought out Hercules after he set foot on the land, he was killed by a single swing of the Hero's spiked club. Some legands also state that when Orthus was killed, he rose into the sky and became the brightest star, which we now know as Sirius, the dog star. Most of Orthus's siblings were also killed by Hercules.</p>

"Good Adam was, originally, Adam from Conn, a whiny queer from New England. It's believed he was molested repeatedly by his HS wrestling coach. A few years ago he transitioned from whiny jock-wannabe into even whinier, sensitive Emo guy. He threatened suicide over something trivial, left the UG and returned as "Good Adam." Under this moniker he uses MMA.tv as his own personal blog, starting threads about the horrible music he listens to (e.g., Coldplay), the WB shows he watches, and posts constant updates about his boring personal life.</p>
<p>After attending college for a few years, he's now a full-blown pseudo-intellectual. He, much like Voodoo Chile before him, goes to the OG to feel smart, as that's the only place he can readily engage in discourse with people stupider than himself. He likes boasting about his intellect and quoting Latin phrases (incorrectly) that he doesn't understand. NewGuest Registered Member</p>
<p>Date: 2006-07-18 01:15:07 I was going to answer but the above response is pretty comprehensive.</p>
<p>A few months ago Adam made a despairing post that his brother ("Anj") had become a loser-dropout and was going to join the Army. He was acting like it was the end of the world.</p>
<p>kmart Registered Member</p>
<p>Date: 2006-07-18 07:53:22 He is a fag.</p>
<p>Voodoo Chile was good for some intelligent arguments, especially in the field of science. Adam knows absolutely nothing - he writes fucking poetry and, like Bradu, I wish he'd off himself already. Fred Registered Member</p>
<p>Date: 2006-07-18 13:12:38 Lol, at Voodoo Chile. I forgot about him. He was one of those guys who would say, "You're not in a position to debate me because you don't have my educational background". squatdog Registered Member</p>
<p>Date: 2006-07-18 13:14:40 He actually attempted suicide and spent time in the hospital. His idiotic brother kept the OG updated. It was laughable.</p>
<p>I'd like to see him give it a go again."</p>
