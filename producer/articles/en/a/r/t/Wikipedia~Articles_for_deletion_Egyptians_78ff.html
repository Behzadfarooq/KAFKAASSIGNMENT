<p>article is a history not a surveys of people. other users ignores talks consensus to delete and create new article, refuse to debates issue in talk pages only to revert the page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Delete. Article is not people survey but a general history. Merge with history article, and rewrite a new article called Egyptian People based on <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_people.html" title="Dutch people">Dutch people</a> or <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedes.html" title="Swedes">Swedes</a> articles]]==</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know if this was discussed before, but the history section is extremely long, I don't really wanna see it gone, but I guess a page about an ethnic group should contain a bit more than history. As EgyEgy said in the ratings page, we need more about culture here. I can write some, but I have no structure, so I'll need someone to administer how this is gonna go. How are we gonna expand the culture section? Cuisine? Arts definitely could use some expansion. Habits and traditions, as in what? As in family life or as in what? I hope my point is getting across. We need a bunch of stubs that we can fill in, someone needs to see the big picture though, and I suck at that. Anyone get what I am saying because it's late here and I think I'm incoherent. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarkaron_a04e.html" title="User:Karkaron">Karkaron</a> 02:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC) <small>This signed comment was actually added by Nardelli (<a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENardelli_660d.html" title="User talk:Nardelli">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nardelli_29a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nardelli">contribs</a>), not Karkaron —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 03:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>You are not incoherent. I totally agree- this is a history article, not an article on the Egyptian people. It has several flaws:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The demographics section is mostly about Egyptian immigration to other countries, not nuts and bolts demographics, like birth and fertility rates, health, age structure etc, etc..</li>
<li>The History section is totally overweighted and overwhelms the whole article. Compare to other articles like <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_people.html" title="Dutch people">Dutch people</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedes.html" title="Swedes">Swedes</a> and you see a much shorter History section, and more on the people themselves. The History section dominates about 80% of this article. What exactly is the focus?</li>
<li>Within the history section itself, there is too much detail. I mean, do we really need to know about the god Hapy? Is it burningly urgent to know that Council of Chalcedon convened in AD 451? we really need to know that Solar worship was embodied in the cults of Ra and Atum? What exactly does this have to do with the people as a whole? Again, compare to other similar Wikipedia articles and you can see this article is totally skewed. How did it receive an "A" rating on an objective basis?</li>
<li>The article also has some questionable statements, like "Modern Egyptian history is generally believed to begin with the French expedition in Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798." Is this really so? Why does modern history begin because the French appeared? It would be more accurate to say that the French or European impact greatly lessened Egypt's insulation under the sultanates. And what about the reforms of Muhammad Ali? Are they an afterthought?</li>
<li>Key information is missing on culture as stated above. What is the detail for example on why the Egyptians do not always view themselves as Arabs? What can be said about the "Egyptian national character"? What are some outstanding features of Egyptian culture etc. etc? If you look at the Dutch and Swedish pages, they have such a section and are not totally overwhelmed with historical detail. A lot of that should move to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Egypt_24d7.html" title="History of Egypt">History of Egypt</a> article.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article needs a complete rewrite, and I think it can be done like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cut the History section by at least 90%. It should just be a summary type thing or sketch with a link to the main article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Egypt_24d7.html" title="History of Egypt">History of Egypt</a> A lot of websites so something similar in about 60 lines.</li>
<li>Expand a Culture section to tell us who are really the Egyptians. For the rewrite, I recommend you look at other similar articles and then work up an outline- cusisine, music, arts etc etc and go from there.</li>
<li>Include a "National character/How others see the Egyptians" section, like the Dutch and Swedish articles. This is very important for the Egyptians since historically they saw themselves as unique and even today do not simply consider themselves just another set of Arabs. They are a distinctive people, and that issue needs to be explored fully.</li>
<li>Also to be considered for inclusion is at least some brief discussion on relations with other peoples surrounding Egypt like Israel. This is also important for the Egyptians have put their own distinctive stamp on that issue. The 1973 Crossing Operation for example is generally regarded with respect by most non-Egyptian military analysts, see Herzog's Arab-Israeli Wars history for example, more so than the uneven performance by many Arab armies. This is only one example of course, but in this and many other ways, the Egyptians have made their mark. This needs to be brought out on a page like this. Obscure details about the 451 Council of Chalcedon or ancient solar calendars belong elsewhere.Nardelli 05:49, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Consensuses: Delete areticle and rewrite totally like Dutch People or Swedes articles. Moved duplicate history section to its own article called Historical perspectives on the Egyptian people. now focus can be on egyptian people not history. Nardelli 02:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Incredibly speedy keep</b> The article is well-written and referenced over 100 times. If the nominator has a problem with the content of the article, he should bring it up on the article's talk page (which he has barely done, judging from Nardelli's contribution history). AfD is not the place for this discussion. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:24, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Also, the nominator's page split referenced above was speedily deleted as a misguided fork. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:26, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>, improve the article via its talk page, and stop trying to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV fork</a>--<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve <sub>(Slf67)</sub></a> <a href="../../../s/l/f/User_talk%7ESlf67_bed3.html" title="User talk:Slf67"><sup>talk</sup></a> 02:31, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
