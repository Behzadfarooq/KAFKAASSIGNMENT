<li><b>Weak keep (maybe to change to "strong keep" later?)</b> This proposition is much weaker than the fundamental theorem of algebra. You don't need the fundamental theorem of algebra to prove it. So even if it is a corollary to that theorem, it silly to regard that as being an important fact about it. To say "Since when do corollaries merit articles on there own?" is also silly; that depends very much on context. <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra.html" title="Fundamental theorem of algebra">Fundamental theorem of algebra</a> is not the right place to merge it into if it is to be merged. Really, the comments above are silly, silly, silly, silly. If you believe, just because this article says so, that the main thing to be said about it is that it's a corollary of a theorem not needed to prove <b>this</b> much simpler theorem, then you are gullible and I can offer you a really great deal on some real estate in Florida. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:34, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I've deleted the silly comment that this theorem is a corollary of the fundamental theorem of algebra. The fact that the proof given in the article does not rely on the fundamental theorem of algebra makes that comment even sillier. But would any of the above commentators explain to me how this simple can be regarded as a corollary of the fundamental theorem of algebra? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:39, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Merge</s></b> into <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_conjugate.html" title="Complex conjugate">complex conjugate</a>. Hmm, on further thought just <b>redirect</b>, as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_conjugate.html" title="Complex conjugate">complex conjugate</a> already does tell what needs to be told in as many words as it needs. Michael Hardy is right that this cannot reasonably be described as a corollary of the fundamental theorem <small>(I would strengthen that to denying that the fundamental theorem of algebra even <i>implies</i> it any more than the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadratic_reciprocity_theorem.html" title="Quadratic reciprocity theorem">quadratic reciprocity theorem</a> implies 2+2=4, namely in the trivial sense that any two true statements imply each other)</small>. However, I'm unconvinced that this theorem merits an article in itself. Is there anything encyclopedic to say about it other than to state it? I wouldn't consider <i>proving</i> it encyclopedic. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 00:42, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. This page may be small, but it states a frequently used fact that deserves to stand on its own. The fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that every polynomial in <b>C</b>[<i>x</i>] has a root in <b>C</b>. The theorem under discussion does not assert the <i>existence</i> of a root, but merely the fact that any complex root of a real polynomial, <i>if</i> it exists, is accompanied by its complex conjugate as (another) root. As a corollary, it asserts that a real polynomial of odd degree has a real root, perhaps because the complex roots occur in pairs. Without checking the reference I do not know how it is proved there, but it is common to use the fundamental theorem of algebra to show that a polynomial of degree <i>n</i> has <i>n</i> roots; still, that dependency may be non-essential. It is true that the brief <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_conjugate.html" title="Complex conjugate">complex conjugate</a> article devotes one sentence to this theorem, but if I were to cite this theorem I predict my readers would find a devoted article more helpful. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 02:05, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I've been looking at a lot of <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">random articles</a> lately, and I find that most are brief mentions of topics verging on trivia. On reflection, I see no problem with that. This mathematics article covers an extremely important practical fact, far more worthy of attention than most of the random topics.

<li><b>Keep, possible rename</b> The page expands a lot more on the theorem than <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_conjugate.html" title="Complex conjugate">complex conjugate</a> does. What we really need is a source to find out what the theorem is called (if anything). (Looking for a source, I found <a href="http://www.uwm.edu/~ericskey/TANOTES/Algebra/node15.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uwm.edu/~ericskey/TANOTES/Algebra/node15.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which demonstrates that the theorem is real, but doesn't give it a name; I suspect most maths textbooks (all obvious sources for this) will do the same.) --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 11:46, 30 January 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> as a section into <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_conjugate.html" title="Complex conjugate">complex conjugate</a>. This result is an important aspect of algebra and is probably taught in every basic course on complex numbers. However, I've not seen a textbook give it a name, probably because the result is almost always proven (in basic complex number courses at least) as a corollary of the Fundamental theorem (and corollaries are rarely named). Inasmuch as there no name to give to this thing, but nonetheless the information must be preserved, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_conjugate.html" title="Complex conjugate">complex conjugate</a> seems the best place to put it. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 14:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Here the claim that this result is a corollary of the fundamental theorem of algebra surfaces again. How on earth would you even <i>use</i> the fundamental theorem of algebra to prove this? Note that the result as stated in the article say that the roots pair up <i>as counted with with multiplicity</i>, simply that the <i>set</i> of roots is symmetric around the real axis. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 15:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. In the future, this page could maybe be renamed into <a href="../../../p/r/o/Properties_of_polynomial_roots.html" title="Properties of polynomial roots">Properties of polynomial roots</a>. (This would solve the <i>google test</i> and the somewhat clumsy name. See above comment by ais523.) In addition to the complex conjugate property, such a page could also disucss: 1) how roots depend continuously but not differentiably on the coefficients, 2) bounds on the roots in terms of the coefficients. There are probably many other properties of polynomials that merit a discussion. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseldon_d9bc.html" title="User:Haseldon">Haseldon</a> 18:55, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Withdraw nom.</b> Michael Hardy is right, this is not a corollary of the FTA. I was frankly a bit surprised to see the assertion that it was, and I was a bit too willing to trust that assertion. The problem is that I'm not a good enough mathematician to be able to say that just because <i>I</i> can't see how it's a corollary, it isn't. Also, I grabbed the nearest algebra text (which was a high-school level text) and checked, and found this theorem listed, unnamed, as a corollary of the FTA, but without a satisfactory proof. These are the factors that influenced that statement, but clearly calling it a "corollary" is silly. The article has, in any case, been much improved by Michael Hardy and others, and sources have been provided which (presumably) verify that the name is in widespread use, which was what I was getting at with the Google hits test. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:10, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
