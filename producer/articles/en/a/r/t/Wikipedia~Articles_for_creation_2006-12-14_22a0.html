<p>The Mercy University Hospital (MUH) is a large teaching hospital of UCC in Cork city Ireland.</p>
<p>The second largest hospital in Cork, MUH is a 354-bed acute general hospital providing in-patient, day-patient, out-patient services and accident and emergency services.</p>
<p>Located in the city centre, MUH is one of two Voluntary Hospitals in the city. Currently, the hospital employs approximately 1,500 staff. Annually treated are approximately 24,000 inpatients and day patients, 28,000 outpatients and 24,000 emergency patients treated. The number of patients treated by the Mercy University Hospital has risen substantially in the last decade and will continue to do so as new facilities are brought on stream.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b></p>
<p>The oldest part of the Mercy University Hospital dates from 1764-1767, originally functioning as the Mansion House for the Mayor of Cork. It later became an educational establishment before becoming the Mercy Hospital on 17th March 1857 when the Sisters of Mercy established a hospital for the sick and poor of the city.</p>
<p>The hospital began as a 40-bed hospital staffed by four Sisters but in the intervening years it has expanded rapidly both in terms of facilities and accommodation. In the last decade, the Mercy University Hospital has undergone very significant capital development, spending over €19,050,000 on relocating its public wards into a new building and the further development of various specialities within the hospital, including a 50-bed acute psychiatric unit and new pathology and clinical pharmacology units.</p>
<p>The hospital participates in the medical undergraduate training programme that runs in association with the National University of Ireland (UCC). The Cork Voluntary Hospitals School of Nursing is based at the Mercy University Hospital and participates in the Registration Diploma Programme in General Nursing in association with University College Cork.</p>

<p>Since the 1970's, subjects of unknown origin have stocked the bookshelves of bookstores, libraries, retailers and other notewrorthy merchants, sold at moderate to reasonable prices and emulated by persons of all sources to where drastic lifestyles changes werer made, especially in terms of a "time warp." For some persons in the mainstream, the literature is mere nonsense, remiscient of science fiction and fantasy but without the magic nor the science deplicted in popular ltierature. For the persons who purchased the books, on the other hand, praised the works to be like that of L. Ron Hubbard or Baba Ram Dass, authors with mixed reputations. The fanfare had so much reputation that publishers decided to coin a phrase or term so as to categorize these works of fiction, and the best term they could devise was "new age," after the Latin word for the Celtic religion of Galicia, which is <i>Marin</i>. Such a term also sparked controversy, since the works of these "new age" authors contradicted both the Zodian literature and the <u>high fantasy</u> noted among J.R.R. Tolkien and Sinclair Lewis, both into whom defended their religious beliefs before the literary movement hereof.</p>
<p>The <u>new age</u> literary movement of the 1970's and 1980's also gave rise to the so-called <u>neopagan</u> movement of literature, along with the <u>Wiccan</u> counterculture and mock devotions of <b>Scientology</b>, <b>Eckankar</b> and <b>Celtic Christianity</b>, just to name a few. All of the <u>New Age</u> literature that are "condemned" are found to be non-Zodian, as certain themes of Islam, Judaism and Zen Buddhism were prevalent. Such literature was also found to be of the imagination, as a recent poll on religious movmements found no objective resources to define or distinguish the entity form all other social groups. Aspects of fantasy and science fiction were found in <u>new age</u> literature, including <b>pseudologisms</b>, <b>nonexistient place and time</b>, <b>supernatural powers</b> and so on. The difference between this literary genre and that of science fiction and fantasy is that the elements of both subgenres are <i>superimposed</i> and <i>integrated</i> while "new age" literature utilizes abstractions of religious beliefs and modern spirituality.</p>
<p>Although the Latin term for "new age" would also fall under <b>noetic</b>, many literary fanatics feel it should be sold under religion or philosophy since they wish to remain anonymous, mostly in fear of being condemned by their loved ones. The sequence of "new age" literature is similar to self-help or support groups into which the matter is simply of trust and fellowship. Simply put, the greater majority of religious faith would currently feel that the "new age" movement should be categorized and placed where it belongs -- in the literary genre of <u>science fiction and fantasy.</u></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-14_22a0.html" title="Edit section: George Ward">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">George Ward</span></h2>
<p>George Ward (18?? - 1918) served as the district attorney during Herkimer County, New York's notoriouis Chester Gillette trial of 1906, the basis for several significant historical works. The most famous of these were Theodore Dreiser's 1925 novel "An American Tragedy" and the 1951 film adaptation "A Place in the Sun" starring Elizabeth Taylor, Montgomery Clift, and Raymond Burr as George Ward.</p>
<p>The murder trial focused on a socially-ambitious shirt factory foreman, Chester, attempting to raise his class standing in Cortland society at a time when class was a major determinant to a person’s career. When Chester's secret, factory girlfriend Grace Brown became pregnant, he took her to Big Moose lake in the Adirondacks rather than marry her. Grace’s body was found in the lake a few days later. As District Attorney, George Ward more than prosecuted the case; he did detective work, manipulated the media, and otherwise controlled Chester’s legal prospects up to his 1908 execution at Auburn State Prison. With no murder weapon and no witnesses other than the alleged perpetrator, Ward litigated a completely circumstantial trial, based more on a series of letters between Chester and Grace than forensics. Interested observers question whether a prosecuting attorney, these days, could win such a case. District Attorney Ward began the prosecution's case by bringing to light all the circumstantial evidence and posing several damning questions: Why was Chester using aliases on that particular journey? Where was the tennis raquet he was seen to have at Big Moose Lake, but was gone by the time he arrived in Inlet? If he had witnessed a tragic accidental death of someone he cared for, why had he been so affable in the days leading up to his arrest? Had he purposely rowed to a particularly uninhabited part of Big Moose Lake to increase the chances of having no witnesses to Grace's premeditated murder? If so, Ward said, the defendant was mistaken, and Ward promised to bring an actual witness to the crime later in the trial. This bit of information began a swarm of conjecture in the newspapers and waves of excitement among the courtroom's observers. Ward presented witnesses that could attest to every phase of the July journey. The coroner testified about his post-mortem examination of Grace's body and stated that she had drowned or died from blows to her head and face. Ward's anticipated witness to the crime, however, was anti-climactic, as he called to the stand a woman who claimed to have heard what she thought was a scream from the lake sometime on the evening of the 11th.</p>
<p>The original letters, as well as dozens of related documents and historical materials, were donated by George Ward's great-grandson to nearby Hamilton College in Clinton, New York.</p>
<p>During World War I, Ward travelled throughout New York State speaking at War Bond rallies, and served on the Wick's Commission investigating dairy farm abuses. George Ward died suddenly in 1918 from Spanish Influenza, contracted during a visit to New York City. He was in his mid-40's.</p>

<p>The demo is not an official product. It is not fully activated and is still under development. The YouTube video of Pleo is 5:31 min. In the video Caleb Chung demonstrates on what you can do with Pleo. The video is an appetizer to let Pleo fans taste the product.

<p>Although the prototype Pleo is still underdevelopment the real product will allow Pleo to fully explore autonomously. The real Pleo will also have a USB port and an upgradeable SD Card. While <i><a href="../../../o/f/f/Officials.html" title="Officials">officials</a></i> say Pleo will be released on Christmas Eve this year (2006) they may not be finished with it but they may finish the Pleo project in March 2007. So then what would you want, a Semi-Finished Pleo on Christmas Eve or a better and finished one in March?</p>

<b>Behavioral event interviewing (BEI)</b> is a psychology based standardized method of interviewing designed to measure how someone will perform on the job. The principle behind the technique is the belief that the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior. This article also defines ‘the STAR’ model and BEI preparation techniques.<br />
IT Professionals are highly analytical and are often hamstrung in interviews by a negative evaluation of their personal (not technical) skills. This article is the accumulation of many years of experience and quantifiable observation of IT people’s interview success rates when adhering to a simple set of rules. The source of information is from a company that began IT contracting in Australia. As these rules are constructed from professional client managers (non-commissioned) they are not tainted by a sales imperative. The rules are presented to assist the whole IT community (globally) by removing communication issues which helps IT professionals and business and the communities those businesses serve.<br />
<br />
<b>The Traditional Interview</b><br />
In this type of interview, the interviewer will run through the applicant's resume using open-ended questions to gain more information. Many of the questions a job applicant will be asked can be anticipated in their own mind beforehand.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Eg. • Tell me more about your last job? • Why did you leave your last job? • Why are you interested in this job?<br />
<br />
<b>Behavioral Event Interviewing (BEI)</b><br />
<br /></p>
<p>During a behavioral event interview, a person will be asked a series of standardized questions designed to get them to talk about how they handled or responded to certain situations in the past. With each answer, they will be expected to describe situations from your past and your feelings and observations about them. The interviewer will use this information to assess their proficiency in one or more job-related areas, which may include anything from adaptability to leadership to problem solving.<br />
<br />
BEI questions may be 'dropped' into a 'chatty interview' or may be formally asked from a set list. Interviewers typically have several follow up questions and probe for details that explore all aspects of a given situation or experience. What are the questions like?<br />
Behavioral questions usually begin with a statement like: 'Tell me about a time when...' or 'Can you a describe a situation where...'.<br />
<br />
The following are some examples of typical behavioral questions and the competencies they demonstrate:<br />
• Describe a difficult problem that you tried to solve. How did you identify the problem? How did you go about trying to solve it? (Demonstrates problem solving)<br />
• Describe a time when you tried to persuade another person to do something that they were not very willing to do. (Demonstrates leadership)<br />
• Describe a time when you decided on your own that something needed to be done, and you took on the task to get it done. (Demonstrates initiative)<br />
<br />
Failure usually results from a simple lack of Preparation. The rules are:<br />
<br />
1. Be familiar with the job. Read the advertisement or job description to identify which personal attributes/ behaviors are likely to be key success factors for the role. It is advisable to research the company's website and any external information about them from business directories etc.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Make a note of two or three examples for each personal attribute that will best illustrate your suitability. Different companies and industries may require different personal attributes, even for the same position. For example, 'self-managing' can mean very different things to different companies.<br />
2. Be able to draw from a variety of experiences that demonstrate your skills and abilities. A good story can also combine work experience with a non-work experience (shows you can use the skill in a variety of settings). Examples may be from your work experience, your personal life or some social or other situation. Be as open, expressive and succinct as possible about each experience.<br />
3. Let others help you out - use examples of quotes from bosses or customers, i.e., "My boss gave me a good performance review, they liked the way I stepped in to get the job done without being told to." This demonstrates your willingness to accept contribution, your flexibility and teamwork skills.<br />
4. Think 'STAR' - Situation or Task, Action and Result. There are several variations of this acronym in the recruiting industry, but all of them are intended to provide structure and focus to your answers. When asked about a type of situation, the interviewer is looking at how you responded to it by via a specific example. Using the STAR model you would break your answer into the three segments of; description of the task, the action you took, and the finally the measurable result. This makes it easier for the interviewer to visualize and record your specific behavioral responses to specific events and so gain the best impression of your potential future performance.<br />
5. Use recent examples. As you will be probed for detail around the situation, it is better to use events in the last 12-18 months as the detail will be clearer in your mind. Be specific as possible about your contribution and the quantitative results achieved. Specific absolute or relative (%) gains in areas such as cost or time savings will give you the interviewer a clearer picture of your abilities.<br />
6. Practice telling your stories until they are vivid and concise, one to three minutes long. An interview can be likened to a marketing activity, where you are the brand. You will only get an interview because your resume and past roles suggest that you have the appropriate technical skills set (your attributes). Often what separates you from the other candidates at the interview stage is the interviewer's belief in how you will fit into the company's culture and specific IT team (your personal benefits).<br />
<br />
It is vital for the IT professional to understand that they are selling their technical AND personal skills. Being able to communicate their adaptability and relatedness at an interview is essential to becoming the leading candidate. This 'story telling practice' is an important preparation tool to assist them in creating a natural flow to your stories so that the interviewer can focus on your potential benefit to the client.<br /></p>

Having created IT contracting in Australia in 1974 and still being a major player in Melb IT, this company has worked hard at defining quantifiable testing methods. These methods are so reliable that the company backs candidates with a double fee refund if an IT person does not fit over the first three months. This company has reference backing of one of the top four banks in Australia.<br />
Thus the distillation of the BEI and STAR methods have become proven methods that people can use in interview situations.</p>

Zuri Lawrence is a professional heavyweight boxer born on June 22, 2006 in Poughkeepsie, New York, USA. He stands 6'4" (193 cm) and has a typical fight night weight of between 230 and 240 pounds. His professional record stands at 20 wins (19 by unanimous decision, 1 by disqualification), 11 loses (6 by unanimous decision, 4 by technical knockout, 1 by knockout) and 4 draws with 1 no contest (as of December 13, 2006).[1]</p>
<p>Lawrence has never broken the glass ceiling and fought for a major heavyweight title (WBC, WBA, IBF or WBO) but he is an important test for many up and coming prospects, a victory over Lawrence often signifies their graduation to true contender status and belt shots soon follow. Notable losses include a technical knockout loss in 11 (after being down 4 times[2]) to Russian prospect Sultan Ibragimov and being brutally rendered unconscious by Calvin "the Boxing Banker" Brock[3]. Notable wins include upsetting the comeback trail of Jameel McCline after McCline's second heavyweight title loss and being the first to expose highly touted Italian Olympic medallist[4] and prospect Paolo Vidoz.</p>
<p>Lawrence is a quick and skilled boxer who is rarely stopped and can give 12 rounds of technical boxing; this combined with his seeming lack of the ability to knock an opponent out (0 knockouts in 36 fights) makes Lawrence a popular opponent amongst matchmakers looking to get some notice for their prospects. Prior to their fight Calvin Brock gave an example of this thinking in an interview with Tiger Boxing: “Zuri Lawrence? Sure. He’s good, but he doesn’t have any power, so I wouldn’t call it a high-risk fight."[5]</p>

<p>Tibbetibaba (Tibbotibaba or Tibetan Baba) is one of the few saints in India whose life was an amalgamation of the path followed by Lord Buddha and the Advaita Vedanta path of Hinduism. He was born on 18th November which corresponded to 2nd Agrahayana of Bengali calendar of the year of His birth. He left his home when he was a teenager in search of the Person who has made this world. He first attained Savikalpa Samadhi (knowledge of Brahman or God with attributes) making his favorite organism, which was a lamb, as his object of meditation. Next he attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi (knowledge of Brahman or God who is infinite and without attributes) with the help of a Mahayana Buddhist monk in a cave near Mansarovar Lake of Tibet.</p>
<p>Tibbetibaba traveled far and wide spanning the length and breadth of India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Burma, enjoying the indescribable beauty of the Nirguna Brahman who manifests all beings of this world. Like his ideal Lord Buddha he alleviated the sufferings of distressed organisms. He followed Lord Buddha’s path of love, non-violence and compassion for all living beings, enjoying the presence of Brahman in all beings at the same time. Such was his love for Lord Buddha that he used to keep an idol of Lord Buddha beside him whenever he went to sleep.</p>
<p>He is among the very few saints in India who have made their soul to permanently enter into another human body. In Hinduism it is held that birth and death is like changing one’s cloth. Birth occurs when a soul enters a new body. When the soul discards the body the incident is called death. When after wandering for many years, He found that his body has grown weak He decided to enter his soul into the body of a Tibetan Buddhist monk whose soul had just permanently left its body. The image or photograph or painting or idol of Tibbetibaba that is visible to everyone today is that of body of the Tibetan Buddhist monk.</p>
<p>Some of the minute specks of His infinite greatness, which is a part of the supreme Lord of this universe, were in his ability of selflessly alleviating pain of others by using the unique medicines prepared by him and his divine ability of resurrecting the dead.</p>
<p>Some of his teachings:</p>
<p>1) There is an element of goodness in badness and badness in goodness (Comment: No thing or event in this world is perfectly good or perfectly bad).</p>
<p>2) You must not consider yourself as body or mind as you are the supreme soul or God (Comment: This view is Advaita Vedantic view).</p>
<p>3) The path of song and the path of knowledge is the path of Godhood.</p>
<p>Some of His disciples and bhaktas:</p>

<p>Hu Haifeng is the son of Chinese President Hu Jintao. Hu haifeng is President of Nuctech, a government company created in the late 1990s to make large scanners for shipping and trucking containers and railway cars - it accounts for 90% of the domestic market. In December 2006, Nuctech won the contract to supply China's airports with security scanners that identify dangerous liquids, a concern that grew following the August 2006 Britain-originated plot to blow up aircraft in mid-air.</p>

<p>Zuzu Angel Jones, known as Zuzu Angel, (June 5, 1921- April 14, 1976) was a Brazilian fashion designer.</p>
<p>When she was a child, she moved to Belo Horizonte, later living in Bahia. Bahian culture and colors significantly influenced the style of Zuzu's creations. In 1947, she went to live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's cultural capital.</p>
<p>In the 1950s Zuzu began her work as a seamstress, usually making clothing for close relatives. At the start of the 70s, she opened up a store in Ipanema, at the same time beginning to exhibit her fashion down American runways. In her fashion expositions, she always harnessed the joy and richness of the colors of Brazilian culture, making a name for herself in the fashion world of her time.</p>
<p>A pioneer in Brazilian fashion, she found success with her style the world over, principally in the United States. In the 70s, her radical son Stuart, activist against the military regime, was taken prisoner and killed during the "Depenências do DOI-CODI." From then on, Zuzu would enter into a war against the dictatorship for the recuperatino of her son's body, even involving the United States, native country of her ex-husband, Stuart's father. This battle only ended with Zuzu's assassination in 1976 by members of the military regine; Zuzu's assassins staged an automobile accident in Rio de Janeiro, in the tunnel that now bears her name. Stuart's body was never found. Zuzu is also mother of journalist Hildegard Angel.</p>
<p>In homage to Zuzu Angel, Chico Buarque, brazilian composer and singer, wrote the song "Angélica."</p>

<p>Brian Willsher was born in London 1930. He is a sculptor, mainly in wood. Early examples of his work were exhibited at the Royal Academy summer show in 1968. He came to wide public attention through a scandal when the tax authorities denied his work was sculpture and such eminent people as Sir Henry Moore and Sir Herbert Read came to his defence. They hailed his work and the government was denounced in a campaign in the Guardian newspaper. He subsequently sold his work in such places as Covent Garden market and these days sells work via his website.</p>

She Could Be King (also seen as <i>shecouldbeking</i> as the band prefers) is an indie/noise/rock band from Wayne, New Jersey. Formed originally c. 2003-4, and consisting of many different members, the full and final line-up did not come to complete fruition until December 2005. The line-up of the band is now Jeff Beck, Brian Burdzy, Rob Conners, Dan Gosnell, Forrest Looker, and Mike Shapira.</p>

<p>The current line-up of shecouldbeking came to be in December 2005, when vocalist Brian Burdzy was welcomed into the band after roughly a month of auditions in November of the same year. After hearing from a friend of both Brian, and the band, that shecouldbeking was looking for a singer, Brian wrote lyrics to two of the songs that were posted in the band's myspace. Those songs would become, <i>Love Is A Mexican Standoff</i> and <i>Horse Latitudes</i>. The band then gave Brian 4 more songs to write lyrics to for the next audition, three were written, those three would become, <i>Ex Machine In The Robotic Garden Of Eden</i>, <i>Salve-Regina Peaceful Fight Song</i>, and <i>Go Back To Jersey Sonny, This Is The City Of Angels, And You Haven't Got Any Wings</i>. The band was satisfied with Brian's lyrics and melodies, his enthusiasm, and his commitment. Brian himself said, "Finally a band that I am in where the people want to work together and achieve the same goal", commenting on the break-up of his prior project, Screams From The Burn Unit.</p>
<p>The band practiced relentlessly following the induction of Brian. They worked hard together to perfect the old songs, and write new ones. "The dedication of Rob and Dan to sit down, duke out new material, and then the rest of us to help put the pieces together, is what made it all go by so seemingly quick" says Brian. The band played thier first show as thier new line-up in the Basement of Forrest's house at school, in New Brunswick New Jersey on New Years Eve. They displayed both new and old material, with obviously, new lyrical content and a new live aesthetic. "Our band functions well in that small setting" said Forrest Looker. Primarily, the band views its major selling point as its extremely energetic live show, in which they themselves get injured, there are ridiculous dances on the part of Dan Gosnell, they all, at one point or another sing/scream/yell, and, at certain venues, things got broken, including thier own equipment.</p>
<p>The band played locally and quite some distance at times, while writing new songs for thier debut EP. In the meantime, the band recorded low quality basement demoes to sell at shows and post for free on thier myspace and pure volume accounts.</p>
<p>The band was very networked within the tri-state music scene, and got on some very favorable shows, the biggest to date was an Excess DB production of Folly's record release show, for thier 2006 album, Resist Convienience. The band got on the show at the insistance of Folly bassis Arben Colaku, who had been a long time friend of Burdzy's, and had played on shows with Screams From THe Burn Unit and Rob Conner's old band, Arcaanum. Though, the band was out of place on the bill, alongside hardcore acts like Fake Your Death, Anterabae, and Folly (not to mention Paulson and The Forecast), the response was seemingly optimistic.</p>
<p>Two days later, the band would sign a record contract with a small label called Refugee Records, to release an EP. At the time, the songs for the EP were written and ready to be recorded</p>
<p>The signing was followed by a mini tour, that the band dubbed <i>The Don't Wake Daddy Tour</i>, only a few days later, playing in North Carolina, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Following a series of both local, and out of state performances, the headed into Clearcut Studio in Garfield, New Jersey, with George Collazo at the helm to produce thier Deput Ep, entitled beforehand, as Petrograd. The band took much lnger in the studio then they, and the label had intended, but the end result was a 6 song EP. Only one of the songs on the EP was not written collectively, and that one was <i>Love Is A Mexican Stand-Off</i>. The single for the release was the second Track entitled <i>Tyranny of the Cute</i>, which contains a guest vocal appearance by Sleeping Revolt singer, Chris Ricci.</p>
<p>The EP can be classified as wierdly unclassify-able, being that none of the songs really sound the same. They all contain elements of pop-punk, indie, noise, and emo. The lyrical theme of the EP is that of the cohesion of all parts of "self" to embrace unfulfilled realm of possibilities and death without the sense of actually living. Each song, represents a different part of the human personality, and though they are conflicting, they all come together to die in the EP's final track <i>Rest In Peace All Dinosaurs</i>. The reason for the "death of all things in this case", Burdzy says "Is the lack of cohesion within the individual, and thus projected on the collective" The band chose to use the 1917 October Revolution in Russia to represent this notion, and the title was to be Petrograd, being that the population of that city, would represent the many different dimensions of the human personality. The artwork has a early 20th century look, as it is a package with Russian stamps on the cover, and feudal Russian imagery on the inside.</p>
<p>The effort was released on July 4th, 2006 and on July 7th the band headed out on the road for <i>Blood, Sweat, And Rhetouric</i>. 17 days to play all over the east coast, going up as far as Rochester, and as South as Miami with Maryland act, Count Your Blessings.</p>
<p>The band came home from tour and resumed playing locally with such NJ acts as Tokyo Rose, and again with The Forecast</p>

<p>Following the tour, the band began writing new songs for a full length. In that time, parts of shecouldbeking's Petrograd Ep were remixed, and given back to the band. No concrete plans have been made as to what to do with the release, although it is loosely being called "Petrograd at Gunpoint". Plans to lay vocals over the work are still up in the air.</p>
<p>In October 2006, the band went into the studio again, with producer George Collazo and former My Chemical Romance Drummer Matt Pelissier to record two songs. The band recorded one of the older tracks, <i>Ex Machine In The Robotic Garden Of Eden</i> and a new song entitled, <i>Halley's 5th Concierto (The Gladiator Industry)</i>. The recordings have not been introduced to the public, but according to the blogs on the Band's myspace, will be posted when they are finished.</p>
<p>According to shecouldbeking, the lyrics and philosophy for the upcoming full length are complete, and 3 of the songs that will most likely be included in the release have been performed for quite some time, those songs being <i>Halley's 5th Concierto (The Gladiator Industry)</i>, <i>Clarence And Alabama Go To Cancun</i>, and <i>The Guns Go Bangladesh</i>. The newer material that is currently being performed by the band is much more noisy and less catchy. "I think the music is more textured now, like a living wall of sound" says Burdzy.</p>

<p>The Flannigan Rifles are the precision military <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drill_team.html" title="Drill team">drill team</a> of Marmion Academy (formerly Marmion Military Academy) in Aurora, IL. The team was assembled under the direction of Technical Sergeant Earl K. Buchan in September of 1947, with the team first performing on December 10th, 1948. The team which at that time known only as "Marmion Military Academy's Drill Platoon" was broadcast on WGN television in September of 1950, while performing at the Chicago Armory under the command of Cadet Lieutenant Richard Murphy.</p>
<p>In 1977, Marmion Military Academy's drill team was officially renamed the "Flannigan Rifles." Brothers Gerald F. Flannigan and Robert W. Flannigan were both students of Marmion. Gerald F. Flannigan had been killed during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, his brother Robert, passed away shortly before the <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veteran%27s_Day_531a.html" title="Veteran's Day">Veteran's Day</a> ceremony held at Marmion in 1975. Marmion's drill team renamed itself to honor these two brother's and the sacrifice Gerald had made during the Second World War.</p>
<p>In 1995, the Exhibition Team of the Flannigan Rifles had all but disbanded after several poor peformances and lack of leadership. Cadet Major Stefan Benning and Team Coach Sergeant First Class Robert Fortune, re-introduced the Exhibition Team on March 12, 1995 during Marmion's annual Military Night. The team began to perform competively again the following year under the leadership of Cadet Major Peter Schmidt and Cadet 1st Lieutenant Quentin Park.</p>
<p>In 1996, Sergeant Major John N. Gissel, USA (Ret.) took over as coach of the team. His leadership, guidance and devotion to the team inspired the Flannigan Rifles to win its first "Commanders Cup" at the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s_Northwestern_Military_Academy_3d0e.html" title="St. John's Northwestern Military Academy">St. John's Northwestern Military Academy</a> Drill Meet for being the top overall team at the meet.</p>
<p>The team continued to excel under the leadership of Cadet Major Austin Dempsey and Cadet Captain Chad Krause in 1997 where the team repeated as champions at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s_Northwestern_Military_Academy_3d0e.html" title="St. John's Northwestern Military Academy">St. John's Northwestern Military Academy</a>, as well as placed 2nd overall at <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purdue_University_4925.html" title="Purdue University">Purdue University</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeoville_High_School_7b36.html" title="Romeoville High School">Romeoville High School</a>, and 3rd overall at Concordia High School.</p>
<p>Sergeant Major Gissel has continued to mold the Flannigan Rifles into the championship team they are today, coaching his teams to an unprecedented 22 of 25 regional drill competition "Commander's Cup" Trophies from 2001-2006 and placing 4th overall at the 2006 National Drill Team Championships at Daytona Beach, FL, which includes a 7th place national finish for Cadet Doctor's solo exhibition and a 7th place national finish for Cadets Basile and Harvey's Dual Exhibition performance. The Flannigan Rifles placed 10th in Inspection, 10th in Infantry Drill Regulation, 10th in Color Guard, 7th in Exhibition Squad and 4th in Exhibition Platoon.</p>
<p>The 2007 team is led by Team Commander, Andrew Brown and Team Executive Officer Evan Williams.</p>

<p>Mohammad Currim Chagla(30 September 1900-9 February 1981) was a renowned Indian justice and government minister. Chagla was born to a prosperous Muslim merchant family in India. His mother died in 1905, and Chagla therefore had a lonely childhood. In 1906 or 1907, Chagla entered the Antonio D'Silva High School in Bombay, where he studied to the 3rd standard before entering St. Xavier's High School. Throughout, he was noted to be a studious, well-behaved student. In 1919, Chagla entered Oxford University in England. During his time there, he participated actively in debates, joining the Oxford Union. After leaving Oxford, he studied for the bar.</p>

<p><b>Behavioral event interviewing (BEI)</b> is a psychology based standardized method of interviewing designed to measure how someone will perform on the job. The principle behind the technique is the belief that the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior. This article also defines <b>‘the STAR’</b> model and <b>BEI preparation techniques.</b><br />
IT Professionals, Engineers and Science professionals are highly analytical and are often hamstrung in interviews by a negative evaluation of their personal (not technical) skills. This article is the accumulation of many years of experience and quantifiable observation of IT people’s interview success rates when adhering to a simple set of rules. The source of information is from a company that began IT contracting in Australia. As these rules are constructed from professional client managers (non-commissioned) they are not tainted by a sales imperative. The rules are presented to assist the whole community (globally) by removing communication issues which helps professionals, businesses and the communities those businesses serve.<br />
<br />
<b>The Traditional Interview</b><br />
<br />
In this type of interview, the interviewer will run through the applicant's resume using open-ended questions to gain more information. Many of the questions a job applicant will be asked can be anticipated in their own mind beforehand.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Eg. • Tell me more about your last job?<br />
• Why did you leave your last job?<br />
• Why are you interested in this job?<br />
<br />
<b>Behavioral Event Interviewing (BEI)</b><br />
<br /></p>
<p>During a behavioral event interview, a person will be asked a series of standardized questions designed to get them to talk about how they handled or responded to certain situations in the past. With each answer, they will be expected to describe situations from your past and your feelings and observations about them. The interviewer will use this information to assess their proficiency in one or more job-related areas, which may include anything from adaptability to leadership to problem solving.<br />
BEI questions may be 'dropped' into a 'chatty interview' or may be formally asked from a set list. Interviewers typically have several follow up questions and probe for details that explore all aspects of a given situation or experience. What are the questions like?<br />
Behavioral questions usually begin with a statement like: 'Tell me about a time when...' or 'Can you a describe a situation where...'.<br />
<br />
The following are some examples of typical behavioral questions and the competencies they demonstrate:<br />
<br />
• Describe a difficult problem that you tried to solve. How did you identify the problem? How did you go about trying to solve it? (Demonstrates problem solving)<br />
• Describe a time when you tried to persuade another person to do something that they were not very willing to do. (Demonstrates leadership)<br />
• Describe a time when you decided on your own that something needed to be done, and you took on the task to get it done. (Demonstrates initiative)<br />
<br />
Failure usually results from a simple lack of Preparation. The rules are:<br />
<br />
1. Be familiar with the job. Read the advertisement or job description to identify which personal attributes/ behaviors are likely to be key success factors for the role. It is advisable to research the company's website and any external information about them from business directories etc.<br /></p>
<p>Make a note of two or three examples for each personal attribute that will best illustrate your suitability. Different companies and industries may require different personal attributes, even for the same position. For example, 'self-managing' can mean very different things to different companies.<br />
2. Be able to draw from a variety of experiences that demonstrate your skills and abilities. A good story can also combine work experience with a non-work experience (shows you can use the skill in a variety of settings). Examples may be from your work experience, your personal life or some social or other situation. Be as open, expressive and succinct as possible about each experience.<br />
3. Let others help you out - use examples of quotes from bosses or customers, i.e., "My boss gave me a good performance review, they liked the way I stepped in to get the job done without being told to." This demonstrates your willingness to accept contribution, your flexibility and teamwork skills.<br />
4. Think 'STAR' - Situation or Task, Action and Result. There are several variations of this acronym in the recruiting industry, but all of them are intended to provide structure and focus to your answers. When asked about a type of situation, the interviewer is looking at how you responded to it by via a specific example. Using the STAR model you would break your answer into the three segments of; description of the task, the action you took, and the finally the measurable result. This makes it easier for the interviewer to visualize and record your specific behavioral responses to specific events and so gain the best impression of your potential future performance.<br />
5. Use recent examples. As you will be probed for detail around the situation, it is better to use events in the last 12-18 months as the detail will be clearer in your mind. Be specific as possible about your contribution and the quantitative results achieved. Specific absolute or relative (%) gains in areas such as cost or time savings will give you the interviewer a clearer picture of your abilities.<br />
6. Practice telling your stories until they are vivid and concise, one to three minutes long. An interview can be likened to a marketing activity, where you are the brand. You will only get an interview because your resume and past roles suggest that you have the appropriate technical skills set (your attributes). Often what separates you from the other candidates at the interview stage is the interviewer's belief in how you will fit into the company's culture and specific team (your personal benefits).<br />
<br />
It is vital for any professional to understand that they need to display their technical AND personal skills. Being able to communicate their adaptability and relatedness at an interview is essential to interview success.<br />

<br />
The reason that this article is important is that it provides more than mere definitions. it provides tested working examples in the very competitive IT industry.<br />
Having created IT contracting in Australia in 1974 and still being a major player in Melb IT, adaps relies heavily on refining quantifiable testing methods.<br />
<br />
The sources validity is also backed by being the leading panel member of Australia’s largest bank <a href="http://www.national.com.au" class="external free" title="http://www.national.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.national.com.au</a><br />

Thus the practical insight of real world proven success of the BEI and STAR methods make this article important for the wider community.</p>

<p><b>METRO PROFILE:</b> The <b>METRO PROFILE</b> is a page that is used to promote riders and give information about the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b> It was created in October of 2005, but later was abandoned. In early 2006 it was revised, but was not succesful, and was then not updated. In July 2006, the webmaster decided to shut the METRO PROFILE down for a few days while it was being held under construction. Around August 7th, 2006, it finally was was back on track, with a new background, new graphics and started giving brief information about the Los Angeles MTA (Metro).</p>
<p>The METRO PROFILE then begin advertising it's page to many myspace users. Eventually it turned out to be so succesfull that every month the page would be updated with a new background and information. It is also advertised in the Los Angeles Transportation Blogspot.</p>
<p>In October, Metro was named Outstanding Transportation System, by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). The METRO PROFILE then immediately launched a new promotional campaign called "Ride America's Best". The "Ride America's Best camapaign helped allure customers or people viewing the METRO PROFILE to start taking Metro. Specially due to the recent rise of gas prices.</p>
<p>In November 2006, it focused on adding more videos in the profile, and attemted to try to give a sharp "Digital" bold look. But due to the feedback it recived, the webmaster changed it. The problem was that there was too many videos and the graphics it was using couse the internet or page to open up very slow on other users' computers.</p>
<p><b>CURRENT</b> On the December 2006 look of the METRO PROFILE, it features diffrent places to go around L.A County on the Metro Rail system. It includes all all rail lines and shopping center/malls around the station.</p>
<p><b>FUTURE</b></p>
