<p>Whilst well referenced quotes may have a place on wikiquote, the only place they should be in wikipedia is in relevant articles where they can be contextualised. Wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection .... . A quixotic collection of inflametory zionist quotes, cherrypicked from around various sources, cannot be anything other that POV, as I suspect the creator of this <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">User:Striver</a> is aware.

<li><b>Keep</b> It is common knowledge that Wikipedia is not an "indiscriminate collection" and that we have wikiquotes. But i argue that the nomination is flawed in its logic. The article is not indiscriminate, it describes and represent a real phenomena that it sources to (1) <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Icke_4a63.html" title="David Icke">David Ickes</a> website, (2) <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Islam_d7b5.html" title="Radio Islam">Radio Islam</a>, (3) whatreallyhappened.com, (4) <a href="../../../c/o/u/CounterPunch_f9ea.html" title="CounterPunch">CounterPunch</a>, (5) <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rense.com.html" title="Rense.com">Rense.com</a> (6) <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamonline.net.html" title="Islamonline.net">islamonline.net</a> and more. Within those sites, each one (except whatreallyhappened) having their own article here on wikipedia, it can not be said to be a "indiscriminate collection", rather, its a well organized and intentfull collections of quotations aimed to achieve a specific aim. And that is why moving to wikiquote is not appropriate either. This articles main objective is not to present the quotes, rather to represent the <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenomena.html" title="Phenomena">phenomena</a> that the practice of using this quotes represent. The quotes are there to give examples of the phenomena, which is evident since every quote is sourced to its main source, or it stats that it lacks such, and then proceeds to show what <b>secondary sources use them to defame Israel and Zionist</b>. The quotes <b>in the article</b> are not cherrypicked, they are picked from <b>list that cherry pick</b>: A huge and important disstinction. The quotes being inflammatory to Zionists is totally irrelevant. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 15:08, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>So, you'd be OK with List of nasty things muslims have said about America or List of Anti-Semitic remarks made by Arabs? As I say, an article about controversies that gave quotes as examples would be fine. Bringing them together is not neutral. --<a href="../../../a/o/r/User%7EAoratos_7a12.html" title="User:Aoratos">Aoratos</a> 15:16, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was actualy thinking about creating a counterpart, maybe Controversial anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist quotes, and put them both on the "Arab-Israeli conflict" template. I have absolutly no problem with that. Only questions that needs to be answered is if Zionist proponens have the same practice of listing anti-zionist quotes. I do not understand " <i>an article about controversies that gave quotes as examples would be fine. Bringing them together is not neutral</i>", could you elaborate on that, so i understand?

<dd>Its a very appropriate cite regarding what the cite contains. The cite is not used as a source of facts like "Israel is bad", it is used as a source of the fact "David Ickes site lists quotes", and that is a 100% correct use of the source. Anyway, What pov is the article pushing? Give a example. What part of the argument is unencyclopedic&#160;? I feel there is a lot of sweeping statements that might not be possible to specify. Again, you seem to be under the impression that this is the "Israel is bad" article, while this is the "People like to give this kind of quotes" article. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 18:48, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article is unencyclopedic. I would consider a collection of hand-picked (i.e. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) out-of-context quotes unencyclopedic. Re "what is POV pushing": the choice and editing (context and lack thereof) of the quotes. Please do not speculate on other editors' motives, your guesses tend to be wrong pretty much all of the time anyway. Whenever you find yourself typing "you seem to think..." the "delete" key is a pretty good choice. (I still don't think the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reptilian_humanoid.html" title="Reptilian humanoid">reptilian humanoid</a> hunter guy is a particularly reliable source...) <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 19:20, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Listen, a list of quotes might be POV, OR, out-of-context or whadever. BUT. It is <b>not</b> the article that originaly researched the quotes, the quotes in the article are <b>prominently</b> used in the lists of quotes describes. Let me put it this way: If i was to take a biblical verse, and claim it to be false, it would be OR. But if i quote the Qur'an doing the same, then it is ok. You understand my point? "Doing OR" = Wrong, "Reporting on OR" = Right. If <b>i</b> was to create a list of quotes out of thin air, that would be POV, OR, out-of-context or whadever, BUT i am NOT doing that, i am REPORTING that some PEOPLE are doing that. And THAT IS encyclopedic. Maybe you are arguing that it is not encyclopedic to report on those peoples habits of creating list of quotes? And by the way, just not liking to see the list is not a reason to argue to delete.

<dd>The soulution to that is to state it in the article. The unrliable factor is what makes the article notable in the first place, that people go to such length to state their view.

The protocols are even more unriliable than this, in this case you can just go to the library and check it out.

<li><b>comment</b> guys, if its the quotes that are sitcking in your eyes, then delete them, not the entire article! If you look closly, i have added that some of the quotes have more than one sorces, making it questionable if any of the sources are accurate. That is inline with having a article on the phenomena. But you give in to your gut-reaction of "rasist-bs" that you rather delete the entire article rather than help editing it, or just remove the quotes.

<li><b>Delete</b> Ignoring for a moment the quote farm (which should go) &amp; the website list (which should also go) as editorial issues - and ignoring the strong <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> this article completely hinges on whether or not one can consider a series of websites selectively publishing "controversial" quotations as a phenomenon. This is really the crux of the article. Deeming these "Israeli and Zionist" quote sites a "phenomenon" is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; i.e. there is no external source provided (and I could not find one myself) that has documented the "phenomenon" of this type of quotation. That being said, This makes the very central point of the article <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, unless sources are provided that this has been documented as a "phenomenon" by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sorces</a>. Drop the contention that this is a phenomenon and you are left with a link farm and quote list... both violating <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. There are of course websites that selectively choose quotes to publish, but this is a general practice, not limited to sites quoting Israelis about Zionism. I could find you dozens of websites that only mention the witicisms of H.L. Mencken, while completely ignoring his racist comments. That doesn't make an article called People quoting H.L. Mencken selectively an encyclopedic article though. Without sources that this is documented as a "phenomenon" the very contention of such is original research and what is left is an indescriminate collection of information.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 04:31, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Very well said. One wonders what response Mr. Striver will have to that one. And frankly, the title change makes it MORE POV, if anything. This sure as hell isn't an article about "People quoting Zionists." It's an article about inflammatory anti-Arab quotes. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 04:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. As Isotope23, above. Also, this appears dangerously close to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> -- the author is attempting to describe a phenomenon by citing instances of that phenomenon and not commentary about it in secondary sources. And finally, allowance of this article would mandate an inappropriate <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV article fork</a> for its anti-Israeli counterpart 'phenomenon'. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 04:48, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
