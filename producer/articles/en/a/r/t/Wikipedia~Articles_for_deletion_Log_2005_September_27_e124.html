<dd><b>Comment</b> Well done on cleaning it up. You should appreciate that many of us have no expertise in this area. So an Afd seems appropriate to me for the original state of the article - either somebody knows and cares, or they don't and if nobody does then delete is a good course of action. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 13:07, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Charles Matthews is definitely right about not using AfD for cleanup. We already <i>have</i> {cleanup} available as a tag, and that's much more appropriate (per nom who states in the AfD itself that the "topic is notable"). Voting "keep", BTW, doesn't obligate a voter to do the cleanup her/himself—doing so is great, but not everyone has expertise in everything. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 16:31, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Move</b> What salvageable content is here should be moved to the 'Eugenics and the state, 1890s-1945' section of <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">Eugenics</a>, which is a very fine article and is where readers can find additional information as well as context. With respect, I find the cleanup commendations confounding. The <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">Eugenics</a> article illustrates a number of highly dubious assertions in this. Most notably, the author has conflated a science (genetics) with a social philosophy (eugenics), unless I have somehow missed the Japanese eugenics degree available as a pre-war discipline. Also, the last line, <i>Eugenic thinking probably had wider effects. Japanese soldiers received instruction on how 'inferior' Asian and European races were to be treated. Military personnel who violated these instructions were severely punished</i> is nonsense. Since when did Japanese society, especially the military, need eugenics to promote a world-view based on racial superiority? Instead, the theory of eugenics and social Darwinism worked well within a social system that already fostered such a view. Bottom line: moving this to Eugenics will get this content the cleanup it desperately needs.

<li><b>Comment</b> I still stand by my nomination, and while the article is much less of a mess than it was, my reasons for the nomination included the lack of references, the vague information, and the poorly phrased article title. As I did indeed say, the topic is notable and article-worthy, but it would be better to have a one sentence stub than a badly titled, vague, sloppy article. Sure, I could have added the cleanup tag and forgotten about it, but in my opinion it's better to start from scratch. Hey, look, there is potential for an excellent article about the topic, but let's do it right, eh? (Note: I was going to follow Neutrality's suggestion and create the article Eugenics in imperial Japan, but I was unsure as to what the article itself should consist of.) <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 19:16, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm the author of the comic. I agree it's not _particularly_ notable as webcomics go, but I don't see why WP:COMIC should just be ignored.

The creator says there he does not plan to release a book, but that was early this year. I still feel that the comic is none notable.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. This is on the edge of the oft-used two-thirds guideline. However, I note that the second merge is unsure of itself and the move (which is really a <i>merge</i> given its description and the obviousness of not actually <i>moving</i> to that title) is very unsure of itself. So I think the two-thirds guideline fits ok here. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:34, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have tried to nominate only currently running webcomics for the alexa rank to be of benefit.

<li>Bearing in mind that I voted delete because I don't think it was notable even when it was updating, I don't think noting the lack of interest in a small update after nearly three years of no updates is evidence of a lack of notability. Whether or not it's notable is based on how popular and significant it was when it was still updating, not how many people check the site now that it's long defunct. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 02:51, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is no different than any other small religious organization and information deserves to be available to all who request it.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The title itself never held any authority in Malta, as the HRE had no authority there between its creation in 1790 and its abolition in 1806, so it can't claim notability on that basis. The title is not recognized by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_of_Privileges_of_the_Maltese_Nobility_bb98.html" title="Committee of Privileges of the Maltese Nobility">Committee of Privileges of the Maltese Nobility</a> so it can't clain notability on that basis. The Association of Foreign Title Holders in Malta is basically just a modern geneology club formed in 1994, so membership there is not notable. The only basis I can see for the notablity of the title is in its creation in 1790 by either the dying <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_44e5.html" title="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph II</a> or the newly crowned <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_22d2.html" title="Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor">Leopold II</a> (a detail the article really should include if it is kept). However, with the 18th century seeing the creation of so many courtesy noble titles, I'd like to see some evidence that the title actually had some lands held in liege before I'm prepared to accept that the <i>title</i> is notable. That the first Count von Zimmermann was notable, I'll grant since he was able to secure at least a courtesy noble title from a major monarch. If evidence that the title was more than simply a courtesy title can be pointed to then I'll change my vote to keep. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 16:26, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article (along with a number of others by the same editor) appears to be original research. I also agree with the comments above regarding "nobility" not equalling "notability"; just because someone claims to have inherited a fairly meaningless title does not justify a place in an encyclopaedia. Also, by analogy, one could argue that there should be (say) an article for every doctor registered in the United States, regardless of individual merit. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverhelm_8708.html" title="User:Silverhelm">Silverhelm</a> 01:10, 1 October 2005 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The article itself does not contain enough to explain why this noble title is notable, and I am firmly not of the opinion that all noble titles are notable. Far too many courtesy titles were created in post-Renaissance Europe for me to accept such titles are notable without further evidence. However, a little fact checking was enough to convince me that it meets my definition of a notable noble title on several points, tho if all I had to judge by was the content of this article, I'd be voting to delete. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 16:54, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>This is an article about a single page website <a href="http://www.seizurerobots.com" class="external text" title="http://www.seizurerobots.com" rel="nofollow">Do not click if prone to epilepsy or bad taste</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree that this is should be deleted as "original research," it is more likely "source-based research." Based on my memory of Egyptian mythology (admittedly, my memory is based on an history class taken three years ago for fun) most of the numbers listed in the article are "verifiable" with reference to the myths (though some of them are rather obscure). I'd tag with "cleanup" and "needs references" instead and let it go at that. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 06:03, 27 September 2005 (UTC) Okay, I'm changing my vote to <b>weak keep</b> because it is going to be a pain in the tuchis to figure out what was referred to in order to put in some of the references necessary to clean this thing up. It looks like most of the information came from <i><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/eml/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/eml/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Egyptian Myth and Legend</a></i>, by Donald Mackenzie, published in 1907.

<li>&lt;Shrug&gt;. Original research is usually not cleanupable. It is deletable and rewritable from scrathchabe. If you know a way to do in a sourced way and all, by all means welcome. I have no reasons to believe the author in each and every entry.

<li>Most of these would be easy to verify with a good reference book on Egyptian mythology (which I do not have handy). "Cleanup" would do it.

<li>Hey, I like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_numbers.html" title="List of numbers">List of numbers</a>. Maybe that's what's wrong with me.&#160;:-) But seriously, the way this should be handled is to note that certain numbers seem to have a "magical" function in ancient Egyptian myths and folktales. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 04:43, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>What it <i>should</i> have is which numbers have special meaning, what that meaning is, and research (with cited sources; no original research here) in to why the numbers have what meaning they have, possibly referencing contemporary cultures. What it <i>has</i> is List of occurrences of the number "seven" in Egyptian Mythology, List of occurrences of the number "five" in Egyptian Mythology, List of occurrences of the number "three" in Egyptian Mythology, and a little bit of original-research numerological speculation. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 07:18, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>No it was not a dictionary definition. It was a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a>. Dictionary articles and stubs are two different things. The question is whether it is a stub with any hope of expansion, or a stub that has no hope whatsoever of expansion. After reading the article as nominated, I was on the side of deleting it. After reading the article as nominated, it appeared to be no more than an unverifiable concept described in one <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_King_bf4f.html" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a> novel, with no hope of expansion beyond the one quotation from that novel. Maybe there was such a class of advertizement, but this surely wouldn't be its name. But after research, I am surprised to find that this is the accepted term for a widely recognized class of advertisement, and is verifiable, with the potential to not be a perpetual stub. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:35, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The question I would ask is what is the evidence that this is widely accepted slang. My Google search shows 8 distinct mentions - only 1 or 2 appear to be ad related. The rest are second hand (e.g "or as they say in the industry..."). If this was widely accepted slang, I would expect many maore direct hits. Secondly could this be a back formation i.e. an adaption of Stephen King's termonology by people outside the industry.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article has multiple references that are at least somewhat credible to support its existence. That is enough to keep the article itself.

<p><b>RaD Man</b> was proposed for deletion. This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion. This page is no longer live. Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.</p>
<p>13 votes delete, 9 to keep, 1 to merge/redirect. 1 vote, by <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuybrushnd_b261.html" title="User:Guybrushnd">User:Guybrushnd</a>, was disregarded as likely sock puppet, due to limited and questionable edit history—I have concluded that all other alleged sock puppets are ostensibly valid votes.</p>
<p>This tally amounts to 14 votes to 9 against having <a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man">RaD Man</a> as an independent article, nearly a 2/3 consensus, but only 13 to 10 for deleting the content entirely. I believe this logically calls for merging and redirection, but only one vote suggested where. Another solution may be to continue the listing, so that the decision of where to merge may be discussed, and additional votes may be added. As I was one of the voters in such a close VfD, I will decline to personally enact a resolution. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 01:46, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

If you mean capable of being described in an encylopaedic fashion - which is what I take it to mean - then he will be as encyclopaedic in 5 years time or in 1000 years time as he is now. If you mean notable enough to be in an encyclopaedia then I've got to disagree with you. We really don't know who will be notable in 5 years time. Wikipedia has plenty of people who may be less notable in 5 years time than they are now. But that's fine because Wikipedia is a database - nice and easy to edit - let's take a risk and include him now and if in 5 years time his notability has waned then he can be deleted in a trice.--<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomheaton_3b83.html" title="User:Tomheaton">Tomheaton</a> 20:46, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<li>I mean notable enough to be in an encyclopedia. You're right that it's difficult to tell what subjects from the present will be notable in the future, but that doesn't excuse us from the responsibility to write articles only on things that will be. Better to wait a few years until we're sure that a subject deserves an article than to rush into writing an article on a subject that turns out to be nonnotable. We're <i>building</i> an encyclopedia here, not maintaining a list of the latest fads. Just because an internet-based encyclopedia <i>can</i> have nonce information inserted and removed rapidly doesn't mean that it <i>should</i>, nor indeed that it <i>will</i>, in practice. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriskaideka_72fe.html" title="User:Triskaideka"></a>—<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriskaideka_72fe.html" title="User:Triskaideka">Triskaideka</a> 21:03, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, albeit with reluctance arising from my distaste for being on the same side as some of the completely inappropriate comments offered above. I don't agree with the idea of waiting a few years to see if this subject area becomes notable. I'm fine with documenting ephemera for historical purposes. It would be nice to have ready online access to, say, fads of the 1920s. My first inclination was to agree with <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> about merge &amp; redirect, but it seems that RaD Man (whom I'd never heard of until I saw this listing) has some activities outside ACiD that are worth noting.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Discounting Duderon (total of 2 edits), I would normally pretty much rely on an 8d-3k to be a delete. However, <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> has comprehensively rewritten the article and persuaded at least one former deleter to be a keeper. In this case, I'm not sure there is a consensus given the new information in the article, and I think that VfU would be likely to undelete+relist this. A renomination may be appropriate for the sake of clarity. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:06, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>It is not important Opa-ages</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable forum on a non-notable website. The Gaming Age website doesn't have an article, so why should its forum be considered more important?

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I'm gonna take a crack a rewriting this, but this is a significant gaming forum, particularly as a barameter of gaming culture in general.

For the number-addicted, it has nearly 2 million posts (this despite automated deletion of stale threads after a certain time), and nearly 8000 registered users (despite requiring administrator approval to register an account).

For one thing, newcomers who vote on AfDs votes are rarely counted and are often assumed to be <a href="../../../g/a/f/WP%7EGAFD_bd8b.html#Sockpuppets_are_bad" title="WP:GAFD">sockpuppets</a>, so the "don't bite the newbies" argument is simply trite and unhelpful. When was the last time you saw a newcomer vote on AfD have a vote that was actually grounded in WP policy and was worthy of being counted? Never, for me. Second thing, if a newcomer can't be bothered to read the <a href="../../../g/a/f/WP%7EGAFD_bd8b.html" title="WP:GAFD">instructions to AfD</a>, which <i>includes in its glossary such terms as "nn" and "cruft,"</i> then that's their problem, not the person who uses those terms. It's shorthand so that we don't waste our time writing out the same old arguments over and over again in longhand. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 00:57, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note: I am entirely in agreeance with not biting newbies, and go out of my way to apologize for and explain misunderstandings.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I nominated the old article for deletion because it was being maintained as an ad for somebody's self-published book. This is in its early stages and lacks references, but seems in form at least to be an attempt to provide the historical account that I hoped would materialise, once the old article was deleted. Good start, I see no original research. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:38, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's true that I don't think this is by the same author as the earlier article. I still think it's original research. The first sentence is a tipoff, but the main problem seems to me to be that what brings everything the article covers together is only the author's POV that none of it is convincing. So while I appreciate your relief, Tony, that this is better than what was here before, I believe this one should be deleted for the same reason the other one was: i.e., a truly encylopedic article is more likely to be written from scratch. Please note that this is not my field--I'm responding to the article's tone and structure, which I believe are fundamentally flawed, rather than my own point of view on the subject. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 21:31, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> It's obviously junk, but it's not "patent nonsense" as narrowly defined by that criterion. I encourage people to pretend that CSD stands for "common sense deletion" in cases like these, though. It's possible someone could undelete it just to make a point, but I hope that doesn't happen. We would all do well to remember that the rules are here to help us make an encyclopedia, and doing what's right for the project should be a higher priority than exactly following a rigid process. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:18, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see why this should be deleted. It is an entirely valid article.

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b>. I very distinctly remember covering this in professor Kenneth Rogerson's Philosophy of Religion class in 1995 or 1996 - I suspect it was in the text. I recall reading a rather extended version of this argument that suggests that, with all the religions in the world, it's impossible to know which one is right. You could work your whole life to be a good Episcopalian only to learn that God wanted you to be a Presbyterian (or a Catholic; or a Buddhist), therefore the wager is between devoting all your energy to a faith that has a one-in-as many faiths as there are chance of being true, or spending the time on yourself and hoping that if there is a God he's not picky. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 02:15, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> It taught me a lot, short as it is. I came to the article from research on Pascal's wager, and in particular the moral and philosophical objections to it, and commentary upon it during the last 3 1/2 centuries. This article is clearly relevant. Furthermore, questions about Pascal's wager are clearly relevant today. For example, every time someone is faced with a chain letter, the basic underpinning seems to me to be a disguised or variant form of Pascal's wager. Atheist's wager is not often cross referenced on the web, and Wikepedia should retain it as a separate cross referenced heading. Sigoldberg1 October 2, 2005</li>

<p>This page contains non factual and insulting text regarding the diet of a specific state. The tone is in itself derogatory. The article states that Kentucky consumption of White Castles is the highest in the nation. There are only White Castles in 3 cities in the state and the states population is over 4 million. Burgoo ( which I had never heard of) is served in Owensburg and I had to get that off the internet. It may contain some truth but it still has a derogatory tone to it. Also is this article suitable to Wikipedia? If there is an article concerning this states presumed diet then wouldn't there have to an aricle concerning every states cuisine?<a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakotaKahn_841e.html" title="User:DakotaKahn">Dakota</a> 22:30, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. More tidy up. Two AfD sub-pages were created one for the article, and one for a redirect to the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>, assuming that the material is verifiable. The innacurately-named "Sources" section is just a link to an annoying recipe site. The article is, however, linked to from <a href="../../../c/u/i/Cuisine_of_the_United_States_30a7.html" title="Cuisine of the United States">Cuisine of the United States</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, which is some evidence that some people think that Kentucky's food is interesting enough to read about.

<li><b>SpeedyKeep</b> Just because a purported native has never heard of something means little. I went through and added some sources for the material about White Castle and Burgoo.

<li>Comment on purported native</li>
</ul>
<p>The article as I first found has changed greatly. The original was different in title and tone. I am not a "purported native" of Kentucky. I am not from Kentucky but have lived here 5 years. I am the one who ask for that deletion. I just don't think it is worth time spent for pursuit. I give up and think I will write a Cinncinnati, Ohio cuisine article. -<a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakotaKahn_841e.html" title="User:DakotaKahn">Dakota</a> 03:49, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
