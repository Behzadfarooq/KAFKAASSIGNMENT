<h2><span class="mw-headline">What?</span></h2>
<p>You told Ilena that silicone is safer than saline? wow. You perhaps need to read a 2006 study on proteins found on implants (that were in the body over time) that are known to cause local immune reaction and the authors state that more research needs to be done to determine if there is any long term systemic reaction. The 'wealth' of studies done are still relatively short. The FDA has itself stated there is insufficient data on any one implant to determine rupture rate.. The scientists are again suggesting that it is still unknown what the long term effects are of rupture. That is one reason why the FDA recommends periodic MRIS after implantation, to detect rupture. There seems to be no clear evidence of systemic illness but this is by far not a given (especially with rupture, for which there is scant data). Where you got the idea that silicone is safer than saline is um, well, not very scientific.Jance 18:23, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are few, if any studies, about the safety of saline implants, and the (probably lesser) effects of the (more common) leaks. I think I did see a meta-study which purported to show that saline implants had fewer side-effects than silicone. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 18:30, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know there are few studies on saline. Part of the problem is the history of all implants. And the litigation. I just saw that you said here that saline had fewer side effects than silicone. That is true. Jance 07:18, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Artur,</p>
<p>I am sorry, I do not understand your message on my talk page. What should I do? Where is the problem?</p>
<p>"An example of what you should not be doing: Creating articles in the <i>main name space</i> which are redacted archives of your talk page. Please move Archive-Gadomski to a <i>subpage of your talk page</i> AT ONCE. I'd do it, except that I don't <i>know where you want want it</i>. — Arthur Rubin | (talk) 19:56, 3 January 2007 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Is the problem with the name of the page? - It can be changed, for example , as Adam M. Gadomski/Archive 2006, BUT I do not know exactly how to do it.</p>

<p>The deal is located in the below section from the talk page:<br />
<small>Look you and i are never going to agree and i think you and I should step back and let other people decide on the wording as we are just going to keep on butting heads. Also, please can neither of us influence the views of others by talking to them about this issue through e-mails or by using firends or on talk pages or by posting any more comments on this talk page. You and I have both had fierce arguments over this and I think we shoud let other decide before we get what happened previously happening agian. I think it is the best way for us to get a fair and balanced result.<br />
(Lucy-marie - You didn't sign above). It's precisley becasue I want to let others decide that I started this Request for Comments strand in the first place. No, we are never going to agree, quite simply because you are wrong as others here have pointed out, as evidence I have presented to you has shown and as the evidence even you presented shows. Remember, your original assertion was that there is no such word as 'persons' in English (whether British, American, Australian, whatever doesn't matter). That part is now resolved - the word is perfectly valid in British English (and others). I would also point out that you subverted the RfC process by declaring it closed, blanking a page and creating two new ones, which I nominated for deletion and other users speedied. I have been more than happy to let others decide, but given the weight of evidence and opinions already expressed here and in the deletion pages, is there any point in prolonging it? Is it time that you accepted that you have learned something and that the Ebglish language is a wondeful thing that never cease to amaze us? Incidentally, I have just come back from the Co-op where the sign next to the bacon slicer reads: "Persons under the age of 18 may not operate this machine." Emeraude 16:25, 7 January 2007 (UTC)<br />
Yes i do think we should prolong this so we can see exactly what the disinterested views of other users are and i am not sure what the Ebglish language is i think you meant English language. I'm sorry i forgot to sign above and don't know how to do the unsigned thigey. So i think this page should be archived and a fresh discussion should be initated excluding the pair of us. this would satisfy me and would settle the argument as i would wholy accept the outcome. I also refer that we should not contact anybody on this issue at all until the RFC is completed and fully implmented. So can you agree to my proposal? Also I do not think either of us should close the rfc either.--Lucy-marie 16:38, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Hi, you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Anderson_%28computer_scientist%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99632949" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Anderson_%28computer_scientist%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99632949" rel="nofollow">reverted</a> my edit without giving any reason. I guess you are aware of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exponentiation.html#Zero_to_the_zero_power" title="Exponentiation">exponentiation#Zero to the zero power</a>, or the broad consensus in the mathematical community that 0<sup>0</sup> = 1, at least when only natural numbers are considered. I think this should be made clear in the article, since the usual arguments in favour of 0<sup>0</sup> = 1 show the problems with Anderson's claim that "transreal arithmetic is total": in standard arithmetic, an identity like <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/3/1/831e04f92cfa3b9df7c0e266afe0d5ba.png" alt="(a+b)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}a^kb^{n-k}" /> is valid for arbitrary <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i>,<i>b</i>,<i>n</i></span>; if 0<sup>0</sup> is left undefined, the situation can be salvaged by adding "whenever both sides are defined". In Anderson's case, one needs to modify this to "whenever both sides are not equal to Φ" or something like that, showing that universal validity of identities must be sacrificed in order to achieve the totality of arithmetical operations. Of course, all of this is original research for WP purposes, but the current exposition is misleading. IMO the entire section should be removed, as was suggested on the talk page.--80.136.148.67 22:48, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>0<sup>0</sup> = 1 when the exponent is considered over the integers, but is normally considered undefined if the exponent is considered over the reals.

<dd>No, just that calculus people are more likely to leave 0<sup>0</sup> undefined. Anderson himself claims that division by zero is a computing problem, and the article focuses on the comparison with IEEE arithmetic. That's why the cs point of view has to be taken into account. From a purely mathematical view, he defines some kind of algebraic structure, and algebraists know that a<sup>0</sup>=1 for just any a, real or whatever. Of course, he tries to do analysis, but I cannot take these attempts seriously. As I said before: IMNSHO this discussion is already more than this theory deserves.--80.136.176.202 16:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About proposing deletion</span></h2>
<p>The proposition of deletion of the article "<a href="../../../a/r/t/ARTHUR_%28military%29_36c8.html" title="ARTHUR (military)">ARTHUR</a>" is, from my point of view, rather drastic. It is an article about a military vehichle, it is not translated from swedish by a german or dutch (but written by a Swede) and "bad grammar" is hardly a reason to delete a semi-serious article. The reason it does'nt have any english references is mainly because there are no english references. And military equipment that is rather nationally unique is not very publicly accounted for either. If you think it has bad grammar, maybe you should correct it, instead of deleting it?</p>

<dd>I apologize for the comments about "translation"; it's just that the grammar and word formation used is more German/Dutch than English. English <i>normally</i> doesn't run multiple words together to produce complicated concepts, but provides hyphenation. However, the reason I'm upset with that is that I can't figure out what you're saying.</dd>
<dd>Also, remember, Wikipedia is not about <b>truth</b>, but about <b>verifiability</b>. In other words, the article needs references for anything not obvious; and what may be obvious to you as a (former?) member of the Swedish military may not be obvious to me. It is permitted for references to be in a foreign language if no English reference is available, but references there must be.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps you would do better writing the article in the Swedish Wikipedia first, and then add the link here. However, I'll withdraw the proposed deletion — for the moment — provided that you work on the encyclopedic tone of the article as well as locating references. (The references <b>do not</b> have to be accessible online. Swedish newspaper articles or articles in the land equivalent of <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane%27s_Fighting_Ships_5a48.html" title="Jane's Fighting Ships">Jane's Fighting Ships</a> would be quite acceptable.) If I removed everything which is unreferenced, as I should, there wouldn't be enough left to construct an article.</dd>

<dd>Yes! I made good faith attempts to edit the article. Patriot made a large number of additions and alterations (16 straight) from January 6th to the 8th. I made what I felt were hard thought edits and put in time and effort. Many of those alterations and additions did not deal with changes that Patriot made. I didn't just revert his edits, but worked with what he had. When he got upset he chose to blanketly revert every change I made, without comment. That's uncalled for. It's hard to reach any concensus when that occurs and I somehow doubt that is Wikipedia policy. 66.75.8.138 02:46, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello there. I've seen your name around the 9/11 articles on occasion, where you seem to be both a voice of sanity and scrupulously fair, so I hope you will help out here. The article on <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclusive_disjunction.html" title="Exclusive disjunction">exclusive disjunction</a> was recently moved to the title `exclusive or' after a debate which I unfortunately missed, the main argument for which was predicated on the fact that Google turns up more hits for `exclusive or' (which is ambiguous anyway — see my comments on the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AExclusive_disjunction&amp;diff=102242524&amp;oldid=102240053" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AExclusive_disjunction&amp;diff=102242524&amp;oldid=102240053" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). I moved the article back to its proper name, since I think that calling it `exclusive or' is akin to calling the article on multiplication `timesing' or the article on addition `plussing'. I would appreciate it if you could cast a glance over the situation and tell me if I am being unreasonable — I just don't think mathematical terminology is best decided upon by the consensus of a dozen Wikipedia editors who may or may not actually know what they are talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AExclusive_disjunction&amp;diff=24878844&amp;oldid=23792868" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AExclusive_disjunction&amp;diff=24878844&amp;oldid=23792868" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kauffman</span></h2>
<p>Arthur, I see the two citations related to Dr. Kauffman. I also see that you are defending the "diminished" version of the paragraph that he is referenced in. Am I missing something. His credentials look pretty good to me, but I'm thinking that you have knowledge from previous discussions that I am not privy to. Is he competition to Barrett? I see he notes that he fights fraud in "mainstream medicine". Are they rivals? --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 01:56, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My apologies. I would prefer the diminished version — he is the only critic who provides a "formal" web site review, but I feel the longer version gives Kauffman's views too much credit. In any case, we need to calm down while the 3RRs are straightened out....</dd>
<dd>I'm really not sure what Kauffman's motivation for the article is. (I don't see a direct reference to Kauffman fighting fraud, but I don't have a copy of his book.) I suspect that Barrett may praise some aspects of "mainstream medicine" which are opposed by what he (Barrett) sees as quacks, which are among the ones that Kauffman thinks are, themselves, quackery or fraud on the part of "mainstream" practitioners. But I really don't know. Gigabutterfly's note that he (Kauffman) doesn't find any studies which support Barrett's conclusions suggests that Kauffman is "cherry-picking" the studies, rather than that Barrett is full of <small>censored</small>. I'm almost certain there's some history between them personally, or one has attacked the pet project of the other.</dd>
<dd>You may have noticed I filed 3RR reports against both Gigabutterfly and Levine2112. (I'd like to goad SA into a 3RR violation, but that would be wrong.) — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 02:13, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I'm not interested in revert wars. That's pretty much why I backed out. I am interested in trying to calm things down on this article and the other articles that Fyslee and llena are a part. I would miss either of them. There was a time that the Chiropractic article was this bad, but we were able to reach consensus by using NPOV and V and RS information. You were an important part of that and I do remember you were a solid editor that resisted POV editing. <a href="http://www.usip.edu/chemistry/faculty/biography.asp?id=43" class="external text" title="http://www.usip.edu/chemistry/faculty/biography.asp?id=43" rel="nofollow">This is the source that is cited on the QW page that says he is fights mainstream medicine fraud</a>. To me, that makes him a pretty reliable source about the same stuff Barrett does. His credentials look pretty good to me, better than Barretts for sure. If anyone is in a position to make the assessment, he would be the one, don't you think? I am not into the long versions. I personally think that a few sentences are all that is necessary to make a point. But I am open to the fact that I may not have all the information that you and others have been privy to. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 02:43, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure if competition is the right word. I had never heard of Kauffman before his mention here. From his track record (at least what's been mentioned here -- JSE, book, etc. - I suspect his version of "exposing fraud in mainstream medicine" is akin to the type we find from Bolen, Mercola, Null, Icke, Rense, Martini, Townsend Letter, etc.. IOW outright enmity to the whole system (and using the enmity they create to promote and sell unproven methods), rather than concentrating on exposing specific proven cases of pharmaceutical industry abuses, serious malpractice, criminal fraud by MDs, crooked dentists, (incompetence &amp; iatrogen problems aren't fraud, so I don't include them), etc.. Those areas are already covered pretty well by law agencies, many consumer groups, most medical societies and their journals, all alternative medicine groups, etc.. Barrett has chosen to concentrate on a niche that has been ignored and is unrelated to those matters, leaving them to those who are already doing it. Like I said at the start, I don't know much about him. I haven't read his book or seen other examples of his actual criticisms, so I could be misjudging him by his use of the language typical of anti-medical and anti-science groups. If anyone can supply some links here to more of his stuff I'd appreciate it. That will help us determine if he's a real medical fraud buster, or just another quack booster using anti-medical rhetoric. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 17:53, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that's kinda what I'm looking for, too. But we have to be careful not to jump to conclusions that he must be a quack because he is criticizing a quackbuster. His credentials are at least as good, if not better than Barrett's when it comes to research and pharmaceuticals. He does back up his arguments with research, both primary and peer reviewed. But it is not whether he is right or wrong in their disagreement on the eight subjects that he reviewed, it's that he noted that Barrett had not cited these same sources (or anything similar) when making his own recommendations for proper diet, etc. IOWs, his commentary was basically saying Quackwatch was not going about it in a scientific way either - the pot is calling the kettle black. Therefore it, too was undependable. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 18:19, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, critics of quackbusters aren't automatically quacks. (There are exceptions.....;-) There are certainly legitimate criticisms that aren't designed to be, or used as, straw man or ad hominem attacks to divert attention from unethical practices and advertising. It's hard for me to really evaluate Kauffman because I don't have any of his stuff, and I have plenty of other things that interest me more, but if anyone will post something here, I'll try to check it out. I suspect your last couple sentences are closer to the truth. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 18:57, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My fear is that despite this, I will get blocked just for being nominated in the middle of this debacle. Please check my edits and my discussion on the Quackwatch talk page. I was being judicious and cooperative, and offering constructive advice for the newbie (and I belive showed incredible patience and restraint). I urge you to un-nominate me (i.e. delete your entry on the 3RR admin noticeboard).

<dd><i>a prime number (often just called a prime) is a natural number that has exactly two divisors - the number itself, and 1. 3, 5 and 7 are prime numbers, but 9 is not (it has three divisors - 1, 3 and 9). Nor is 1 a prime number, because it has just one divisor (1).</i></dd>

<p>I think you have changed it from something which is generally accessible to something which only mathematicians may appreciate - I feel a lot of Wikipedia suffers from this - it clearly has too many mathematicians involved! (I too am one, but not a 'notable' one - I am more concerned about access to the subject: most people learn more from a few well-chosen examples than from a rigorous definition. (The current version relies heavily upon <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_numbers.html" title="Natural numbers">natural numbers</a>, but if you look at that you find that Wikipedia doesn;t know whether zero is included or not .....)</p>

<li>I would be interested to know why you consider my mention of the principles of epistemology to be a sign of bias? I was merely pointing out that the articles that are quoted against hair tests are do not rule out that hair analysis may be clinically useful, but rather show that as they are done today, there are serious flaws. To point out that something is neither completely disproven nor completely proven is not bias to my mind, but rather to explain how the scientific process works, and what the controversies about it are. Why did you remove this?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I would also like to know why you deem my mentioning that hair analysis could potentially obviate the necessity of a lumbar puncture to be "unsourced" or "biased." The Multiple Sclerosis page in wikipedia, to which I linked, mentions that lumbar punctures are sometimes necessary to diagnose MS. What is "unsourced" or "biased" about this suggestion?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why is my writing that there are not one but three debates swirling about hair analysis in alternative medicine "unsourced" or "biased?" It essentially is exactly what Barratt says!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why is writing that hair analysis has suffered from benign neglect a sign of "bias" or an "unsourced statement." If I source a 1978 article showing that there is clear data that it could be of use in diagnosing MS, and nothing has been done in the next 28 years, I cannot see how you take issue with this claim. Is it not evident from the article itself that these discoveries have been neglected for 28 years? Could you please explain me your reasoning?</li>

<dd>"strong, if not compelling" needs to be removed; "unaniomous beliefs" should be replaced by "medical concesnsus", and the last sentence is yet another conclusion. Never mind, I found why I removed it. I said it shouldn't be in the "background" section. Looking closely, it just introduces the two clincal studies mentioned below. Perhaps a sentence following those studies adding a summary might be appropriate, but if you cannot find a source for that, it may not be approriate, either. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 14:36, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To answer some of your points:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I strenuously disagree with your assertion that including the principles of epistemology in the article is "original research." Epistemology is the logical theory or taxonomy of knowledge, and every bit as rigorously logical as math. The non-mainstream use of hair tests is an area in which there is as yet, no clarity on their use; thus it is entirely relevant and appropriate to explain to the reader the principles of epistemology so that he or she can better understand the issues at hand.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The basic rules of epistemology are clearly defined, and logically consistent. To explain the epistemology of our knowledge on the use hair tests in alternative medicine and medical research is no more to conduct original research than is to rewrite 10^0.5 as SQRT(10), or to compare two birthdates, and write that one person was born before the other. To assert that this is a conclusion or original research would be as far-fetched as to claim that my writing that the Ryan study is now 28 years old is a "conclusion" or "original research," because the Ryan study doesn't explicitly say that it is 28 years old.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>To explain the epistemology of hair test use is simply to perform a logical operation on the data. Your assertion that the onus is on me to supply a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that hair analysis could be useful, is to insist that the absence of proof is proof of absence. This is either faulty logic, or the expression of a (false) POV. Not even Barratt argues that there is proof of absence, but rather points to an absence of proof. To take logic to its extreme: until it is conclusively proven that there <b>can</b> be no further uses for hair analysis as a diagnostic aid, we have to assume that it is possible that there are some. I am intent on reentering this line of thought into the HA article. Are you going to want to ask for arbitration on this?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Benign neglect is a strong, but, I think accurate description of the state of affairs. Would you agree that writing "That even though there are research findings of significant discrepancies between the hair of those with some ailments and healthy individuals, that suggest that hair analysis could have further diagnostic uses, little if any progress was made in a twenty-three year span in further elucidating their significance and introducing them into clinical practice?" This is not original research, but rather comparing Barratt and Seidel, who write that it is useless in clinical practice, to Ryan and Holmes, who proved otherwise. Could our POVs be affecting our judgments?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I do not agree with your assertion that my "synthesis" of the facts is uncalled for. We know that that MS is an illness. We know that illnesses are determined by diagnosis, and we know that illnesses are diagnosed by finding clinical markers that differentiate them from healthy states. Obviously, this means that this clinical marker could play a role. Now we don't know whether this definitely can be used to diagnose MS, but we do know darn well that it could possibly be used to diagnose MS, and, by definition, this article is precisely about what is not already well-established and universally accepted in regards to hair tests. As such, my "synthesis" is legitimate, even the best way to underscore the <b>uncertainties</b> that surround the use of hair test in alternative medicine.

<p>I need to revise and extend my remarks. I meant mediation, and wrote arbitration. My profuse apologies.--Alterrabe 16:49, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd accept mediation, if we can't reach an equitable agreement, provided we can agree on the scope. (The mediation in re <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrett_v._Rosenthal_4883.html" title="Barrett v. Rosenthal">Barrett v. Rosenthal</a>, which, as you can earlier in my talk page, went to arbitrartion, failed because the participants couldn't agree on the scope.) I feel that your version of the article (just before my trim) provides undue weight toward hair mineral analysis being an acceptable medical practice, even if the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> concerns are unjustified. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 19:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I do not claim that hair mineral analysis is an <i>accepted</i> medical technique. I believe however, that it is <i>conceivable</i> that it will some day be an accepted medical technique. Although I don't address this in the article, I personally believe that it is very likely that medicine will eventually adopt hair mineral analysis for further diagnostic work. Before we start discussing the scope of mediation and all that, I'd ask that you read the page as I just left it; you'll see where I am coming from. If you want to make improvements feel free.--Alterrabe 21:37, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arthur it's not about those prominent people or conspiracy theories. It's about the <i>title</i> and the <i>content</i> of the template. You cannot push that singular template/article into conspiracy theories; it's a hypothesis, there is nothing on the other side. You cannot have a coin, if it doesn’t have two faces. You cannot make the elephant-fly. We cannot just label such (serious) hypothesis, its POV. Do tell, why is this still up and running? If you won't to call it conspiracy theories (as in plural), I'd suggest you write "death rays" article and find some sources for it, or find some other alternative. Of course if you try to expand it with something that would be in line with derogatory and libelous connotations of the term "conspiracy", we are back at the point one. You were perfectly clear yesterday; let me remind you of your own words: "It appears I misunderstood you. Nuclear, gave a plausible explanation that you wanted to create a 9/11 controlled demolition template. That may be <b>a worthy cause…</b>"; The <b>only theory</b> with a Wikipedia article is the <b>controlled demolition</b> theory."; The template is <b>perfectly fine</b>… as reduced by removing other entries in the <b>controlled demolition</b> (hypothesis) form."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:911ct&amp;diff=103258142&amp;oldid=103257034" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:911ct&amp;diff=103258142&amp;oldid=103257034" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.

<dd>There are other conspiracy theories than <b>controlled demolition</b>, although we don't have articles on them, and there are theorists about whom we <b>do</b> have articles who believe in other theories. We probably should have the template in the inclusive form, as well as the controlled demolition template; however none of the drafts at {{<a href="../../../9/1/1/Template%7E911ct.html" title="Template:911ct">911ct</a>}} would be acceptable as a CD template, because they include theorists who do not accept controlled demolition.</dd>

<dd>If you include that and insist to call the template "conspiracy theories" I won't mind at all:). But seriously, that excerpt could hardly be called hypothesis, since its states… all sorts of things without explaining anything. Its really not about the structure at all, it's about the speed of collapse. But never mind that, if you would take a breath and took a calm look at all this you'd see the middle ground. Or NPOV, as we call it here. I've seen your suggestion, if you won't to pursue such strange "trinity" so be it. However, I would kindly ask once more, if you would simply rename current template, I'm sure you are the one who can easily trim it and form(ulate) it without causing more mess. You've repeatedly stated that it’s nothing but a good and valid tool. Not to point out, that you are still "distributing" it under name which is clearly disputed, even by yourself. So let's make clear what is clear and use this for what it is. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELovelight_bc72.html" title="User:Lovelight">Lovelight</a> 02:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The external links I removed were all the same link, to his website. I also removed content from the body of articles, which was to his own obscure personal theory, and I removed quotes from him, and I removed links to google searches which he posted which were designed so that his website would come up high on the list of hits. Neither he nor his website are reliable sources, so his quotes and his website don't belong anywhere on wikipedia other than on his user page. I had some difficulty at times knowing how much of what he posted to cut, though, because he often posts one or two paragraphs of what to me is incomprehensible babble. It is possible that some of it makes sense or could belong in the articles, I can't be entirely sure as I'm not an expert on any of the topics these articles relate to. Of course, none of it is sourced, so removing it is always a reasonable choice. If you think any portion of his written content does fit in its article and adds to it, feel free to put it back. And, note that this isn't the first time I have done this; back around October I removed these same spam links from him from dozens of articles, but he waited until I had forgotten about him, made a new account, and reposted a bunch of it. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 02:01, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Arthur, Nuclear, please cool it. Nuclear, Arthur is right - the real problem is that the 911cd template exists at all. The 911ct template has more scope for including the balancing articles which are sceptical of the conspiracy theories, so is a better template per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. You are assuming bad faith. There is no deadline, everythign can be solved by calm, rational discourse, which is the wise course for you given that you are under sanction.

<li>Having the mainstream view of 9/11 conspiracy theories does not constitute involvement. I have very little involvement with these articles, virtually none with the templates, and am not an American (which helps). Your definition of "uninvolved" appears to be wither one who shares your bias or one who has no opinion on 9/11 conspiracy theories. You'll not likely find the latter, and the former is not "uninvolved". You need to take a step back before you end up back in front of ArbCom.

<p><b>Mr. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">RUBIN</a>,</b></p>
<p>Respectable <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikipedian" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wikipedian"><i>Wiki</i>-Editor</a>,</p>
<p>Of your user page...:</p>
<ol>
<li>This user is a relatively famous Wikipedian: Arthur Rubin;</li>
<li>Note: I didn't write that, but I don't feel comfortable taking it out. — Arthur Rubin | (talk).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>My note about this: I dont know you, but that words seemed to express a sincere feeling. I hope his/her maybe quite correct!</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us go to the goal...</p>
<p><b>Honourable Mr. Rubin,</b></p>
<p>I think I have understood why you have reverted the alphabetization I have proposed for two or three times at <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Erd%C5%91s_e1ea.html" title="Paul Erdős">Paul Erdős</a> article.</p>
<p>In fact — last time — , you have commented the revertions as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>01:19 7 february 2007 (Revert failed alphabetization AGAIN)</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>01:21 7 february 2007 (Let's try this sort, if yoy want to alphabetize)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you appreciate [FAMILY NAME, FIRST NAME] form (Nothing against it. I do appreciate this too!...), then, accordingly, at "COLABORATIONS" TOPIC, it must appear, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>* <a href="../../../y/o/u/Yousef_Alavi_9453.html" title="Yousef Alavi">Alavi, Yousef</a>;</li>
<li>* <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/l/B%C3%A9la_Bollobas_368e.html" title="Béla Bollobas">Bollobas, Bela</a>;</li>
<li>* (and so the following..., until Wrinkler, Peter, naturally, <i>the last</i>)</li>
</ol>
<p>And, so, this <b>"in fact"-alphabetized set <i>would make sense</i></b>: to provide quick and easy seeking, don't you agree?</p>
<p>On the other side — but under the same theme — why revertion done at "EXTERNAL LINKS" TOPIC? I really do not understand it. <b>If <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia Policies &amp; Rules</a> prescribe it in such manner, please, <i>can you report it to me</i>?</b></p>
<p>As you have seen — I think so — I am not an "anglo-culture native user", but a foreign ("alien" or "stranger"...) one, from <b><a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brasil</a></b>. But I, naturally, want to obey or conform to the "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia"><i>Anglophone</i>-Wikipedia</a> home rules", not conform to mine.</p>
<p>So, my zealous <i>wiki</i>-editor... Can you answer me these questions, and solve these doubts?</p>
<p>Finally, can you post your answer to these questions on <a href="../../../e/g/i/User_talk%7EEgidiofc_3257.html" title="User talk:Egidiofc">my discussion page</a>?</p>
<p>Best <i>wiki</i>-salutations!</p>

<p>I understood your entire explanation. And, naturally, I thank you for all.</p>
<p>Some of the pointed themes — as adopted by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia"><i>Anglophone</i>-Wikipedia</a> — receive my full disagreement. I am sorry for them. But, as you have so promptly and prudently said, it seems there is nothing (perhaps, <i>almost</i> nothing...) to do about for now...!</p>
<p>About <i><a href="../../../e/t/_/Et_cetera.html" title="Et cetera">et cœtera</a></i> as I have written, take this only as a precious latinism from me.

<p>One of the people making edits had his talk page covered in warnings about sock puppetry, nonsense, and vandalism.. I'm trying to help this encylopedia, but I'm conidering going back to contrbuting without an account because of alot of the obvious bad faith exibited by some editors.

<dd><i>One of the people</i>...which one? I'll keep that in mind. Nonetheless, I don't think <b>all</b> of the editors who are reverting your change to the lead (even excluding myself) were acting in bad faith. Considering the controversial nature of his work, we need a mainstream source calling the films documentaries, or we cannot really say that they <i>are</i> documentaries. I'm only watching this page because of the continued vandalism (yes, I know what I said on your talk page) committed by Bov (and his IP addresses, as he seems unable to log in from work), Lovelight, NuclearUmph, Webucation, et al. If they hadn't been here, your edits to the page wouldn't have been seen by me, but you might have been tricked into a 3RR violation. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 00:02, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, it appears that I'clast et.al. don't have any evidence and that they do is flimsy at best, hence why I keep asking for it given that supposedly it is available for use by Ilena (and I'clast) in her ArbCom defense. Or rather, they are using this "evidence" to make an entire thread of unsubstantiated claims without actually providing any hint of what they actually have for rebuttal. Hence why I keep telling I'clast to cease his harassment on my talk page, put up or shut up. My take is that I'clast was quite prepared to blow smoke up everybody's rear end and bias the ArbCom with "other people are COIing, so if one is punished, all should be punished" type defense strategy. You can see Ilena locking onto this tactic quite early. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShot_info_7854.html" title="User:Shot info">Shot info</a> 22:32, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Arthur Rubin, you edited the page <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_8913.html" title="Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center">Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center</a> with the following comment: "(Remove quote from source which is probably a copyright violation)". But I think this constitutes what is called a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Acceptable_uses" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, so I will put the quotation back on the page. <a href="../../../r/o/u/User%7ERougieux_6057.html" title="User:Rougieux">Rougieux</a> 10:10, 27 February 2007 (UTC).</p>
<p>An extract of the fair use article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inclusion of brief attributed quotations of copyrighted text, used to illustrate a point, establish context, or attribute a point of view or idea is acceptable under fair use. Text must be used verbatim: any alterations must be clearly marked. Removed text is marked by an ellipsis (...), insertions or alerations are put in brackets ([added text]). A change of emphasis is noted after the quotation with (emphasis added), while if the emphasis was in the original, it may be noted by (emphasis in original). All copyrighted text must be attributed.</p>

<dd>You misunderstood me. I'm saying that the link, itself, is likely a copyright violation, and so violates <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>.

<dd>You are right, I removed the link to Youtube but I let the quotation in the article. And I wrote an email to "VPRO tv" this morning. They say it's OK to include the quote and proposed to link to the video on their site.<a href="../../../r/o/u/User%7ERougieux_6057.html" title="User:Rougieux">Rougieux</a> 11:03, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Since you are tangentially involved in this, it is appropriate that I let you know about it and invite your comments.

<dd>I'd rather not. I was <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sporgery.html" title="Sporgery">sporged</a>, probably by the CoS, for a <i>favorable</i> comment I wrote in <a href="news:alt.religion.scientology" class="external free" title="news:alt.religion.scientology" rel="nofollow">news:alt.religion.scientology</a> . (I think I removed over 90% of the the 1000 or so from the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> archives, but there are still a number remaining. With Google's new From: mangling, they are difficult to find....) I don't want to get involved again. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 18:00, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Absolutely understand and sympathize. Just wanted to let you know. Take care. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 18:57, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Though I would be remiss if I did not invite you to consider if you are holding against me, as a Scientologist, something that the CoS (maybe, who knows, but I will grant it was them), holding against me that the CoS did something stupid in perceived defense against perceived ill-intentioned attacks. That would be like holding <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate_scandal.html" title="Watergate scandal">Watergate</a> against every Republican. I do not think you would do that, would you? I must say that I see quite a pronounced "blind spot" when it comes to Scientology on the part of otherwise perfectly reasonable netizens. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 18:14, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The encyclopedia's help entry on reversion is unclear; it's missing a step or something.
