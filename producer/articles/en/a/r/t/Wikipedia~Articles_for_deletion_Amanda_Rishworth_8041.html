<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't know enough about Australian politics to get involved in this one, but there are failed political candidates with their own Wikipedia entries which would seem to set precedent. For example <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raj_Bhakta_41fd.html" title="Raj Bhakta">Raj Bhakta</a>, who recently tanked in the 2006 race for <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania%27s_13th_congressional_district.html" title="Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district">my local district</a>. He stood no chance at winning (good riddance), but still has his own developed, well-sourced article. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 09:20, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thankyou very much for the info, it does indeed set a precedent. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 09:51, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Bhakta was a candidate for a federal legislature; Rishworth was a candidate for a state legislature (Krimpet, your equivalent would be the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_House_of_Representatives_8bd8.html" title="Pennsylvania House of Representatives">Pennsylvania House of Representatives</a>). That's a substantial difference, so I doubt there's much precedential value in the Bhakta article. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 05:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Huh? Rishworth is a <i>current</i> candidate in a federal (as with the Bhakta article), not state race (though she previously contested a state seat), and stands, unlike Bhakta, a very strong chance of winning. If we're keeping American articles on candidates who didn't stand a chance in hell, and deleting Australian articles on candidates who are very much favoured to win, then this is one hell of a double standard. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:38, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. I think we need more Australian perspectives on this, I don't think it's appropriate for people overseas to give their approval or rejection (my opinion) on a matter such as this... it really needs the opinions of people familiar with Australian elections. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 06:43, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I'm abstaining again... I'll admit I shouldn't have trusted one biased proponent to explain a foreign election to me, I failed to realize she was running again for a federal election, which is much more valid criteria for a keep. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 11:27, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was responding to the comment about failed candidacies in long-shot elections. Bhakta was a failed candidate in a federal election, which in and of itself made him notable. Rishworth's failed candidacy was for a state election; Krimpet and Timshift9's comments indicated they felt there was precedential value in a comparison between those two failed candidacies, which there really isn't. That both Bhakta (reality TV contestant) and Rishworth (current candidacy, youth leadership positions) have other claims to notability was beside the point of the comments. Personally, I think major-party candidates for state legislatures (in whatever country) are notable enough for articles. Clearly, that position is not in vogue; I've written enough subsequently deleted articles to realize that. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 13:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Rishworth has been preselected for the most marginal of 150 seats in the upcoming 2007 election. The Liberals won on a particularly strong 52.8% of the two party preferred vote at the 2004 election, so there is a strong chance that Rishworth will take it at the next election even if the polling showing the ALP ahead doesn't hold out - so she'll either be a successful or non-successful federal candidate. Not to mention she was president of Young ALP etc. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 14:04, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b> it seems to be well established elsewhere that major party candidates in a election for the legislative body are notable whether they win or lose. The doubts come in when the candidate is not from a major party. In any context I would regard getting one-third of the vote as substantial--at 5% or so it might be different. Some of the objections seem to be based on her politics, or speculation about her subsequent career. Perhaps none of them are relevant to the proper concerns of this AfD. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Should not be an article without reliable references which there are not even after this huge debate. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 10:11, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How are there not reliable references? Just about very polling organisation in the country has been looking at Kingston in the last fortnight, and Rishworth appears in just about all the reporting on those polls. It is a patent double standard to keep a whole bunch of American federal candidates who never stood any chance, and to delete an Australian one in one of the most crucial races in the country. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 12:11, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I didn't state that as I meant. There are not reliable sources as to her notability just reliable sources that she's a candidate. The seat and related contest is clearly notable but the two references in the article in essence say <i>she's a candidate</i> and nothing more - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 07:16, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>She's not notable for <i>losing</i> an election. She's notable for being in a current, ongoing race which is receiving quite a lot of attention. Are people even reading the article before voting? <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 22:41, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are people forgetting the fact that she's not notable just for that, things like the fact she was Young Labor president? And an organiser for the Shop Distributive Allied Employees Assoc. union, and she's also a psychologist. As was already said, it seems to be well established elsewhere that major party candidates in a election for the legislative body are notable whether they win or lose. The doubts come in when the candidate is not from a major party. In any context, one-third of the vote as substantial--at 5% or so it might be different. The fact she also brought Labor ahead of the Liberals candidate to face them on the two party preferred vote as opposed to the Liberals in 2002, and also the fact she's been preselected in the country's most marginal of 150 lower house seats, Kingston at less than 0.1 percent, where a poll was done a week ago by The Advertiser newspaper in Adelaide of 550 electors in Kingston, with Labor on 56 percent of the 2PP. This is not some fly-by-night person. An article from <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s256913.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s256913.htm" rel="nofollow">2001 shows</a> that. This article should not be deleted given other examples of failed candidates given as examples here, especially when she's not a failed candidate yet. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 13:10, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable, crystal ball. Although she stands a reasonable chance of winning the seat, I would give the same odds to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sarah_Hanson-Young_2010.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sarah Hanson-Young">Sarah Hanson-Young</a>, who was deleted and protected after the same debate. Her chances of winning the seat are irrelevant to the debate. I sympathise with <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a>, but the WP consensus seems to be that she does not deserve an article until she actually wins the seat. 203.20.192.55 07:07, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per 203.20.192.55. Having key roles in two apparently-NN organisations doesn't confer additional notability. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyingtoaster1337_9f8e.html" title="User:Flyingtoaster1337">Flyingtoaster1337</a> 07:38, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While I would agree with the nomination that her participation in the SA election does not warrant an article, together with her involvement in an important contest in the upcoming federal election, and other positions held, she seems notable enough. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 15:41, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
