<dd>I'll admit that my prose isn't fantastic (I'm an astronomy student, not a English major), but you should be looking at the topic, not the content of the article in deciding if it is worthy of an article on Wikipedia. The death penalty is a controversial issue in the United States, and every execution receives coverage in the national news media. I'd be interesting to know how we would decide who is "interesting" or not? Multiple murders? Rape involved?

<dd>What about this man's death, more then so many others, sheds light on the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> debate? You chose this man deliberately, yes? So I assume there is something special about him. Now maybe it's just that he is somehow special to you. If that's the case, you <i>should</i> be creating knowledge; put down your feelings and post that as a blog, or to your local paper, or to a relevant mailing list. If he is or should be special to us, then tell us why! Either way, write from the heart, not the head. We can fix your prose, but we can't inject spark if there's not life to begin with.

<li><b>comment</b> - a quick google finds the claim that "3,581 offenders were under sentence of death in the United States as of December 31, 2001".

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I personally don't see a reason to have biographies of random murderers who are sentenced to death, there are so many murderers and they don't seem special to me. However, a number of the murderers Evil Monkey lists above are no more noteworthy than Thacker, and it would be inconsistent to keep them and delete this one. I am not suggesting that we should keep an article that merits deletion just because other articles that might merit it didn't get nominated, just that the continued existence of so many articles on 'ordinary' murderers suggests a consensus consistent with keeping the Thacker article. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostGirl_ed70.html" title="User:GhostGirl">GhostGirl</a> 13:26, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The purpose of Wikipedia is "The Free Encyclopedia" and that means that certain topics are going to be able to be kept updated and included than in the "Encyclopedia Brittanica" or what not. Also, if the Thacker article is cleaned up, and more research done on the man, the crime, and whatnot, then it could be a valuble asset down the road. Further, I like to see biographies on such things, if for nothing else than to give an understanding as to why the individual was put to death, what the individual's last meal, and last words were. Remember, an insignificant peice of data to us, down the road could be vital in the understanding of the future.<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldan_2c27.html" title="User:Soldan">Soldan</a> 16:04, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Agree with Danny and Soldan. Why? Because if this encyclopedia is to cover such important topics as <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminology.html" title="Criminology">criminology</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penology.html" title="Penology">penology</a> then this kind of data is useful now and is going to be only more useful in the future, when someone might really want to go back and explore the death penalty in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._6e1d.html" title="U.S.">U.S.</a> We have precious little knowledge of why people were put to death in 19th century America, let alone, say, ancient <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>; think of how important that kind of material is historically and sociologically.
