<p>The major problem with this article is that it's original research. Rather than a reproduction of a published list of bad songs, this article is made up of some titles taken from such lists with no apparent methodology. Since there are no set standards for inclusion, the article could be expanded indefinitely. Some sources are cited, but many are not. This results in significant NPOV and verifiability issues. If someone has a suggestion as to how this article could be brought up to wikipedia standards, please share it. <a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">djrobgordon</a> 02:09, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> but delete all entries that are not sourced. State strict criteria requiring sources be cited, and not just someone's opinion. Also there's quite a bit of POV comment needs to be trimmed. I gave the "She Bangs" listing a rewrite to not only remove POV but also to better cite why it's considered one of the worst songs. Suggest, actually, that this be renamed "List of RECORDINGS that have been considered among the worst ever." <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 02:51, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. It is not original research to write an article that isn't a copy-paste of a pre-existing article. "Original research" would be saying "x song is bad" when no one significant has said that before; listing various songs that have been especially noteworthy for a source saying that they are bad is not "original research", it's combining old research into a new, easily-accessible way. In fact, I'd be more tempted to delete this article if it <b>was</b> a "published list of bad songs", since it'd very likely be a copyvio and in any case would be 100% useless (since an external link or "further reading" mention would suffice just as well). If there are POV or verifiability problems, be constructive rather than destructive: make them NPOV and verify them. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:44, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"entirely subjective, some people's worst song is another's favourite." - Hm. You clearly don't understand Wikipedia lists, or at least this one. The article is not about songs that <i>everyone</i> thinks are the worst ever, it's about songs that a <i>powerful majority</i> have said are the worst ever in various polls. Since <i>nothing in the entire world</i> is agreed upon 100% by anyone, I'm surprised that you'd make such a bizarre demand as to only allow this article to exist if it was somehow fancifully possible to magically see what songs everyone hates (as though such a song could exist). It makes no more sense than expanding "no original research" to "no research", as some on this vote seem to be arguing for. As long as it's not <i>Wikipedia's</i> opinion that's being expressed, but rather various third parties, the article is completely NPOV, and just needs some polishing up and expansion to reach an acceptable level of quality. Hopefully you will regret your delete votes if this page ever reaches the level of quality of, say, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="List of films that have been considered the worst ever">List of films that have been considered the worst ever</a>; if not, there's probably no chance of reasoning with you. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:47, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Considered among the worst ever"? By whom? Why should we care? Even if every entry on here was cited from some publication, it's still pointless. People's opinions vary; one man's trash is another man's treasure and vice versa. There is no coherent connection between entries on this list.

<ul>
<li>"By whom?" - By any noteworthy, major source.</li>
<li>"Why should we care?" - Not caring about an article's topic is not sufficient rationale for deletion. Plenty of people do care about this topic, because they're interested in major popular opinions and their reaction to various songs. I don't care about <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_I%2C_Duke_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg_e69d.html" title="Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg">Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>, but you don't see me putting him up for VfD. And this article will benefit, inform, and interest substantially more people than Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.</li>
<li>"People's opinions vary; one man's trash is another man's treasure and vice versa." - You don't seem to comprehend the significant other aspect of that saying: yes, there is no unanimity in what is or isn't "treasure", but there is <i>certainly</i> a strong majority! Most people who see an unearthed trunk full of gold coins, for example, would call it "treasure", even though some wouldn't; the fact that there is dissenters no more means that we can't discuss what people consider "treasure" than that we can't discuss what people consider "terrible songs", as long as we cite sources. You fail to draw the line between "every song is liked by <i>someone</i>" (which is as true as it is irrelevant) and "it's impossible to call any song widely disliked because there are always dissenters" (which is patent nonsense; unanimity is not a requirement for majority): the whole <i>idea</i> of these articles is to base it on majority and widespread opinions that have been documented by major polls, lists, reviewers, etc. It's not to find any song "unanimously hated"; since such a notion is inherently impossible, I'm surprised that you even considered that as a possible goal for this article, or for any other article. <i>All</i> articles on Wikipedia focus solely on the most noteworthy, relevant, and significant bits of information related to the topics they encompass. If not, we'd have a 10,000-page article called <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Yosemite_area_c3b9.html" title="History of the Yosemite area">History of the Yosemite area</a> instead of a 16-page one. The minor details are <i>always</i> assumed to be excluded from <i>any</i> page; this one is in absolutely no way different.</li>
<li>"There is no coherent connection between entries on this list." - Sure there is. "Songs that have been considered among the worst ever by noteworthy sources". You'll have a hard time getting more coherent than that.</li>
<li>"It makes no more sense than List of songs that have been widely enjoyed" - It makes more sense because there are hundreds of ways to try to determine people's favorite songs; album sales, polls, etc. And we already host numerous ones of those on Wikipedia. This is the only page which attempts to address in a general way the <i>opposite</i>: songs that are very widely (or very noteworthy for being) disliked, according to the numerous attempts that have been made to study this. It's an interesting article on a nice subject that has a lot of potential. That's good enough for me. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:47, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>POV is not a valid reason, on its own, to delete any article. It's a reason to put an NPOV tag on the page so people can focus on improving it.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I did not use the word POV. I did use subjective and bollocks, which is what I think about the article. The songs may be cited from lists that various people/magazine readerships/pundits/hacks have devised. Those lists are inherently subjective and yes POV now that you mention it. I am not in the business of wasting "<i>people's past and future efforts</i>". I was voting.

<li>Fair enough. I certainly wouldn't be so quick to judge that this article won't be deleted, though. It's only been one day and the delete votes are increasing rapidly. Out of 29 votes, there are currently 11 Delete (including 2 Strong Delete) and 18 Keep (including 4 Weak Keep and 1 Strong Keep), making the percentage for keeping the article currently only 62%. Could change easily. Anyway, I apologize for putting any words into your mouth which you didn't intend; I didn't mean to. And I'm glad you're willing to help improve the article even though you don't think it should exist—excellent attitude for Wikipedia in general. Though I still must disagree with you entirely—reproducing POVed lists on Wikipedia is <i>completely in keeping with NPOV policy</i>, which only states that we can't put <i>our</i> POV on Wikipedia; every noteworthy source's POV is absolutely fair game. That's how we can write any article <i>at all</i>: by representing all noteworthy POVs, not trying to pick and choose which ones are more or less "subjective" than others. If it's an external, significant POV, than we can mention it, no matter how distorted its views are. And if there are significant rebuttals, of course, we should include those too! -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 10:41, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Just think about it. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_believed_to_have_epilepsy.html" title="List of people believed to have epilepsy">List of people believed to have epilepsy</a>, List of Europeans, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Eagle_Scouts_9cb4.html" title="List of Eagle Scouts">List of Eagle Scouts</a>, List of people who were cremated, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_have_disappeared.html" title="List of people who have disappeared">List of people who have disappeared</a>, List of virgins, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_World_War_I_veterans_8f91.html" title="List of World War I veterans">List of World War I veterans</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christians_ec4d.html" title="List of Christians">List of Christians</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_deaf_people.html" title="List of deaf people">List of deaf people</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sculptors.html" title="List of sculptors">List of sculptors</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_suicides.html" title="List of suicides">List of suicides</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Cubans_2ee3.html" title="List of Cubans">List of Cubans</a>, and hundreds more—think about it. These lists aren't <i>meant</i> to have <i>every</i> item imaginable, just the most <i>noteworthy</i> one: it's assumed that a "list of Muslims" or similar will only cover especially noteworthy Muslims (i.e. ones who would have their own Wikipedia article, generally), not every Muslim in the world! That's just much more efficient than having "famous" in every article on Wikipedia. In the same way as <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_speculated_to_have_been_autistic.html" title="People speculated to have been autistic">People speculated to have been autistic</a> only deals with <i>noteworthy</i> speculation, "List of songs that have been considered among the worst ever", for obvious reasons, and quite clearly to anyone looking at the page, deals exclusively with major, widely-publicized polls and other noteworthy sources for various people's opinions on the subject. It's not meant to be an objective list of the worst songs in the world, which is <i>why</i> it's called "list of songs that have been <i>considered</i> among the worst ever", not "list of the worst songs ever". "Considered" assumes "considered by a noteworthy amount of people" and possibly "considered by especially noteworthy individuals" (like perhaps if Bob Dylan consistently labeled a certain song as the "worst ever"; though that might not be within the scope of this page). Arguing that an article should be deleted because a <i>literal</i> interpretation of its title would make it unmaintainable, even though it's actual <i>topic</i>, dealing, as it does, with only the most noteworthy and well-known "songs that have been considered among the worst ever", is quite maintainable indeed, is arguing for the deletion of tens of thousands of Wikipedia articles. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:47, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I love looking at lists like this -- but <i>not on Wikipedia</i>. The person who wrote this article should put it on the web. They probably put it here either 1) to get more eyes -- which it is not Wikipedia's job to provide -- and/or 2) lazy. It IS a good article, but that's not the point -- is the article <i>concept</i> good <i>for Wikipedia</i>? Also articles like this will be maintenance problems. On the other hand, since Wikipedia kept the Worst Films list, its hard to justify deleting this one.<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Would anyone object to my linking to this VfD on the Talk page of <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="List of films that have been considered the worst ever">List of films that have been considered the worst ever</a></b>? Effectively, this vote is a vote on whether or not to delete the <i>entire</i> series of "X that have been considered the worst ever", since there's absolutely no significant difference I can see between a list of movies that significant sources have called "the worst" and a list of songs that significant sources have called "the worst". Therefore, this VfD is equally as significant to the editors of those other pages as it is to those of the much-less-frequented and significantly-lower-quality <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_that_have_been_considered_among_the_worst_ever.html" title="List of songs that have been considered among the worst ever">List of songs that have been considered among the worst ever</a>, if not <i>more</i> significant. So, shall I provide the link for any interested editors? I don't think they'll be happy to see an article that's gotten over 1550 edits since August 2003 get deleted without their being given a chance to vote too. For that matter, this VfD probably applies equally to <b><a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">Films that have been considered the greatest ever</a></b>, <b><a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_and_video_games_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever">Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever</a></b>, etc. I'll link to this vote there, too, if no one has any problems with letting all the editors most informed and experienced in this topic and very specific type of article have their say. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 10:41, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think this article already does a pretty good job of policing its entries and making sure they all have sources. I agree that a separate list of "removed songs" could be interesting, to avoid having people re-add songs that have already been rejected and to keep tabs on them. Not vital, though, and could be more of a hassle than simple removing anything that isn't properly sourced and explained. I did link to some of the above pages to help people get suggestions for various ways to improve this article, though; some images would help spice it up, and it might not be a bad idea to broaden the perspective to include other determiners for being considered "worst song" (like if an especially noteworthy critic, musician, celebrity, organization, etc. called it the "worst song", not just various polls and such). -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 11:57, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

More reputable sources include VH1 (but no link is provided and I haven't found the polls online), maybe WFMU (a small local radio station) and Blender magazine, for which wiki already has an article that could be expanded-Blender Magazine's 50 Worst Songs Ever!. Now maybe I've left off a few valid sources, but I fail to see the <i>notable level of infamy</i> or the <i>critical and popular consensus</i>.
