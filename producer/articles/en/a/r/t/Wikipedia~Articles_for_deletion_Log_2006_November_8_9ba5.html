<p>Contested PROD with "fails WP:WEB and WP:V: non-notable forum/website, nothing is referenced, no chance of anything being referenced", however it was contested. I wholeheartedly agree with this reasoning. I don't see any reliable independent third party sources, nor do I think there will be any. My googling has not found any as of yet. Fails the Alexa test (~190K), if that happens to be your thing. Doesn't rank highly on Big-Boards either. <b>Delete</b> as failing WP:V and WP:WEB. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 01:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Just what would qualify as a reference? It is possible for facts to exist without having an outside website to reference them. And SB.com is linked to other websites. The Alexa rating itself isn't Wiki policy and shouldn't be grounds for deletion. And SB.com does rank well on Big Boards when you check things other then the first stats. And it just so happens that SB.com is owned and run by Kier, one of the primary developers of the VB Bulliten Board software. It should be noted that things far less notable have their own pages. Such as individual pages for minor characters in rarely watched TV shows. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 01:40, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> official policy excludes facts that exist without any outside source. And "If article X then article Y." is a fallacious argument. The infamous Argumentum ad Pokémon has long since been refuted, as shown below. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:57, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per Pokemon Rule, i.e. there is an article for every Pokemon in existence. Also, SB is central to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> community. <a href="../../../e/2E/_/User%7EE._Sn0_%3D31337%3D_919f.html" title="User:E.

<li>When you can cite the same range of in-depth sources about this web site that are cited at <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html#Notes_and_references" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur#Notes_and_references</a>, you can validly employ that argument. Of course, you will have at the same time cited sources to demonstrate that the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria are satisfied, which is the argument that you <i>should</i> be making here (but are not).

That you wrote it off by calling it a gaming website shows you voted against it without any attempt to see the truth of the matter. As it stands, I keep hearing people talk about how UncleG got it right. I am still waiting for an explanation as to why the Sidekick article which met all the stated requirements got deleted. And knowing that the Sidekick article was deleted regardless of the requirements, why should I even bother with your rules knowing full well that its going to be ignored just like it has in the past? You've killed any respect I once had for Wikipedia policies now that I see how they are being applied in a cherry picking standard where people just remove pages they don't like.

<li><i><b>keep</b></i> So what you're saying is that we should not look to Wikipedia for information? Because that was what he said he was doing, and you just stated that that was the wrong way to utilize this page. Also, nobody has yet said that providing sources will prevent deletion. Thus it seems rather fucking pointless to the people who made this site. <i>Italic text</i>And it's not even self promotion.<i>Italic text</i> So there's no reason to delete it neither, save for the does not cite it's sources thing, which should be warned of first, which it wasn't neither, and isn't even a guarantee because now, it suddenly isn't influential enough. Unlike the aforementioned Bulbasaur article. To put it this way, the ones who argue for deletion cite a flaw, and then nominates for deletion. Then they inform the writers that providing sources won't save it because it isn't noticeable enough. Then the writers are informed that articles of less note, that should also be deleted won't be, because, well.. Because. And nominating those articles for deletion because they violate the same rules that are almost being followed, are <i>Italic text</i>disrupting wikipedia. And any complaints about this are completely irrelevant for some reason. Which is for some reason not intellectual dishonesty? So remember people if your article is deleted, don't list other articles up for deletion for the very same reason, especially if they qualify for deletion... Anyway, what you guys who want to delete are saying is that it's getting deleted because it isn't verified, right? And that if we add sources that verifies things, it won't help anyway and it is not worthy enough and it's self advertising and so on. Then someone comes in and argues your point, and points out unfair treatment, and thus get's slapped with a giant fish slapping dance version of "that's not relevant to the debate"... <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakonKL_78ac.html" title="User:HaakonKL">HaakonKL</a> 20:54, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Ultra-Loser (great name) commented that if this article is going to be deleted, then all other episodes of this series would need to be deleted (and why would one episode of a list of episodes be nominated without any of the others being nominated anyway?).

<li>Ok, let's get something straight. Did you read the article? It's one sentence, it doesn't add anything at all. You can have a list and nominate stuff later on that doesn't meet notability.

<li>Yes, my name rules. Anyways, I've thought this over, and I've decided to vote <b>delete</b>, for this article and every other article in the list - unless someone can expand them considerably within the next five days. Right now they're just wasting space on the wikipedia servers and degrading the quality of this encyclopedia. Anyone who comes to this article looking for information will likely just be disappointed. I dig the spoiler warning over the "this article is a stub" sentance, by the way. Very useful. <b><a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltra-Loser_fa06.html" title="User:Ultra-Loser"><span style="color:#112B84">Ultra-Loser</span></a></b> <small><a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltra-Loser_53db.html" title="User talk:Ultra-Loser">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultra-Loser_4117.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultra-Loser">Contributions</a></small> 02:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, I read it, and I then went to the episodes list and glanced at a couple other episodes. They appear to be mostly one sentence articles, but that's why I made the comment that articles can be expanded. I've never seen the show, but I know it has a huge fanbase. Surely someone can expand it. I'd hate to see Wikipedia become lopsided in its content, excluding content on older shows, while current shows like My Name is Earl and Office have entire in-depth synopses of every single episode. Just my thoughts. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 02:54, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe it would be more useful to have all of the one-liner articles merged into a list while retaining the blurb descriptors and then linking that list back to the main article? I can see why we should keep the material in as much as we keep a lot of pop culture, but a load of 1 line articles isn't really what we want unless they will someday each grow into something more than a stub. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 04:16, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It should be kept but single line articles like this have no intrinsic value. They are also a pain to navigate to, and elevate what should be a bullet point in a main article detailing all episodes, to one which has a full page given to it. Its simply a waste of resources.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are many thousands of TV episodes that have pages on Wikipedia, do you suggest we delete them all? Some of them are even less significant than Battlestar Galactica.

<ul>
<li>"If article X then article Y." is a fallacious argument, for obvious reasons. The correct argument is that Wikipedia should reflect the sources that exist in the world at large. We justify articles on individual episodes from series like <i>Babylon 5</i> and <i>Star Trek</i> not because "other shows have them", but because we can point to web sites, articles, and even <i>entire books</i> where people have documented, commented upon, and analysed such television series at the levels of the individual episodes. If you wish to make a similar case for this television series, please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">point to</a> equivalent web sites, scholary articles, or books for <i>this</i> series that provide the requisite amount of source material for supporting an individual encyclopaedia article on this individual episode. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:52, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep.</b> The big problem with this (and the others) is that they are sub-stubs.

<li><b>Comment</b> Original author here. Oy, vey, give me a break, okay? First thing was to create the article, put in all the infobox information, link it all, and then pad it out. For any article this is a drawn out process and part of this is that the whole thing IS supposed to be collaborative, right? Having the article is supposed to invite editing and improvement, right? The article's less than a week old, have a coffee and wait to see how long it's been before you go and do something like this... Now...

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just so we are clear here, this is a "character" on a television show that has never appeared in said show and never will.

<li><b>Keep</b> - article is sourced (though poorly cited) from source that deal with the exact subject matter. To suggest the article is unencyclopaedic is farcicle, and to suggest that it's OR is transparently false. Sure, the article needs style improvement, but <i>needs style improvement</i> is hardly a criterion for deletion. It's a criterion for improvement. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:16, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: From the tagged version of the article: "The answer, in the lack of scientific evidence of cognitive differences, convincingly lies..." That, my "farcicle" friend, is a thesis, a no-no in this encyclopedia. You may have faith that an essay can be merely massaged back into an acceptable NPOV article, but I don't. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 21:51, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article no longer says that - suggesting we delete articles based on what they used to say is pretty rediculous. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 22:39, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A essay was written to support one conclusion. It's supports, structure, tone, etc. is all used to support that one conclusion. I am not convinced you can just tweak one aspect of this article, its tone, and can confidently say its no longer an essay. Its a cosmetic cover-up, and frankly, you're being ridiculous if you can't see it needs to be totally rewritten. Perhaps you would want to keep the article intact and replace its foundation from underneath it, that's your opinion. My opinion is to demolish the article first before rebuilding. Unless of course, you still deny it's an essay, which would be an actual farce. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 23:00, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It really isn't. Have you read the most recent version of the article? The issue of women in physics being underrepresented is one that's studied, talked about, whatever. See: <a href="http://www.casca.ca/ecass/issues/2005-ws/brief/matthews/matthews.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.casca.ca/ecass/issues/2005-ws/brief/matthews/matthews.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.aas.org/~cswa/bulletin.board/2006/06.02.06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aas.org/~cswa/bulletin.board/2006/06.02.06.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> for instance. It's clear that the original writer of the article let their own opinions slip in, but the article is no longer an essay, nor does it really flawlessly represent a neutral point of view (though it probably does as well as an average article). But the problems with it don't mandate deletion, but improvement. They're not that severe. The foundations are fine, just the paint needed to go. Which it already has. The deletion policy specifically lists <i>Article is biased or has lots of POV</i> as a <i>Problem articles where deletion may not be needed</i>. The point is clear: There's no reason to delete the article. There's no rational for deleting the article. It deals with a verifiable, encyclopaedic subject in an incomplete but reasonable way. Sure, it needs expansion, but the response to an article that needs to be expanded is not to delete it but to expand it. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 23:14, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not convinced. I've read the article as it was, as it is, and in my opinion (if you choose to accept it or not) the effort to save it is foolish. The topic is better served as a section of <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women_in_science.html" title="Women in science">Women in science</a>. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 23:47, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>So you want to delete the article for reasons wholly unrelated to the article? That's a pretty weak argument, as far as I can see. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 01:36, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The fact that some people would like to dump this entry is an example of the gender bias that this entry illustrates. <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovember7_6c04.html" title="User:November7">November7</a> 16:25, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's probably not fair - they're likely just unaware that it is an issue of significant interest and study. I've been to a talk on the issue of Women in Astronomy, but that's probably the exception, not the rule. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:32, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes,of course. Being unaware that you are sexist excuses all. <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovember7_6c04.html" title="User:November7">November7</a> 22:02, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure this comment makes sense. Perhaps you would care to elaborate? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 22:39, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Indeed. Ever heard of good faith? I don't like the assertion that I'm sexist because I reccommend the deletion of a poorly written article. The subject of gender bias itself is notable (and is a re-direct to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">sexism</a>) but this article isn't purporting to be about that subject but rather doesn't seem to go anywhere. The last paragraph reads more like a press release pointing to some information. Re-write to something useful and I'll be happy to change my opinion. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 23:12, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The gender ratios of women in physics are a notable and well-documented subject; however, this article is badly written and goes nowhere as it stands. To counter a rational argument for deletion with sniping and personal attacks is an indication of the same mindset that rejects women from physics based on emotion and image, rather than considering fairly their merits. My vote below is to merge this article with <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women_in_science.html" title="Women in science">Women in science</a> and actually say something coherent about the content of the recent publications referenced in the article. --A woman in physics, <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHEL_f701.html" title="User:HEL">HEL</a> 19:42, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> an AfD ought to be a discussion about deleting the page rather than the content.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. The article's non-neutrality is a major issue, however I do not think it immediately fits into an AfD article.<font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b><a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal">¤~Persian Poet Gal</a></b></i></font></font> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 00:30, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>If there is a sufficient range of sources to hand for a subject, neutrality is mainly a cleanup issue. The cases where non-neutrality is a deletion issue are usually when the topic itself is inherently non-neutral.

<p>I found this article in speedy-delete patrolling. The subject appears to not exist and is non-notable as a fictional character. Note that the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nelson_Wu_167a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nelson Wu">previous AfD</a> was closed early and the article speedy-deleted under CSD:G1 (patent nonsense), which does not apply to fictional entries. If the previous AfD had run its course I could have applied G4 (reposted content), but I could find no applicable speed-deletion criteria so I'm sending it to AfD. In my humble opinion (and after trying to track down this subject, real or fictional, and failing), the article should be <b>deleted</b>.

<li><b>Response</b> from: Jdobish 07:09, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm a little baffled by the logic of searching for combination of Accatel and Callcentric; what does that prove except that the 2 words may not be used often together. When searching for "callcentric.com" excluding their own domain there are around 1,190 hits.<br /></li>
<li>Wikipedia's guidline: <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> mentions under "Criteria for companies and corporations":
<ul>
<li>Section 1: "This criterion includes published works in all forms" - an example of this might be (if I am interpreting this correctly) the comments written here: <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/nsearch?boardlist=168&amp;cat=remark&amp;advanced=1&amp;168=1&amp;p=10&amp;o=r&amp;q=callcentric" class="external free" title="http://www.dslreports.com/nsearch?boardlist=168&amp;cat=remark&amp;advanced=1&amp;168=1&amp;p=10&amp;o=r&amp;q=callcentric" rel="nofollow">http://www.dslreports.com/nsearch?boardlist=168&amp;cat=remark&amp;advanced=1&amp;168=1&amp;p=10&amp;o=r&amp;q=callcentric</a></li>
<li>Section 2: "The company or corporation is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications" - While mentioning specifically <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_500.html" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a>, I assume Google Page Rank and Alexa ratings would be a quantifier. Google pagerank for <a href="http://www.callcentric.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.callcentric.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.callcentric.com/</a> is 5, and current Alexa statistics can be seen here: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.callcentric.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.callcentric.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.callcentric.com</a> of note are the 3 month change and 1 week average.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compared to some of the other companies listed here (which is the same category as Callcentric): <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_commercial_voice_over_IP_network_providers_964c.html" title="List of commercial voice over IP network providers">List of commercial voice over IP network providers</a> it would seem I have written this article in more detail, clarity, and neutrality than the others. Callcentric from what I can tell is more "notable" than some of the other companies/articles listed at that link. No offense taken, but disconcerting that this is my first article and I actually spent time reading the Wikipedia policies, suggestions, etc; and the end result seems to be deletion. Jdobish 07:09, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b>: as I noted at the talk page, I appreciate your efforts and hope you don't get discouraged, but: the dslreports link you give is trivial coverage (forum posts, not journalistic articles); an Alexa ranking of more than 100,000 is not very impressive (I don't know what a Google pagerank is); and the fact that there may be other articles worthy of deleteion which are not deleted yet is no indication that this article should be kept either, only that those other articles should be up for deletion as well (and they maywell be, once some editor notices them). I have noticed this article since it was a new one, not because it is somehow worse than all those others. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:33, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, the second criterion is <i>not</i> inclusive of Google PageRank and Alexa. Those aren't akin to the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_500.html" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes_500.html" title="Forbes 500">Forbes 500</a> in any way. For starters, and in many ways this isn't even the most significant difference, <i>what they rank are not companies</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:55, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This looks like an advertisement for a small company, not an encyclopedia article on a notable company. The comparison to other VoIP providers made this appear obvious. George J. Bendo 09:52, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The cites in the article appear to show that he is a local radio and TV personality in 1 town in Australia who had a record which was a local hit. There is a passing reference in <s>the local paper</s> a national paper. The cites are mostly local fansites. No real evidence of notability in the form of multiple independent national mainstream press coverage.

<p>Wikipedia is not a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">game guide</a> is my biggest concern here. Initally prodded, the prod tag was replaced with "This article is NOT to be used as a game guide. It is present merely for reference purposes. Any of the following information can be found in various strategy guides, magazines, and online articles published by Nintendo or other reliable third parties". But looking at some choice selections of the text I see things like..."Charge Beam can be combined with the Bomb: by charging up and then changing into the Morphing Ball, a five-drop bomb will immediately be released.", "...multiplayer levels, and is extremely well-hidden... except in the arena Head Shot, where it can be found easily.", and "This is the most effective way to kill many tough enemies in many Metroid games - particularly Metroids themselves..." i.e. things that would only be relevant to players of the game, a game guide. If someone wants to <b>move to gaming wiki</b> that's fine, but I don't think this belongs on the wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 20:34, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Exactly. After looking the article over, I admit it needs some cleaning, and perhaps some of the less notable items could be removed. But someone unfamiliar with the Metroid games, reading about, say, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samus_Aran_0854.html" title="Samus Aran">Samus Aran</a>, who wants to know about her Power Suit and its abilities, comes to <a href="../../../i/t/e/Items_in_the_Metroid_series_209c.html" title="Items in the Metroid series">Items in the Metroid series</a>.

<li><b>Rewrite</b> There are far, far too many spoilers abound, and most of them aren't even necessary. "Murder Beam" also needs to be removed.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERuss_is_the_sex_e86f.html" title="User:Russ is the sex">Russ is the sex</a>; LLR is a landmark label for Chicago music and many of those artists have gone on to national success (The Academy Is..., Gatsby's American Dream, and Hidden in Plain view). It seems that because the external links lead to the founders' myspace pages rather than "official" pages that the label must not be important. But, as Russ explained, LLR no longer exists so there is no website.

<p>Comic makes no assertion of notability. Searching for <i>"John and John" comic -wikipedia</i> gets about 27k google hits, but the results are obscured by references to unrelated topics. As far as I can tell, this comic isn't published anywhere except its own site.

<p>The article makes no claims to notability for this comic. Searching for <i>"Arthur, King of Time and Space" -wikipedia</i> results in 591 results further suggesting a lack of notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>"Arthur, King of Time and Space" -site:wikipedia.org -site:answers.com</i> is more useful, as it reduces the number of false negatives from sites that mention wikipedia and the article on the same page. It wouldn't make sense to penalize an entry because people talking about it were citing <i>us</i>, do you think? Performing the search as mentioned does not significantly enhance the evidence for notability. (680 results, though it is the number one result for the title even without quotation marks, and seems to have a google pagrank of 5 of 10, alexa rank of 845,539.) 68.250.175.194 21:10, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As far as I can see, this comic is about 2 1/2 years old.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The term <i>long-running</i> in the original poster's comment probably refers to the comic having 903 consecutive daily updates since it's appearance online by it's current name. This would be equivalent to a run of 5 and 3/4ths years for a Monday/Wednesday/Friday comic, a mark few non-notable comics reach. The regularity and reliability of his updates is very unusual amongst webcomics artists; Gadzikowski is a surviving participant in the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Grind_Iron_Man_Challenge_b2a7.html" title="Daily Grind Iron Man Challenge">Daily Grind Iron Man Challenge</a> which has run more than a year and a half at this point. Gadzikowski is likely to continue this run indefinitely - he seems to have been cartooning daily since 1976 (yes, hard to verify) and has stated that: <i>I intend to tell the story of King Arthur in real time in daily panel gags over twenty-five years...</i> In light of his current productivity this seems probable.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Definitely could use some cleanup. It's a relatively long-running regular comic, though (since 1999), and a search without the subtitle turns up better results.

<p>I have noticed that a lot of reasonably long - running webcomics, with good art, have been up for deletion in recent months. Any idea what the cause of the trend is? Examples: TwoKinds(Averages about 6th on TopWebComics), 21Cf, Alien Dice(Keenspot) Bob and George, Zap!, Catharsis, Better Days... Does something have a grudge or something? And this while comics such as God mode are on the list, despite having no wikipedia page. 86.137.97.67 17:44, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Comic mentions cameos of several other notable webcomics. I assume these cameos were made with permission? References from other notable webcomics would make this notable (it's why I try to note other webcomics that have referenced a given comic), the same way an obscure book being referenced by a notable book is made more notable by the reference. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 07:31, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I haven't done a google search for notability, but this was making the old internet rounds a couple years ago - my wife was a big fan of the Cat Town website which included "musical performances" (some based on Chicago musical numbers - ah, THE MUSICAL EPISODE, as it's linked). That said, I think there should be more to this than self-reference links - why should this be in the encyclopedia? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 00:32, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - This webcomic does not even have its own domain...sorry, but simply not notable, not important. Google for "Cat Town comic" brings up the wikipedia article first, with the comic not appearing in the next 7 pages (All I could care to look at).

<li><b>Delete</b> Non-encyclopedically notable book. Wikipedia is not a library directory or Amazon.com. Possible promotional abuse of wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep?</b> (on <i>probation</i>?)

<li><b>Delete</b> It's just an advert for an as yet non-notable book. With any luck deletion will also put a stop to page's author spamming up the rest of wikipedia with links to it. <a href="../../../c/i/a/User%7ECiaranG_a34c.html" title="User:CiaranG">CiaranG</a> 18:19, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I saw the book in a store at the weekend and while it looks pretty, it has non-notable written all over it. I can't believe that it will ever be notable, and the original article's creator will not make any friends by creating links throughout WP. I'd almost suggest preventing re-creation, but I suppose it's theoretically possible that this book might become notable, in the same way as <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_As_She_Is_Spoke_b36e.html" title="English As She Is Spoke">English As She Is Spoke</a> became notable. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERingbark_23e5.html" title="User:Ringbark">Ringbark</a> 18:57, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: not (yet) notable enough to merit an entry. It has shot up the Amazon sales list since yesterday (when I clocked it at 25,000), but that's hardly significant. I very much agree with <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERingbark_23e5.html" title="User:Ringbark">Ringbark</a> about The Glory Boy's efforts to promote it in other articles - that's not helping.

<li><b>Keep</b> These two articles were in rather poor condition when I first came across them, and I have attempted to make significant improvements in order to bring them up to encylopedic quality. I feel that these two characters of the film are notable enough to have their articles as they are the prominent villains within the film. That said, I realize that the plot summary is rather excessive (especially for Tyrell) and not in line with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I will attempt to add further content and reduce the summary if the article is kept, as I cannot do immediately as I am extremely busy over the next week or so. If the article cannot be kept, perhaps it can be merged or redirected into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mask_%28film%29_b828.html" title="The Mask (film)">The Mask (film)</a> article or maybe a seperate article featuring the characters in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mask_d64c.html" title="The Mask">The Mask</a> universe?

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a strange and interesting case. A comic published by Mirage in 1989 (when TMNT was a breakout hit) would have been pretty notable. However, I can't find any evidence the thing was even ever actually published. <i>Hallowieners +Mirage</i> brings just a couple of WP articles and some unrelated stuff. <i>"Ryan Brown" +Hallowieners</i> brings just 3 results, 2 from Wikipedia and a 3rd from a <a href="http://forums.thetechnodrome.com/showthread.php?t=17177" class="external text" title="http://forums.thetechnodrome.com/showthread.php?t=17177" rel="nofollow">forum post</a> where the poster says they haven't been able to find the book but has seen art from it. Not necessarily a hoax, but maybe this got announced and even advertised and never released? Delete as unverifiable unless new info arises. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:29, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It sounds familiar. I'm doing some looking - first thought is that it was 1990 instead of 1989 though. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 00:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Sad delete</b>Well, the internet isn't probably going to solve this one. For something minor from before the internet, this isn't an unusual state of affairs. I suspect that the subject material is real, but either didn't get to production or only ran to at most a few issues (probably was just a one-off). The term "hallowieners" seems to be generally used as a term for kids trick-or-treating at Halloween, hence the other 1000+ ghits. So, this just doesn't seem notable, and hence should either be deleted or perhaps merged into the <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirage.html" title="Mirage">Mirage</a> and/or the articles for the authors. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 00:47, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Those doing verification searches, might take notice that the article title is more-than-likely misspelled. If this article was indeed written in good faith, the subject was more than likely spelled "<b>Halloweiners</b>." Now that I've pointed this out...I feel...rather ridiculous right now. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 05:02, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I had considered that. You get more relevant info with the spelling as it is in the article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 05:26, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Same here. The tiny shreds of evidence that do exist seem to support the Hallowieners spelling. <i>Halloweiners +Mirage</i> gets zero hits. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:41, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting. BTW, this sounds like the sort of thing that would be covered on <a href="../../../x/-/e/X-Entertainment_e3af.html" title="X-Entertainment">X-Entertainment</a>.com.

<dd>I tried searching Google Groups for the use of "Hallowieners" in Usenet newsgroups. The only occurrances that came up were in comic trade groups where someone had 1 issue for sale (most other comics listed had multiple issues). Perhaps, it can be concluded by this that it was only a one-issue comic, and as such, is probably not notable enough for an encyclopedia article (???). <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a></dd>

<dd>SUPPORT AfD - I performed the first edit on this podiobook article after it was created, correcting a misspelled word. But after rereading Wikipedia's policy, I agree with the AfD request, because there is nothing of substance to be said about podiobooks other than a basic description (dictionary) and a few examples (potential link spam). I think the concept of a "podiobook" is important enough to be mentioned in the <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcast.html" title="Podcast">podcast</a> article, but nothing more than that. <a href="../../../b/j/_/User%7EBJ_Nemeth_b3f9.html" title="User:BJ Nemeth">BJ Nemeth</a> 22:30, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Neutral</b> I was asked to comment by TruthbringerToronto on the notability but this is really not the kind of mathematics I would know much about.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - As a quick note, I should mention that I used Cvitanic's book in an undergraduate Economic Statistics course I took (and received an A in) so I might be a little bit biased. However, I believe Cvitanic meets <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EProf_bc6c.html" title="WP:Prof">notability criteria</a> based on the following chain:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3. The person has published a significant and well-known academic work. To be significant or well-known, <i>the work must meet one of the following criteria</i>:
<dl>
<dd>2. The work must be prescribed as a textbook, a reference work, or required reading in an undergraduate- or graduate- level course; which is not taught, designed, or otherwise overseen by the author; at several independent accredited universities.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I only know that the textbook was taught at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_College_d44f.html" title="Hamilton College">my school</a>, but I am pretty sure that other schools use it because the professor I took the course with participated in an experimental shared teaching program across several liberal arts colleges where each professor at each school taught an identical course (which would seemingly require the same textbook). I am sure (based on the academic accolades) that Cvitanic may pass another criterion which would be easier to show, but for now one should suffice. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 15:39, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This isn't an issue of grammar, this is an issue of the above not forming a coherent sentence. Minor grammatical problems are fine when they don't interfere with communication.

<li>(dumbfounded look) Think about it: "Keep schools in Wikipedia" means I believe schools should be kept in Wikipedia. In all seriousness, this is really about the way I voted, which you obviously don't approve of, and now you have to bust my chops for whatever reason. Remember, this is "the free encylopedia", meaning I can vote whatever way I want, for whatever reason, and am entitled to be treated civil.

<li>I'm sure it's quite possible to write things about a DMV that aren't directory-type information. Having said that, this discussion is entirely academic because no-one really writes about DMVs.

<li>Failure to examine hypotheticals is often an indication of not having a coherent explanation. I have a DMV in mind and have some sources for it, I'm not going to create an article to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> but given that I could, a straight answer on whether or not such an article would be kept would be helpful.

<p>An editor cleaned up all the original research here a few days ago and what was left doesn't really constitute an article on Jainism and Hinduism, but instead is a fairly decent start on an article about the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Bill of 2006.

<li><b>Delete ASAP</b> This is such a thinly veiled attack upon another lawyer that I would say it's not disguised at all. The article is an embarassment to the legal community, and not in a good way, either. According to the text of the article it would seem that the target of the article has sent out a mass e-mail message to a list of attorneys, and those people who received it will easily be able to identify the target of the demeaning remarks. The creator of the article in the edit history for his contribution to another article says he is the director of Virgin Islands Search &amp; Rescue. I don't know if that means he is a lawyer, but where I come from making an article like this would be a very, very bad thing for a lawyer to do. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 20:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>On November 4, Chowbak tagged image:Rebecca Cummings.jpg for deletion and now 4 days later after personally attacking mine and Rebecca's integrity he lists the article for deletion. You've got to question why the article wasn't listed for deletion from the beginning?
<ul>
<li>FWIW, I wasn't trying to personally attack anyone's integrity; I just felt you had a different attitude about information distribution. That's perfectly honorable, but it does put you in conflict IMO with Wikipedia's founding principles. That's all I was trying to say. I hadn't looked closely at the article before you wrote that; upon closer examination I realized I had no idea why there was an article about her in the first place. Please assume good faith, and don't take any of this personally. I always may be wrong, but I do act for what I honestly believe is best for Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 19:52, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as the original admin consulted on the image pertaining to this article, I think we need to exclude any debate on the image here... that debate belongs on IFD not AFD. As for the self promotion angle, I feel this article has a very good balance between fact and promotional content. The article as written initially I feel proved that she passes the WP:PORNBIO guidelines. My initial thought was that this was self promotion, having later found out that HeartThrobs was a friend creating the bio and that it did not violated WP:AUTO changed my initial deletion decision. Having seen the article as it stands now, and after review again of the content and the references, I still feel that a strong case regarding her WP:PORNBIO "notability" is put forward. I think this belongs to stay on wikipedia. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a> <span style="font-size:130%; background:yellow; border:1px solid black;">☢</span> 05:03, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's not any laxer than WP:BIO, it's just more specific. Point 3 is "unique, noteworthy contributions", and gives examples of beginning a trend or starring in an iconic or blockbuster feature. She has done neither. (<a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Jeremy_5f73.html" title="Ron Jeremy">Ron Jeremy</a> is iconic. Co-starring with him isn't, thousands have.) Being the first bisexual president of a nameless gay/lesbian/bisexual organization isn't unique unless the organization is notable itself - after all, there seem to only be three orientation possibilities, and somebody has to be first for each. Point 4 is "subject of a noteworthy news piece or controversy" and while the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Moines_Register_3e34.html" title="Des Moines Register">Des Moines Register</a> is a fine newspaper, the article isn't about her, it's about the fact she, among other relative unknowns, <i>has</i> a Wikipedia article, how surprising. We try hard to avoid creating news like that. Also note that the article is humorous, even satirical, pointing out such facts that her name - allegedly real - is "Cummings", while her promotion agent's name writing her Wikipedia article -- I assume that's <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeartThrobs_7211.html" title="User:HeartThrobs">User:HeartThrobs</a>? -- is "Goings". I chuckled out loud reading this line: "It's been said she is the most famous porn star in Iowa but she really is the only porn star in Iowa. The other one died this spring in a car accident in Vegas." Sorry.

<li><b>Comment</b> - well, <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> is certainly our resident expert, and his points were well made. For many of us though, Cummings seems to be in a "grey area", notability wise. While she's certainly hasn't achieved the notoriety of Ron Jeremy or Jenna Jameson (sp?), neither is she an anonymous model with a personal ad in the back of a men's magazine. I know that my next comment isn't really considered a valid argument, but if we can have articles about <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> characters or cartoon strips that only appear on Blogs, then a semi-notable porn star doesn't seem like such a big stretch. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 22:40, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think "an anonymous model with a personal ad in the back of a men's magazine" basically sums it up. She's a stripper from some Iowa town selling videos of herself on her web page. You'll get no argument from me that there are lots of superfluous articles on Wikipedia, but really, that way lies madness. We could never delete <i>anything</i> if "look at all these other articles that need to be deleted" was an acceptable argument... unless every single non-notable article was put up on AFD at the same time. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 23:06, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Now there's an amusing idea; nom it all at once, then sit back and watch the fireworks.

<li>Hi.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am quite verifiable, as are the slight accomplishments included in the wiki entry here referred. All of my books on this topic are currently available. I am arguably notable, as evidenced by a lifetime of dedication to the philosophies referenced within the wiki entry. And, I exist quite nicely, thank you.</dd>
<dd>However, upon review of the Wiki guidelines per entries of the sort under consideration, it is understandable that adjustments might be made. I might add that upon perusal of pages of this sort for comparison, I found mine fraught with far less of the self-aggrandizement and project-hyping so often found in vanity-type pages.</dd>
<dd>Thank you for your time keeping wiki nice and scrubbed, although as regards this occult topic, I might advise deeper research.</dd>
<dd>Thanks,</dd>
<dd>s</dd>

Wow. That was fast!</p>
<p>Again and understand, wiki is not my "thing", and i claim no vested interest in this matter. I, "saintstephen", have basically been having fun with the opensource nature of the database, posting absolute facts as regards my life. Specifically, my life in the Black Magick Community. And why not. In this specific arena, I have few peers.</p>
<p>Out of habitual curiosity i went to the reliable source link offered and scanned the guidelines, quickly, regarding scholerly research and the like. It would seem that deletion, or amendment, could be appropo, even though thousands others are aware of various established facts within the short bio.</p>
<p>I, again, have no personal interest in supporting the facts further.</p>
<p>Have at it. We suckle at the teat of half a`dozen ivory towers.</p>
<p><br />
Oh. Sorry about the snip AFD from the daily log or whatever. i dont even know what the hell that thing is. it looked like a demon at the gate. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Quadmona (<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadmona_2ca4.html" title="User talk:Quadmona">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Quadmona_794a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Quadmona">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Not notable - google search shows wiki mirrors, search for Polish string "wódka Wisła" doesn't show anything notable. Seems like a hoax or an ad for some minor product, and the language is very 'addy' (much loved as a highly-regarded export vodka and a sought after drink by Poles the world over).<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 21:20, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Given that at least one book has been written on this topic, the best option would be a Pubs in Balmain article. Certainly, this is a list of substubs.

<p>Wikipedia is not a memorial. Murders of this type are lamentably common.

<p>Robert A. West appears to have had his feathers ruffled. Because I deigned to question his continued removal of what I considered to be relevant information regarding the Daniel Brandt article he has decided to attempt to delete an article of mine.</p>
<p><b>Fact:</b> This article is of consequence because it has since become the basis for a charitable organization with 501(c)(3) status that was created in order to inform young women about potential abusive relationships.</p>
<p><b>Fact:</b> This article is of consequence because the Texas State Legislature will be creating a law in January '07 in her name and memory to award diplomas posthumously to students that died during their Senior year of High School.</p>
<p><b>Fact:</b> This article is of consequence because the Texas Psychological Foundation has created a memorial grant in perpetuity of $5000 / year for Graduate work related to studying violence against women.</p>
<p>Robert A. West's feathers aside, it is absurd that Wikipedia articles be so capriciously and callously deleted. Drew30319 22:38, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Although a memorial fund has been created and a scholarship will be created in 2007, neither of these are primary points in the article. This murder has been covered by all major networks in addition to AP and UPI. Drew30319 22:42, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Clearly this is not an assassination, but the event was newsworthy and the memorial fund that has developed as a result gives Crecente a certain amount of renown.

The state senator that is sponsoring "Jennifer's Bill" was re-elected and we have every expectation that the bill will pass. At that point I'd like to be able to re-use the appropriate content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, although it does not matter with respect to the apparent direction that the article is headed, it is not just a memorial fund and scholarship. There is an actual charity that has been created. The organization is incorporated and has received 501(c)(3) status by the IRS.</p>
<p>Again, this isn't stated to change any minds, but for clarification.</p>
<p>I feel comfortable with waiting until the legislation passes to be able to add the relevant info. Thanks for the constructive information. Drew30319 02:42, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wish <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Ann%27s_Group_866f.html" title="Jennifer Ann's Group">Jennifer Ann's Group</a> well: I can think of several friends (two now deceased) who desperately needed that sort of advice. Objectively, however, it is not notable, and cannot confer notability on Jennifer. Simply getting 501(c)3 approval is not notable. Any competent attorney can shepherd any reasonable proposal through the process. The routine publication of a press release or interview announcing the organization is termed "trivial" press coverage, and doesn't really count. I've served on the boards of a few organizations with more press coverage than this new org -- none of which I believe are notable enough to merit their own articles. There is a strong recommendation (<a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>) not to write articles about yourself, your family members or organizations in which one is involved. The idea is that, if the person or organization is really notable, someone else will write an article in due time, and that you cannot really be objective about it. Any strongly-notable organization has critics. Even <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Theresa_07ef.html" title="Mother Theresa">Mother Theresa</a> and the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalai_Lama_3904.html" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a> have them.

<p>A web forum that seems to fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I asked for sources on the talk page awhile ago and haven't received any responses. Googling only brings up a few dozen hits not from the BZPower itself. Was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_BZPower_23ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/BZPower">previously nominated</a> but was kept as apparently users back then didn't need to present any sort of logical argument. Anyway, the lack of independent coverage means it fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and it doesn't look like it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. As is, the entire article is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<li>In response to the "As is, the entire article is original research" claim, see this part of that policy: "Primary sources are documents or people very close to the situation you are writing about... An article or section of an article that relies on primary source should (1) only make descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) make no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, explanatory, or evaluative claims. Contributors drawing on entirely primary sources should be careful to comply with both conditions." Seems this is being ignored by you--just want to make sure this is brought up. As far as I can see, being a primary source myself, there is only a tiny amount that qualifies as OR, if anything. The basic facts of the site are easily verifiable, are correct, and are provided by a primary source, myself and others. Again, the issue is that more citations are needed, and as shown below, they can be. And let's not lose sight of the main reason the site is notable, as I stated in the last AFD, which concluded it should stay: "But I beleive that every site of note in the Bionicle community deserves reference; we're talking about the fan community of LEGO's most successful line, that helped save the company, and it is also the company that is more in-tune with its online fan community than virtually any other. There is just plain no justification for any arguement that sites like BZP or MoD do not deserve their own encyclopedic reference, unless you want to argue that the LEGO company is not noteworthy. I see nobody arguing that." --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonesiii_867a.html" title="User:Bonesiii">Bonesiii</a> 20:20, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First off, Wickethewok, you asked for sources 5 days ago. Do you expect things to just fly up within 5 days? Two weeks, perhaps is a fairer time, but you didn't even allow for a week.</dd>
<dd>Second, you say it fails the WP:WEB critieria. Then explain how BZpower was once linked to on BIONICLE.com, the official BIONICLE website, and has been noted in many online articles and such, yet you say they still fail?</dd>
<dd>Third, I'd like to comment in this SPA rumor. I am a pretty well respected BS01 staffer, and BZP member.

The opening comment on this page states "I asked for sources on the talk page awhile ago and haven't received any responses." -- I've been watching the talk page over the past month and this request came only last week. Not sure how wikipedia's policies define "a while" but that doesn't fit my definition.&#160;;) (All due respect.) And just a summary reading of these policies that BZP supposedly doesn't fit shows that yes, it does--the evidence just isn't cited yet (how could it be within a mere week?). Got real life to spend time on now, so must go... For starters though, BZP is often mentioned on other websites, and has been mentioned in print journals such as the AFOL magazine (adult fan of LEGO), so those citations shouldn't be that hard to find for anyone who has time to search... And of course, it has been very relevant to the LEGO company, so at least by my definition of "relevant" no sound arguement can be made that it isn't (I thought this was cleared up last time, lol). <b>Keep</b> --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonesiii_867a.html" title="User:Bonesiii">Bonesiii</a> 04:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>5 day waiting period with 5 days for AFD. If the information can't be verified in 10 days, something ain't right. And really, its not like there hasn't been warning - I mean, the article has been nominated for AFD 3 times already apparently since its creation 1.5 years ago. I could've even just nominated the article with no warning, but I figured that giving people twice the amount of time that is required by deletion process would be nice. If someone comes up with some sources, like, a month from now, the article can be reinstated, albeit with the removal of all the OR. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 06:44, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1) Google search: 77,900 hits. 18000 or so without the BZP domain name; admiddetedly a few of those are just the bzcommunity old domain name, but just browse the list yourself; that's a minority: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=BZPower+-site:www.bzpower.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=BZPower+-site:www.bzpower.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=BZPower+-site:www.bzpower.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N</a> And as mentioned before; fifth hit on Google search for Bionicle, topped only by Bionicle.com, Scholastic's Bionicle page, and of course the wikipedia entry for Bionicle: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=Bionicle" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=Bionicle" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=Bionicle</a></dd>
<dd>2) Coverage on other websites not affiliated with BZP? BZP is the most-covered Bionicle fansite there is. A few examples: <a href="http://forums.maskofdestiny.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=forum;f=10" class="external free" title="http://forums.maskofdestiny.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=forum;f=10" rel="nofollow">http://forums.maskofdestiny.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=forum;f=10</a> <a href="http://www.mnonlinev3.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=1181&amp;st=240" class="external free" title="http://www.mnonlinev3.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=1181&amp;st=240" rel="nofollow">http://www.mnonlinev3.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=1181&amp;st=240</a> <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0211/S00055.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0211/S00055.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0211/S00055.htm</a> <a href="http://www.lugnet.com/cool/" class="external free" title="http://www.lugnet.com/cool/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lugnet.com/cool/</a></dd>
<dd>3) Also, as far as "previous warning" the past AFD nominations are hardly surprising--BZP has many enemies (see the Criticism section of the article), and from my experience, that's what motivated those proposals, not wikipedia policy. By the way, wiki policy did come up, and according to the first AFD: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/BZPower" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/BZPower" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/BZPower</a> BZP does meet Alexa standards. No idea why that is now taken the opposite way, but something seems inconsistent here?</dd>
<dd>4) The vanity accusation is certainly a fair concern, and I of course am a staff member there, so you'd be correct to be cautious about what I say. However, that also means I know what I'm talking about, and as I stated, the policies being linked to appear to qualify BZPower for inclusion. And as I said in the last AFD, we don't need wikipedia advertising.&#160;;) We became the most popular Bionicle forum long before wikipedia ever had an article on us (and we did not originate this article, as stated in the first AFD). And finally, if I was interested in having an article for advertisement's sake, why exactly would I be leading efforts to include a fair criticism section?</dd>
<dd>5) It appears that there's a tendency here to discount anything an expert on a subject knows--this is a little disturbing, and I hope that will not be the case with my logic; the guideline at the top of this page makes the claim that it's the logic that the decision is based on, not a head count. And for the record, I may be a staff member now but I had no idea BZP existed for 2 years after it was founded, so I would consider myself to be partly an independant source (and if you want actual independent sources, see the google search&#160;:)). This "original research" guideline appears to be questionable, as stated here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Notability_%28web%29#Expand_The_Criteria.21.21" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Notability_%28web%29#Expand_The_Criteria.21.21" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Notability_%28web%29#Expand_The_Criteria.21.21</a> , though the basic idea makes sense to me. But the facts listed on this article are well-known and often mentioned on sites outside of BZP, such as Mask of Destiny, Mata Nui Online (again, see the google search); they are hardly "original" research. They just need cited better, admittedly.</dd>
<dd>7) Also note; much of the notability claims made were stated by Greg Farshtey, the author of the Bionicle books, though he didn't print the statements, lol. He is not affiliated with BZPower, but LEGO company instead; many of the citations in the article already cite his statements, so this would count as well as independant sources, as I understand it, and is easily verified simply by asking him (member name=GregF at BZP, he's also on Mask of Destiny with his own forum division). It appears possible these citations are being discounted merely because they are posts on BZPower, which to me would be invalid since they were not posted by BZPower staff but a LEGO employee; and not just any but the author of the books, the comics, lead member of the Bionicle story team, etc. Also probably worth noting that two BZPower members had the published Bionicle Encyclopedia (see Amazon page: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bionicle-Encyclopedia-Stickers-Greg-Farshtey/dp/0439745616" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/Bionicle-Encyclopedia-Stickers-Greg-Farshtey/dp/0439745616" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Bionicle-Encyclopedia-Stickers-Greg-Farshtey/dp/0439745616</a>) dedicated to them for their help in providing the content of that book (Crystal Matrix, founder of Biosector01 reference and my fellow BZP Reference Master, and Pekel, current owner of half of BS01 (note that that site has ongoing issues with a technical glitch that is still being resolved but was online at the time the encyclopedia was being written; details here: <a href="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?showforum=45" class="external free" title="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?showforum=45" rel="nofollow">http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?showforum=45</a>), one of the BZP reference keepers and forum assistants, and a contest I ran on BZP, incidentally, decided a small part of the content to that book ( <a href="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=29&amp;t=156654" class="external free" title="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=29&amp;t=156654" rel="nofollow">http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=29&amp;t=156654</a> ). You can see the discussions ongoing currently for the second edition of that book on BZPower here: <a href="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=229663" class="external free" title="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=229663" rel="nofollow">http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=229663</a></dd>
<dd>8) So again, my conclusion: logically I see no need to delete the article prematurely. The "Trivial coverage" and "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators" criteria can be met under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, as can the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> verifiability requirement (and part of that has already been met). If citations can't be provided later, say in a month, that action would make sense; either way, I am willing to take the time later to make sure a re-added article has appropriate citations. It just wouldn't be very helpful to delete the archives of the current article.&#160;;) Heck, just in this comment alone I've got tons of citations; will try to find time to add them this weekend to the article. --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonesiii_867a.html" title="User:Bonesiii">Bonesiii</a> 13:52, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

How can you read that and say BZP is "<i>not</i> the <b>subject</b>... at all"? Also, how does he "just happen" to be the webmaster of the site? You really think that Binky would be considered for the job of webmaster for LEGO.com if he was just another AFOL on Lugnet, not an accomplished admin of BZP? That <b>is</b> called being a subject. Not the main subject, sure, but the term "main" does not appear in the guidelines. In fact, your comment actually backs me up even further if you look at the exception, trivial mention. Obviously, Bink's mention of BZP was not trivia. I really don't see why you are still arguing here--the policy says that if <b>any one</b> of the requirements is met, the article qualifies. So BZP does, does it not?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as to what Bones said. Also, I've looked over the article and it only has one "citation needed" template, which happens to be after "Farshtey has also joined many other Bionicle-themed forums." I'm not saying this is the only place it needs a citation, but, it is the only part you guys say needs a citation. This sentence appears to be difficult, if not impossible, to find a citation to. You COULD link the the MoD section for Greg, but that doesn't cover the other sites. I already added a citation to the Greg/BR thing, and Bones could probably find a suitable citation for the other sentence.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I was tempted to close this, but instead I'll give my opinion as to why it should be deleted. Firstly, the vast majority of the article is original research - to qualify for inclusion the facts need to be cited from reliable sources, not written from the experiences of somebody who is personally involved. Secondly, the article has been around for over a year and has already gone through a number of AFDs, so the claim that there have <i>only</i> been two weeks available to provide references is nonsense. All articles need referencing from day one - if you can't find a reliable reference for the information you want to include then don't include it. Thirdly, the sources provided in an attempt to prove its notability are either trivial mentions or not what we regard as reliable. BZPower is not the subject of the article quoted above - it is mentioned in passing by somebody with a vested interest. Arguing that its notability is intrinsically linked to Lego is a fallacy. If it is kept, any editor would be quite entitled to strip it back to the couple of facts verifiable from the sources. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 16:54, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is about a list with no historical origins and is not and cannot be quality encyclopedic content.</p>
<p>I don't really see any good reason this article should exist. First of all, there is no evidence that such a list existed in any historical context. Secondly, there is no definitive list--it's basically a compendium of top sights lists in various travel guides. Third, many of the sites listed are not of Medieval origin (i.e., the Taj Mahal, Stonehenge, The Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa, most of the Great Wall of China, the Hagia Sophia and the Leaning Tower of Pisa--the bulk of the list).</p>
<p>I recommend deleting this list to avoid further confusion. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Bastian_b6cf.html" title="User:Phil Bastian">Phil Bastian</a> 22:52, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Delete</b> unless better references can be found. The article itself states that it's "a list whose origin and make-up is unknown. No scholarly resource is known to mention it..." This plus the overwhelming reliance on one website as a source brings up <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> concerns. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 00:08, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. I wrote this article, actually re-wrote it. I did a lot of research and could not find any scholarly source that mentions it (which is probably original research on my part to say so in the article). I suspect this list is real and was created by Enlightenment or Romantic era authors (late 17th to mid-19th centuries), which is why many of the sites are not technically "medieval" - this was <i>before</i> clear lines of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodization.html" title="Periodization">periodization</a> came about in the 19th century - but obviously <i>after</i> the word Medieval was created in the Enlightenment era. This is similar to the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World_9081.html" title="Seven Wonders of the Ancient World">Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</a> list, which was actually created by Medieval authors who were romanticizing the ancient world. Many sources mention the list, and its exact make-up will change depending - this is typical of the "wonders" genre.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To summarize:
<ol>
<li>Just because a list has many <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vicissitudes" class="extiw" title="wikt:vicissitudes">vicissitudes</a> doesn't mean it can't have an article. <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magna_Carta_56fc.html" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> has this same problem, there is no single Magna Carta. It's really more of a type or genre than a single list.</li>
<li>The list is probably real from either the Enlightenment or Romantic eras, based on word etymology of "medieval", the choice of sites, and what is known about other "wonders" lists - making lists of "wonders" is a common genre that has been on-going with every generation since the ancient Greeks. <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanticism.html" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> in particular is defined by its fascination and "romanticizing" the Middle Ages.</li>
<li>The way the article is worded now may be original research on my part and should not preclude that there really are some scholarly sources that discuss this particular wonders list.</li>
</ol>

<dd>I hope others might take an interest in helping further research it, and refine the wording of the article.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> -- while I am away from my sources at the present, once the classical list of 7 Wonders became known to the medieval world, then-contemporary lists began being created.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> <s><b>Delete</b></s> the sourcing just shows that <i>someone</i> considered that some of these 11 wonders to be among a non-existant canonical seven (to mirror the ancient world). The problems are as myriad as the potential sources: like a list of the seven best films of all time or the seven most important inventions, or the seven most influential ideas, etc. Pure POV collection. Also problematic is that most of these 11 wonders were not "of the Medieval World"; best I understand the medieval times really only apply to the so-called Western World and are somewhat bounded (roughly, hence ambiguously) by the fall of Rome (476) and the fall of Constantinople (1453). The term is usually reserved for the "Western World" because these events had great meaning there and would have been just random dates elsewhere. Using the roughly 1000 year period to define the Medieval: of the 11 items listed as the "Seven Wonders", only 5 -- Hagia Sophia, the Taj Mahal, the Cairo Citadel, Ely Cathedral, and Cluny Abbey, -- clearly fit in the time frame (2 of these 5 are not considered part of the Western World to which the term medieval pertains). Another 2 of the 11 may squeak in but only if we allow (POV) them: construction of the Great Wall of China continued into the period, but the majority appears to pre-date it; conversely, although construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa continued into the 1600s, the majority fits the dates. The Great Wall also is not part of the Western World. Stonehenge (prehistoric), the Colosseum (1st Century), and the Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa (2nd Century), all pre-date Medieval times. I could find no sourcing for the date of construction of the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, but it is outside the Western World. Conclusion: the list is purely a POV selection of other POV selections based on no objective criteria and is therefore not encyclopedic: sourced or otherwise. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 22:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Umm.. at Wikipedia, not only are we allowed to write about other people's POV's, we are encouraged to do so. <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiable_e5a8.html" title="WP:Verifiable">Verifiability, Not Truth</a>. See my comments above about when this list was created, and what "medieval" meant to them. It is a modernism to hold this very old list up to current professional standards and then tear it down as inaccurate. Inaccurate to who? It's probably not even an academic list, more akin to the tastes of popular culture sometime between the late 17th and 19th centuries. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 22:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If that were the article, it should better be titled Late 17th through 19th century views of what constituted the seven wonders of the medieval world, and the article's text would have to be significantly altered to buy into that proposition, and the sourcing should be of material or quoting material of that vintage, rather than late 20th and early 21st century travel guides. Since none of that is the fact, I stand by my position that this article is an uncomprehensive POV attempt by the editors here to identify 11 "wonders" without particular regard to time or place and label them <i><b>the</b></i> Seven Wonders of the Medieval World. That is POV, not writing about POV. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 06:13, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Uncomprehensive" is not a reason to AfD, that's called a Stub, Start-class or B-class article. As for being "POV", please do delete or change anything you believe to be POV, we can work that out on the article talk page. The article makes no claim to being an authoritative list of <i><b>the</b></i> Seven Wonders, in fact just the opposite, it has many qualifiers. Nor are the sources just recent travel guides.

Oh, and by the way, I'll edit whatever I please. Your protectionist stand combined with a keep just confirms that the article is <i><b>meant to be POV</b></i> and any POV that conflicts with yours should not be included nor yours deleted.

A trivial glance at the list shows that they are overwhelmingly not verifiable by watching the episode, despite assertion to the contrary. <i>"Jonathan tells Clark "you were meant for much more important things than winning football games". Glen Ford's Jonathan Kent, in Superman, says very similar dialogue."</i> That presumably requires watching the episode <i>and</i> another film; same with every other allusion that is to another film or the comics, they rely on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research by synthesis</a> between two primary sources. <i>"Clark is almost always seen wearing combinations of red, yellow and blue"</i> would require watching, well, every episode in which Clark wears one or more of the three primary colours, if not sourced to a secondary rather than primary source. This is why encyclopaedia articles must rely predominantly on secondary sources; this article is clearly reliant on primary sources and not appropriate for an encyclopaedia. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 14:20, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think this articles has been up for deletion before, or it was at least discussed before. The article, though probably on the crust isn't encyclopedic, the vast allusions that are constantly made reference to in the show make for some notability. Most shows do not do too much alluding in general, and this show has almost a half dozen references an episode. Most of this is not "crystal ball work" as just about all of the references are to previous things of the Superman history. There are certain elements that needs a source, but most is reference back to the comics or films, and can easily be verified by watching. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 00:11, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Probably <b>Merge</b> into the episode summaries, combined with <b>Transwiki</b> over to <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Smallville" class="extiw" title="wikicities:c:Smallville">wikicities:c:Smallville</a>. I have a hard time deciding where the OR line is here. Everybody assumes that the "Clark Kent" in <i>Smallville</i> is the same one that's in <i>Superman</i>... but is that citable anywhere? Ditto for any number of lesser references. It seems appropriate to link <i>Smallville</i> characters to their corresponding DC characters, but absent an explicit cite from the writers, it's technically OR to assume that merely because the name is the same and the character is similar, it's the same character. Reductio ad absurdum: If you see a news article saying that Bill Gates bought the Dodgers, can you assume that the article is talking about <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a>? After all, if they don't say "founder of Microsoft", they might be talking about some *other* Bill Gates. Where's the line? <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> says "It is legitimate to make ... straightforward logical deductions ...". That would seem to apply to at least some of the material here, and that material seems useful. Perhaps that would reduce this page to the point where the material could be moved into the episode summaries. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordan_Brown_fffa.html" title="User:Jordan Brown">Jordan Brown</a> 07:50, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article is an attempt to contact fans of a game and direct them to a website. The website does not appear to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>Weak Keep, Very Weak</b> This man is by no means a "run of the mill" academic, but the copyright issues are a big problem. And the article is poorly written. Sources? Terrible. POV? Yikes! My preference would be to prune this article <i>alllllll the way down to a stub</i>, because that's all the available source material can justify. I am persuaded that good source material is out there, but someone has to actually go out there and get it <i><b>before</b></i> posting the article on Wikipedia. How long will it take? Better still, if someone with good research skills will pledge to work on this article, maybe they can userfy it for some intensive work and then re-post. I would really like to see a good article on this man. Notability is not the only criteria (not that any real evidence of notability has been presented at this time.) Another option is to place this man's name on <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">Requested Articles</a>. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 01:49, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
