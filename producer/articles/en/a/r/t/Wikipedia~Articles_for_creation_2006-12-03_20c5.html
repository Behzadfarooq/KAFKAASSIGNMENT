<p>The Theories of the Press serve primarily to address the function of media in a given society. They attempt to explain the connection between government and the media and examine how that relationship affects the balance of freedom and control within a society. There are four original and widely taught theories which include Authoritarian, Libertarian, Social Responsibility, and Communist. A fifth more recent addition is the Developmental theory, however it has yet to gain popularity and acceptance among some scholars.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a name="Authoritarian_Theory" id="Authoritarian_Theory"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-03_20c5.html" title="Edit section: Authoritarian Theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Authoritarian Theory</span></h2>
<p>Authoritarian Theory developed soon after the advent of the printing press in 16th Century England made possible the establishment of the basis of modern mass media. This theory is a reflection of the general sentiment of the time that those in positions of authority and rank are responsible for guiding the lower classes. In this climate, presses were owned by the monarchy and used to distribute information approved by the sovereign, such as material supporting certain rulers and their policies. In this way, the ruling class sought to influence the "inferior masses" and made the press not a separate and free entity but a utility of the state.</p>
<p><a name="Libertarian_Theory" id="Libertarian_Theory"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-03_20c5.html" title="Edit section: Libertarian Theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Libertarian Theory</span></h2>
<p>Libertarian Theory resulted from the philosophies of the Enlightenment and essentially reversed the premise of the Authoritarian Theory. The Libertarian Theory upheld Enlightened ideas by demonstrating a belief that man is not a mindless creature in need of guidance from a superior, but rather a rational being able to make intelligent decisions when presented with diverse accounts and varied information. In this period, the press is seen as a partner in man’s quest to gain knowledge rather than merely an instrument of the state and therefore media becomes detached from the government.</p>
<p><a name="Social_Responsibility_Theory" id="Social_Responsibility_Theory"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-03_20c5.html" title="Edit section: Social Responsibility Theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social Responsibility Theory</span></h2>
<p>Social Responsibility Theory developed within the past century, almost in conjunction with the Communist Theory. Social Responsibility Theory is the prevailing attitude toward mass media in most modern western countries and can be most simply defined as a modernization of the Libertarian Theory in which the government and press remain separated but popular notions about the responsibilities of the media have evolved. Today there are few small media outlets and therefore less diversity of available information because in today’s economy, only large companies seem able to turn a profit. This consolidation and commercialization is largely responsible for the development of the Social Responsibility Theory because consumers of the media become more concerned with the integrity of the information that they receive and endeavor to hold the sources responsible to society.</p>
<p><a name="Communist_Theory" id="Communist_Theory"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-03_20c5.html" title="Edit section: Communist Theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Communist Theory</span></h2>
<p>Communist Theory developed in the same time period as the Social Responsibility Theory to describe the modern relationship between the press and the government in communist nations such as Russia. Like the Social Responsibility Theory, the Communist Theory is essentially an update of an earlier theory of the press- the Authoritarian Theory. In modern communist states as in earlier authoritarian nations, the government uses the press as a tool and employs strict censorship in order to achieve its goals.</p>

<p>The SS California was an early twentieth century, British Steamship built in 1923 for the Anchor Line. Weighing in at 16,792 Gross Tons it was subsequently bought by a private owner and entered the Merchant Navy in 1938. With War looming in Mainland Europe the British Government, fearing the extensive nature of German naval re-armament, brought as many seaworthy vessels as it could into active service to sure up channel routes and coastal defences. On the 11th of July, 1943, the SS California was attacked and set ablaze by an axis bomber whilst trooping. Critically Weakened, the vessel became a sitting target and on the very same day was torpedoed and sunk, off the coast of Oporto, by an escorting aixs destroyer and with the loss of some 46 lives.</p>

<p>Downunder Wrestling Xtreme A.K.A DWX is a local wrestling troupe located in Victoria, Australia.</p>
<p>The DWX roster consists of:</p>
<p>Joey Russel Jr., LSD, Blade (Current champion), Laser, Chuck E Chaos (Former WWA wrestler), Bradman, Slik Steve, Ricky "The Legend" Diamond, Bulldog, Stefan Cool, 69</p>
<p>Diva Roster:</p>
<p>Vixin, Desire, Delta</p>
<p>Tag Teams:</p>
<p>Warriors of Rock</p>
<p>Monthly Shows:</p>
<p>Hell Has Frozen Over, Doveton Domination</p>
<p>Tours:</p>
<p>Regional Riot Tour</p>
<p>Although DWX is a small band of wrestlers it is very entertaining. They have high flying wrestling action that the whole family can enjoy. As DWX grow in popularity I'm quite sure that we will see them competing with other wrestling companies as PWA.</p>
<p>DWX's shows have 6 matches including a diva's match. Although they are local they can really bring down the house with spectacles such as Street Fights and Table Matches.</p>

<p><br />
تا به امروز تاريخ اين ورزش براي مردم و حتي جماعت ورزشکار ( بجز عده اي خاص ) پنهان مانده است. کشف اين تاريخ و آشکار شدن رازهاي اين ورزش بر مي گردد به زندگي مردي تنها به نام تاگاشي که در دهکده اي در هيمالايا زندگي مي کرده است .</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>در سال 1907 طي سفري که اين مرد مصمم به شمال تبت داشت به کتابي چرمي که با زبان تصاوير سخن مي گفت دست يافت و 40 سال متمادي به مطالعه آن کتاب و مقايسه آن با کتب قديمي ديگر که تا آن زمان نگاشته شده بود پرداخت. بالاخره بعد از مطالعات دقيق و تمرينات پياپي نام اين کتاب را هفت راز نهاد ( وي براي هر راز شخصيتي خاص در نظر گرفت ) اين مرد دانشمند که بعدها استاد تاگاشي نام گرفت در نوشته هاي خود چنين مي نگارد : اين کتاب ( هفت راز ) مشتمل است بر نيروهاي اتمي بدن انسان و نيروهاي دروني وجود آدمي ، که اين نيروي دروني خود به هفت جزء پاک و طبيعي تقسيم مي شود .</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>وي در مکتوبات خود چنين توضيح مي دهد که در زمانهاي قديم اين دانسته ها و نيروها صرفا براي حفظ حيات و رفاه آدمي به کار رفته است. مثلا براي مقابله با طبيعت وحشي و حيوانات درنده، سرما و گرما و حتي براي صلح و هماهنگ انسانها .</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>بالاخره در فاصله جنگهاي متمادي که ميان انسانها در گرفت اين کتاب و دستورات آن از چشمها دور ماند و کم کم مطالب آن به دست فراموشي سپرده شد . البته دنياي صنعت پيشرفته نيز در اين امر نقش مهمي را ايفا کرد .</p>
<p>در سال 1947 استاد تاگاشي اقدام به دنبال کردن نقشه اي که در صفحات آخر آن کتاب قرار داشت نمود زيرا عقيده داشت اين سفر ، سفري است که توسط آخرين کساني که اين کتاب نزد آنان قرار داشته انجام شده است .</p>
<p>ايشان معتقد بودند که راز هفتم اين کتاب بايد تدريس شود و مردم بتوانند از اين راز عجيب آگاهي يافته و بهره ببرند. پس از 16 سال سفر در ميان کشورهاي نپال ، مالزي ، هندوستان ، اندونزي و آموزش اين رشته ، حدود 200 دانشجو را به گرد خود جمع کرد .</p>
<p>استاد تاگاشي عميقا اعتقاد داشت که دروس اين کتاب و فنون اين رشته نبايد مورد سوء استفاده قرار گيرد ، بنابراين همه شاگردان او در اين رابطه با وي هم قسم شدند .</p>
<p>در سال 1963 استاد تاگاشي به همراه 30 تن از شاگردان خود به کوههاي برومو که در شرق جاواي اندونزي قرار داشت رسيدند. در اين هنگام اين مرد خستگي ناپذير ، پي به راز ششم و هفتم ، يعني تصوير دروني و صداي دروني برد و بسيار بر قدرت و توانايي اش افزوده گشت . در سال 1976 استاد تاگاشي در گذشت. آرزوي قلبي استاد تاگاشي اين بود که از رموز و اسرار اين کتاب تمامي مردم دنيا آگاهي يابند ، سينه به سينه ، نسل به نسل آن را بياموزند و از هرگونه سوء استفاده از اين هنر خودداري کنند .</p>
<p>چند تن از دانشجويان که به درجه استادي رسيده بودند تصميم به گسترش اين رشته ورزشي هنري در کشورهاي مختلف گرفتند. يکي از آنها استاد لاينا بود که در سال 1977 پس از سفر به انگلستان شروع به تدريس نمود . در سال 1981 استاد لاينا موفق به تاسيس بزرگترين باشگاه کاتدا در لندن شد و از اين طريق توانست به دانشجويان کشورهاي مختلف و مليتهاي گوناگون ( اروپايي ، هندي و ايراني ) که مقيم آن کشور بودند ، تدريس نمايد . در سال 1987 به دستور استاد لاينا سه تن از استادان اين رشته که تحت نظارت استاد لاينا به درجه استادي رسيده بودند براي درک راز هفتم به کوههاي هيماليا يعني محل کشف کتاب توسط استاد تاگاشي رهسپار شدند .</p>
<p>دو تن از اين اساتيد ايراني الاصل و نفر سوم از کشور انگلستان بود ، هر يک از اين سه تن طي نقشه اي جداگانه به سمت کوه حرکت کردند و پس از تحمل سختي ها و مشکلات بسيار اين ماموريت را با موفقيت به پايان رساندند و به انگلستان بازگشتند. نام يکي از آن دو استاد ايراني ، امير لطفي بود . در اواخر همين سال وي تصميم گرفت درباره رشته هاي ديگر از جمله کاراته ، تکواندو ، کآي چاي آيکيدو ، جودو و سي لت مطالعه نمايد ، انجام اين مطالعات رشته مستقلي به نام نيرو که آميزه اي از رشته هاي مذکور همراه با سبک اصلي اين استاد يعني کاتدا بود ابداع کرد. وي در سال 1989 اين رشته خاص ( نيرو ) را در فدراسيون هنرهاي رزمي انگلستان به ثبت رساند، در سال 1991 به ايران آمد و مشغول تدريس اين رشته شد و کماکان در اين رشته فعاليت دارد</p>

Understanding Cholesterol</p>
<p>Cholesterol is something we all need for life, it creates certain hormones and it helps digest fats, by itself it is not harmful. Cholesterol also helps with the proper function of the nervous system. Cholesterol is either “good” or “bad.” What is Good Cholesterol (HDL) High Density Lipoprotein and Bad Cholesterol (LDL) Low density lipoprotein? LDL-the “bad” cholesterol creates fatty deposits called plaque on the arterial walls. This can result in decreased blood flow and oxygen to the heart. HDL-the “good” cholesterol removes cholesterol from artery walls and slows, or may even prevent, the development of plaque. We can say it takes cholesterol from body tissue back to the liver. A high level of cholesterol in the blood is a risk factor of heart disease. The 1987 report of National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panels suggest the total blood cholesterol level should be: &lt; 200 mg/dl normal blood cholesterol 200-239 mg/dl borderline-high &gt; 240 mg/dl high Where does cholesterol come from? Our body naturally produces all the cholesterol that we need, but we also get it from the foods we eat each day. The amounts of cholesterol in foods vary, depending on what it is. Animal products have cholesterol, but plants do not. Most Americans can put away 400-450 mg of cholesterol per day, when we should try and get no more then 300-mg daily. What can we do to reduce cholesterol levels? Eating less fat, especially saturated fats, we have seen if we replace saturated fats (red meats, bacon, butter and cream) with polyunsaturated or mono unsaturated ( olive oil), we will see a significant decrease in our cholesterol levels. Eating fish has been found to increase the amount of “good” cholesterol in the blood, and this helps rid the system of bad cholesterol.</p>

<b>Missle defence</b><br />
Missles have been used mainly as an attack weapon in the history<br />
Since they are small and their last trajectory part of a flight,<br />
is mainly a combination of speed and gravity missles are hard to defence against.</p>
<p>There have been a few systems to counter missle's.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The best known systems are<br />
- Shooting systems like the goal keeper, a granate machine gun system often used on ships.<br />
- Laser system, lasers so powerful so that they penetrate a hull (existing since 2000).<br />
- Anti missles, like the patriot a small missle that is fired to an incoming missle.<br />
- Microwave based systems, (still concept?)<br />
- Defence satelites (using a method from above but orbeting in space).<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Still attacking missles are a risk. For example ABC missles Atomics/Biochemic/Chemical rockets. Still contain a dangerous load even if they explode. Therfore early detection is required. Satelatis like the keyhole1 series try to detect launches, besides radar systems.<br />
Most systems are for the last past of the trajectory. Only space based systems act during the midway of an balistic rocket. While normal airplane bomb squads can destroy hardened launch pads of rockets.</p>
<p>(note i was a bit supriced that there wasn't a wiki article into this subject my text is realy small, but as starter other people can make it longer.)</p>

<p>■ Larry C. Glasscock directed the Anthem insurance company to record growth. Known for streamlining operations at numerous institutions, Glasscock went to work for Anthem in 1998. There he held the successively responsible positions of chief operating officer, president, chief executive officer, and chairman. He more than doubled the company's annual premiums</p>
<p>and oversaw its highly successful initial public offering in 2001, up to that time the largest for a health-care company. He was one of the architects of a merger with WellPoint Health, a deal that was expected to close in mid-2004, which would make the resulting company the largest managed care provider in the United States.</p>
<p>HONES HIS OPERATING EFFICIENCY Larry Glasscock was born in Cullman, Alabama, in 1948; in 1969 he married Lee Ann Roden. He served with the U.S. Marine Corps from 1970 to 1976 and then went to work for AmeriTrust Corporation in Cleveland, Ohio, where he had an 18-year career. In 1974 he began work as vice president of personnel and organization. In 1976 he became the vice president of the company's national division and, then, in 1978 was appointed the vice president and manager of the credit card center. In 1980 he moved on to become AmeriTrust's senior vice president of consumer finance. Another move, in 1981, saw him assume the duties of the senior vice president of the national division. In 1983 Glasscock was promoted to executive vice president of corporate banking administration and, in 1987, to group executive vice president. He held this last position until 1992.</p>
<p>Following his stint at AmeriTrust, Glasscock held the position of president and chief executive officer at Essex Holdings, another Cleveland-based company. He was also hired by the federal government as the president and chief operating officer of First American Bankshares, N.A., of Washington, DC. The bank had been owned by Bank of Credit and Commerce International, now defunct, and was reputed to have laundered drug money. International authorities closed down the operation, resulting in a loss to depositors of $2 billion. Glasscock was brought aboard to clean it up in preparation for sale. Upon completing that assignment, he went on to hold the position (1993–1998) of president and chief executive officer of Group Hospitalization &amp; Medical Services, which operated as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of the National Capital Area. The company was losing money, and he oversaw a turnaround and guided it to an affiliation with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland. From January through April 1998, he was chief operating officer of CareFirst, the resulting company.</p>
<p>SHEPHERDS ANTHEM THROUGH RECORD GROWTH In April 1998 Glasscock joined Anthem, an Indiana-based insurance company that, through subsidiary operations, supplied healthcare benefits to more than 11.5 million people. Anthem, the publicly traded parent company of Anthem Insurance Companies, was an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Glasscock joined the corporation as senior executive vice president and chief operating officer. Chief executive officer L. Ben Lytle had brought Glasscock into the company to help analyze and integrate the operations of several new companies that had been obtained through a series of mergers and buyouts directed by Lytle. In his first four months at Anthem, Glasscock, through a combination of early retirement and attrition, had lightened the corporation of hundreds of its middle managers, bringing the manager-to-employee ratio to roughly 1 to 15, from 1 to 8. He was promoted to president and chief operating officer in April 1999 and to president and chief executive officer in October 1999. In July 2001 Glasscock became president and chief executive officer of Anthem Inc. In July 2002 he was appointed chairman of the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare. With Glasscock at the helm, Anthem experienced record growth, and in the first part of 2003 Lytle picked Glasscock to be chairman of the board, in addition to his other responsibilities, when Lytle vacated that spot and became Anthem's presiding director.</p>
<p>In June 2003 Glasscock and Lytle were honored with the 2003 Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for financial services. From the time Glasscock joined Anthem in 1998, the corporation's annual premiums had more than doubled, and its 2001 initial public offering was the largest up to then for an Indiana company, Wall Street's 23rd largest ever, and by far the largest public offering of a health-care company at the time. Anthem was ranked on Barron's 500 list, the Standard &amp; Poors 500 index, and the Fortune 500 list.</p>
<p>ARCHITECT OF MERGER In October 2003 Anthem announced that it would purchase California-based WellPoint Health networks for about $16.4 billion. Approved by the Federal Trade Commission in February 2004 but still subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, the merger was expected to result in the creation of the country's largest managed care provider, with a membership of 26 million people from California to Maine. According to Glasscock, it was expected that under the merger the two companies would save $50 million in 2005 and $250 million by the year after that. The deal was projected to close by mid-2004, with the combined company to be called WellPoint.</p>
<p>News of the deal was met with mixed reactions. Benefit consultants speculated that savings from the consolidation of back-office functions and the elimination of some jobs might slow premium increases, which at the time were rising at their fastest pace in a decade. It was thought that big insurers who were eager to attract large, multistate employers as clients might become more competitive in the wake of the merger. Other analysts believed that competition might be hampered should smaller insurers be driven from the market, which could fuel price increases. Doctors were also concerned that the merger marked a nationwide trend toward a health-care system governed by a handful of publicly traded corporations operating primarily for the welfare of shareholders.</p>
<p>In April 2004 it was announced that for his role in the pending merger, Glasscock would receive a merit-based performance bonus of $42.5 million, in addition to his regular salary and bonus, paid out over the ensuing three years. In 2003 Glasscock earned $3.6 million in salary, and his outstanding stock options, said to be worth no less than $22.9 million, were to fully vest at the sale's close.</p>

<p>Michael Kashalos was born in Assia, Cyprus in 1885.</p>
<p>He worked as shoe-maker until the Second World War and then turned to mirror decoration and painting on glass. He also made decorative clay and plaster objects and copies of ancient finds. In around 1957 he took up painting and gradually devoted himself entirely to it. He was predominantly self-taught, although attended a few icon-painting classes at the Elementary School given by the teacher and iconographer Kyriacos Pierides.</p>
<p>In August 1974 was seriously wounded by the Turkish Army which invaded his village and died later, on 31 of August, as a refugee in Larnaca. He is considered the father of contemporary Cypriot Naive art. His work can be found in many places including the State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art, the Cyprus Folk Art Museum, the Cultural Centre of Popular Bank and in various private collections.</p>

<p>The Honourable Robert Arthur Riversdale Waldegrave was born in 1989, into the aristocratic Waldegrave family of over 600 years(see also Earls Waldegrave). He is tall, thin, and in possession of ginger hair. His name of peference is Riversdale, a choice which appears inexplicable. He was educated at The Hall School, London, and Eton College. He is currently in the process of applying to read Oriental Studies at Pembroke College, Oxford. Although once thought to be the favoured Waldegrave son to assume the succession of the title of Earl Waldegrave, his new-found drunken debauchery, sexual promiscuity and tendencies toward the political standpoint of Anarchy, has led various spokespeople to doubt his suitability. However, his educational career continues unabated, under the guidance of Dr. David Eltis, the well respected Historian, author of 'The Military Revolution in Sixteenth-Century Europe,' inventor of 'Flying Chess,' a three dimensional variant of the original game of chess, and a producer of many plays, which he has failed to publish as of yet.</p>

<p>The Reejers are a colorado based band.</p>
<p>Ranging from a gigantic wall of swirling atmospheric sound, to a single road worn acoustic guitar. Every performance is a unique event and never lacking in emotional urgency. Adorned in volume or stripped to the bone. The songs are an accessible stream of melody and raw emotion. The Reejers have crisscrossed the United States a dozen times since 1992 attaining a fanatical following in the big city and the small forgotten towns. Forever expanding an already impressive collection of original songs. The selections below are from their second full length indie record, 'Erased'. Eleven original tracks that take the listener on an aural journey through ambient landscapes. They create a unique sound by combining folk with the aggressive edge of rock. The album was recorded at Warzone studios in Chicago. This band has contributed songs to three nationally distributed compilation CD's, Aware II, Shmowballs, and Chicago subdisc. The Reejers are also featured on the soundtrack of the motion picture 'Motiff County'.</p>

<p>XEntertainment.org is a website created on July 23, 2004 by James Gaudet, an entertainment researcher for the XEntertainment Organization. It features a wide field of material on everything from what are aliens, is there a bigfoot, mysterious sea creatures, Bushisms, jokes and quotes, Native Americans (Indian) and Wolves, Predators, an excellent site on cars featuring all the known manufacturers. All literature is backed up by major sources in the specified genre, research and sample sounds.</p>
<p>Jimmy origionaly desgined the site as a one stop portal with easy access for users who were sick of having to bookmark and/or look up news, info, entertainment etc. With everything compiled in one place and updated daily it is of great convinience to anyone on the net. The format of the site is dual frame allowing the user to listen to music while they read an article. It also utilizes an expansive series of menus to allow the user to launch into a bevy of other sites while still having all the options of the main page. It is very easy to navigate and its even easier on the eyes. XEntertainment.org is set in a black background with a light blue text that allows for easy and long time viewing without the burn in and dull charecteristics of the standard boring black and white. The site also has a translator for worldwide acceptance and a word crawler to bring up any word in any of the pages.</p>

<p>Demethylases are <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzymes.html" title="Enzymes">enzymes</a> that remove methyl (CH<sub>3</sub>-) groups from proteins and other substances. They are utilized in a variety of processes, such as in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemotaxis.html" title="Chemotaxis">chemotaxis</a> signal transduction. A good example of a demethylase is the activated (i.e. <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphorylated.html" title="Phosphorylated">phosphorylated</a>) form of the CheB protein, which demethylates MCPs (<b>m</b>ethyl-accepting <b>c</b>hemotaxis <b>p</b>roteins). MCPs sense extracellular attractants and repellents in bacteria like <i><a href="../../../e/2E/_/E._coli.html" title="E. coli">E. coli</a></i> in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemotaxis.html" title="Chemotaxis">chemotaxis</a> regulation. Because CheB removes methyl groups from a <a href="../../../g/l/u/Glutamate.html" title="Glutamate">glutamate</a> and creates, as a result of this demethylation, a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methanol.html" title="Methanol">methanol</a> and a <a href="../../../g/l/u/Glutamic_acid.html" title="Glutamic acid">glutamic acid</a> residue, CheB is more specifically termed a methyl<a href="../../../e/s/t/Esterase.html" title="Esterase">esterase</a>.</p>
