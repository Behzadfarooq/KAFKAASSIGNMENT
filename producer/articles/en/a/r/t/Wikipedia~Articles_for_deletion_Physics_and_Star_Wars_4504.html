<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Move some/most of the current content</b> to Technology in Star Wars, <b>Stubify</b> the Physics article and <b>Slap a big Rewrite Needed notice</b> on both articles. There are certainly enough "star wars technical physics info" (the Ewok genocide and whatnot) and star wars fans out there to bring this up to the level of the Physics and Star Trek article i.e. actually about physics and star wars rather than the current technology listcruft which has little or nothing to do with discussion of physics <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 14:27, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or are we going to have Physics and Lost in Space, Physics and The Incredible Hulk, Physics and War of the Worlds, Physics and Bewitched, etc. etc. hopefully these will all be red links and it seems that the discussion of why fiction needn't follow the laws of physics is not really encyclopedic.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> True, it is fiction, but the average movie viewer probably doesn't have a whole lot of physics knowledge and may not know what's fiction and what's fact. Perhaps Kchase's suggestion of a Physics in science fiction article would be a better way to go, but that can be discussed outside of AfD. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 21:32, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> with added phenomena. These are both extraordinarily popular sci-fi dynasties, but if there are any more of these articles, it might be worth creating a Physics in science fiction article or the like and merging all of them. Some things (like sound in space), are common problems.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 11:02, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but needs an expansion or improved standards tag 24.9.10.235 23:35, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Extra strong delete.</b> This is an article interesting only to a niche audience. Most of the 300,000,000 inhabitants of the United States, for example, where the film was produced, would not choose to read any of this without a financial incentive. Since Wikipedia was designed in part for low-income children who are probably more worried about having enough money for lunch rather than enough money to buy Star Wars toys, I think this should go. It violates the spirit of the project. I can't imagine a kid in a missionary school in Kenya caring about this or even beginning to understand why it would be important to anyone. Wikipedia is not paper, but the flagship Wikimedia project should have an image to uphold and the thought of someone finding this on Special:Random pages is an embarassment to me. I'd also support <i>transwiki</i> to an appropriate Wikia project, such as Wikia or a Wikibook on film production. Erik the Rude 11:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This article should be deleted because Wikipedia, rather than being for anyone who wants to learn, is actually for people who are too poor to avoid Star Wars merchandise and therefore should be protected from reading any article which mentions something which has a product attached to it? I have never heard of this or anything like this as a criterion for deletion. In fact it seems to me that this editor is displaying a bias towards a certain vision for wikipedia not shared by all who contribute.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, if we deleted every article which was interesting to a niche audience, we'd delete half of wikipedia. Personally, I'm not a Star Wars fan (see this article for reasons why <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/1999/06/15/brin_main/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/1999/06/15/brin_main/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> ) so I know the repeated insinuation made in this discussion that not only fanboys are interested in keeping this article. <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker">Lurker</a> 13:41, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> fails twice, firstly <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (unverifiable, read those refs and weep; no, Virginia, Wikipedia is not a reliable source) and secondly <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> (and this is original research as the absence of references shows). Whether it's starwarscruft and thus fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is more a matter of opinion, but from where I'm sitting it most assuredly is. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 13:09, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's a fair criticism that one of websites don't meet the letter of WP:V, but I think it is reliable nonetheless. The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Technical_Commentaries_8152.html" title="Star Wars Technical Commentaries">Star Wars Technical Commentaries</a>, source for two of the three phenomena I added, are written by an astrophysics postdoc who has (co-)written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/102-9258104-2822565?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Curtis+Saxton&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/102-9258104-2822565?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Curtis+Saxton&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">ten books on Star Wars</a> that <i>were</i> subject to editorial review. What's more, the homepage for the Commentaries notes that they were "greatly enhanced as a result of debate and discussion involving many correspondents". In any case, this article now meets WP:V far better than many wikipedia articles that have <b>no</b> sources. The other source <a href="http://exn.ca/starwars/home.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://exn.ca/starwars/home.cfm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> seems to be part of the Discovery Channel, as you'll discover when you click on the link in the top corner. I think that's certainly reliable.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 21:12, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
