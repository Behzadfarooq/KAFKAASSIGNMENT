I have a real problem with the idea that Wikipedia can allow its sysops to post false information, declare it uneditable, and say that I have to live with it. This is an example of the abuse of power at Wikipedia at its worst and I REALLY REALLY resent it.

<p><b>Overturn and Undelete</b> I would like the Church of Reality undeleted. It was originally deleted because it wasn't notable because it had only 3000 Google hits and it wasn't a 501(C)3 non profit. It now has 24,900 Google hits and is now an [http:// _tax_exempt_status/ IRS blessed 501(C)3 church].

<li>The reason that I gave in the original AFD discussion is as valid now as it was then. Nothing has changed to affect the status of this subject as mis-use of Wikipedia as a soapbox by its author. Marc Perkel has continued his self-promotion campaign and the number of Google Web results has as a consequence increased, but there is still no evidence that this religion has any more than 1 adherent. <b>Keep deleted</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:23, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>If it has extensive coverage, it doesn't matter <i>why</i> the author wrote the article. I'm not arguing either way yet (waiting to see if people think this new info would change the outcome of an AfD), I'm just saying. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 02:27, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Church of Reality <i>hasn't</i> had extensive coverage. Marc Perkel has created an extensive self-publicity campaign. (In the original AFD discussion I listed several of the web sites that he operates.) But <i>all</i> of the information about this religion comes from a single source, Perkel himself, and thus suffers from the original research, non-neutrality, and verifiability problems that such <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a> does. Even the coverage by Mike Malloy was <i>information sourced directly from Perkel himself</i>. No reliable sources independent of him had produced works of their own about it then, and Perkel has presented no evidence that any reliable sources independent of him have produced works of their own about it since. Perkel has continued his self-publicity campaign, of which it seems apparent that repeatedly submitting this same article to Wikipedia is a part, but this continues to be original research, a novel belief that has not been peer reviewed and accepted into the corpus of human knowledge, for the same reason now as it was then.
<p>Contrast the situation here with religions that are <i>not</i> original research. You'll find plenty of published works from multiple sources, that are independent of the subject, that deal with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>, and the like. (See the references sections of those articles, for starters.) There is <i>nothing</i> like that for Perkel's church of 1 adherent.</p>
<p>Keeping out novel concepts that have not gained any traction in the world outside of their creators (and the Wikipedia articles written by their creators) is part of the reason that we have a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a> policy. That a proponent is vociferous, and creates a huge self-publicity campaign, does not change that. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:35, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Abstain</b>, but as the admin who deleted it the 2nd time, I figured I should at least explain my actions. I saw the 2nd listing on AFD, compared the new version to the old/deleted version, and observed that they were substantially the same.

<li>The welcome was just a way of pointing out that I’m a meatpuppet wasn’t it? Shame on you for using sarcasm on a newbie!--BenE 04:24, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Honestly, I was <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> and welcoming you as a possible productive editor. I'll admit I was also pointing out you're new, so that whoever ends up counting viewpoints to determine consensus can take it into account at the end of the discussion. We really do love new editors, but they tend not to be well-versed in deletion policy. So I'm willing to call it partial sarcasm.&#160;;) -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 04:46, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm well versed in your deletion policy. It's simple. If is isn't Christian then it gets deleted. I am totally unimpressed with the censorship here. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcperkel_2849.html" title="User:Marcperkel">Marcperkel</a> 06:24, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's pretty ridiculous, you're not the only atheist editor here, maybe you should go take a look at <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_atheism.html" title="History of atheism">history of atheism</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Religion_6f56.html" title="Criticism of Religion">Criticism of Religion</a> and many more similar articles. If you want to be taken seriously you should drop the whole persecution and censorship act since it's completely groundless and juvenile. Noone has said your articles should be deleted on the grounds of religious outlook, it's the fact that there are only 348 unique google hits and you have yet to prove notability. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TheMidnighters</a> 06:43, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

I realize that the fact that I "like the philosophy" is irrelevant to this discussion, but that is why I'm here. I haven't posted before because I don't regularly spend time here.

<li>I agree with Geronmooo... there really are two separate issues here - validity of the COR, and the Internet/MSM "profile" of the COR. Clearly the latter predominates in this discussion. But it also probably not "censorship", as in active repression of an unpopular viewpoint. I would like the administrators to consider, though, that while I do understand their need to keep Wikipedia reasonably lean and free of self promoting pages, one of the nice things about an online encyclopedia is the ability to more easily include articles on interesting but not widely know topics. This might be a useful exception to the standard numerical rules<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMar10029_2c1b.html" title="User:Mar10029">Mar10029</a> 16:13, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep deleted</b> - I had actually heard about this web-site and visited it previously. My impression was that it is set up like a religion, but in 'Reality' is currently something more like a message board / social club for atheists. However, they still fall short on notability. There are plenty of web-sites with larger user groups and higher traffic which we don't include. I suspect that some of these accounts which are labelled 'sock puppets' are instead actually participants in the message boards there coming to Wikipedia for the sole purpose of voting on this issue. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson"><span style="color:yellow;background:red">T</span></a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CBDunkerson_ea5b.html" title="Special:Contributions/CBDunkerson"><span style="color:yellow;background:green">C</span></a></sub> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson"><span style="color:yellow;background:blue">@</span></a></sup> 16:34, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<b>Overturn and Undelete</b> I certainly doesn't matter what this hairball thinks of our church. Reality is what it is and will win against superstition and bigotry in the end. One doesn't even need "faith." (Pardon my dirty mouth.) One doesn't have to believe in reality. Reality will not be swayed by the doubts of unbelievers.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Overturn and Undelete</b> Sirs, I am a member of the Church of Reality. I do not know Mr. Perkel personally, but I am aware of your concerns that his desire to put an article on your site is merely an attempt at self-promotion. I do not believe this is the case. The church is a real (albeit small, relatively new and technically a charity) organization of those like myself, who feel that the injection of mythical deities into an otherwise rational debate of very pressing issues greatly hinders the ability of our collective effort to achieve practical solutions.</p>
<p>Before I became aware of the recent controversy of the posting, I was surprised when I found that your site did not have an article on the church. I had a mind to write one myself when the time became available to me. But, obviously, Mr. Perkel’s article would be more comprehensive (and definitely better written) than any I could write. Thus, with the utmost respect and appreciation for the work you do, and with the understanding that you must be vigilant of those who would use your wonderful resource as a platform for personal gain, I would like to convey my belief that Mr. Perkel’s motives are benefic and the cause just. Please reconsider the deletion.</p>

<p><br />
<b>Overturn and Undelete</b> I am proud to say that I, too, am a devout member of the Church of Reality, so I believe that you will have to retract your statment that our church has only one member. By the way, the usual disclaimers apply: I do not personally know Mark Perkel nor am I being paid by the church, nor have I accepted any reward or other perquisites for this statement. I just want you to know that we church members are serious about our membership and about our church, and I believe that you are perilously close to the application of a religious "litmus test". I believe you know that this would be the first step on the road to religious persecution of other sects with whom you disagree. Is that really what you want?</p>

<p><b>Overturn and Undelete</b> As an active member of the Church of Reality, I must take exception to your deeply offensive characterization of our Church.</p>
<p>Far from being a "parody" or "vanity site", the COR has recently been given 501C3 tax exempt organization status by the IRS - something I strongly doubt the Flying Spaghetti Monster (which you allow a site entry) has acheived.</p>
<p>By mocking our faith you've engaged in religious discrimination, which may be actionable under U.S. law.</p>

<b>Overturn and Undelete</b> The Church of Reality has only one member? Bah! A parody religion? spew. You should do some research. Marc equals one member, plus me equals two, so you've already lost, and as far as I can see there are many more devoted members of the Church of Reality. The CoR is a serious thang, it isn't there to make you laugh, it's there to make you think about reality and the world around you. I think the flying spaghetti monster just had his wings clipped.</p>

<b>Overturn and Undelete</b> Though created by Marc Perkel, the Church of Reality does have a following of more than just Marc himself. The Church of Reality is fascinating, I consider myself a member and I think what Wikipedia is doing is nothing more than religious censorship.</p>
<p>Toss aside what your personal beliefs are and understand that there are people, like myself, out there who dont subscribe to the standard Christian belief system that is so popular in the US. Is it that hard to fathom a religion based on what is real??? It seems a lot more valid to me because everthing Marc talks about is based on reality. Not faith in some non-existent being or entity that we are supposed to give our lives to.</p>
<p>I dont worship Marc Perkel. I dont worship the Church of Reality. I dont "worship" anyone or anything. I just believe in what is Real. Is that so difficult to swallow?</p>

<li>I guess there is no point in just posting a lot of angry notes from COR members who feel slighted, that is irrelevant to the Wikipedia vetting process. But it is a bit infuriating when something that yre is a lot of good stuff there, far beyond what someone would do for a parody. So I see why Marc reposted them here. But I would think that it would be fairly typical for people who feel strongly about a topic to only show up here when there was a DRV; unless you were really into the workings of Wikipedia, you might not know about the process at all.</li>

Dear Mr. Dpbsmith - We aren't all the same person. I dont post here or read this site unless someone calls my attention to it (like Marc did via email to all members). I have been interested in the CoR since the beginning and have indeed met, on more than one occasion, Mr. Perkel. I am a member. I am not Marc Perkel. But I suppose since you are so against Reality it would be easy to just pretend that people arent actually interested in this. I have been trying to promote the church to my friends, family and other people on my MySpace page. I want everyone to know about it because it is really the only 'religion' that is based entirely on what is real.</p>
<p>How can you give credit to the Flying Spaghetti Monster and not what is really REAL??</p>
<p>If it's real, we believe in it.</p>

<p>I have been at the CoR webpage for quite over a month now and I will verify what I know about the CoR. The CoR may have over 300 registered users, but you can look at the membership lists and view yourself just how active these members are. Maybe 10-15 of them are actually active, while 5 or so post everyday. Not very convincing.</p>
<p>The CoR, for what it is worth, defy logic and attempt to monopolize the concept of reality, declaring reality is only real if it can be measured by modern science. Any student of philosphy or metaphysics will easily tell you how incorrect this statement is, but it is something that the CoR tries to whisper into the ears of people.</p>
<p>Due to the blatant abuse of reality, I would vote to not allow them to be posted here.</p>
<p>For the most part, the CoR is a one man show. If your view doesn't correlate with the view of Marc, needless to say, it doesn't make it on the list.</p>
<p>If you wish to verify that I am a active poster at the CoR, feel free to verify <a href="http://www.churchofreality.org/phpbb/memberlist.php" class="external free" title="http://www.churchofreality.org/phpbb/memberlist.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.churchofreality.org/phpbb/memberlist.php</a> view membership by total posts/descending</p>

<p>All I know is 1) I've seen church of reality bumper stickers around town. 2) I can usually depend on Wikipedia to tell me what something is and find out what is behind it, whether it's credible and its pros and cons. 3) In this case I did get the information from WP (more or less), but only through digging through the deletion debates.</p>
<p>I have idea who Mark P is and am not affiliated with his organization. But it sure would have been nice to be able to bring up a nice, neutral WP entry and find out about all these controversies directly.</p>

<p>I just came to wiki to find some info on this whole controversy. I think anything which can spark this much vitriol absolutely deserves a Wiki mention.</p>
