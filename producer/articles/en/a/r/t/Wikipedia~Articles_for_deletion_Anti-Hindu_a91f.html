<dd>Note, The article lacks Reliable sources and these need to be clicked to verify their nature and if what they say is actually what has been referenced - <i>removed on verifying the sources</i> <s>I am not saying the article lacks source but the</s> article itself is denoting an adjective that is why it is used to qualify Prejudice (Anti-Hindu <b>prejudice</b>)in the very first sentence of the article.The term Anti-Hindu is therefore incapable of carrying the whole weight of the article.Do a dictionary search for <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/islamophobia" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/islamophobia" rel="nofollow">Islamophobia</a>,<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=anti-Semitism" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=anti-Semitism" rel="nofollow">Anti Semitism</a><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=anti-%20Hindu" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=anti-%20Hindu" rel="nofollow">Anti Hindu</a>,You will find that both the former exist but not Anti-Hindu.I am equally against the terms Anti-Muslim being elevated to denote a movement or philosophy - which is the reason the term - fear of Muslims or Islamophobia is used to denote that state of mind or philosophy - similar is the case with Anti-Semitism.Anti-Jew does not denote a widespread philiosophy of hate towards Jews while Anti-Semitism does.The absence of a term denoting the fear of Hindus or hate of Hindus could be an indication that such a philosophy has not gained a wider ground even though in individual cases there would be definitely be people who are Anti-Hindus, in the similar way that there will be people who are Anti Buddhists,Christians or Muslims.The term Anti-Hindu does not exist in academic discourse the way it has been portrayed in this article and hence does not deserve to be used as a head for an article that discusses systematic prejudice against Hindus.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a> 03:43, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please articulate your argument better.It makes absolutely no sense to me right now.All the HAF links are qualified as HAF links.HAF is an advocacy group like the Anti-Defamation League, which is allowed as a reliable source to explain their viewpoint (primary source) and to cite their activities etc. HAF is a notable and recognized group. Their partisanship may be a matter of debate, but they are reliable. Similarly, IndiaCause would not lie about the topics discussed as then they'd invite libel lawsuit. Thus, the facts are reliable.</dd>

<dd>The only worthwhile sources used are&#160;:1 educational on Wendy episode - scholarly interpretation whose comments on Hinduism were in academic perspective,few articles from rediff.com - editorial in nature.US State Department links mention the presecution of minorities in South Asian countries and are already covered in the Persecution of Hindus page.In short this is an interesting presentation of factoids and individual incidences.This page needs to go.Those who say the sources are fine and article is balanced need not look at the face value of the article - check the individual links.Most if not all are dubious <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a> 06:01, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, right. US Congress is dubious? What a sick joke. Plus, the HAF report is backed by Simon Weisenthal Center and acknowledged in the Washington times so it is backed up by reliable third parties and can be sourced just like ADL articles are sourced in anti-semitism article.All my sources satisfy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

TerryJ-HO is deliberately conflating the issue of Hindu Nationalism with the hate and bigotry against millions of Hindus who have nothing to do with any goddamn nationalist movement.Many anti-semites also conflate the issue of anti-semitism with the issue of minority Jewish Fundamentalism, does that mean antisemitism should also be put up for AfD?This is utterly disgusting!<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 01:40, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Which is why I have been careful to avoid potentially partisan sources unless backed by reliable sources.Also bear in mind that anti-Hindus often hide their bigotry behind claims to oppose Hindutva (like the user who filed this AfD), so any claims of "Misuse of anti-Hindu by Hindutvaadis" need to be carefully sourced lest we don't let anti-Hindu prejudices enter the anti-Hindu article itself.This is similar to many haters of other religions who mask their hatred behind opposition to radical sects in the religion (anti-semites who claim opposition to Jewish nationalism, anti-Muslims who claim opposition to terrorism, anti-Christians claim opposition to Christian Fundamentalism etc.).<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 03:46, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. It brings together collection of unrelated events and classifies them under term coined here. I see very, very disturbing trend to create "anti-everything" articles on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Move</b> - "Anti-Hindu" reads as a discriptor. Perhaps Anti-Hindu prejudice should be used, as the analog of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Christian_d3d0.html" title="Anti-Christian">Anti-Christian</a> redirects to; or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Hinduism_e40b.html" title="Anti-Hinduism">Anti-Hinduism</a>; or another title that is clearly a subject.

<li><b>Move</b> per ENeville above. I dont want to say it, but I hadnt heard this phrase before I came on WP, and that makes me suspicious, especially since I hear it on WP all the time now. Be that as it may, I think that prejudice against all faiths deserves an article on WP.

<dd>err... what pattern? could you be more explicit, please? Could the fact that you have been asked to justify your edits on a few pages have caused you to make that statement? Remember, any edit you make, you should be prepared to defend without losing your temper.</dd>
<dd>I did look at the links, which is why I voted move. The use of the term in the media is largely limited to rightwing groups. I think we have to be very careful about such terms, like <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraordinary_rendition.html" title="Extraordinary rendition">extraordinary rendition</a> or <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">islamofascism</a>.

<dd>Please be civil. That was a remarkably incivil statement, and a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. The names you mention are based on a superficial reading of the results. For example, the Yang, Ho, Kuver and Yang edited book is a collection of essays, in which one by Muthu Selvan uses the term in the context placing the motivation of flame wars on Hindu newsgroups. Note that you could equally well have mentioned Sumit Sarkar, who also uses "anti-Hindu", and is hardly rightwing. The point is not irrelevant that the term is used as a single adjective. Consider the following representative quote from Ashok Kapur "The British India government was acting on anti-Congress, anti-Hindu and</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>anti-majority rule premises." This hardly suggests that the term is in widespread use. Please note that I do not object to the content of the article, but the name strikes me as something of a neologism. Also, dont lose your shirt. If you have put work into editing the article, and your edits are sourced and NPOV, the work will not be lost. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 00:43, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didnt vote delete. I merely noted that I was 'suspicious' of the use of a term that I, even after having observed these debates in the real world, had not seen before. That suspicion crystallised on reading the linked results. Please note that I have not disagreed with the content of the article, only, mildly, with the article title. I find it extraordinary that it should provoke such anger. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 01:03, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you here. I don't see how it being renamed "Anti-Hindu prejudice" would be worthy of a fight. I'd think renaming <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Catholicism_6249.html" title="Anti-Catholicism">Anti-Catholicism</a> to "Anti-Catholic prejudice" would be unnecessary, but not worth fighting over. Only issue is that moving it is a separate issue, this is more of a delete/keep discussion. Although possibly rename could start being an option as it is with categories.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.
