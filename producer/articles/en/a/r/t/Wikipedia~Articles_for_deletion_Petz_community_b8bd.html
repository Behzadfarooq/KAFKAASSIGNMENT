Does Wikipedia really need articles about online fan clubs of computer games?</i> The article is currently linkless, probably since it was created in April, exactly 6 months ago. Reviewing the history, apparently only anonymous and very new people contributed to the article, plus some established ones tagging and doing some minor cleaning. Besides not being really encyclopedic, the article is currently a mixture of an external link repository and instruction manual. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 02:12, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The nom should note that this is not actually describing an individual community, but that there is a strong community for the games in question, which appear to be notable and to have a Wikipedia article themselves. I would suggest that this be <b>Delete</b>d, however, and that the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petz.html" title="Petz">Petz</a> article be expanded slightly to note the presence of its active online community. <a href="../../../i/m/b/User%7EImban_8637.html" title="User:Imban">Imban</a> 02:18, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not disagree with your comment. Note that in no place I stated this was describing an individual community, just informed why the article was originally prod'ed. My concern is that the topic may create a precedent for articles like Halo community, Half-life community, Digg community, etc, which are not encyclopedic unless correctly sourced and verifiable. Also, the article has been "hidden" since creation, as it has no wikilinks, no categories, no stub, etc, and has since then became a link farm. I agree with your idea of merging some information into the main article, but the current one is, apparently, unencyclopedic. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 02:28, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's clear that no one here has done any research into this community. To couple it with the article about "Petz" itself would be a sort of sin. "Petz" as it means to this community has nothing to do with the current programs by the same name. The following of these old and dead games borders on a cult, and anyone who has set foot into one of the stomping grounds of this community would know this. There are years and years of history, and plenty of sources that could be added. How about instead of deleting it, someone puts some effort into making it *accurate*? The difference between this community and the "halo community" or the like is obvious. We're united, and we're actually a <i>community</i>, we don't just all "play the same game". Many members of the community don't even play the games anymore. I challenge anyone who thinks the PC is on par with "a group of people who like to play Halo" to come visit us. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.104.242.76 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.104.242.76_b2e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.104.242.76">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd>Hello there, 70.104.242.76. Unluckily, as you can read <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">here</a>, the burden of evidence is in the editor who added the text, not in the ones reviewing it. We are not forced to find the "plenty of sources that could be added", they should be added by the ones adding the information in Wikipedia. Hopefully that made our position clear. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 05:09, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Oh, I understand. It just seems absurd to me to delete an article just because it's not instantly complete, rather than to edit it or label it as "incomplete". I'm not much familiar with wikipedia's rules and such, and I don't typically edit articles or anything, it just bothered me that the article might be deleted. Flag it is incomplete or inaccurate or whatever, that would be fine, but why delete something just because it's "under construction", so to speak? As I said, I wasn't the one to add the text, I barely even figured out how to reply here. I just didn't think it was fair to say that we didn't have any importance whatsoever, and all of the other comments here. It may be the editor's responsibility to add the sources, but it's irresponsible to make claims about the community without first doing research. My point: you don't automatically delete every article that is slightly inaccurate as soon as it is posted, do you? This article has been edited in the past month or so, and the last time I saw it, it had plenty of sources. They must have been removed somewhere along the line. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.104.242.76 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.104.242.76_b2e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.104.242.76">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
