<p>Non-notable novel from 2005. Political/religious thriller.

<li><b>Delete</b> though not speedy (makes claim for notability). Title is highly POV and may be an attempt to get this slogan more widely known. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 09:56, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I can best shed light on this because I created it. I created this to make a point. Note that point is different than <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> because this in no way causes disruption to wikipedia. Yet, when I saw a proliferation of anti-Islamic polemics (some found in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Category%7EBooks_critical_of_Islam_4b0b.html" title="Category:Books critical of Islam">Category:Books critical of Islam</a>) I created a rather borderline notability book about Christianity but made sure its Amazon rank (381,306) was better than the book that inspired its (639,969). I was worried about systemic bias because when an encyclopedia has many pretty non-scholarly critical books about one religion and not about others I'm not sure that's a good thing. It should be noted that there are more critical of Christianity books and hopefully things will even out some, but since it was pretty clear to me from other articles that inclusionist tendencies were winning out in the community I realized that books on this level were not considered notable per AfD voting standards. The title also plays off of Islamofascism debates but was not an attempt to get the title into greater usage. I would also not oppose in any way adding (book) to the end of the title of that makes people feel more comfortable. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/i/m/Wikipedia%7ELimited_administrators_6c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Limited administrators">?</a></sup> 14:02, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. So you agree that it's borderline notable, and you admit that you only created the article to make a point about an unrelated issue, yet you still insist that it should be kept? Is this really a book that is critical of Christianity? I'm not sure how it even makes your point. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 19:21, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I believe the book is probably not encyclopedic. However, my vote for this is based on other standards that seem to have been set from my perusal of other AfDs. Similar to the subject of schools I suppose. My point about Christianity evenness was not cheap critiques. It was moreso titles since I created it during the AfD of The Nazi Connection to Islamic Terrorism (book). My point was that what I believe has become the de facto standard for book notability has been set below this--whether it's good or bad. I was also curious about the deletion prospects for this. If this is deleted and some of the others aren't I'd want to know why. I'm not sure if I'm making sense. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/i/m/Wikipedia%7ELimited_administrators_6c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Limited administrators">?</a></sup> 20:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sure, the title is POV but I don't see why we'd care - it's the title of a <i>book</i>. We can argue the importance of the book, but I doubt it would go anywhere. We have articles on individual episodes of obscure TV programs nobody's ever seen, so I'd be surprised if we got consensus to delete this. However my actual "vote" is <b>merge</b> to Richard J. Weisman, the author. This is simply a matter of organization- there's little point having an article on a specific book <i>before</i> we even have an article on the author. The author article could discuss this and his other books, and if the day comes when it's too long, we split them off again. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:36, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note: for purposes of Afd, <s>I suppose I should have said <b>keep</b>.</s> The issue of turning this into an article about the author is a matter for the talk page, not for Afd. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
