<dd>The subject is of substantial importance and significance to the local population of Northern Ireland, specifically Derry City. He is just as renowned in the city and famous institution of St. Columb's College as fellow illustrious alumni such as Martin O'Neill, John Hume and Seamus Heaney. I do not see any challenge to the existence of these men's articles. John Fullerton is also a name common to many ears outside his local community as I will discuss below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I feel that the article does make numerous claims to notability for it's subject. John Fullerton was not only a past pupil. The initial statement is a mere introduction. There are other reasons for this article and I feel I have mentioned them within the content, thus warranting the article itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example, he is recognised as an overhead and free kick specialist and along with Tony Furey, a fellow member of the Physical Education department in St. Columb's College and a powerful diplomat, he famously negotiated with the British government and brokered numerous deals for the state-funding of his department, resulting in the much-needed investment totalling £2 million to be allocated to the department over a period of 7 years between 1987 and 1994. One of the monthly sums personally designated to John Fullerton for his development proposal can be seen <a href="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/qanda/writtenans/000131.htm#eti" class="external text" title="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/qanda/writtenans/000131.htm#eti" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This was the standard monthly sum for John Fullerton for 2 years, while Tony Furey received a similar sum and the College was given half a million pounds sterling due to the successful negotiations. As far as I know, further details of the payment are not allowed for reasons of commercial confidentiality as the institution is permanently operational and is currently awaiting acceptance of further development. John Fullerton's ground-breaking negotiations were a huge achievement and are well-known throughout Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as a major breakthrough for Catholic/nationalist equality during the "troubles" era. These negotiations had been the first of their kind since he worked for a department in a Roman Catholic school in Unionist-dominated Northern Ireland. They set an extremely important precedent for Northern Irish politics and social policies. Catholic schools had previously been neglected by the largely Protestant-biased UUP. He is held as a local hero by many among the nationalist community as he demonstrated that the goal of full equality and peace could be achieved by diplomacy and co-operation, rather than violent tactics, like that employed by the IRA. This approach he adopted was similar to that taken by John Hume. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 159.134.207.171 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.134.207.171_0550.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.134.207.171">contribs</a>)</small></dd>

<p>I would have to agree that John Fullerton is a notable character. I’m from Belfast, Northern Ireland but living in Derry, but I had heard about Fullerton before moving here. His often-hilarious exploits at Derry City FC get a brief mention in Norman Giller’s “Football and All That: An Irreverent History”, where he famously scored from near the half-way line in a league football game. This is quite an achievement in football and Giller describes him as “an influential and witty personality to local football at a time when Northern Ireland needed something to cheer about”. The distance he scored the free-kick from was the second furthest distance ever scored from in the UK and Ireland. He is also mentioned in “From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles” by Niall O'Dochartaigh for his breakthrough in cross-community negotiations in Northern Ireland. “an influential and witty personality for local football at a time when Northern Ireland needed something to cheer about”. The article includes all the relevant information. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 84.64.215.208 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.64.215.208_7a92.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.64.215.208">contribs</a>)</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Derry Journal online archives do not go back to the when Fullerton carried out his most influential work. Although the article is about a man who planned his physical education department, which does not sound notable on the face of it, the individual circumstances in Fullerton's case are what give him special prominence. He set a famous precedent in Northern Irish politics, as has been noted, by negotiating the planning of the department. Also, although I was aware of his speciality in the area of overhead and free kicking I was unaware that he held the record in football mentioned in Giller's book. I am aware of O'Dochartaigh's book and the mention of Fullerton. - <i>unsigned comment by Johnfullerton (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnfullerton_7d75.html" title="User talk:Johnfullerton">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnfullerton_5370.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnfullerton">contribs</a>)</i></li>

<p>I think another reason why this article ought to be kept is that, in a school noted for the brilliance of its past pupils, john fullerton is a man who has achieved great status in his field. He is important to people in Derry and surrounding areas. It would be a disgrace if he is once again shunned from the limelight that he so richly deserves. I believe some of the best chapters on Fullerton have yet to be written!</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> how can anyone say John Fulerton is "not notable"&#160;??? that is insane, he is one of the most widely know and respected figures in Northern Ireland of the past 50 years.

<li><b>Comment</b> Fullerton played for Derry City FC in the professional Irish football league whilst on trial and his famous wonder-goal is mentioned in Giller's book, as has been pointed out. The Derry Journal office archives on the Buncrana Road in Derry will have numerous articles on Fullerton dating from the time of his most prominent work. His importance to NI society and politics was also pointed out in O'Dochartaigh's book. This clearly demonstrates that he is a major local political figure. Does this not satisfy the criteria? Regarding the anti-bullying wristbands, I'm not sure how influential he was in their creation. Have you any evidence of this? If anything, I think he merely promoted them. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 159.134.206.82 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.134.206.82_7dcb.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.134.206.82">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<p>he has also been briefly mentioned in an article by Queens University Professor Kieran McEvoy ("Restorative Justice and the Critique of Informalism in Northern Ireland " (with Harry Mika) (2002) 43 British Journal of Criminology 534 ) as one of the people who have made strides in promoting cross community relations. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> Ciaranmcgonagle (<a href="../../../c/i/a/User_talk%7ECiaranmcgonagle_83f1.html" title="User talk:Ciaranmcgonagle">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ciaranmcgonagle_bed9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ciaranmcgonagle">contribs</a>)</small></p>
<p>Fullerton is a legend and deserves to be on this site.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is not a vote so I don't see the point in people adding their personal views or support in order to keep this article up. It is both futile and detrimental to any chance of Fullerton being taken seriously by anyone who is unaware of his work. As Tearlach points out, "the interference with the afd and the influx of newly-signed editors endorsing his importance suggests there's astroturfing going on with this article (Tearlach 14:45, 11 December 2005 (UTC))". I'm not sure who these people are but the interference is certainly damaging the subject's credibility so I'd be pleased to see excitable people refrain from treating this debate as a voting arena. Now, regardless of these interferences, the facts are as follows:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Fullerton is a notable sportsman. He played for Derry City FC in the professional Irish football league whilst on trial and scored a record goal for the UK and Ireland. (<b>Norman Giller, Football and All That: An Irreverent History</b>)</li>
<li>Fullerton is a notable personality in Northern Irish politics and society. He made famous and ground-breaking negotiations with the British government, changing the face of the political and social scene in Northern Ireland gaining increased equality for Roman Catholics in the area of education. (<b>Niall O'Dochartaigh, From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles</b> (I am well aware of this book, as it is in the Central Library in Derry and I have borrowed it previously. If needs be I could check for its availability, borrow it and scan the relevant pages for people to see.), <b>Kieran McEvoy ("Restorative Justice and the Critique of Informalism in Northern Ireland " (with Harry Mika) (2002) 43 British Journal of Criminology 534 )</b>) Evidence of the actual investment resulting from the negotiations can be seen at, <a href="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/qanda/writtenans/000131.htm#eti" class="external free" title="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/qanda/writtenans/000131.htm#eti" rel="nofollow">http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/qanda/writtenans/000131.htm#eti</a>, as has been pointed out above.</li>
<li>Claims have been made that he was influential in the setting up of the global anti-bullying wrist-band campaign, although I am not convinced by this. I feel evidence of this is necessary as Fullerton merely promoted them within Northern Ireland, if anything.--Johnfullerton 20:14, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think this subject is totally relevant to this page. John Fullerton was footballs original heart throb. Had he been about nowadays he would be as big as Beckham,he certainly takes a better set piece.

KEEP: I detect a lot of jealousy amongst posters on this discussion of this great man. Don't hate him because he is better than you. Fullerton would not hate you for feeling this way, he is humble in his greatness and I think it's time that you people take a leaf from John's book and honour this beautiful tribute. This is a man who embodied class, touch and vision on and off the football field, it is truly a disgrace that his name be soiled in this way. hame on the lot of you!

<p><b>Comment</b> I am not John Fullerton so I cannot see how the accusation of vanity against the article can stand. Anyhow, I apologise for the mess this has become. These trolls are not sockpuppets of mine and have nothing to do with me. I am as much frustrated by their interference as other serious contributors to this site, as they are damaging the subject's (now slight) chance to remain credible. Before their interference there was a consensus for possibly keeping the article. However, since, this has changed and I feel their interuption has put some contributors on a side against the article. Nevertheless, serious sources relating to Fullerton's notability have been mentioned. Are these enough to ensure the page is preserved?--Johnfullerton 00:20, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Seriously</b> I am trying here. But the problem is that verifiable sources <i>haven't</i> been provided, to justify the claims of notability in the article. Read this page . . . nothing but paragraphs and paragraphs of personal testimony, but no one has provided the link we ask for. I can only barely prove that this man <i>exists</i>, let alone that he is one of the most well-known and important figures in Northern Ireland. If he is so important, than why does a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22John+Fullerton%22+Derry&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22John+Fullerton%22+Derry&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">"John Fullerton" Derry</a> turn up no hits for him? Surely there would be <i>something</i>, either from his work in politics or in football. But alas, there is nothing. Even the link to the school's website shows that he is not even the head of the P.E. department, but rather the school coach. I'm sure his work toward a new school gym is important to that school, and perhaps to that community, but it is not of interest to an encyclopedia reader from a general audience. — <a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrioneight_f590.html" title="User:Orioneight"><font color="#003366">orion</font></a><a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrioneight_f590.html" title="User:Orioneight"><font color="#999999">eight</font></a> <font size="-2">(<a href="../../../o/r/i/User_talk%7EOrioneight_fcde.html" title="User talk:Orioneight">talk</a>)</font> 01:19, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Nope, it isn't, since the sock votes wouldn't be counted anyway. 95% of the time, socks only hurt your chances to do whatever it is you want to do on here since people will view the credibility of the claims of your side with suspicion since they had to resort to socks. The other 5% of the time is when a losing side puts socks voting for the opposing side, usually because it's so obvious that the other side will win that the losing side feels they have to do something to break consensus. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 17:34, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> OK, so this guy has had brief mentions in one obscure academic paper and in one obscure book by an unknown author, and his name is included in a NI assembly document as the recipient of a government grant (as well as a local newspaper article which turned out to be a completely different Fullerton). Still does not establish notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> The local press online archives do not go back far enough to when Fullerton carried out his work. The Derry Journal Office archives on the Buncrana Road would have planty of information. So far we've established that he has been mentioned in two books, not one. And who are you to say they are obscure? O'Dochartaigh's book is an important publication for anyone interested in Derry City and the history of the "troubles" in NI, while Giller's proves that he played in a professional football league. Not only did he do so, but he scored a record goal. There are biographies on here for modern-day professional Irish league footballers. Why should it be any different for Fullerton? --Johnfullerton 11:28, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Don't worry about the sockpuppets. They're an irrelevant nuisance. The point is still verification. Even if the references in those books are verified, the bulk of the material in the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fullerton_d096.html#Career" title="John Fullerton">John Fullerton#Career</a> section remains unverified by published sources. What reputable publication tells us about his tendon injury or his meteoric rise in the ranks to be, erm, deputy head of a school PE department? <i>Who</i> "argued that only George Best in recent times has been more successful at using the medium of sport to bridge political divides in Northern Ireland"? <i>Who</i> suggested "that the reason why his success has not been more noteworthy is due to" etc?</dd>
<dd>As to one of the sources offered: the NI Assembly document lists a John Fullerton as recipient of £8,467, but provides no detail: for all we know, it might be a different John Fullerton and refer to a contract to clean the windows. Another current example: the <a href="http://www.stcolumbs.com/ppu/ppalumni.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.stcolumbs.com/ppu/ppalumni.htm" rel="nofollow">Alumni Illustrissimi</a> site only lists winners up to 2003] so currently we've no proof that he won that award in 2005. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 13:10, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have visited the Central Library in Derry and asked the receptionist to direct me to books she knew to refer to Fullerton. She directed me towards:</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Walker, Past and Present: History, Identity and Politics in Northern Ireland.</b> (At page</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>72-73 Fullerton and the St. Columb’s College affair is talked about in enough detail to make it notable I feel.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Hargie and Dickson, Researching the Troubles: Social Science Perspectives on the Northern Ireland Conflict.</b></li>
<li><b>Mahon, The History of Gaelic Football</b> (In the chapter relating to GAA in Ulster, and a specific sub-section on Co. Derry, the divide between the “soccer-playing city” and the “gaelic-playing rural areas” are noted and Fullerton’s name is mentioned in connection with this and somewhat contributing to this. People in Derry city viewed him as a local role-model while nationalists in rural areas felt he always has a soft attitude towards Britain, a fact which was allegedly backed up by the fact he played the “foreign game of soccer” according to Mahon.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>She also pointed me to O’Dochartaigh’s book and some newspaper and sport cuttings from the early 1980s and late 1970s. These mention his record goal even though he played only 4 times for the Derry City full-team and mentions the reasons for this return to St. Columb’s.

<p>Keep - I refer to the comment that the academic journal was obscure. I would argue that in the realm of northern irish criminology it is well known and is usually a set text on any criminolgical university syllabus. Outside of this it may be called obscure however, if this is not a forum for knowledge and historical insight which is not well known or has thusfar been overlooked in the public domain, then i fail to see the purpose of this site! I would also hope you disregard the views of the so called sock puppets, both for and against, and give regard to the original authors. (ciaranmcgonagle)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If "hoax" accusations are going to be lazily hurled at the subject they'd need foundation. Does the fate of this article rely on Google now? I do not see where it is the official policy of Wikipedia for its articles to pass the "Google test" before being accepted. Source evidence has been provided to prove Fullerton's professional footballing and his notable role in NI politics. Doesn't this establish notability? By the way, it was 2004, not 2005, when Fullerton won the past-pupil award.--Johnfullerton 17:43, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The speech - so many giants in so many very different spheres, <b>some names well known inside their professional worlds</b>, others household names like Phil Coulter, Bishop Edward Daly - I believe this relates to fullerton and people of that ilk. I think these sites have a duty to spread the word of lessor know people such as fullerton. I think if the site is allowed up it would create a hub or a basis for further works into fullerton and the body of work will expand from there. Surely if everything on this site could be referenced on google there would be no need for it?? This is the whole point of this community and people such as fullerton should be allowed, people who are unfashionable like this will never get the acclaim that they deserve in the normal arenas. - <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by Ciaranmcgonagle (<a href="../../../c/i/a/User_talk%7ECiaranmcgonagle_83f1.html" title="User talk:Ciaranmcgonagle">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ciaranmcgonagle_bed9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ciaranmcgonagle">contribs</a>)</i></small></p>

<p>First thing i noticed when reading this post, is that most of the "Delete" comments are being made by people living outside Ireland, north and south. Asking for proof because they have never heard of JF, well just going to make a few points, If you are not from the surrounding area then you are not going to have heard of them man, most of his work was done before the internet came about and i would wager that all of your so called refrences came from the internet, how many people went down to the derry journal office to get research, how many went to inish times for information. I am cuently studying in Derry and had to write a report on the history of derry's sport. Firstly i must thank wikipedia for providing information helping me in my report. Although the info was hard to come by i stumbled upon the report about john fullerton which led me to here where this debate is happening. Is it taking up so much space on your webpage that it should be deleted? If you were to ask the people of derry who they would rather have represented by their city John F or Nadine Coyle (whom you have on your site) i would say most of them would say john. As for the facts i don't know much about them but i'm guesing he is on this more becasue of his work for the funding rather than his footballing skills. To anyone not from Derry you will never understand what it was like during the troubles and for John and his co-workers to pull that off was an amazing feat from somone on "the city side." As for the football I couldn't give a damm I'm a GAA man to the end and i find it amazing that no one has mentioned that John played Gaa for donegal team. - unsigned post by 212.219.92.232 (<a href="../../../2/1/2/User_talk%7E212.219.92.232.html" title="User talk:212.219.92.232">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_212.219.92.232_1f91.html" title="Special:Contributions/212.219.92.232">contribs</a>)</p>

<dd>Well then, I don't think the mere fact that "someone on the internet created a neologism" can justify a deletion - the question should rather be for the likelihood that people would want to look it up in Wikipedia, which is related to the question how often it is used (and not or not fully understood by the audience). Of course the chances of a neologism to become used regularly are better when spread through an often-quoted book than through a poorly-read website or newsgroup. But the medium itself shouldn't matter. He're I'd say press coverage is so high that chances for regular look-ups are good. This might be different in five years - words come and go. But for the time being the article should stay. -- <a href="../../../h/0/0/User%7EH005_e797.html" title="User:H005">H005</a> 20:46, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I was swinging on this one, since "Death Wrestling" is a term in relatively common use, and has been used in various computer games as well. But the specific way that this format is proposed is not the only way that it works. Whilst there is a pretty good chance that Championship Death Wrestling will be popular in the future, and it is a concept that has been discussed hundreds of times over the past 5-10 years at professional wrestling tournaments such as WWF, the fact of the matter is that right now its not notable enough.

<p>This article was put up the other say by User:Infrasonic, who likely is Dr Becker himself. I cleaned up the article and am now submitting it here for consideration because it looks too much like a vanity biography.</p>
<p>According to the article, Dr Becker has published a bunch of papers and is on the lecturing circuit. That alone doesn't mean much, it's the work of any academic to publish papers and give lectures. Being a member of any professional society doesn't establish notability either; as long as one has the requisite qualifications anyone who will pay the membership dues can be a member.</p>
<p>The article states that the Dr Becker appeared on a TV show and was featured in several popular journals. Being mentioned does not make one sufficiently notable to warrant an article here, one should be something of a household name. I don't think that is the case here.</p>
<p>I'm unsure about the inventions Dr Becker lists. We read that a few patents have been issued, Google Scholar mentions the "Wells Johnson Becker-Rojas powered liposuction device" once, but nothing states that those patents are licensed or that the inventions are somehow widely used or groundbreaking in a way. The suction cannula is reported in ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY 25 (2): 154-158 AUG 1990 and cited a whopping eight times. The adjustable breast implant is described in PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY 73 (4): 678-683 1984; that paper is cited a respectable 65 times. However, implantable pockets that are filled with saline over the course of a few weeks or months are common in reconstrucive surgery for the raising of skin flaps to use in autologous grafts, I fail to see why a breast implant with a septum is a novelty. Altogether, delete as vanity. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 03:34, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Based on your nom, Becker invented a new type of breast implant in the 1980s that changed his field. He holds patents and his <i>Becker Expander/Mammary Prosthesis</i> was approved by the FDA. That seems good enough for inclusion. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:30, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Note: anyone who pays the application fee can receive a patent, especially in the United States, there is no peer review involved. (Exercising the cat with a <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_pointer.html" title="Laser pointer">laser pointer</a> is patented!) What I fail to see sources that prove the notability of the adjustable breast implant.

<p>This article is for a TV show which is barely notable. Its information value is roughly zero; at best this series deserves a single article for each season (recalling that an encyclopedia is "a collection of fact-based articles, intended to introduce the reader to an unfamiliar subject"). Instead of nomming all the articles (which would be mean) I am just going to do this one to see what the consensus is to do about it. See <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_fccd.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a> for a discussion of the notability of television episodes.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Unlike many articles of this type, the article is complete and well-written, and all the articles follow an established format. Somebody seems to be making an effort to write all these articles and collect all info on this show into an organized collection of data (note info template at the bottom of all the pages). While its true that guidlines discourage articles on individual TV show episodes, this is more like somebody's project than just random articles. I hate to throw away someone's hard work if it's in good shape and not hurting anything. Maybe they're practicing on this, working up to a later project on Hitchcock's films, or Moliere's plays, or something.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Valid article about a notable series that does no harm. Not sure why the nominator thinks the show is "barely notable." This is a fairly popular series, and the number of pages and amount of edits on Wikipedia support that. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 20:08, 11 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This show is completely unoriginal and unmemorable. Of course this is POV, but notability isn't created by the number of fans writing articles; it comes from whether any non-fan will need to know the information, ever, and while they might want to know about the show itself, writing an article for an individual episode is unnecessary. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 02:33, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That seems an odd criteria. How is one to judge whether someone will ever "need to know" the information? I would humbly submit that someone who finds the show "unoriginal and unmemorable" would not be the best person to make that judgement. Would you also AfD all the existing Star Trek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and The Simpsons episode pages? <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 05:18, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, because those shows have a good amount of cultural value, so it's possible that some non-fan might want to reference what episode a certain <i>Simpsons</i> reference came from. I would support merging all those articles into a season-long summary, but such a summary would be pretty long. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 14:04, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per above and the talk page. Also, lightning seems to be a very odd phenomenon to be related to a universal constant. The form of the equation seems quite odd: I don't think that anybody would use P<sub>2</sub>(x<sup>2</sup>) in that context. They would expand the polynomial. It strikes me as an attempt to make the equation look more complicated than it is.

<li><b>Keep</b> Commons is, in my opinion, a poor place for image galleries of this type. This galery provides valuable understanding of the artist in a manner that cannot be provided in any other way. In order to understand art, one must look at art. In order to understand a complex art topic, such as the development over artists career, or the characteristics of particular artists style, one must look at a lot of art, therefore, in my mind, the information provided by this gallery is clearly encyclopedic, the only question then is how to present it. I believe Commons to be a poor choice for the following reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Unsophisticated users of Wikipedia (who, I beleive, is who we should also keep in my mind as the primary audience for everything we do here) could be confused by following a link that takes them away from the English Wikipedia without warning.</li>
<li>Despite having seen many claims on Wikipedia that it is the purpose of Commons to host image galleries, I have never been able to find such a statement on Commons. In my understanding, Commons was created to allow the several Wikimedia projects to have access to the same images without having to reload them to each project. In order to assist that effort, images are sometimes organized into gallery pages, however that is merely ancillary to the main purpose. If any one is aware of where on Commons it says something to the effect of "this is the place within Wikimedia for image galleries used in support of other Wikimedia project articles", please point it out to me.</li>
<li>Commons is a multilingual project. As the project develops, more anad more pages will look like <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Louvre" class="extiw" title="commons:Louvre">this</a> one. Sending users of an English language encyclopedia to such a page a bad idea.</li>
<li>It creates an additional burden on editor interested in developing and protecting such content since it would require them to watch two projects, rather than one.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I've looked at this gallery and I've looked at the Commons page. The gallery article is superior. It has informative captions — in English — where the Commons page has ugly filenames. It's a beautiful, informative encyclopedic page.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Wikipedia has no explicit policy against having pages in the article space that are galleries. While <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information explicitly says that <i>Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files with no text to go with the articles</i> and explicitly forbids articles that are <i>Collections of photographs or media files with no text to go with the articles</i>, this gallery provides encyclopediac complementation to the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_dc18.html" title="William-Adolphe Bouguereau">William-Adolphe Bouguereau</a> article, and is annotated. The exact interpretation of the prohibition of collections of photographs is highly contentious at present, and according to the policy <i>If in doubt, don't delete</i>, a delete outcome is inappropriate.

<dd>I've quoted that phrase precisely three times in my 16 months here at WP: it's hardly a dogged mantra of mine. Following the links I provided, and following the discussion on the WP:NOT talk page will show that there is considerable uncertainty about both how to interpret this rule, and whether the rule is, as currently phrased, a good rule. If three people are sure that rule should be interpreted one way, and three quite sure it shoould be interpreated in another incompatible way, does that make it a clear-cut rule? --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 16:22, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Commons appears to have no editing policies about galleries in the shared space, which is to say that it is not a suitable place for galleries whose quality one wishes to maintain. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 15:20, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are indeed many galleries/articles on Commons even if they don't have a clearcut policy on when to use them. One of the discussions you link to uses the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linx.html" title="Linx">Linx</a> gallery as an example. That article starts with these words: "de: - Linz ist die Landeshauptstadt des österreichischen Bundeslandes Oberösterreich". Or take the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ln" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ln" rel="nofollow">Köln gallery</a>. The multilingual information is very nice on Commons but it is in many cases unnecessarily distracting and cumbersome when compared with English language galleries on the English Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 16:16, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The purporse of commons is not to house galleries whose purpose is to illustrate wikipedia articles. Commons is not broken and does not need to be fixed.

<li>Cryptic: Thanks for those links, some were useful to me. I had conceded that galleries outside user space were allowed on Commons: I am sorry if that was unclear. The second point I made is that Commons has no editing policies for maintaining the quality of galleries in this shared space: unsurprisingly since it is not an encylopaedia. The point of galleries on Commons, according to the links you give, is parallel to the point of lists here on Wikipedia: they are a flexible alternative to categories. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 16:28, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Now that we've established that there's significant support for keeping quality galleries like this one I think we should develop some pretty restrictive guidelines on what kinds of galleries are acceptable. A blanket "keep galleries" policy could lead to a lot of bad articles. Galleries of the type "Gallery of Artist X" are generally a good thing when there is a significant number of works and some intelligent captions. "Gallery of vaguely related stuff I like" should be out. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 10:12, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with much of what you say, but I still think this stub makes a claim of notability - perhaps not a strong enough claim to earn a stay, but a claim nonetheless. In my view, the <i>nn-bio</i> speedy tag should be used for articles that don't make any sort of claim whatsoever. Geogre's law is a very interesting one, but I've seen a few cases, like this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gerald_gradwohl" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gerald_gradwohl" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, where it doesn't hold up. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 15:56, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Err, Simetrical, this article <i>was</i> once part of the article <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> and it was spun-off (with many other sub-articles since they made the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> page toooooo large... get it ... not more than 32k and all that stuff...?) and precisely because it is a complicated subject in and of itself it was judged by a number of learned editors to be worthy of a comprehensive article.

<dd>I did, in fact, read the article carefully, and it is clearly a discussion of nothing but etymology and word usage. As such, I feel that it belongs on Wiktionary, and I don't think it belongs in two places. Clearly, I'm outvoted.</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The content of the article is certainly encyclopaedic. If the name was "origin of the term "Jew"", just like many other articles have a section like this, there would not be this fuss.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is encyclopedic, and to merge it with "Jew" would kind of much up that article, would recommend reworking the Etymology section of "Jew" to link over to this article. DeathThoreau 15:52, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I would just like to note that to my knowledge, expansive etymologies are very much a part of Wiktionary's mission, which brings up the question of whether we should have articles on exactly the same thing in two different MediaWiki projects; lengthy etymologies certainly <i>aren't</i> considered out of place in dictionaries such as the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary"><i>OED</i></a>; and I would never think of an individual word's etymology as being encyclopedic, personally.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While etymology is not normally worth a seperate article in an encylcopedia, it does make sense to cover it in an artilce on the term. Then, if that article is too large, it would also make sense to split it out. I have no problem with duplicate information in other Wiki projects, if the information belongs in both places. <a href="../../../m/j/c/User%7EMjchonoles_54b1.html" title="User:Mjchonoles">Mjchonoles</a> 03:12, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Etymology is a window on cultural history. Where words have strong historic resonance, extended treatment of their etymologies may well be encyclopedia material. This article is one example of such. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 04:34, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not notable. Does not meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidlines. One self-published album, released a year ago (plus a remix album, also self-published). Can't find any evidence of a national tour, significant venues, etc. -- even on her web site. Seven Google hits on "Aisha Goodison", all about the lawsuit, none about her music. Search on "singer Aisha" turns up a a couple references to the lawsuit, and a bunch of singers who are not her. No entry in allmusic.com for "Aisha Goodison". There is ab entry on an "Aisha", a reggae singer. Unless she's a reggae singer (doesn't look like it), that's probably not her; it's probably Aisha Davis. I found one one-sentence passing mention on a minor web site of a singer "Aisha"; that turned out to be Aisha Davis. The only possible claim to notability, I think, is that she has filed a nuisance lawsuit against Madonna, on what looks to be bizarre grounds, which I guess got a small amount of press notice. Anybody can do that. I don't think that comes close to making her notable. (If it does, I think the article should be rewritten to feature the lawsuit.) As a bonus, she (or a catspaw) created the article as vanity, then engaged in revert wars when editors NPOV'd it.<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:40, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey guys, I created this entry and, as you suspected, I am also part of the production team.<br />
I think that this article is factual and unbiased. Vanity would imply that I have boasted about the show being fantastic, or at least presented an opinion. This article is neutral in the way it has been written, merely presenting facts and useful information.<br />
This show will no doubt appear on Machinima.com, but if you feel that that sentence is not appropriate then it can be edited (after this is Wikipedia).<br />
I feel this article provides useful information for those who have seen the trailer and\or have read about the series, and would like to know who is involved, what it is about, which episodes are in production, who the characters are etc.<br />
Rather than deleting the article, we could simple add a notice such as the one at the top of the <a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Men_3_6951.html" title="X-Men 3">X-Men 3</a> page, stating that the production hasn't yet been completed and as such this information may be speculative.</p>
<p>If, having read this, you still feel this isn't appropriate for Wikipedia, you may remove the article.--<small>Unsigned comment by EvMaster</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Men_3_6951.html" title="X-Men 3">X-Men 3</a> is a major studio production that follows up two very successful films about a highly-notable comic book series. Your work, however good it may or may not be, is none of those things. While it could be argued that Machinima.com is an important vehicle for your particular genre, appeareance there does not necessarily indicate notability as wikipedia is not a crystal ball. <b>Delete</b>--<small>Unsigned comment by DeathThoreau</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Don't let this whole thing discourage you, EvMaster. I'm sure you could contribute to wikipedia in other ways. As it is, it doesn't belong. If, however, it gets released, and becomes really popular (let's face it, even a tiny fraction of Red vs Blue's popularity would be quite an achievement), and has a big impact, then maybe, who knows. And remember, if your production becomes really popular, <i>someone else</i> may well create an article on your show.--<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrat_53ce.html" title="User:Drat">Drat</a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDrat_c90f.html" title="User talk:Drat">Talk</a>)</small> 16:38, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do NOT Delete:</b> People (especially kids) have always done random runs so the phenomenon exists long before the Wikipedia article and the website randomrun.org. The article is an attempt to formalize the phenomenon. If banal daily activities as running and sitting (especially Chair sitting positions <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitting.html#Chair_sitting_positions" title="Sitting">Sitting#Chair_sitting_positions</a>) have articles so should random running as well. As for it not being successful on Alexa - I do not see how an internet monitoring service can be relevant in determining weather something that exists much before internet is relevant enough to have a Wikipedia article. Also it is not a neologism because it is not a newly coined phrase or even a phrase, it is just the only possible description of the action just as good food is not neologism but just a basic way to describe food. To name random running something else would be to create a neologism. People do random runs but it is not something that was ever formally discussed or documented - this is the only issue. However I agree that it needs more resources than a personal website randomrun.org and a much better text. If these are the reasons to delete it please do until better definition and resources are found, but I think random run is something that deserves an article nevertheless. Maybe random run should be included within the article “<a href="../../../r/u/n/Running.html" title="Running">Running</a>” since that article seams very narrow - it focuses mostly on competitive running which is a sport while random running is not a sport.

It should be clear that this is not a prank nor a joke. Even if it were, that is not a reason for aggressive behaviour. This is by no means an emotional discussion.

<li>The author, writing above, states that "[p]eople do random runs but it is not something that was ever formally discussed or documented". That is a strong argument that this article is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. By our policies, subjects do not belong here <i>until</i> they have been discussed, documented, peer reviewed, and accepted into the corpus of human knowledge. The author thus makes a good case for the article to be deleted.
<p>There <i>are</i> documented things known as random runs. There is <a href="http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~rsa2003/run.html" class="external text" title="http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~rsa2003/run.html" rel="nofollow">a social event held at The International Conference on Random Structures and Algorithms</a> in <a href="../../../p/o/z/Pozna%C5%84.html" title="Poznań">Poznań</a> and <a href="http://www.sportident.co.uk/school/game_2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sportident.co.uk/school/game_2.html" rel="nofollow">a game made up by a sports equipment manufacturer</a>.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I cleaned this up and added links to the station and others. This is a legitimate radio station in Romania, and apparently fairly well-known there. Unfortunately I was not able to find any sites in English, but I was able to figure out enough from the Googled websites to add the info that I found. Now the question is: Is the station notable enough to be listed in the Wikipedia, and do we include non-English-language radio stations in the Wikipedia? <s>If this article is kept, it should be moved to <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stil_FM_5629.html" title="Stil FM">Stil FM</a>.</s> (page moved) <s>I will abstain for the moment.</s> •<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 22:12, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - the December 5 revision reads much better, but the article is now nothing but speculation. There's some evidence that <i>Streets of Hong Kong</i> was planned as the second game, before was changed to <i>New York City</i>.

<li>Although the word is attested, it appears to be a simple pejorative epithet used to describe mainstream news organizations. Although I can find many instances of people referring to the mainstream media as "the lamestream media", I can find no actual sources, describing any underlying concept, that could be used to construct an encyclopaedia article. The article <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cites no sources</a> at all, and the specific concept that this article ascribes to the word appears to be a novel one invented by a Wikipedia editor. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Original research</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:07, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I take issue with the notion that this word is simply a "pejorative epithet used to describe mainstream news organizations." Lamestream can be used as the definition describes in more than one context. Example, Mainstream Rock and Roll (standard music industry drival) depending upon the label and artist can be categorized into Lamestream. This was evident at the end of the 80's and the beginning of the 90's with big hair bands. The Lamestream Rock and Roll movement tried to hold on while being eroded by the grundge movement. Thus it lacked relivancy but still believed it held a popular position. Another example, mainstream science education believes the Coriolis force affects water in a toilet bowl. This is incorrect and is yet another example of Lamestream science education. Lamestream is not just used for the supposed popular press it also is used as the definition defines. The popular press is just an enormous example so it was used. On another note this word could be moved to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikitionary" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikitionary" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikitionary</a> an I would be satisfied with that. By the way the word Fuck is defined and used in Wikipedia not Wikitionary and I hear nobody talking about movement or deletion of it from Wikipedia. Tell me the improvements to Lamestream you would like to see and I will make it happen?- oadine 13:27, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is not a valid music genre. The music style is no different from standard black/folk metal, with the lyrics being the sole difference. This, along with Pagan metal (black metal with slightly different lyrics)and Battle metal (black metal with yet another lyrical theme)should all be removed based on the aforementioned criteria. If, for some reason, someone truly believes this article is necessary, merge it and the others with the Black Metal page.</p>

<li>I see no reason whatsoever to delete this entry, nor to "merge" it. National Socialist Black Metal is, though not a label for a musica genre that has nothing in common with other musical genres, a label for a specific category of bands and music nonetheless. Like it or leave it, thats about it. The most proper way to handle this would be to leave this as its own entry and link it in the black metal or other sections suggested above. NSBM as an acronym for this genre of artists and music is a search term that should link to an entry for National Socialist Black Metal. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.182.188.222 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.182.188.222_48ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.182.188.222">contribs</a>) 20:27, December 10, 2005.</small></li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. I am unimpressed by the keepers. Thelb4 cites the expansion of the BBC one article: over the course 2.5 years! Yuckfoo manages to find the word "Monitoring" on Google and applies zero analysis to that finding rendering it meaningless (as Gazpacho points out, "please", whilst polite, isn't a useful addition to the debate). However, I don't think this debate can be read as producing a consensus to delete. In my capacity as editor-in-ordinary, I am going to mark this as a move to Wikt. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:21, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The major problem with your article is that you fail to say why Off the Chart Radio is notable in any way. You launch into a month by month history of a year old station but fail to tell us why we should care at all about it, the reader doesn't have any reason to keep reading unless they are pretty big fans of the station already (and they'd have to be big fans to want to deal with this kind of detail). Provided that the station is notable (verified through third parties, news articles, people outside of its broadcast area talking about it), you would need to clean up this article. I'd suggest a discussion of the format, the broadcast area, it's audience, then some of the shows. If you want to talk about the history, unless a lot of interesting things are happening (which it doesn't seem) it can be summed up in a few paragraphs (when it started and why, and then what it's up to today).

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Clearly, the numerics are here to delete. However, the original article's lead was more-or-less incomprehensible advertspeak. The new lead sentence is at least legible, if not really notability-establishing. Since there <i>are</i> other lists very much like this within this topic, and I'm concerned that the incomprehensibility of the pre-rewrite version may have influenced things (given that two editors, nom included call it an ad) I'd prefer to see a new nomination before deletion.-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:27, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The whole point of this article is advertising a specific product. I would not waste any time on rephrasing the text, it is still an advertisement. Wikipedia is not a replacement for corporate websites or printed catalogues. Listing of available products and packages are utterly unencyclopedic. We should remove this garbage, and this is a point to start. The fact that there are other spam pages on Wikipedia should not prevent us from deleting this one. --<a href="../../../d/r/t/User%7EDrTorstenHenning_2c0a.html" title="User:DrTorstenHenning">DrTorstenHenning</a> 12:03, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Listing the existence of a product is not spam in itself. Thomas is a notable childern's story, television series, and toy. Stating what toys are available is hardly advertising them. There's a lot worse listcruft on Wikipedia. If you think all the Thomas merchandise articles should go, then list them all. But if you're only going to list the one, then I have to argue consistency over deletion. -- <a href="../../../j/l/a/User%7EJLaTondre_be65.html" title="User:JLaTondre">JLaTondre</a> 22:49, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; I can make enough sense of Estonian to tell that they definitely seem to be notable.

(<i>1980. aastate lõpul oli Ultima Thule vaieldamatult Eesti rokkbänd number 1.</i>) It also says they've toured Canada, so they must have at least some international notability. Other sites I found use phrases like "one of Estonia's most legendary rock ensembles".

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This ruling is massively important, as said in the original version of the article (note that I included some references to help people to check it out). This is a case that defined <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> as applied to the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a>. In effect, what this case meant is that it is okay to kill a black man, and that doing so isn't racist. It has major repercussions and is a heavily discussed case, with <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Mccleskey+v.+Kemp%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=740&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Mccleskey+v.+Kemp%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=740&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">748 unique google hits, out of a total of 17,100</a>. Yes, it was written in legalese. But something written as X v Y is really only going to be useful for lawyers, so what is the problem?

<li>Sounds like a different setup - U.S. Supreme Court cases generally don't have trials, as they are reviews of lower court decisions, with arguments taking no more than a few hours. However, if R v Trinh and McLean was a notable case (which is how it sounds), by all means include it! <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 14:25, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry. I should have been more specific. What I meant was that anytime the United States Supreme Court decides to hear a case it is notable. This is because they have control of what cases they will review and their decisions have the potential for far reaching consequences in the United States. To the best of my knowledge the equivalent in Australia would be the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Court_of_Australia_754b.html" title="High Court of Australia">High Court of Australia</a>. The <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_Northern_Territory_f808.html" title="Supreme Court of the Northern Territory">Supreme Court of the Northern Territory</a> appears to be a trial court, much like <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Supreme_Court_239b.html" title="New York Supreme Court">New York Supreme Court</a>. I know the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Falconio_995b.html" title="Peter Falconio">Peter Falconio</a> case is getting a lot of attention in Commonwealth countries.I do not know anything about R v Trinh and McLean, therefore I cannot comment on its notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and I don't think that pages describing edits should be allowed. Articles get reverted and edited all the time, just because this one got more press there needs to be an entire page about this guy? Sure there can be a snippet in the vandalized article that refutes the false claims, but there does not need to be an entire page that dwells on this edit alone. Leave the guy alone, there is no reason to ruin this person over an edit.

<li><b>Merge</b> to Wikipedia Biography contreversy, there is no point of having some computer vandal article on Wikipedia. Firstly, having an article for a Wikipedia vandal will probably incite more vandals to follow his antics. Also, aside from sparking of his little prank, he is pretty much unnotable (and considering the amount of Wikipedia vandals, he is not so relevant considering other actions such as date changing and spurious biographies are NOT foreign to Wikipedia). However, considering the long reaching effect of this dude, one needs to merge it with the already crazy Wikipedia controversy article.

<li>I voted to delete the Seigenthaler controversy article, and now I think I was wrong about that. It seems to getting a lot more attention than I thought. I was worried about having an excessive focus on things that happen to us, a different standard of notability, or skewed perception...but now I'm pretty sure that article is worth having. So, when I look at this article on Brian Chase, my first reaction is to think it should be merged/redirected, and anything worth saying can go in that controversy article. But, I figure I ought to learn a lesson and err on the side of a <b>keep</b> vote, because if you're in doubt a keep vote is usually the way to go. I think on the article talk page it might be a good idea to discuss merging there, though, and let the editors who are interested in the subject make a decision about that. I think in an uncertain case it's a good idea to put down a vote for keeping it, but also urge interested editors on the talk page to look at it more deeply and make an eventual decision about whether to merge it or keep it independent. A keep vote doesn't necessarily have to contradict eventual merging; I would expect interested editors in the future to make a better decision than me. It just means "keep pending talk page review". <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:16, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>As a side note, I also want to say I feel really sorry for the guy. Vandalism and deliberate inaccuracy can't be tolerated, but it should be dealt with quietly here on Wikipedia, not through all this press coverage.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. "'I'm glad this aspect of it is over,' Seigenthaler, 78, said. But he expressed concern that 'every biography on Wikipedia is going to be hit by this stuff - think what they'd do to Tom DeLay and Hillary Clinton, to mention two. My fear is that we're going to get government regulation of the Internet as a result.'" (source: Yahoo! News -- "Author Apologizes for Fake Wikipedia Entry" <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/usatoday/20051212/tc_usatoday/authorapologizesforfakewikipediabiography" class="external free" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/usatoday/20051212/tc_usatoday/authorapologizesforfakewikipediabiography" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/s/usatoday/20051212/tc_usatoday/authorapologizesforfakewikipediabiography</a>) Brian Chase is a key player in an event that could bring about consequences for all of us. For the simple fact that there's national debate about government regulation of the internet, it defies logic to say that Brian Chase is not noteworthy. He's part of the reason there's national debate to begin with, and while he may not be the person who has sparked said debate (Siegenthaler gets credit for that, with the article he wrote in USA Today), there wouldn't be any debate, had he not done what he did. Everyone knows what caused the World Wars, everyone knows what lead up to Roe v. Wade and to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, everyone knows about the draft during Vietnam, and everyone should know about what Brian Chase did. To play any kind of role in bringing about such debate that could lead to a landmark decision, especially one that deals with privacy laws, freedom of speech, and a whole slew of other issues, is definitely noteworthy. --Putainsdetoiles 04:59, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I feel sorry for the poor sap who has to count the votes on this thing.</li>
<li><b>Try to start a national controversy about this vote page</b> so that a Wikipedia Votes for Deletion for Brian Chase (hoaxer) controversy article is necessary. But seriously, I find myself profoundly unable to care about this matter. Once we're at the point of having a passionately contested, in-depth, 30-page debate about a three-paragraph stub, it's clear that Wikipedia loses either way. The process has eaten the encyclopedia. There's plenty of reason to delete this article (it's redundant to other articles and the figure probably won't be noteworthy enough for an article once we've given the events some perspective), and then there's reason to keep it (might as well leave up an article until there's more space between the present and the events, since it's easier to delete an article later than to recreate it later after it's been deleted, and lets people work to improve the article in question in the meantime), and somehow I don't see how it makes the slightest difference to the future of mankind either way.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is a real character, and is mentioned elsewhere in Wikipedia (eg. in <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternity_%28comics%29.html" title="Eternity (comics)">Eternity (comics)</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactus.html" title="Galactus">Galactus</a>). It is only orphaned for lack of wikilinks. However, it does seem, on my superficial search, that this character is only mentioned in the comics <i>en passant</i> and does not really appear anywhere. If such is the case, it should be merged into <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternity_%28comics%29.html" title="Eternity (comics)">Eternity (comics)</a>.

<b>What?</b> Whois marking this article (about) <b>'Matty Midura' for deletion above?? I am Matty Midura actually - and I have 'no problem' with it, as presented by anonymous user as it appears, and from another 'identical post' from Candice666 found via 'User Talk' or something. I found 'both' accidentally, while researching my name (i.e. Matty Midura) within this upstart publication.</b>
<p>Moreover! Just who-n-f#ck is this <b>'spic'</b> (JoaoRetardo) anyway?? He/she, is going to question <b>"how my sites are listed"</b> in search engines??? The same goes for the <b>'dork'</b> (RJH) below the Ist. asshole! I will provide a <b>'link/photo'</b> of how one of my sites (i.e. New Jersey Shark Attacks) was/are ranked by Google (previously #1) and by Yahoo below here - if it's permissible. I am a 'new user' here, not yet <b>up to speed with the format and rules of this publication!</b> The same sentiments apply to the <b>'dork'</b> below the Ist. asshole!</p>
<p>Lastingly! I must admit, I am flattered that someone posted an article about me in Wikipedia. I originally thought that the publication <b>'searched the web'</b> or, by other means (i.e. Public Records etc.) for info posted. Obviously, it was <b>'other means'</b> but, that of the <b>public at large!</b> I'm into that, as long as the info is not intrusive or defamatory! In my '8 years' on the Web, I've seen it all. But I am 'curious' as to how the poster (i.e. Candice666), or anyone for that matter, could possibly discern or otherwise: <b>"that I did not graduate from LaSalle U, and not return to complete the exams!"</b> The university would never divulge that kind of information - <b>about the exams</b> specifically, and/or whether I choose to re-test or decline to do so on record!..<br />

<dd>It is not being discussed wether Matty Midura exists, or wether he approves of the article, or wether the article was created by himself or some admirer. What is being discussed is Matty Midura's notability. If you think Midura has done something that makes him worth of being on Wikipedia, please show it here. Ranking 1st on a Google search is not convincing evidence, since any site can show 1st on Google if the search is worded with that intention in mind. And please <b>do not</b> remove votes from this message. This accomplishes nothing and will most likely get you blocked for violating Wikipedia policies.

<p>This is obviously just a wind up by someone in Scotland, who's too into the whole celtic-rangers thing. But for the record, once again, the1641 rebellion is a very important event in Irish history, there were indeed massacres of protestants by catholics, and vice versa. However, there was no Earl Patrick Flanagan, no battle at Belfast and no group called "Irish Catholic rebels". The fact that it is supposed to linked to a street gang in modern glasgow led by a 17 year old is just hilarious. Thanks for trying anyway mate! Can we just delete this and forget about it now? Banning this IP adress wouldn't be a bad idea either</p>

<li>"Why Does God Bring People into Our Lives" is an important body of music, even though it is comprised of cover songs. It is well known thoughout various musical communities I participate in. The album is commonly described as a brilliant compilation that is clearly genre defying and highly creative. Furthermore, the "Democratic Fascist" website is often cited in political discussion and is the cause for great debate on both sides of the political spectrum. Michael Haddad is undenaibly a highly progressive thinker whose talents span and push the boundaries of music, politics and popular culture. Removing this article would go against the very principal of Wikipedia and serves absoltuely no purpose. Detractors would be much better off spending their time contributing to society and culture the way Mr. Haddad has opposed to wasting energy on this battle. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.43.175.11 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.43.175.11_d397.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.43.175.11">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Michael Haddad's article should certainly remain part of the Wikipedia database in light of the cult notoriety of his music.

<p>In support of including Mr. Haddad's biography on Wikipeida, I should note that his Hannity website is referenced in Amherest College's class Pop Culture and the Blogosphere--undeniable proof of his intellectual excellence.

All of you naysayers fail to recognize what it is really at work with this Michael Haddad. What we are dealing with is the birth of a Renaissance Man. Just like those before him, who were ridiculed for thier thought-provoking ideas that pushed the boundries of the human intellect, Mr. Haddad's work will probably not be truly appreciated until he is dead.</p>
<p>Also, I strongly agree with the assertion above as to the nature of this debate on the grounds of cause and effect. Did Hume teach us nothing? The whole notion of causality is made upon metaphysicaly grounds that are shakey at best. Unless you want to get into the dualistic metaphysics of Kant (well leave the epistemic or ontological debate alone), you simply cannot make such a claim. -johnny j. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.42.115.97 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.42.115.97_ea05.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.42.115.97">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The point of Wikipedia is not to find the next "Renaissance Man."

Many of these anon supporters have his website as a reason for inclusion. The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/democraticfascist/" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/democraticfascist/" rel="nofollow">website</a> reffered to has a low (2/10) Google page rank and doesn't register on Alexa, thus failing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia has never been based on a democratic ideal. It is closer to a meritocracy, where the value of somebody's contributions often determines their amount of impact in a given discussion. Admins are given a higher level of authority as determined by their value (as percieved other project members). As far as Iraq goes, you might find it interesting to note that this is not an american encyclopedia, it is an english speaker's encyclopedia, so we likely have some Sunni/Baathist editors who are currently fighting in a bloody fight for freedom *against* the americans in Iraq. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 05:38, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I see no problem with it. Its in relatively widespread use.

<dd>But is what you described actually called Astral music by anyone? I think it's called Space music or more likely New Age music. As I mentioned in the nom, not many of the Google results are actually related to what's discussed in the article... so the raw number is rather irrelevent.

<dd>Sorry, that's what I've always called it, for the past 15 years or so. I thought that google verified that. I guess there is a case to suggest that it means the same thing as new-age music. It depends on who you ask. Its the same deal with a lot of these music categories. Since 1990 or so, every band in existence wants to have their own unique sound. It started with alternative music, and then just kept going. <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith_No_More_71ac.html" title="Faith No More">Faith No More</a> was one of the bands that really stuffed things up by insisting that they followed 10 categories at once. This is why we have these billions of sub categories. But again, this is a legitimate sub category. Its just a matter of how legitimate. 44,500 to me says very legitimate, but if you disagree, then that's your opinion. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 11:27, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I just don't get how this is a genuine genre of music... other than the article and you, no one seems to be saying that. I'm all for articles on obscure genres that really exist, but like I said, that 44,500 number has no results I can find that actually deal with this as a genre of music <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22astral+music%22+genre&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22astral+music%22+genre&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, so it doesn't verify anything. And as a longtime trance/electronica fan, I've never heard of this as a genre. <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astral_Projection_%28group%29_15b5.html" title="Astral Projection (group)">Astral Projection</a> is a famous <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa_trance_music.html" title="Goa trance music">Goa</a> group, maybe that's what you're thinking of?</dd>
<dd>I just don't get keeping it on the theory that it might be a genre, despite no evidence. Rewrite it to be about the distrubtion company and that might change things, but <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> articles need to go. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:26, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>redirect</b> to New Age music. FWIW, I've been hosting an ambient and atmospheric music radio show for the last ten years, and I have heard the term, but always as referring to a minor sub-genre of new age music. It is, however, also the name of a well known music <i>distribution company</i> <a href="http://www.astralmusic.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.astralmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, which explains much of the high google count (as does the Turkish tourist yacht company which also uses this name). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 06:56, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>While I appreciate that Danny Elfman has composed the soundtracks for a number of Tim Burton films (and I acknowledge that their collaboration may go somewhat deeper than that), I don't believe that they are really appropriately thought of as a pair, nor that this article makes a lot of sense. I will also go ahead and appeal to a <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> argument; how many hundreds of thousands of occasional collaborations will deserve their own pages now? —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 21:24, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>; The argument that MANY other pairs will "deserve" recognition is unfounded, as <b>not NEARLY as many Director/Soundtrack pairs have had as long lasting and successful a relationship as Burton and Elfman have</b>. After Spielberg and Williams, of course. But beyond that, they are the really famous and deserve a relationship article on their jobs together. Otherwise we'd have to go into each of their individual profile articles and add sub-headers about their relationship.

<dd>It isn't just Director/Composer pairs I'm worried about, but Director/Actor, Actor/Actor, Writer/Director, etc... and that's only in the movies. In general, people in every field of human endeavor sometimes form partnerships with the same people a few times but are still more known as individuals. There are exceptions where the pair is more famous than either individually (<a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurel_and_Hardy_ba96.html" title="Laurel and Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a>, say}, but Tim Burton and Danny Elfman are not such a pair. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 22:58, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've checked. The prior article was different. It stated that a machosexual is a homosexual male who behaves in a certain manner. This article states that a machosexual is a heterosexual male who behaves in a certain manner. That such mutually contradictory definitions, of what machosexuals are, have been added here indicates that both are concepts that have failed to actually gain any traction in the world at large.

<li>It was unfortunate that I chose to mention those ideas in a work of fiction by name. Aiheuism is not a religion, though it was a religion in those stories. Christmas and its customs did not originate in Charles Dickens' CHRISTMAS CAROL either, but it was mentioned in a work of fiction... With that being said, Aiheuism is a widespread belief but simply not evangelical. There are no real books on it, just a couple of papers, and certainly no entry in Webster's. No need has been seen and no attempt been made. Perhaps I will write "the book" on Aiheuism someday because it is an interesting reflection on how some ecologists see the world, but certainly not just to substantiate an article in Wikipedia, absolutely no offense intended. My main strength is in editing animal welfare and zoological articles, and I'll pretty much stick to that from now on where there is no chance of offending the Internet Gods. That being said, and no I am neither angry nor hurt, but your method of accepting articles absolutely ensures you'll never see anything worthwhile in WikiMedia FIRST....as a scientist I find that prospect just a little chilling....just a thought. Happy Holidays, and do whatever you see fit with the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnBurkitt_0c24.html" title="User:JohnBurkitt">John H. Burkitt</a> 00:22, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>No vote</b> - orphaned nomination by an anon. It's still stayed in the article through the last several editors' revisions, so I'll go ahead and open it up for discussion. Supposedly, Mr. Graham himself <a href="http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A8295" class="external text" title="http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A8295" rel="nofollow">wants the article deleted</a>, but he's been a talk show host for several relatively major stations, and his firing from WMAL is particularly controversial. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 23:28, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It appears that information currently contained on the page is well-documented, and has sufficient corroborating links. Some previous versions that contained information beneficial to Graham failed to include corroboration, and often relied on statements made by Graham himself. While there have been some instances of vandalism, these have been quickly removed or resolved by persons regularly reviewing this page. I see no reason for this article to be deleted., however, I do believe that the article written by Graham in the Charleston Citipaper <a href="http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A8295" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A8295" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> is self-serving, and contains no information that could serve to provide a better understanding of this biography.

<p>The zine and DIY communities are a lot more vital and important than you seem to realize, linag. Wrekk's contributions to these are quite far-reaching both through her own projects and through her involvement with <a href="http://www.microcosmpublishing.com" class="external text" title="http://www.microcosmpublishing.com" rel="nofollow">Microcosm Publishing</a>. Any DIY book as popular as Stolen Sharpie Revolution is a force to be reckoned with. Jim 07:52, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Mm, I am a big fan of the independent media, Jim; but, we don't even have articles for everyone in the mainstream media: what sort of road would we be going down, as an encyclopædia, to just list everyone who has blogged and had some 'influence.' Under such a thing, you would have a page, as would I; although it might sound nice, it would be rather absurd, since it does not take that much to get a circle. The concensus here seems to be that unless someone is noted in their field, or has had their work catapulted into public conciousness, or their work linked notably to a major event, they don't cut the mustard, so to speak. 18:53, 12 December 2005 (UTC) <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">Iinag</a></li>

Sounds busted to me. I donno but girl selling out of 3 press runs of her zine sounds pretty fucking influential in these days of 'blogs' and 'e-zines' A girl who put a lot of herself into such awesome, well known, and vital projects such as Portland Zine Symposium and Independent Publishing Resource Center, and one of like 5 people in the world who can call zines a paid career.

<li>Right, i have cleaned up and wikified the article, but i vote <b>delete</b>, as per everyone else. If Stolen Sharpie Revolution is so significant and popular, then why is it a red link? In fact, the only subject specific blue link is <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microcosm_Publishing_fef4.html" title="Microcosm Publishing">Microcosm Publishing</a>, which is a bad, jumbled article that i am not sure is encyclopaedic itself. Furthermore, Alex wrekk (which should be moved to Alex Wrekk) is an orphan page, which doesn't convince me of its importance. Merge to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microcosm_Publishing_fef4.html" title="Microcosm Publishing">Microcosm Publishing</a> if anyone else deems any of this info notable, i guess. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdcooper_7efd.html" title="User:Jdcooper">Jdcooper</a> 14:09, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

This artilce is an exact copy of the other one, posted from the same IP and on the same date -- just under a different article title. Apparently, the anon author decided on a better title which would match exactly the title on the list of the Democratic Youth organizations, but could not move the first page he had created. The mere reason there are two entries here on this page is that they happened to get caught at different times... If one of them would have been fortunate to receive a translation, the other one would simply become a redirect page.</dd>
<dd>I think that once you've AfD-ed the first one, you want to just go ahead and AfD the second one as well, and link the AfD entry from the second to the first. See for example how the "rotary club" twins are done: "rotary rj ilha do governador" and Rotary rj ilha do governador.

<dd>The article needs to be in English. Can you provide the translation please? If so then it may be kept, but as is, even with your helpful translation of the very definition and with the link to the page in arabic -- I still don't think it makes an article yet. - <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrovert_e3fe.html" title="User:Introvert"><font color="#004161">Introvert</font></a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrovert_66c0.html" title="User talk:Introvert"><font color="#004161"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 09:31, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, the arabic text inserted is non-encyclopediatic material.
