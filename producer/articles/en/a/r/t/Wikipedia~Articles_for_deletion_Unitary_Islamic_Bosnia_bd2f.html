<li><b>Strong delete.</b> The concept is not recognised nor in use. There is no political party that makes this supposed movement a part of its platform. A google search for "Unitary Islamic Bosnia" in English, Bosnian, and Serbian, comes up with zero results, aptly illustrating the fact that this alleged movement is unknown even locally. The sources used to justify the alleged movement nearly all come from highly controversial radical serb sites with obvious agendas (i.e. SrpskaMreza), or succumb to logical fallacies. It is a clear case of "partisan screed, or opinion masquerading as fact", which is listed as one of the basic reasons why an article should be deleted. For instance, the article states that the political goal "is often hidden behind the pro-European and pro-democratic rhetorics of the Bosniak politicians..." - the article's lone author clearly making an opinionated judgement of the "<i>real</i>" intentions of politicians who promote the exact opposite of this alleged policy. Furthermore, none of these "ethnic Bosniak politicans" described in the article would ever agree to be supporting this idea. There is absolutely no valid reason to keep this article; the topic is not grounded in reality and is a clear attempt to insert a highly controversial POV and bias into wikipedia. The few valid facts that the article might have should be integrated into existing and undisputed articles where they would belong. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 06:25, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete.</b> As per original nom of speedy delete (this should only be considered ONE vote for deletion - not including my nom herein) and for very reasons outlined by <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">above user</a>.</s> <b>Neutral/Keep</b> Willing to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_Good_Faith_ad0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume Good Faith">assume good faith</a> for the time being and allow author to verify the data, <s>but seems as if the author is already involved in other dubious articles.

Articles do exist pertaining to irrendist and nationalism movements of other ethnic groups in the Balkans, excluding this article would then be POV in and of itself. Care should of course be exercised to only include verifiable fact. It should also be noted that both <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlihodza_8f58.html" title="User:Alihodza">User:Alihodza</a> (Bosniac POV) and <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBongo11_d800.html" title="User:Bongo11">User:Bongo11</a> (non-Bosnian POV) have only been created in the past 24-hours and only have edits pertaining to this article and AfD; possible sock-puppetry in action. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellenica_3598.html" title="User:Hellenica">hellenica</a> 15:50, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Excuse me: I am not a sock puppet. I have been a non-registered wikipedia user for a long time and only decided to work on the basis of my login after Jimbo's recent policy changes.

<li><b>Delete</b> - the article appears to come across as factual, but only until you read the 3rd paragraph does it begin to sound inappropriate. The 3rd paragraph reads as if the article is attempting to propagate some sort of opinionated conspiracy. I suppose if that were deleted the article would be acceptable, but since I'm not an expert on this, this decision should be relegated to more knowledgable editors. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 06:40, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - for all reasons above. Interestingly the article appeared while high profile negotiations are taking place in Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding constitutional changes that need to re-define the structure of the country. Highly politicised and factually wrong. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 06:56, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes Dado this article is certainly part of their Greater serbian conspiracy! now they want to influence negotiations through Wikipedia! It should be deleted!!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The name of the article was changed into Bosniak nationalism, and I do not think that anybody would deny that such nationalism exist. If we have articles about <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbia</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_nationalism.html" title="Croatian nationalism">Croatian nationalism</a>, why not about this one too? Is it a taboo or what. Also, I wrote this article for the sake of the neutrality policy of Wikipedia, since much is written on Wikipedia about Serbian nationalism with the purpose to demonize Serbian people. The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbia</a> article is much larger POV that this, but I do not deny that some small number of Serbs support this idea. Who can say here that only Serbian nationalism exist, and Bosniak one not? For the NPOV policy, both nationalisms should have their own articles. As for my sources, I posted them here: Talk:Bosniak nationalism. Can you explain why these sources are not credible? You just used word "not credible", with no explanation why. For example, here are excerpts from the "Islamic declaration" written by Alija IzetbegoviÄ‡, a former Bosnian president: <a href="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/licnosti/izetbegovic.2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/licnosti/izetbegovic.2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. What is wrong with the credibility of this source? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="green"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 09:49, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> This is simply an inflammatory piece of Serbian propaganda. The original concept that was the originall title does not exist as per the talk page for the piece, and later edits are an attempt to imply that Bosniak political parties want a mono-ethnic "Greater Bosnia". Whilst there is a mountain of evidence to suggest the reverse is true, the author has been unable to demonstrate that mainstream Bosniak parties actually espouse this view. Vague references to "Bosniak nationalism" from mostly Serbian propaganda sources are not enough to make the case. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlihodza_8f58.html" title="User:Alihodza">Alihodza</a> 11:40, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> Bosniak nationalism? does such a thing exist? no it does not! and it is a totally ridiculuos attempt to remove attention from serbian nationalism by insolently accusing bosniaks of the same thing. Bosniak/bosnian authorities or goverment has never expressed any nationalism, as far as I know it is the serbian jugoslavic goverment who are the ones accused of ethnic cleansing and agression on countries in the balkans. All bosniaks did during the war was to defend Bosnia from being split up between neighbouring countries. And all bosniaks do after the war is to keep the country together. Therefore such a thing as bosniak nationalism does not exist, if you doubt please then look at the war datas from the war and you will see that bosniak civilians died 30 times more than serbian or croatian civilans.

<li>Or we can view it as I have helped repair those articles by removing term that is clearly disputed (at least until it is decided if the term "Unitary Islamic Bosnia" should remain on this Wikipedia). Your attempt to make a political issue of this voting is not wellcomed. Your attack on my intentions and my right to vote and be equally respected here have been noted as a personal attack. It seams to me that you are more inclined towards rigging anything since you are bringing it up. Voting typically lasts 7 days for any article (per HappyCamper).

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article needs a lot of work but the checking that I have done has discovered some Bosnian politicians who have made arguments which are along these lines. For example <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alija_Izetbegovic_fc85.html" title="Alija Izetbegovic">Alija Izetbegovic</a> opened a branch of his SDA party in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandzak.html" title="Sandzak">Sandzak</a> outside Bosnia in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> and "argued that should Serbia and Montenegro decide to unify in some future new federation or confederation, the Moslems of the Sandzak would demand both cultural and political autonomy" (<i>Broken Bonds</i> by Lenard J. Cohen, p. 144). I have also seen characterizations of Izetbegovic's earlier writings such as the Islamic Declaration which are of the nationalist kind. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 20:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Alija Izetbegovic's "Islamic Declaration" does not mention Bosnia or Bosniaks once, while the Sandzak comment in no way supports the alleged "irredentist" nature as it has nothing to do with territorial ambitions seeing as it took place at a time when all the regions were one country.. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 20:30, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, Islamic Declaration has nothing to do with the subject. <a href="../../../n/o/e/Noel_Malcolm_acfc.html" title="Noel Malcolm">Noel Malcolm</a> explained in his book "Bosnia: A Short History" (Chapter "Bosnia and Death of Yugoslavia: 1989-1992") that the book has nothing to do with neither fundamentalism nor nationalism. He explained how Serb propaganda took same quotes from the context (there you can read some examples) trying to present this book as something it is not. For instance the main part of the book is about moral values in Islam. It is generally about muslims all over the world. The second thing is that the user who first created this article as "Unitary Islamic Bosnia" has himself stated that "This article is crap" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bosniak_nationalism#I_give_up..." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bosniak_nationalism#I_give_up..." rel="nofollow">[10]</a> because he thought that Serbs were demonized in every discussion.

<ul>
<li>My vote was the first on the top of this page. As far as I'm aware, moving a page to a new location as soon as its brought up for deletion isn't exactly an established practice on AfD either. I merely added a comment to my original vote to reinforce my point following your bad attempt to save an inherently POV article.

<li>The quote is taken out of context. The user wrote <i>The article is crap, as most other articles related to Bosnia and Herzegovina (this country is a lost case for the goals of Wikipedia).</i> Apparently, he refers to state of the article after your edits and Dado's edits (you are responsible for that situation in BH-related articles). Anyway, he voted KEEP on this very page. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 08:51, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>You forget to mention that right after he noted that the article was "crap" he explained that he created it as a form of retribution to percieved bias against Serbs elsewhere on wikipedia. And what "situation in BH-related articles" am I responsible for? Getting them featured on the front page? What exactly have you done to improve the state of BH-related articles? Better yet, what haven't you done to make the situation worse? Every BH-related article you have touched has turned into an edit-war. From being struck down in your <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corrupt_bargain.html" title="Corrupt bargain">corrupt bargain</a>-like nomination for administrator due to extreme bias and nationalism to runing everything you touch, you are not one to talk about responsibilty for the current state of balkan-related articles. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 22:02, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Though the page has been moved, the situation reamins relatively unchanged. Despite this, supporters of keeping the article (nearly all of them users from the Serbian language wikipedia) claim that it should be kept considering the presence of other "(people name) nationalism" articles on wikipedia. Ignoring for a second the giant logical fallacy in this argument (Should wikipedia also have articles on "<a href="../../../f/u/r/Fur_%28people%29.html" title="Fur (people)">Fur</a> nationalism" or "Nationalism in <a href="../../../l/i/c/Lichtenstein.html" title="Lichtenstein">Lichtenstein</a>"?), or the fact that all such articles about nationalism in the region were created by these same Serbian users, it should be noted that a google search for Bosniak nationalism finds less than .5% of the total number of sites a similar search for "Serbian/Serb" nationalism does, while a serbian language search finds a whopping one article (a wikipedia discussion page). No matter how persistently its twisted or presented to appear acceptable, this was and still is a poor attempt to force POV into wikipedia. I thus hope that well-meaning members of our community will join the effort to not let Wikipedia's credibility be ruined by inherently biased and irrepairable articles put forward by proponents of the by now infamous Serb radicalism. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 20:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Some users here said that Bosniak nationalism doesn't exist. An example of it which recently stirred much controversy is a statement by Bisera Turkovic, Bosnian ambassador to the US, and one of the founders of Bosniak SDA, together with Izetbegovic. She said that "it will take time, but people in B&amp;H will certainly stop calling themselves Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks and they will all inevitably become Bosnians"<a href="http://www.vjesnik.com/pdf/2005\11\19\10A10.PDF" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vjesnik.com/pdf/2005\11\19\10A10.PDF" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. (If you don't understand how is this a statement of Bosniak nationalism, you should note that "Bosniaks" actually means "Bosnians" and hence Bosniaks speak, not Bosniak language, but Bosnian language. Naming of the language is intentionally chosen as a step towards this goal.)

<dd>You are again spreading incorrect information, as you did before and do now in Bosnian-related articles. I have just read her statement. First she said it was her personal opinion. Second, she said that Bosnia should follow USA model. It means that Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats should identify themselves with their own country Bosnia and Herzegovina as Americans do identify themselves with USA. Also, she says every man has right to preserve his/her ethnicity, religion, culture etc. Third, this is actually argument against "Bosniak nationalism". If someone says that Bosniaks should call themselves Bosnians it is not Bosniak nationalism, it is anti-Bosniak nationalism. <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniaks.html" title="Bosniaks">Bosniak</a> doesnt mean <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnians.html" title="Bosnians">Bosnian</a>.
