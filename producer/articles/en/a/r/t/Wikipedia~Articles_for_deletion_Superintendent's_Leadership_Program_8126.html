<p>A high school awards/scholarship program in a county in Maryland that doesn't meet notability criteria for inclusion. There were about six of these types of programs at my high school alone. <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hs=i53&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Superintendent%27s+Leadership+Program%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hs=i53&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Superintendent%27s+Leadership+Program%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> brings up 19 unique hits with Wikipedia being the second.

<ul>
<li>Okay so there are about 6 of such programs at your high school. But this program is open county-wide, where there are 32 high schools. Applicants have to undergo an interview process as well. This leadership program is different from many other programs in that it is the only humanities-oriented intern program within Montgomery County. 68.48.32.65 01:49, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Plus I bet that the programs at your high school are almost open to anyone who wants to do an internship. This program has a rigorous selection process; in fact I, as a member of this leadership program, can attest that there were about 100 applicants to this program for the class of 2007 and only <b>14</b> were accepted. Would you mind showing me some of the websites of the internships at your school? 68.48.32.65 01:53, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually there were several where only about 3/100 students would get in. The fact that it's rigourous isn't anything new or unique- there was a scholarship at my school that required a few hundred hours of community service, extra-curriculars, high marks and an interview, and I wouldn't consider it for an article because it's so minor. The scholarships didn't have websites for them- they were of the "See your guidance counsellor and take it from there" variety--<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 02:00, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You do realize, that there are around <i>3,077</i> counties in the USA, most with multiple and similar county-wide programs. How is this program any more notable than all the others?--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 01:56, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The thing is, programs like these are a dime a dozen. In order to get on Wikipedia, they should be particularly notable outside of the county too. A few things to consider would include stuff like national coverage, and <i>why</i> it's important. There are thousands of such scholarships in the United States alone with very little to set them apart. If it had national coverage or was a particularly famous scholarship, I could understand, but from what I see, it's a run-of-the-mill program (despite it being difficult to get into). --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 01:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable school program.

<li><b>Delete</b>. As Tree Biting Conspiracy. Just one of a million local scholarhip programs. AmitDeshwar 07:46, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> and <b>strong keep</b>. I would like to clarify that this is not a <i><b>scholarship</b></i> program but a <i><b>leadership</b></i> program. This leadership program is incorporated into a student's daily academic schedule for 4 out of 8 periods. This program <i><b>does not give out</b></i> any money. 68.48.32.65 15:56, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case it's not a very notable leadership program either- it's basically the same as a co-op, which works on the exact same premise offered. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 16:17, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> and <b>strong keep</b>.I guess the issue is that <i><b>ONLY</b></i> students from Montgomery County, Maryland, are allowed to apply for this leadership program which makes it not so notable outside of Montgomery County. 68.48.32.65 16:23, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not just that, it would also have to meet criteria set out for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, which is basically an extension of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">importance</a>. The best way to gauge the importance of a subject is to see how much <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable, independent, non-trivial information</a> has been published about it. There are easily a few thousand scholarships/co-op programs that span my province, but most of them won't get articles because they're not featured in several non-trivial independent publications. --~~</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But there was a press release for this program, the following appeared in the local newspaper:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Rockville, MD -- The Superintendent’s Leadership Program has selected 14 participants for the 2006-2007 class from among candidates at Montgomery County high schools. The program is the only humanities oriented honors intern program in the county. The curriculum content and style is comparable to many college courses. Students in this program are selected for demonstrating outstanding leadership, academic excellence, and uncommon maturity within their schools and communities.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Students accepted to the program are assigned to work for 15 hours per week for a full academic year under the guidance of a management executive such as a Director, Vice President, or CEO. They are given the chance to handle projects, individually and as part of a team. Business partners to the Montgomery County Public Schools program include corporate, government and nonprofit organizations. The 2007 class participants represent 12 Montgomery County high schools.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Significant program components also include site visits to meet and talk with industry executives working in a wide range of settings, didactic seminars to discuss current issues in the workplace, extensive research and writing assignments, a group community service project and an international business project that reinforces cross-cultural relations and global citizenship.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Kim Jones, Program Director of the Superintendent’s Leadership Program says, “It is critical that students with this level of maturity, that can clearly articulate their career objectives, be given the opportunity to apprentice in their discipline. This program reveals facets of a chosen industry that would otherwise take years to experience.”</b></i></p>

<li>Unforuntately press releases are not independent, and local newspapers don't count as non-trivial. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 18:19, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - under 30 people ever have been in this program, no where near notable enough... --<a href="../../../t/-/r/User%7ET-rex_9e1e.html" title="User:T-rex">T</a>-<a href="../../../t/-/r/User_talk%7ET-rex_4226.html" title="User talk:T-rex">rex</a> 04:10, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Strong Keep</b>.</s> [Struck out duplicate vote from same anon IP as above] Just to clarify, this program actually started in the late 1990s/ early 2000s and it had since more than 60 participants. I could not find any information about them, though. 14:56, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
