<p><b>Read before voting</b>: Seeing as some people get confused by this nomination, I will attempt to explicate what this nomination is for.

<p>This should either be deleted or have links to the smaller categories (Jewish American Show Business figures, etc.).

<dd>Arniep, clearly you do not understand. You cannot vote "keep" on both this list and the smaller separate lists - for they are identical. You need to make up your mind on which to choose. If you feel that the smaller lists should be kept than please state so and <b>STATE</b> that you want this page cleared and only used as an index for the smaller lists. Otherwise people might not know where you stand. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStabRule_e05a.html" title="User:StabRule">StabRule</a> 03:30, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> Your own vote (Delete content and Link to Smaller Pages) means exactly the same as what I said, you can keep the current page and merely remove the list content if it is already duplicated and then add links to the appropriate pages. Arniep 03:36, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Based upon the huge mess this created and actions taken by the person that listed all of these lists (spamming for votes, juvenile responses here and on talk pages); I think the best course of action is to keep everything and then sort it out on those actual pages in the discussion pages. Changing a page into an index is not something that belongs on AFD. This whole mess could have been taken care of on the talk page for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a>.

<dd>Consensus does not mean voting it out on AfD, it means discussing what should take place on the talk page, then coming to a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_decision_making.html" title="Consensus decision making">consensus</a> on it. That could include some sort of compromise, but does not involve voting. I would prefer if someone speedy kept all of these AfDs and then it can be discussed on the talk pages first. If that does not get anywhere, then there can be a formal survey or vote. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 00:29, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Deleting a page <b>DOES NOT</b> mean it can never be remade. This was and still is the best course of action - to hold and afd. If these are speedy kept then we can continue the discussion in the Talk Page. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStabRule_e05a.html" title="User:StabRule">StabRule</a> 01:15, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Let's keep this polite and productive.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> It's hard to decide whether it's more annoying to have this misuse of AfD procedures, or scurilous and gratuitious (albeit somewhat literate) backhanded accusations of anti-semitism by editors like JJay who references <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Niem%C3%B6ller_4b7c.html" title="Martin NiemÃ¶ller">Martin NiemÃ¶ller</a>. On the first: if you want a page cleaned up, do that through the article talk page, or in the extreme, via RfC; AfD'ing as a euphemism for "change the content" is asinine. On the second, if you think deleting a few words from a website is the moral equivalent of murdering your family, you are in <i>serious</i> need of mental health intervention. Grow up! Get over it. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 17:53, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Thank you for the kind words regarding my literacy. You are free to interpret my vote anyway you see fit. The same is true concerning my mental health, or lack thereof. But do not ever accuse me of playing tennis. I do not like little yellow balls, or white shorts. If you need to resort to that type of name calling, at least have the simple decency to do it on my talk page. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:43, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
