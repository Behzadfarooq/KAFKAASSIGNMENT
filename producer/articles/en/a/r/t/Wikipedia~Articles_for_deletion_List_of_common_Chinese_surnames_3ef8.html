<p>I would like to renominate <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames_de0f.html" title="List of common Chinese surnames">List of common Chinese surnames</a> for deletion as per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Invalid criteria are used for nomination to begin with. The genealogical clause in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> pertains to biographical articles, stating that biographical articles must be about notable persons. This article is not biographical, nor does it even list any people. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> is also invalid, as the list does not even state the meanings of the surnames, and it can't be used in a dictionary function. This list is a researched and published list of the 100 most common Chinese surnames. The article is actually about such a list that is published in real life. It's not a list that's just gathered together by WP editors. Furthermore, it lists rankings of how common the surnames were in both 2006 and 1990, such that readers can compare the commonality rankings of different surnames, and also of commonality rankings of the same surname between 2006 and 1990. This alone makes the article encyclopedic. The fact that it lists the Korean and Vietnamese equivalents of these surnames actually make the article <i>more</i> encyclopedic. And whether or not it's just a list of common surnames in the PRC alone is, firstly, as yet undetermined, and secondly, not grounds for deletion at all. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 00:34, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I think you are misrepresenting the policies here. To begin with, not all dictionaries specialize in giving meanings or definitions. For instance, there are dictionaries for pronunications, for frequency, grammatical usage, etc. You take a look at almost any good Chinese dictionary and you find that they indicate this or that character is also a surname. The best one also have a list of Chinese surnames in the back. As it looks now, the article is nothing but a list of surnames and their pronunications according to their frequency in the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, you are also misreading <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, which covers a much wider range of articles that should not be in Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>

<dd>As I said earlier, I cannot see what the frequency in PRC has to do with Chinese surnames in general, something that this article purports to discuss. In the explantion of the statistics for 2006, it states that it is based on information from 1100 counties and cities in the whole of China. Last time I checked, China had more than 2000 counties and usually statistics from China include the PRC only. If you claim that Taiwan is included, the burden of proof is on you not me.</dd>

<dd>None of the above really takes away from the fact that this list is a researched and published list in real life. The article is not a list with no other information than a listing, it's not even a list that's been compiled by WP editors. It's also not a genealogy, as it makes no mention of any people. None of what you've said also takes away from the fact that the article provides comparative rankings on commonality of these surnames, something that, in real life, is not found in a dictionary, but in a published list of common Chinese surnames. Lastly, like I've said many times already, the PRC and naming issue is not criteria to delete at all. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 03:43, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- reasons for nomination are invalid. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> does not apply because the article presents additional non-dictionary information (a ranking of names). <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> is also mis-interpreted: it is not a list of <i>loosely associated</i> topics (#1), a geneological entry (#2)--this applies to biographical articles only, or a phone directory (#3). If you think or are sure that the information is about the PRC only, then simply rename the article. Changing the title of a page is not a reason to list it for deletion. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:34, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I had read your response prior to my comment. From the thread I see that you brought no counterarguments against HongQiGong's argument that the excerpt on genealogical entries is inapplicable. And also, there are no separate dictionaries for definitions, pronunciation, and grammar--all of these things are included in a dictionary. "Dictionaries" for frequency of use and other information have a more appropriate name--encyclopedias. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:18, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we stand very far apart in our interpretations of the two above-mentioned policies, I'll leave it at that. It does, however, seem that I am not alone and I will leave it to other editors to weigh in on the matter. To me, this article looks like half-way between a frequency list and a pronunciation table, and as it happens, the most exhaustive treatment of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frequency_lists" class="extiw" title="wikt:frequency_lists">frequency lists</a> can be found on Wiktionary.--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 03:02, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Any encyclopedic information <i>about</i> Chinese surnames belongs in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_surname.html" title="Chinese surname">Chinese surname</a>, but an article that consists of a list of surnames is not encyclopedic. Please see the long list of previous AfDs that have all resulted in deletions for lists of names that I compiled at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lists_of_given_names_3cf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lists of given names">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lists of given names</a>. I fail to see why ranking them makes it encyclopedic, and it is ranked just as well at Wiktionary. Translations, pronunciations, Romanizations, etc. are all dictionary material, and not encyclopedic except in the context of encyclopedic prose. The rule of thumb is that if an article is about the word or words themselves (etymology, meaning, pronunciation, etc.) rather than the concept the word refers to (its history, influence, context, etc.) than it is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 03:08, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually I fail to see how the rankings are <i>not</i> encyclopedic. Plus, this is a list that exists in real life as a researched and published list, which makes it different from some of the other lists of surnames, unless these are also lists that have been researched and published in real life. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 03:43, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Phone books and car manuals and even dictionaries are all published material, but they are not encyclopedic.

Having been published has no bearing on it being encyclopedic, however, the fact that it is a list of names does have bearing on it belonging in Wiktionary and not Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> as per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> criterion #3: development; the list allows navigation among surname articles and redlinks to the surnames for which articles are not yet written. Also the objection about the lack of sources for pronunciation information for Korean, Cantonese, Mandarin, etc. is rather amusing given that these readings are common knowledge to tens or hundreds of millions of people and are listed in virtually any dictionary you can find, but I put in cites to a web-accessible source for the Korean pronunciation for the top 25, for example. Finally I fail to see how it is unencyclopedic to put the Vietnamese and Korean pronunciations in the table, given that it is nowhere stated that people with that surname are related (you don't see a disclaimer on every article about someone named Smith that they're unrelated to all the other Smiths), and further there are significant populations of both groups living in the PRC as well as populations of Chinese living in said countries who actually use those pronunciations either in everyday life or as their legal name. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 06:13, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The argument that the article should be kept "as per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>" is assuming what it should prove, i.e. the utility of an article on every single Chinese surname. I read <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> and it is clearly designed to help people create lists of biographies, countries, species and the like. I just had a look at a couple of the articles on Chinese surnames and all they do is to list the pronunciation and the list number of people called <a href="../../../x/u/_/Xu.html" title="Xu">Xu</a>, for instance. They almost looks like disambiguation pages and some of the pages actually are disambiguation pages, like <a href="../../../w/e/i/Wei.html" title="Wei">Wei</a>. If this discussion leads to the deletion of a couple of empty article on surnames, all the better.</dd>
<dd>The argument that the list is useful is not an argument by itself. A phone directory or a top 10 list may be useful, but we don't include them in encyclopedias.--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 12:35, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None of them really address the fact that this list has comparative commonality rankings from both 2006 and 1990. What I mean is, a reader can look at the list and see, for example, that X is ranked 10th, as compared to Y, which is 11th, and a reader can look at the list and see, also, that X is ranked 10th in 2006, but was ranked 15th in 1990, whereas Y was ranked 14th in 1990. That's encyclopedic.

<dd>Summarizing the delete votes up to this point (above): Nominator's "not a genealogical database"; <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>; "per above"; an opinion on the encylcopedic nature of the ranked list; and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> again. The <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> argument is becoming overused in AFD discussions for any list, without understanding the principle behind the rule, and I decided to call out anyone who wants to claim <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> to back it up. This is not genealogical (as the nominator proposed) as no biographic info is on this page. It is not a directory of businesses (obviously). That leaves us with "loosely associated topics", which is in WINAD as a deterrent to the "me too" lists of every time that a left-handed actor sneezed in a film. A researched list of surnames from a country's census or what not is not loosely associated information. So far, the only reasonable argument for deletion is Dmcdevit's "unencyclopedic". To argue whether it is encylcopedic or not is valid; to try to fit this square peg article into the round <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> hole is not. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 23:11, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To be anal about it, I don't think we should say that Chinese surnames are "endowed with more meaning". I just think that Chinese culture takes surnames more seriously than say, the cultures of western or English-speaking countries. The fact that there's a published and researched list of common Chinese surnames is pretty much evident of that. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 20:23, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, I do agree that the phrasing made it an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> argument and the point would have come across equally or better as "Chinese surnames have a particular cultural significance" (I don't know whether this is true or false).

You are of course right that "Arguments should be considered on their own merits, period." As for your other point that "we do not create separate policies for matters Chinese or questions pertaining to other cultures"--this is true. But we should consider topics that have a "special significance" (if indeed they do), whether the topic is related to Chinese (or any other) culture or to microbiology. I think <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAQu01rius_9358.html" title="User:AQu01rius">User:AQu01rius</a>'s point, simply stated, is that "Chinese surnames" are an important, notable, and encyclopedic topic. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:21, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Heck, if someone in real life researched and published a book on the most common English surnames with their ranking of commonality, and an editor wrote an article based on that, I would think the same, that such an article deserves to exist in WP. Furthermore, please see <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>.

<p><b>Comments</b> - It seems that we are talking past each other, so I will try again.</p>
<ol>
<li>No one has said that this article consists of "loosely associated topics", neither is anyone denying that it is based on a credible source. But that does not make this article encyclopedic; the fact that it is <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">useful</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/t/WP%7EINTERESTING_6e23.html" title="WP:INTERESTING">interesting</a> does not make it encyclopedic. A telephone directory is sourced, contains interesting data on the frequency of surnames and is very useful. But it is not encyclopedic. A dictionary can list the pronunciation of several Chinese characters, but that does not make it into an encyclopedia.</li>
<li>As to whether Chinese surnames are more important than "Western surnames" (whatever that is) has no bearing whatsoever on the question whether there should be a separate article listing the hundred most common surnames by frequency. This is a policy question and not a question of different cultures. I'm looking at you, HongQiGong.</li>
<li>No one is denying that there should be an article on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_surnames.html" title="Chinese surnames">Chinese surnames</a>. Neither has anyone denied that certain Chinese surnames may be the topic of separate articles. But no one has so far put forward any convincing argument why we should have a special list with Chinese surnames, many of the articles that the present page link to are not even articles. Many of them look more like disambiguation pages, and some of them actually <i>are</i> disambiguation pages: <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mai.html" title="Mai">Mai</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/i/Wei.html" title="Wei">Wei</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi.html" title="Shi">Shi</a>. There is even a special project devoted to the creation <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Chinese_surnames_9af2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Chinese surnames">Wikipedia:WikiProject Chinese surnames</a>, where the to-do-list runs as follows: "1. It must be an interwiki link to an article which satisfies WP:NOT. No redlinks. 2. Individual must have that surname. (Not as a given name.) 3. The individual's article must show the full Chinese name to support inclusion in the list." Can anyone tell me what is going on here? A Wikiproject for the creation of dictionary entries and disambiguation pages? I'm not saying that their work is worthless, but it is misplaced. We have Wiktionary and that's where their work belongs. There is an excellent summary of the differences between Wiktionary and Wikipedia articles <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html#The_differences_between_encyclopaedia_and_dictionary_articles" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">here</a> and how that applies to articles on family names.</li>
<li>Some of you have asked why some of the oppose votes only quote the <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> without further comment. My explanation is that the reason for deletion is obvious, and that most people who are in favor in keeping this article either do not understand Wikipedia policy or the difference between Wikipedia and Wiktionary.

<dd>You said above that we stand "far apart in our interpretations" of the two policies, but whereas I have suggested my reasoning behind my interpretation, you have only noted the policy (your comment to HongQiGong on this matter was "you are also misreading <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, which covers a much wider range of articles that should not be in Wikipedia" and nothing else). Whether this article is kept or deleted is a matter of consensus. You may take it to DRV (although you wrote arbitration, I assume that's what you meant), but the <i>only</i> purpose of DRV is to determine whether an AfD discussion was appropriately closed.

But stating that you will take this to DRV or arbitration if the consensus is not in your favor does seem like a form of "disruption". Wikipedia operates based on consensus. Sometimes it's on our side, other times it's not. I realize that this article is in many respects similar to what might be found in a dictionary (Wiktionary). However, let's also please realize that this article also contains addiitonal information that would not be found in most dictionaries. Yes, Wikipedia is not the white pages. Nor is this! This is not a list of individuals--which is what the white pages is. Finally, I have no idea what reading "like a list of disambiguation pages" has <i>anything</i> to do with genealogical or phonebook entries. To sum up, I hope you do not take my (or others') comments personally. They are not directed against you. They are directed against the arguments and the statements you have written.

<li>This is kind of interesting, if no consensus emerges, then the result is "keep", I gather. So policies do not really matter after all. After an article has been created, no matter how unencyclopedic, the burden of proof is on those who want it to be deleted. As long as I manage to get a narrow majority vote in my favor, it doesn't really matter what kind of article I create.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Dmcdevit and some other points I want to raise. First, this is a list of names. Therefore, per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> (an official policy) it's dictionary material. The 1990 rankings and the 2006 rankings and the translations into other languages are all great stuff which make this a comprehensive <i>dictionary</i> article, not an encyclopedia article. Second, as has been noted, the cultural significance of Chinese surnames can be covered in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_surnames.html" title="Chinese surnames">Chinese surnames</a>; there is no potential for it to be covered in a <i>list</i> of names. Third, <s>some of the arguments to keep are a tad overwrought, given</s> note that this has already been transwikied to Wiktionary and no material is being lost. Finally, to address the argument that this list is useful for navigational purposes: Let's see. When I look at the first few linked articles, I see two types of content: (1) dictionary material, e.g. in <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_%28%E6%9D%8E%29.html" title="Li (李)">Li (李)</a>: "Lǐ (Chinese: 李; pinyin: Lǐ) is a surname of Chinese origin. It is the most widespread surname in China..." or (2) disambiguation, e.g. lists of people named Lǐ. The #1-type material should be tranwikied to Wiktionary and deleted from Wikipedia, like this list. The #2 type material should stay on Wikipedia and pages like <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_%28%E6%9D%8E%29.html" title="Li (李)">Li (李)</a> should be converted into pure disambiguation pages with links to the corresponding Wiktionary articles (using {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWiktionarypar_6f6e.html" title="Template:Wiktionarypar">Wiktionarypar</a>}}; see e.g. what was done <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harry&amp;diff=107970116&amp;oldid=107970007" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harry&amp;diff=107970116&amp;oldid=107970007" rel="nofollow">here</a> with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry.html" title="Harry">Harry</a>). Once this is done, this list would be a list of links to disambiguation pages. There is no warrant to have such a list as it would not help in navigation. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Individual Chinese surnames have its individual extensive origins, and there is no way that it can all be covered in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_surnames.html" title="Chinese surnames">one article</a> alone. See an expanded Chinese surname article example here: <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a>. Now, if this Chinese surname list is properly expanded, it would include the outline of the history origin of each listed surname, and links to its expanded article entry. Anyways, just look at the article <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a>, and think about it again. <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;">AQu01rius</font> <small>(<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAQu01rius_9358.html" title="User:AQu01rius">User</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../a/q/u/User_talk%7EAQu01rius_1acc.html" title="User talk:AQu01rius">Talk</a>)</small> 18:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

I just went through the first ten or twenty and most articles on the list are not as extensive and look of more like dictionary entries or disambiguation pages. Most of the purported histories of the origins lack sources and could be deleted without debate, thus rendering them useless as encyclopedic articles.

<li>Exactly. Yuan is actually not one of the top surnames in China (<a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Being the 37th</a>), and it already have such extensive history of origin. According to the "<i>deletion logic</i>" I am receiving, a bad, short article that's not verified should be deleted right away, regardless of the subject's potential encyclopedic value? Many users are ignoring this line in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>: "<i>Before nominating a recently created article, please consider that many good articles started their Wikilife in pretty bad shape.</i> ". Read on and it says "<i>Unless it is obviously a hopeless case, consider sharing your reservations with the article creator, mentioning your concerns on the article's discussion page, and/or adding a "cleanup" template, instead of bringing the article to AfD.</i>". Now tell me, are the surname stubs <b>hopeless cases</b>? If you think so, then look at <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a> again, but look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yuan_%28surname%29&amp;oldid=4347203" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yuan_%28surname%29&amp;oldid=4347203" rel="nofollow">earlier versions</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I am not confusing articles with subjects; the onus of expanding a lousy article lies on the person who created it or wants to keep it. What gets my goat about this whole <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Chinese_surnames_9af2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Chinese surnames">surname project</a> is that it is (1) entirely focused on increasing the quantity of surname related articles and (2) based on a number of questionable assumptions about Chinese history.</dd>

<dd>First, if the proponents of these articles focused on creating a small number of solid articles on a selected group of Chinese surnames, it would be easier to argue for an expansion of the project. I started to notice this when a number of biographies on I created got tagged with stuff like "This article is about person with the Chinese surname Chen." At first, I thought this was part of a project that was designed to improve Chinese biographies, but after a while I noticed that all the surname project managed to do was to create empty articles and lists, with no encyclopedic value whatsoever. This was several months ago, and I think it is time to ask where this project is taking Wikipedia.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, many of these articles confuse myths with history. I perfectly aware of the fact many people in China place great importance on surnames and that certain surnames carry special meaning for people. But the fact that a certain name can be traced back two or three thousand years back in history does not necessarily mean that all people bearing this same surname today have anything more in common than their surname. Anyone who is familiar with Chinese history or anthropology knows that claims of common ancestry should be taken with great deal of caution.</dd>

<li>I don't think it's relevant that the Yuan clans are <i>related</i> to the Yuan surname. They're distinct topics as indicated by certain sections of <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a> describing the name and other sections describing the clans. The separateness of the topics is already evident in the article, and I would propose making the separation even clearer by transferring the content about the name to Wiktionary. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 23:32, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think that's a fair representation of what sectionalizing an article means. The part about the surname ("Origins of the surname") provides essential background context to later sections. The article overall is about a particular surname. An encyclopedic treatment of such a subject requires discussing the origins of the name, where/when it is used, and any special (historical, political, cutlural) signifiance attached to the name or carriers of the name. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:30, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>You</b> don't think it's relevant. In Chinese history, the origins of clans led to the development of the surname. It's connected.

<li>Just to clarify, I didn't mean that the Yuan clans are irrelevant to the Yuan name.

<li>You clearly did mention a claim that the surname and the clan are "distinct" to the point of requiring two differemt articles. What do you understand from this topic to define this "distinction", and to form an opinion that they should be split into two different sites?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:09, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">article itself</a> is already divided into sections discussing the name (intro, Origin of the surname, Spread of the surname) and sections discussing the clans (Early Yuan clans, Genealogies, Clan organization). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>So? That's to make the article more readable. The article on <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> has separate sections for "Background and family life" and "Early political career". Surely you wouldn't suggest that these sections should be in separate articles? Or should we remove from the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> article the definition of the word? Dicdefs are allowed in Wikipedia <i>as long as</i> they are supplemented by additional encyclopedic content. It's the same situation here.

<li>I see. In other words, your only motivation to consider them "distinct" is due to the way a wikipedian article is sectionalised, and not due to your understanding of Chinese clans and Chinese surnames?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 03:21, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>My understanding of the Yuan clans and the Yuan surname, their relationship to each other, and their distinctness <i>despite this relationship</i>, is based on reading <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">the article itself</a>. If you have an understanding of this subject that goes beyond what is in the article, and you can source it, please add both the understanding and the sourcing to the article. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:35, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>But you are still not explaining just what "understanding" you have gleened from the above, other than to say there is a section for clans.

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Any name would be presumed distinct from a group of clans bearing that name. The burden is to explain why the Yuan name is somehow <i>not</i> distinct from the Yuan clans. After reading the article, it is apparent to me that there are things to be said about the name Yuan, and other things to be said about the Yuan clans. Why do you think that the relationship between the Yuan name and the Yuan clans means they're not <i>distinct</i>? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:17, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do not think the burden is on anyone other then the person claiming a "distiction" in a topic when no one has made such a distinction before. Your claim is unique, unverified and unsourced, and it is not the onus of the entire community to explain old, verified, and sourced information to you. Once again, you are simply not explaining to us just where does the "distinction" lies in other than superficial impressions. I am beginning to have serious doubts on your basic understanding of Chinese surnames, and the reasonings you throw up here.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 18:21, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The connection between Chinese surnames and clans is irrelevant to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">distinction we always make</a> between content appropriate for Wikipedia and content appropriate for Wiktionary. The organization of the article <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a> confirms the propriety of that distinction. I appreciate the significance of surnames in Chinese culture, as explained in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_surnames.html#The_sociological_use_of_surnames" title="Chinese surnames">Chinese surnames#The sociological use of surnames</a>, but that gives no warrant to violate the Wikipedia-Wiktionary distinction. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:52, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

One last thing: the section "Origin of the surname" is actually not even a definition! It's a historical background section. How is the sentence "Prior to the unification of China in 221 BC, the concentration of the surname was in the historical domain of Chen. Some members of the Yuan clan are known to have moved to Zheng and other neighbouring states." a definition? -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:37, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Chinese surnames, unlike those in many other cultures, are notable and have "deeper meaning" not simply because the characters carry meaning (weak argument) but because there are indeed so few. The phrase "the old one hundred surnames" (lao3bai2xing4) as a euphemism for the populace is indicative of this fact. Moreover, articles on Chinese surnames are in many cases very detailed, and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Category%7EChinese_family_names_896f.html" title="Category:Chinese family names">Category:Chinese family names</a> represents this fact as well. This is not a directory (what is An Tian Ming's phone number these days, anyway? Is he still on main street?), and is well sourced. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 22:24, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Many of the other lists of surnames are simple lists, with the listing indicating no useful arrangement other than simple alphabetization.
