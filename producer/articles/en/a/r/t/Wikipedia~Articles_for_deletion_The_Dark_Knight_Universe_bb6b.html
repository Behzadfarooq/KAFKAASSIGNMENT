<li><b>Delete</b> - this is an extremely unuseful and misleading article, because it suggests that every Batman story that Miller has written is part of the same "canon", distinct from the main canon, which simply isn't true. DKR and DK2 take place in the same "possible" future, true; but "Year One" is official continuity. Besides which, two books do not make a "universe". <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 11:03, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> What Seb Patrick said above is categorically false. Miller intends all of his stories to be read together: "Anything I come up with about any of these characters is DKU. DC winds up adopting just about all of it, anyway."<a href="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=27218" class="external autonumber" title="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=27218" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Spawn/Batman even mentions that it is a companion to DKR on the inside cover. The All-Star Batman and Robin page on Wikipedia mentions that he intends those books to be part of the same universe, which he himself calls The Dark Knight Universe. He also said that it is his own Batman: Year Two, his intended follow-up to Year One<a href="http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685820p1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685820p1.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> . That said, all of his Batman work has an explicitly stated internal continuity regardless of which books are official DC and which aren't. Calling the article "unuseful" and "misleading," therefore, is both unuseful and misleading to this discussion. Furthermore, this article existed as Frank Miller's Batman for over a month without setting off any red flags. So why is the new title suddenly grounds for deletion? It is a resource for Batman fans and fans of Frank Miller to see which works he has written on the character and what chronological order they proceed in, from the beginning to the end of Batman's career. This information is valid, alluded to in previously existing Wikipedia articles, and unavailable on other pages. It serves as a reference page, much as the "List of _____ Episodes" pages do. It also fits into multiple categories on this website such as Batman storylines and Batman writers. It can also be said to be a subcategory of Miller's work, ala the View Askewniverse (which, by the way, gets its own page) in relation to Kevin Smith. Finally, the fact that this was earmarked for deletion because it supposedly contains "false" data is further proof that it contains previously unknown information to users such as those posting above. Apparently, few of them knew that there was a Dark Knight Universe or that Miller's Batman work is internally consistent. Furthermore, the article itself states and has always stated which of these stories are Official DC continuity and which are not, another reason some have earmarked this for deletion. Rather that have an itchy trigger finger (not to mention a belittlement of the author and his or her intent) perhaps we should look at this article and see that it indeed describes a specific, verifiable DC alternate storyline that is only alluded to on other pages, none of which describe its full scope. For all these reasons, the article should stay. <a href="../../../s/s/a/User%7ESSantoro_917f.html" title="User:SSantoro">SSantoro</a> 16:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - the reason it was flagged for deletion now and not before when it had another title is that, #1, the "See Also" section of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> article was re-organized, and #2, the newer name better reflects the article's contents. Oh, and it is largely OR.

<li>There are multiple explicit statements by Miller himself in those articles, validating there testimony. They are all clearly in the same "universe."

<li>4. Newsarama: "Given that you’ve written the later chapters of Batman’s life with Dark Knight, and you’ve written Year One, and this is the unofficial “Year Two,” do you ever entertain fantasies of saying, 'F___ it, I’m going to write my Batman from his start to his end. DC, give me ten years, and let me go nuts'?" Miller: "That kind of fantasy flits through the mind every now and then, but essentially, I write stories when I really have a story I want to tell. I wouldn’t have taken this on if I hadn’t sat down, thought about what they were offering in terms of creative freedom, setting, and everything else. After looking at it all, I realized I had a story here. It does relate to my other stories, but I like the fact that yeah, I’ve done the other bookend, but to show Batman, and more to the point, Dick Grayson becoming a hero…when we first see him, he’s a frightened, traumatized little boy.

<li>5. "Spawn vs. Batman is a companion piece to DC Comic's The Dark Knight Returns." (Spawn/Batman inside cover). You would have to do a lot of logic leaps to pretend he's not talking about the same thing.
<ul>
<li>This is really tenative. He dodges a lot of those Newsarama questions, and referring to a book as a "companion piece" doesn't mean it's in the same continuity (e.g. V For Vendetta and Miracleman, which Moore has described as companion pieces on multiple occasions). This continuity seems to exist more in the mind of one Newsarama editor's opinion than Miller's mind, and constructing these sorts of fanon continuities from works that inspired later works smacks of original research. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:31, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>After all the posted quotes from Miller himself, the link to IGN stating the same information, and evidence from within the books themselves, you continue to insist that this article "smacks" of orginal research, i.e. fabricated information. The IGN site and Newsarama even reference "Comics in Context" as further evidence of the DKU. It's even well known by the fans, and you can see this if you frequent comics forums. Miller coined the phrase DKU, discusses it periodically (in multiple sources), and clearly considers his other Batman stories as a reference point whenever he writes a new one. According to another, no longer posted, Newsarama interview, <i>Miller stated himself that he asked DC to let him classify his works officially under the DKU label</i>, in which he would explore his own interpretation of the DC Universe. I know this is now unverifiable since the site has been taken down. Yet to support this, I reference again when Miller said, "Anything I come up with about any of these characters is DKU."<a href="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=27218" class="external autonumber" title="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=27218" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> This in and of itself proves the existence of the DKU, and that all of Miller's Batman stories are part of it.

<li>Frank Miller is not the publisher. DC is. DC decide which continuities tie into one-another, and which are canon. Notwithstanding the fact that Miller is the sort of person who will contradict himself in interviews over this sort of thing as the years go by (and the vagueness, as outlined by other commenters above, of some of the statements in interviews), it doesn't matter what he "intends" - it's to do with what he's commissioned to write, and what DC decide to do with it. Of all the stories mentioned in the article, <i>Year One</i> is the only one that takes place in official DC continuity, and DKR and DK2 are the only ones that are recognised as being in the same one as each other (if Miller has decided to go and tell his own "Year Two" with ASB&amp;R, then he's going against everything DC publicised the All Star line as, as that line is categorically supposed to contain completely continuity-free stories, a tenet he's clearly completely reneged on). I still maintain that the article is misleading by suggesting that Year One and DKR are part of the same continuity - they are NOT. Year One is part of a continuity in which, for example, Tim Drake is the third Robin. DKR does not acknowledge Drake's existence, having Jason Todd as the second and Carrie Kelly as the third. No matter what Miller's intentions as a writer, the final say goes to the people commissioning and publishing the books - i.e. DC Comics. You mention yourself that the article used to exist perfectly fine under a different name - and frankly, I can't understand the reason for the change. "Frank Miller's Batman work" is a perfectly acceptable title and a perfectly acceptable article. "The Dark Knight Universe", however, is an inherently problematic one, because it leads to this very debate we're having here - which means it clearly isn't encyclopedic. I maintain that it's misleading, because it's based on one person's opinion of what is canonical, and also because with the recent announcement of the title of the next Batman film, it suggests a connection to <i>that</i> universe. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 08:24, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your implication that the artist has no say over his own work and that only what DC decides matters is ludicrous. If I write a movie and publish it with MGM and then write a sequel and publish it with Fox, that does not mean that the movies are unrelated. Kevin Smith's Askewniverse is published by Miramax, Universal, and their subsidiaries. Since Miramax didn't publish Mallrats, does that mean that it has nothing to do with Clerks, despite what Miramax says? Miller's statements aren't inconsistent. He says and has always said that his Batman stories are connected. Spawn/Batman (published by IMAGE and not DC) says it's a companion piece to DKR, but according to your logic, that is impossible since DC wasn't fully in charge. Miller can certainly, without the permission of even care of DC, publish his own stories. That's why most of them are officially outside DC Continuity to begin with: Miller publishes what he wants, regardless of "official" DC Continuity. Year One contained some dramatic revisions to the DC Universe itself, and DC accepted it as tthe new origin for "Modern Age" Batman. Nevertheless, Miller is writing ASB&amp;R to follow up Year One in his own way. The All-Star label is not undermined by this. They hired Miller and Grant Morrison to write ANY stories they wanted outside DC Continuity (i.e. giving the author's frreedom to choose). Miller chose the DKU and Morrison chose the Silver Age. Honestly, given the citations, direct quotes, and the multiple other internal Wikipedia references, it seems more like some people are in the mood to delete something, regardless of whether it requires deletion. My defense hasn't been weak or "original." I don't think it will hurt Wikipedia to leave it up, unlike a band vanity page or the like. <a href="../../../s/s/a/User%7ESSantoro_917f.html" title="User:SSantoro">SSantoro</a> 13:37, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I also applaud SSantaro's research here, but there's not quite enough there to say this deserves its own topic. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 22:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I appreciate it. I'm not hellbent on keeping the article up, but I do believe that Miller's artistic intentions, as indicated in his quotes, deserve some sort of mention in some of the related articles. Though as per putting the name of an unofficial parallel storyline into an encyclopedia, that point is well taken. The thing that initially set me off was the implication that the article was based on fabricated "fanon," which is untrue. The author, not the fans, created, named, and continues to discuss the universe. Nevertheless, DC has (regrettably from my perspective) failed to give him his his own "universe" in an official, this has DC's stamp on it sort of way. <b>Though again I wonder about Kevin Smith's <a href="../../../v/i/e/View_Askewniverse_0618.html" title="View Askewniverse">View Askewniverse</a>.</b> The films are put out by different companies, yet maintain an inner continuity AND a Wikipedia article. "Yes," one might say, "but they are all products of View Askew Productions." Ahah! But so is <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jersey_Girl_7995.html" title="Jersey Girl">Jersey Girl</a> which, FYI, Kevin Smith and Wikipedia both mention as being OUTSIDE the View Askewniverse. That said, we really are dealing in a gray area here. <a href="../../../s/s/a/User%7ESSantoro_917f.html" title="User:SSantoro">SSantoro</a> 00:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Miller's view of the DKU isn't encyclopedic, but could be <b>Merged</b> into his article. -- <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocoder_9b81.html" title="User:Robocoder">Robocoder</a> (<small><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobocoder_39f3.html" title="User talk:Robocoder">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robocoder_5ab3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robocoder">contribs</a></small>) 13:05, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the article. Miller has said that all of his Batman stories follow the same continuity, and his interpretation of Batman is different enough from the mainstream writers of the DCU to warrant a seperate article. --<a href="../../../c/m/d/User%7ECmdrClow_aa26.html" title="User:CmdrClow">CmdrClow</a> 21:19, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Maybe keep the spawn stuff, merge out some of it into frank millers page but otherwise we'll have Alan Moore's DCU, Grant Morrisson's DCU, Geoff Jones DCU etc. etc. etc. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalendrom_b3c6.html" title="User:Palendrom">Palendrom</a> 02:06, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
