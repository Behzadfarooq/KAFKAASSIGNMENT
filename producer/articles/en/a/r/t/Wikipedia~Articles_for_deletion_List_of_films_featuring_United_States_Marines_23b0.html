<li><b>Keep</b> Sure, an article that merely has films because they have marines in it (no matter the role) would be a problem, however, this article does not have to be that article. It should be limited to those whose primary subject is related to the Marines. IOW, the American Presient which merely features marines wouldn't qualify, but something like Jarhead would. This is really no different than listing war movies by the war they depict. It might also work better as a category.

<li>I agree that ad hominem arguments are inappropriate, but that comment was not the gist of Docu's argument. Rather, it was an afternote to his main argument. It does, however, raise some concern that you nominated this for AfD <i>two minutes</i> after the "twist ending" article. That is hardly enough time to consider the merits of an article. Granted, maybe you looked them all over beforehand and then proceeded to nominate them for deletion. However, if the same criticism(s) are going to be applied to all of the articles, then a bundled nomination (or at least, a few bundled nominations of a couple articles each) would have been appropriate. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>As I noted in other AFDs, a mass nomination of 20-some articles would create chaos and would result in no consensus being reached and the nomination being closed with an instruction to renominate individually. Even smaller groupings are likely to be shut down, as recent grouped nominations of Amazing Race contestants and Millionaire contestants were shut down for being too unrelated to each other. And frankly it's not like any of these articles are so in-depth that they require vast amounts of time to consider. This article is a list of about 40 names. How long does it take to read that and come to a conclusion about it? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't take long to read and judge this list as being of high/low quality (seconds at most), but it does take more time to consider whether the topic itself has merit or if the article can potentially be refocused/improved. Perhaps you consider such lists/articles (no matter how they're written) to be <i>inherently</i> unencyclopedic (even if its, for example, "films about the USMC"). If that is the case, then I understand your fast-paced nominations, but I disagree strongly with that notion. It is not indiscriminate to group films by their primary subject of focus or the use of an object or characteristic as a major plot theme. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:07, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And while I do respect that a single mass nomination would have been even worse, so many nominations at once is still a concern to me. Either way it's a potential flood that might be better space out over a few days, perhaps nominating a few, seeing the response, and reacting accordingly. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:06, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am a very concerned WP Films member, especially on film lists issues. I am not a "deletionist" as such. However, Otto4711's move is having a very positive effect. Our lists have to be developed into useful articles, or should give their place to some category. The current AfD has brought out this issue and already solutions are being worked out. Please note that the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_years_in_film.html" title="List of years in film">List of years in film</a>, which was innitially just a navigation to a series of lists, had grown into an indiscriminate POV collection of films. So at one point it was nominated for AfD. During the AfD discussion, an editor was motivated to start developing it into something very useful. It's still under development, so please notice how it evolved (up to the 1930s) and how it looked berofe (1940s on). <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> <small><a href="../../../h/o/v/User_talk%7EHoverfish_2aee.html" title="User talk:Hoverfish">Talk</a></small> 14:36, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>At this point in the discussion, I took it upon myself to <b>rewrite</b> the article, which can be found at User:Saberwyn/Films featuring the United States Marine Corps. The top half of the article is a table displaying title and director, summary, date of release, and awards (a field which in hindsight should really be replaced with something else). The bottom half is an annotated version of the current article, saying why a particluar movie is or isn't included in the table (there are borderline cases in this section). Please comment and reconsider based on this rewrite. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 11:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I find the draft quite acceptable. I would recommend it as an example for several other film lists in need of cleanup/inclusion-explanations under the current AfD nomination. Details: not so many awards where applicable - give 1-2 main ones by name and the rest by number.

Many thanks for your improvements, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:01, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Excellent</b> I like the improvements to the page, and I believe this is the concept that should be used in improving this page. I don't know that it should be explicitly limited to films (though another page could cover other media appearances), and I might modify the criteria to include former marine characters if they're still central to the plot. Maybe adding exclusion criteria too, so folks no that a movie that just has some marines in it would not qualify. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:24, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Which movies would you add in, and what disqualification criteria would you add? -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 23:22, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One thing: I noticed that you decided not to include movies that don't have a corresponding Wiki article. However, I would leave those in IF you know that they would otherwise qualify. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:38, 27 February 2007 (UTC) By the way, I've added the movie "Tribes" to the Tribes disambig page-- it looks like it would qualify per information found on Amazon.com. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC) You should also leave in "Shores of Tripoli" the wiki article is under its full title <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_the_Shores_of_Tripoli_0362.html" title="To the Shores of Tripoli">To the Shores of Tripoli</a>. According to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035447/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035447/" rel="nofollow">IMDB</a> it is about the Marines. Also notable as <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maureen_O%27Hara_788f.html" title="Maureen O'Hara">Maureen O'Hara's</a> first Technicolor film. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC) Oh, also leave in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Santini_6540.html" title="The Great Santini">The Great Santini</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:55, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Further query: would you folks consider it appropriate to include something like the 1937 <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busby_Berkeley_1ed7.html" title="Busby Berkeley">Busby Berkeley</a> musical <i>The Singing Marine</i>? <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 05:02, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reason movies without Wiki articles were not included as without the article, I cannot confirm or deny the presence and impact of Marines in the plot. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 11:17, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the rewrite. GassyGuy 23:02, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
