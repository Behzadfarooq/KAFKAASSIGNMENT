<p>A vague list with no criteria for inclusion or exclusion. There is no definition of success and the article seems to have an English speaking county / US bias. It's basically uncited and probably unverifiable for the aircraft listed. As a side note, it was prod'd but de-prod'd by an anon user and the initial contributor of the article is now indef blocked. <a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 03:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I believe a major problem with the current article is that instead of using a single measure of "success" and clearly defining it, it uses varying criteria that seem to have been arbitrarily chosen. The list would be better if it used a single criterion, such as "List of aircraft with the longest production runs" or something like that. Of course, lists like that run the risk of going against the idea that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, but that's for another time. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#8652B9"><i>Kyok</i></font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETachikoma_1ad2.html" title="User talk:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#BA55D3"><i>o</i></font></a> 13:05, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, although weakly. Yes, there is a problem with the criteria for "success"; AFAIAC any aircraft that flies is "successful", since <i>man will never fly</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. How is this "mind-bogglingly subjective"? There are perfectly good criteria for "success" (albeit several different ones), and some are used here: <i>most ordered and produced commercial airliner</i> sounds successful to me. Clearly in need of cleanup, but a reasonable list. I see no problem at all with having several different criteria used; for example, "most manufactured", "longest in use", and "most profit" could all reasonably be thought of as criteria for success. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 15:52, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for insurmountable NPOV and OR issues. No objective definition of "successful" is possible. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:03, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>rename</b> because of the above comment suggest that a type of POV may be perceived in the term "most successfull". I suggest the new list be called: "List of sucessfull and poppular aircrafts". Also, remove any information which is not properly sourced. ie.: If "airplane A is very successful/popular" (which means it is in the list) then there should be a quote/reference to who said so. This avoids a violation of <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. If we say, according to, a survey from ABC inc., Airplane A is very popular, then Keep that information. Prior to any deletion the relevant sourced information should be verified and transfered to the <b>new list</b>. Finally, even though popularity is subjective it is less a contreversial theme than successfullness. Nevertheless, popularity is sometimes harder to evaluate and is subjective. Ironically many wikipedians believe popularity is a reason for inclussion or exclussion. <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_fuel_cell.html" title="Water fuel cell">Water fuel cell</a> is not that popular but it is an article. Also, sucessfullness and popularity can both be measured and hence are <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empirical.html" title="Empirical">empirical</a>. Empirical data is not subjective. It can be measured by a specific amount and devided by a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_denominator.html" title="Common denominator">common denominator</a> to give specific stats. These stats should be utilised if possible in this list. I may be correct to assume that those who vote because they believe the issue is subjectivity that perhaps it was your way of saying "that there is a lack of emperical data or referencing?". --<a href="../../../f/r/_/User%7EFR_Soliloquy_489e.html" title="User:FR Soliloquy">FR Soliloquy</a> 18:12, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The list doesn't need to be all-inclusive to be valid. Claiming it was all-inclusive would be a POV issue, but simply listing proably successful aircraft against various measures seems quite valid. Providing proper references to substantiate claims would make it acceptable. I do agree the title reads as horribly objective, but the claims made can be substantiated.

<li><b>Comment</b> I mean come on. Where is the relationship there between Lil' Murda and Aftermath Entertainment? Lil' Murda is signed to Young Bucks label, who is signed to 50 Cent's label who is signed to Dr. Dre's label (Aftermath). And this is a so called extended family? Nevermind that Dre will probably never meet Lil' Murda (we are never definite about the future), but this article is nothing but a bunch of loose affiliates. No family is ever applied. Why? Because it doesn't exsit. --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed87_265c.html" title="User:Ted87">Ted87</a> 07:05, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> This is too fancrufty. There is no point in having an article about "extended Aftermath Entertainment family," or whatever. It's convoluted, serves no real purpose, and has the potential to spiral out of control. If an artist is signed directly to Aftermath, then they can be cited on the Aftermath article. If they aren't signed directly to Aftermath, then there's no point in drawing a correlation simply because they're merely associated with someone who is.Enotiva 06:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - No point of having this article, as Ted87 said, I don't see how guys like C-Bo, Lil' Murda, or Awesome Two are related to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment label. Maybe we should just add a list of artists who are signed to Aftermath, Shady, and G-Unit, but nothing else, no "Fyre Dapartment" or whatever, and just add that list to the Aftermath, Shady, and G-Unit articles as a section such as "Record labels affiliated with Aftermath". So then only add the artists that are ON Aftermath, such as Eminem, Busta Rhymes, Dr. Dre, etc. Or G-Unit, 50 Cent, Young Buck, Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks, Olivia, and so on. --- <a href="../../../e/f/i/User%7EEfil4tselaer_e93e.html" title="User:Efil4tselaer">Efil4tselaer</a> 01:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Is the release on a major record label, as is required per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>? Just getting a record deal with <i>any</i> ol' body isn't sufficient. As for the "worked with" claim, leaving aside the issue of the perhaps dubious notability of at least some of those names themselves, the fact of that matter is that <i>plenty</i> of currently non-notable artists can truthfully claim that they've "worked with" big names. I don't care if he "worked with" <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoop_Dogg_0d8a.html" title="Snoop Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/d/Diddy.html" title="Diddy">Diddy</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay-Z_fefb.html" title="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a> all last week. The fact remains that right <i>now</i> he's got nothing released that's notable, and no media coverage that's notable, so right <i>now</i> . . . he is not notable. But I do sincerely wish him the best of luck in changing that situation in the future. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 23:46, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Movies are published, and certainly are reliable insofar as what appears in them! So how in the world is stating what's in a movie is OR? Does that mean that plot synopses is OR? Not at all.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Both articles mentioned were created because the pop culture sections were getting too long in the main articles. As long as Wiki policy prevents repetitive deleting of cruft (WP:3RR]], allows concensus by to determine what stays in an article (when crufters outnumber serious aircraft editors), and admins interfere with efforts to remove the cruft by 3RRing those who take it out, then Wiki in effect approves of cruft. SO if cruft is allowed to exist, then why not in its own article? Makes just as much sense as anything else Wiki does. And while you're on the OR bandwagon, swing on over to every article on every movie or TV show ever made. About 98% of them are totally unsourced. So as far as entertainment goes, the OR rule is not enforced on Wiki. So it's kinda silly for you to use that argument here. I'm all for banning unsourced cruft totally (assuming the admins would actually enforce it), but until that happens, this stuff is going to be somewhere. It has just as much right here as in a serious article on an aircraft. - - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 02:40, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - But this doesn't violate NOR. When you refer to something in a movie, or in a book, the movie itself is a reference, and the fact that there's a wikiarticle on the movie shows that it's recognized as a notable reference as well.

<li>Regarding the "indiscriminate listings" comment, we remove the RAH-66's "Incredible Hulk" appearence about once a month, and there is a lengthy discussion on that talk page regarding why the appearance is non-notable. While I have not personally vetted the list on the UH-60, I have vetted other lists, and it looks as if this list has been vetted too. THe Blackhawk is a popular icon, as has made many appearences. COuld a few onf the ones in that list be removed? Probably, but I've not seen all the movies on that list, so I don't know how significant their apperances are. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 05:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's obvious you guys have a vendetta against pop-culture lists, but you don't care a wit if the same items are listed in the main aircraft articles, even though, according to you, the items themselves are OR and indiscriminate. It bothers you more that there's a list of the items on a separate page than the fact the items exists at all. For whatever reasons, you just don't want pop-culture in list articles. That's fine, but at least admit that's your real issue. Stop <b>PRETENDING</b> the real reason is <b>OR</b>, because it's obvious us to those of us who deal with the issues everday that it's not! If it did bother you, then we'd see you in the edit histories of aircraft pages, fighting the good fight against OR! Meanwhile, serious aircraft editors fight against it every day without your help. A fight that will become even harder if you succeed in taking away the only real compromise we have with the crufters - the only semblance of peace in this never-ending war against cruft.

<dd>Just because people will persist in trying to include extraneous information is not a reason to sanction it. These lists are inherently OR because they require looking at primary sources, in the abscence of anyone REPORTING or STUDYING these things. Another issue is the fact these lists can NEVER be complete, a list of every game, movie, show and book that includes a given aircraft is not only interminable, but utterly useless. The other problem is determining what is, or is not, a reference, a problem I've addressed other places, but one I feel is a serious issue. A quick look through these various lists will turn up the idignation of many editors; either 'that's not a reference!' or 'they missed ...'

<li><b>Delete</b> per Wintermut et al. Aside from the numerous other considerations cited, I'm militantly disinterested in the assertion by BillCJ and others that it's necessary to create these crufty, unencyclopedic, unsourced, POV lists because otherwise main articles would be cluttered with the "information." <i>Who says?</i> If you think a series of articles you monitor are being deluged with crap, <i>revert the edits.</i> It's no different from any other WikiProject subject to trivial bombardment of one fashion or another. Nothing in Wikipedia policy requires us to accept every single unsourced hunk of crap triviality. This is the moral equivalent of we over in <a href="../../../h/o/c/WP%7EHOCKEY_7a0a.html" title="WP:HOCKEY">WP:HOCKEY</a> complaining that we needed to make a List of NHL players wearing CCM brand ice skates just because some folks decided they just had to identify CCM wearers. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:22, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Strongly concur with <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> in saying that "The main article would be too cluttered" is not an explicit reason for the creation of new garbage articles. When your home becomes cluttered with junk, do you build a new room to contain the junk? No, you clean up the mess. The notion that subsections of an article ought to be forked out in to their own articles is valid when the information is encyclopedic in its own right. Just because it is there in the parent article does not mean it belongs in its own article, however, and an otherwise pointless "List of appearences of X in popular culture" have absolutely no encyclopedic value! If any of these "appearances" are somehow significant to the development of X's article then they can be merged back in under a heavily trimmed section, but a laundry list of "Hey I saw it in this movie!" is a waste. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:51, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>AGAIN - I have NO problem deleting genuine cruft from main articles - I do it EVERY day. THe problem is that repeatedly deleitng the same information that a user keeps putting back in leads to revert wars. I don't want ANY pop culture items in ANY aircraft articles at all, on purist grounds, but that does not mean that genuinely notable appearences are not encyclopedic, and should not be mentioned somewhere. But if I keep removing any pop culture items from aircraft articles, eventually some stupid admin with his head up is rear is going to think <b>I'm</b> revert warring, and you morons won't be around to back me up. Yes, the list here is too long; someone dropped the ball in watching it. However, the PROPER soulution is to trim it back as far as possible, and add cite tags. THat is the PROPER way to deal with unsourced material, if thet were GENUINELY what you guys were interested in. But again, you just DO NOT LIKE pop culture list articles, no matter how well-kept they are! <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_in_popular_culture_0cfe.html" title="Air Force One in popular culture">Air Force One in popular culture‎</a> is a vetted, trimmed, well-kept article, but one of you still AfDed it! SO DO NOT GIVE ME THIS GARBAGE ABOUT <i>absolutely no encyclopedic value!</i> - JUST BE MEN AND ADMIT YOU JUST DON'T LIKE THE LISTS! PERIOD! But please get of your stinking policy high-horse, stop harrassing GENUINE EDITORS who actually want to make decent articles. If the page is OR, TAG IT!

<dd>Am I to assume then we are all supposed to kowtow to the editors who revert changes intended to restore an article to meet policy and guidelines?

If you're worried about <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> then try to resolve the issue with the "warring" editor.

And <i>that</i> being said, BillCJ, do you really think it's constructive to scream at us because you think we don't like pop culture articles, when you admit yourself you don't want pop culture references in the articles about which you yourself care?

<dd>Ok, here's a reason: Despite what some call "cruft", the fact that a type of helicopter <i>has</i> an impact on popular culture is significant. The Blackhawk isn't quite the icon that they Huey is, but it's getting there. Face it, how military objects impact society and culture can't be ignored (hey, there's whole sciences, ie "sociology" and "cultural anthropology" about this stuff). <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 20:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Uh, if this helecopter actually " <i><b>has</b> an impact on popular culture</i>" there would surely be documentation in sociological journals.

<p><b>comment to above</b>: The above sub-paragraph is to help divide this AfD for perusal and editing reasons. I couldn't find my comment in this long debate so here is my comment to my previous statement and reply to the above question from RGTraynor. I am not presuming, absent any <i>attribution</i>, that all those movies which supposedly have UH-60s in them actually do. Those movies are documents in of themself and generally, for those people that stay to the end of a movie at the cinema, you can see the credits. Those credits will indicate what type of vehicles where used in a given movie. Perhaps you are confusing original research a synthesis of because A (image of UH-60) and B(image of UH-60 in movie) then movie has UH-60. I don't know but, according to me such a synthesis would and should be pretty obvious and no different than the commonly accept idea "the sky is blue." Perhaps there is a mix up here on the interpretation of what wikipedia is and is not. A movie is a generally considered a reliable source of information, in fact it is the primary source. Nevertheless <a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?s=kw&amp;q=Helicopter" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/find?s=kw&amp;q=Helicopter" rel="nofollow">here is a link</a> to a secondary source which states which movies use a helicopter. And here is a published comments, which has been peer reviewed, that state that there was a black hawk in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265086/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265086/" rel="nofollow">this movie</a>. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 21:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>CP, besides your misunderstanding about <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATTribution</a> and primary vs. secondary sources (which tends to indicate <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>), this is simply unencyclopaedic content. If it were truely notable (and actually impacts popular culture) there would be <i>true</i> reliable secondary sources (peer-reviewed sociological journals, in this case) talking about all the impacts of thus-and-so helicopter on popular culture. Obviously there are no such articles because it has no relevance in popular culture -- this is, as most have pointed out, list cruft and is not appropriate for wikipedia. Hope this helps clear this up. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 22:24, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Those links are, frankly, a waste of our time. All along the keep-proponents have been pushing the notion that this article is necessary because it lists (in theory, accurately) the movies in which <i>this particular model of helicopter</i> appears. Now your purported attribution is a simple linksearch on IMDB for "helicopter?"

<p>Indiscriminate information. It's not immediately clear what this article is specifically about. It seems to be 4 seperate articles about 4 unrelated species, from 4 different and unrelated films: <i>The Descent</i>, <i>The Cave</i>, an unspecifified film featuring "The Grue" (the Riddick films), and the <i>Mimic</i> films. Article needs to sent back to Subterranea. Saikokira 00:54, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I do not think notability is an issue with SIMUN. Notability is different from the number of actual participants. The host (French School of Singapore) tries to keep the SIMUN professional by giving out strict criteria in choosing the delegates and the chairpersons are all hand-picked plus voted. That's why it only has around 350 delegates. Please note that there are not many inter-school MUNs in Singapore, and almost all private, independent and international schools on this island-state are participating in the Singapore Model United Nations. For high school students of Singapore it is an honor to join SIMUN and the notability is across all schools and many notable media, as stated in the article. Also, many Model United Nations conferences that do not have an article does not mean that this article shouldn't exist. --<a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJingshen_b1ac.html" title="User:Jingshen">Jingshen</a> 10:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per above. Model UNs, model legislatures, model city councils, they all proliferate like weeds and none have any real notability. We don't have articles for other minor LARPs, although there are many LARPs with many more players and which meet far more often. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Iagree that models of organisations do not have impact on the world but they are notable and should be respected. There are reliable secondary sources as said in article. With all the respect and my inexperience with Wikipedia egnlish, I do not really know what LARPS are, but I believe meeting often does not automatically qualify for notability. Singapore Model United Nations should exist by itself because of its uniqueness in location/venue, the participants, organisation, and the audience. It is significant as I have said many times in SIMUN publications that Singapore is an inward looking nation. It is important, especially for teenagers who are the future of our world, to understand what is going on outside. Singaporeans esp the young have only theoritical knowledge about UN and all educators want them to have practical knowledge and that's why schools recommend SIMUN and that's why SIMUN is so notable and highly regarded. SIMUN, being the only inter-school conference coordinated by Singapore gives the valuable chance for schools to work together. singapore has many difference educational systems such as GCSE and IB, etc. Students of SIMUN learn interactively with these people from different systems. The SIMUN discusses wider issues and more issues in depth than many more of them with thousands of participants. And more current issues are well. The issues for THIMUN and other big MUNs are usually set a year ago. SIMUN is more up-to-date with problems to debate such as Iran and the day-to-day management of the real UN such as the 2007 resolution of the UN charter. SIMUN is definitely unique and has its own value. The general MUN article certainly cannot cover that. Therefore I should urge Wikipedia to keep this article. There are not many articles about Singapore and none about MUNs in Singapore. Wikipedia, as an International encyclopedia, should include general issues as well as those that fit both international and locally, such as SIMUN. This article will do all good and no harm. If I were to make a big encyclopedia I would definitely include it. Strongly Keep. excuse my spelling mistakes svp I am not English native speaker.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You've made an eloquent case for why this program is important to Singapore high school students. You have yet to make an argument for how this article meets Wikipedia guidelines and policy for the inclusion of articles. We do not dispute -- nor is it our place to do so -- whether there is a need for Singapore's youth to understand the greater world around them.

<dd>Glad you asked. Take a look at <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. First off, "A company, corporation, organization, group, product, or service is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered. If the depth of coverage is not substantial, then multiple independent sources should be cited to establish notability. Trivial or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability." All the sources given in the article come from the organization itself. "Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable independent sources can be found." <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 01:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hellio as the coordinator of Singapore Model United Nations, I say this is an organzation, nor a company, product, etc. It is notable annual event with significant meanings as it combines the locality of Singapore with International schools and international concepts (i.e. the UN) to achieve alternative learning through experience and nationwide communication of international matters.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancois_Cornu_7fdf.html" title="User:Francois Cornu">Francois Cornu</a> 12:20, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Subject seems to have two primary claims to notability. Firstly, he ran for Congress as a Republican nominee in 1972. However, he did so in a distict in which it didn't even matter who the Republican nominee was, because the district was drawn so strongly in favor of the Democrat. The Democrat won with almost 70%. Not only did Strickland not win, but he didn't even come in second. So seems to fall short of the politician guidelines in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Secondly, there is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_29/b3741618.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_29/b3741618.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> article in <i><a href="../../../b/u/s/BusinessWeek_6dfe.html" title="BusinessWeek">BusinessWeek</a></i> about him. Definitely a quality secondary source. But per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, if coverage in a single secondary source is not "substantial", then multiple secondary sources are required.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Wikipedia is one of the premier places where a lot of people go for elections data and to learn about political figures. Even if this guy didn't win, this was still an important step when talking about how the Republican Party performed in Louisiana and specifically in this seat which would go for the Republican candidate a few years later. Also, the larger page for Gillis Long doesn't include all of the information about his challengers, something which would appear to be very useful to anybody who wanted to know about his actions during campaigning, given that he was a major politial figure in Louisiana's history.

<li><b>Keep</b> It has been generally accepted that major party candidates for election to the national legislative body are N. This may sometimes been problematic in the case of nations with multi-party systems, but in the US it is clear that there are two generally accepted ones. (Whether candidates from other parties are N might depend on the votes). That makes only about 500 defeated candidates every two years (actually fewer, many people run more than once)&#160;; it also means that the people who do get that far are among the 1,000 most prominent politicians in the country. I think that is clear and undoubtable notability. Quibbling about the details of a career or how many votes someone got is irrelevant/That's for the election campaign, not for use. WP is indeed one of the places people go to for general information, and this includes politics--certainly it includes national politics. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:43, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If that line of reasoning (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is satisfied by being a major party candidate for national legislature) is going to be followed — and, at first consideration, I actually would not have a huge problem with that idea — then the politician guidelines laid out in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should reflect that. It shouldn't have to be a matter of you (nor me nor anyone else) in a delete discussion claiming that it's "generally accepted". It should be in the guidelines. I'll see how this debate comes out and if that argument is accepted, I'll bring up the issue on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> talk page for a possible change there. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 20:36, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. In researching the archives of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> talk page I found three different occasions on which the issue of whether a <i>losing</i> candidate should automatically qualify for notability was discussed. Two of those three times, it being specifically identified as the losing candidate in a congressional election. All three times, the sentiment expressed was that the losing candidate should <b>not</b> automatically be considered notable. So I'd challenge your assertion that it's "generally accepted that major party candidates for election to the national legislative body are N". That statement does not appear to be true at all. If anything, it appears to be "generally accepted" that if the <i>only</i> claim to notability is being the losing candidate in a congressional election, then they are <b>not</b> N.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If such sources are found and cited, then fine. But no one has done so (besides the <i>BusinessWeek</i> article, which isn't even about his congressional election) to this point, and I'm not sure I believe there is "no doubt" that multiple, reliable, non-trivial, secondary sources (something <i>about</i> Roy C. Strickland, not just something that shows there was a name of "Roy C. Strickland" on the congressional ballot in 1972) and retrievable for someone who came in third in a virtually uncontested 1972 congressional election. And according to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, the burden of proof, with regard to whether there are adequate sources, falls on those who wish to add or retain the article. <i>So far</i>, I don't see any proof of such sources besides that one article. So it still seems to me that as things stand right now, this guy would satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> <i>only</i> if we accept the proposition, per <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a>, that losing congressional candidates are inherently notable, even in the absence of the availability of those such sources about them. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 22:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As far as her notability, you're correct. If there isn't any more to her than what that article says now, and no other <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>-acceptable referneces to be found for her, then she's even less notable than Strickland. No argument there. But that doesn't necessarily make Strickland a keep (see <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a>); I'd say it makes hers a candidate for deletion. The discussion as to whether losing congressional candidates should be automatically notable or not is still on-going on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html#Politicians:_Losing_congressional_candidates_automatically_notable.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">WP:BIO talk page</a>, so I'd hold off on nominating her for deletion pending that outcome. But if the outcome of that is "no, they are not", and if no one can demonstrate further notability for her article either, I'd absolutely say that one should go too. As for judging of full articles vs. stubs, <i>everything</i> that's presented as factual and could be challenged must be so judged. A full article, by its nature, though, has a lot more info in it that needs to <i>be</i> verified by <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> standards. Since a stub doesn't say much, there's not much that might be challenged. A couple of pointers to official election results would provide adequate verification of almost everyting that's in the Hearn stub right now. In Strickland's article, however, there is a great deal of info who's <i>only</i> verification we have is either primary source and/or original research. That's why, even if we decide Strickland's notability as a Republican congressional nominee is sufficent for a keep, I still think the retained article would then need to be significantly gutted unless other independent, secondary sources about Strickland can be found. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 01:04, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. Above the special notes about politicians at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is the suggested inclusion criterion "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." Strickland would appear to be borderline with respect to this criterion. In fact, the statement in the opening sentence of the article "who was a pioneer in the development of the Republican Party in Louisiana" would seem to be in conflict with Strickland's repeated failure to achieve elected office. If some citation could be found that either indicated that Strickland's "struggle" helped to shape the state party (currently lacking) or if some citation could be found that could insert Strickland into the paragraph at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party_0712.html#Realignment:_The_South_becomes_Republican" title="History of the United States Republican Party">History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party#Realignment:_The_South_becomes_Republican</a>, that would suffice to support retention of the article, I think.

<li>Changing to <b>Keep</b>, based on the references added. Thanks for changing my mind. =^_^= The article is still spammy and needs a cleanup, so if somebody can get that, great.

<li><b>Comment with regard to A.Z's comments above</b>. Firstly, I do not see the rationale behind A.Z. picking holes in the above arguments without stating his/her own position. Indeed, I would call such a stance vexatious - in that it adds nothing to the debate. Secondly, looking at A.Z's contribution history it would appear that he/she has a strong interest in LBGT matters and comments on the Reference Desk, but has largely stayed away from AFD discussions. Thirdly, the above comments all reference this article wrt to Wiki policies and/or standards yet A.Z. appears to take the position that all contributors to this AFD discussion are, thus far, in error. So, what gives, A.Z? Are you for or against this nomination and on what grounds?

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree that the article on the league is notable and of reasonable quality and I would also agree that the clubs are possibly notable too, but the season is likely to be of passing interest only.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is a policy on English soccer leagues which I understand maintains the first ten levels. The Mallee Football League would of similar notability to one of the lower leagues in that standard. However, the reserves and colts are not notable enough to warrant an article and should be deleted. There may be a case for the main article with brief summaries of the lower grades. In summary, weak keep main grades, delete lower grades. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 01:19, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article contains a lot of POV, unsourced nonsense. Furthermore, many of the bullet points have little to do with the attacks on September 11, 2001.

The unsourced opening paragraph seems to conclude that the background of the attack is "US foreign policy with regard to predominantly Muslim countries and Israel in the latter part of the Cold War, the growth of radical Islamism, and prior terrorist attacks on the United States" and as such is original research. This narrow conclusion of the causes then becomes a POV fork to be critical of these presumptuous, unsourced "background" events. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 07:56, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia rules are not suitable for articles like this, where deciding what to include controls the message the article delivers (by showing readers a bunch of dots they can connect, per Morton). Unless we create new (article-specific?) rules, editors have to make decisions about what to mention or omit based on their own POV. No wonder the result is less than satisfactory. This is not a suitable topic for an article in any encyclopedia, and is an invitation to POV-warring in this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">CWC</a><small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Chittleborough_55c1.html" title="User talk:Chris Chittleborough">(talk)</a></small> 12:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Undecided</b> I'm undecided on this. Chapters 2-8 of the 9/11 commission report deal with "background' history, as well as some material that can go in the "planning" article. The 9/11 commission report also has extensive footnotes, which lead one to more good, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources. Of course, such an article could be attractive to POV pushers, but at the same time if it can be made to work, with good sources and comply with policies, then it might be useful. I suggest maybe stubbing the article and even moving to userspace, until time if/when if can be brought up to acceptable quality and compliance with policies. I'm of the opinion that it's better we try making something acceptable out of this, so people have something neutral to look at when they search "9/11 + background" on google, as opposed to some of the other material that turns up in searches. As the article stands now, though it's no better than the other things that turn up in a google search. That's why I suggest stubbing it, and if after some effort it can't be made to work then delete it. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAude_cc13.html" title="User:Aude">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAude_bc63.html" title="User talk:Aude">talk</a>)</small> 12:46, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</s></li>

Roboliberal seems to have a skewed notion of what constitutes "significant body of well-known work," "notable awards" or "regarded as important figure by peers." Wikipedia policy has in mind a slightly larger field than the theater community in Ithaca, NY. When Mr. Callan's acclaim comes from the New York Times theater reviewer instead of from his college newspaper, and his awards from the Tony nominators rather than the local theater, that will merit notice. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No Delete</b> Respectfully, I disagree on both counts for proposed deletion. Mr. Callan is a writer whom I work with on several IC-TV shows and is of extreme notability in the areas in which he writes. Certainly, the accusation that it is somehow self-advertisement is baseless and without proof. I have worked with the author but am not even a close friend, so in neither case does the article fit the criteria for auto-biography as laid out in the wiikipedia guidelines. After all, IC-TV itself (our campus TV station) has a wiki entry, so why not an entry on one of its more popular writers?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The case comes down to one of notability. I have fufilled at least three out of five of the notability criteria: recieved notable awards (cited), regarded as an important figure by peers (cited), has created a significant body of well-known work (cited). I would welcome suggestions on how to demonstrate the other two criteria, but there are honestly few authors that have statues or monuements of them built, anyway. And no one cites a problem with *their* wiki entries. The lack of a secondary source (such as a non-fiction book about the author's work) is one that I could find numerous wiki-entries on authors to support in contrary. Many articles on semi-popular modern authors fail to meet this requirement. I would like to remove the tag for speedy deletion, honestly. I welcome other opinions however.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - A wee bit of digging. I've no beef with the notability of the <a href="../../../i/c/t/ICTV_9197.html" title="ICTV">ICTV</a> site, seeing as it has won numerous awards <a href="http://www.ictv.org/sections/awards/awards.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ictv.org/sections/awards/awards.php" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> and serves 26,000 homes on Time Warner basic cable in the county in which Ithaca is located. By the bye, that awards list? Callan does not appear.

<li><b>Strongly Object to Deletion</b>I object to the notion that the subject in question is not notable because he hasn't had a write up in the New York Times. There are plenty of television and comics writers who have never once had a write-up by either the New York Times or any other national paper who warrant (and have) wikipedia pages. Likewise, I will point everyone to the "notability page" for Wikipedia requirements which clearly spells out that fame IS NOT equivalent to notability. Mr. Callan is a well-known author in the Ithaca and Priceton communities and I believe I have established notability in this regard through numerous citations and articles. An inability to find a few of these clearly cited articles doing cursory google searches is not the fault of the subject. The world exists beyond the internet. And I'm not at all sure The Cornell Daily Sun makes an archive of even a majority of its articles. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Roboliberal (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERoboliberal_4356.html" title="User talk:Roboliberal">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roboliberal_0f21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roboliberal">contribs</a>) 21:48, 19 March 2007 (UTC).</small><small>— <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsername_4f9c.html" title="User:Username">username</a> (<a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUsername_2815.html" title="User talk:Username">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_username_c492.html" title="Special:Contributions/username">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.

<p><s>There is nearly no encyclopaedic value in this article, as firstly such things do not really belong in a separate fork of this nature; and secondarily it seems unclear to me how this article could ever be written in an informative manner as a factual piece. In fact, what it is covering is perhaps "non-mainstream theories" versus conspiracy theorism, and writing articles very specifically on generalised classes of such matters is highly questionable. Consequently, I feel deletion is the only viable option, as it is difficult to see how it could be written in an NPOV manner. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 05:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</s> Withdrawn - since it seems I hadn't really considered this very well, considering the comments below.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although I believe these AIDS conspiracy theories to be complete rubbish, it appears that there exist several experts who seem to believe that these conspiracies exist. Like the 9/11 "Truth" Movement, no matter how ridiculous a conspiracy theory, if it is notable then Wikipedia needs to provide an article for it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Great, but that's just a laundry list of long lists of photographers amongst which he is mentioned, a production he was in, and so forth. We get (and do not dispute) that the guy exists. We dispute that he is a notable photographer. Our advice is to demonstrate how Mr. Stember fulfills the criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, especially the following pertaining to "creative" individuals:</li>

<dd>* The person has received notable awards or honors.</dd>
<dd>* The person is regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by their peers or successors.</dd>
<dd>* The person is known for originating a significant new concept, theory or technique.</dd>
<dd>* The person has created a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, which has been the subject of an independent book or feature-length film, or of multiple independent periodical articles or reviews.</dd>
<dd>* The person's work either (a) has been displayed in a significant exhibition or as a monument (b) has won significant critical attention, or (c) is represented within the permanent collection of a significant gallery or museum of more than local significance.</dd>

<dd>Until that happens -- and even IF that happens, this is still going to be a vanity article that could fail to pass muster on that ground alone -- Calton's characterization of the subject as a "journeyman" photographer looks spot on. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blatant self-promotion / advertising. Prolific name dropping but are there actually any links to anything that references the guy? -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 07:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why don't you try checking: www.google.com / www.imdb.com / www.johnstember.com / or contact any of the people mentioned for references. We are not trying to promote but simply inform which is what we believe an encyclopedia is for unless you think otherwise. We have taken exactly the same format as used on many other pages including john's ex-wife's carey lowell. if your response is so negative why don't you try offering some advice&#160;? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by John Stember (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Stember_8a20.html" title="User talk:John Stember">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John_Stember_08f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/John Stember">contribs</a>) 08:09, March 19, 2007.</small></p>

<p>Unsourced article. I get 358 Google hits for the name. The most salient claims to notability seem to be the awards but I am unable to confirm them from reliable third party sources (3 Google hits for "Robert Graves poetry award", 1 Google hit for "Edgeworth Prize for poetry"). No hits at Amazon.com for "Kudryavitsky", Amazon.co.uk has an entry for <i>A Night in the Nabokov Hotel</i> with a publication date this month and a sales rank of 1,036,009. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 08:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>:My dear Mr Bakharev, the author has published every book mentioned in the biog. To state the opposite is sheer ignorance, or even worse. There's no place here for uneducated guesses, like yours. I've checked and double checked all the sourses and added a couple. All in all, the author published seven collections of his Russian poems with reputable Russian publishers; three of them with the Third Wave Books, the publisher of Joseph Brodsky. His English collection was brought out by the Kildare-based Goldsmith Press, who published Patrick Kavanagh, among the others. I am beginning to think that you're no expert in Russian literature, Mr Bakharev. Not yet. Generally, I am terrified by the prospect of authors being judged by people who know little about literature and seldom read books. Counting Google hits seems more important to some folks. If only they could count a wee bit better...User:Dreamcatcher9 03:46, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> I am the creator of this article, and I have been in communication with <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">User:Calton</a> on this issue. I added this article because I thought it was relevant to the previous article on Matt McAllister. I am not making the argument that simply because both were included in the Guinness World Records that this automatically merits their inclusion in Wikipedia. On the contrary, Waltke has been featured in dozens of newspapers, film, television and radio programs regarding his record (as I cited in the article) as well as publications on the history of the t-shirt (also cited in the article). This includes an appearance on the <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> program of <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Beck_a946.html" title="Glenn Beck">Glenn Beck</a>'s "Sick Twisted Freak", which gave him national exposure. If these grounds aren't enough, I have already suggested to <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">User:Calton</a> that perhaps a <b>merged article</b> would be in order for the record itself, which gained even more attention in the past 6 months because of Matt McAllister, the previous record holder. Matt McAllister became notable under the premises of a the Wikipedia definition of an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a>. The viral YouTube video of his record breaking that was uploaded in September 2006 (which is linked in his Wikipedia article) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6tlw-oPDBM" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6tlw-oPDBM" rel="nofollow">has been very widely viewed (nearly 3,000,000 separate views as of this writing) on the initial uploaded site alone since its inception.</a> This is far more internet exposure than many other videos listed under <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a>, such as <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Brolsma_7d5b.html" title="Gary Brolsma">Gary Brolsma</a>, who has not one but two separate articles about him (the other regarding his <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_Numa_aede.html" title="Numa Numa">Numa Numa</a> video) and whose cited video <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6377855743675143177&amp;q=numa+numa+gary" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6377855743675143177&amp;q=numa+numa+gary" rel="nofollow">has been viewed around 1,000,000 times.</a> In addition to this, McAllister's internet popularity earned him a guest spot on the October 12th, 2006 episode of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Late_Show_with_David_Letterman_e8f9.html" title="The Late Show with David Letterman">The Late Show with David Letterman</a>, earning him further national exposure. Because the record which made him famous was broken, I thought this merited some mention at least in his article, and possibly another independent article for Aaron John Waltke. If the Wikipedia editors' consensus is that these biographies are too trivial to merit independent articles, then I would wholly endorse a <b>merger</b> into a general article about the record, but not a wholesale deletion of all mention of it.--<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodAaron_ddcb.html" title="User:GoodAaron">GoodAaron</a> 20:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Calton, please try not to become defensive. I only meant that I had contacted you about contesting the article. What I have tried to illustrate above is why <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a>, which openly admits that it is neither an official policy or guideline but more of a "matter of opinion", is a bad argument to use here. I will try to clarify this as best as I can below. As for the label of "ludicrously trivial bid for fame", I know of no other way to engage that kind of arbitrary assessment than by laying out my reasoning as rationally as possible as to why it is not "trivial" in the terms of notability.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Accepted Premises:</b></dd>
<dd>1.) A Wikipedia article is eligible for deletion if it is not found to meet notability standards.</dd>
<dd>2.) The achievement of a Guinness World Record alone is not enough to meet notability standards.</dd>
<dd>3.) According to the above Wikipedia Editor consensus, Aaron John Waltke may not be eligible for notability as an independent article.</dd>
<dd>4.) If Matt McAllister can be found to meet notability requirements, it is possible that Aaron John Waltke could be merged into the McAllister article as relevant information.</dd>
<dd>5.) The Matt McAllister article may be eligible to meet notability standards on the grounds of the Wikipedia category <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a>.</dd>
<dd>6.) The notability standards of the Wikipedia category <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a> are ambiguous, because there are no minimum quantifiable standards in place to define that category.</dd>
<dd>7.) If there are no quantifiable standards in place to define a category, <b>then there is no other option than to rely on examples of precedent to define that category.</b></dd>
<dd>8.) Other undisputed examples within the Wikipedia category <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a> include <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Brolsma_7d5b.html" title="Gary Brolsma">Gary Brolsma</a>. Matt McAllister has received just as much exposure (as measured in the quantified number of views) with his World Record viral video as <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Brolsma_7d5b.html" title="Gary Brolsma">Gary Brolsma</a> (see above). On these terms of notability, the two articles are analogous.</dd>
<dd>9.) Matt McAllister has also appeared on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Late_Show_with_David_Letterman_e8f9.html" title="The Late Show with David Letterman">The Late Show with David Letterman</a> for his World Record viral video. <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Brolsma_7d5b.html" title="Gary Brolsma">Gary Brolsma</a> was mentioned in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> Entertainment section for his viral video. On these terms of notability, the two articles are analogous.</dd>
<dd><b>THEREFORE</b>: Since the Matt McAllister article appears to be eligible for notability on terms of the Wikipedia category <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a>, and much of the information in the Aaron John Waltke article would be relevant as an addition to the Matt McAllister article, the McAllister article should be retained and the Aaron John Waltke article should be <b>merged</b> with it.--<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodAaron_ddcb.html" title="User:GoodAaron">GoodAaron</a> 00:46, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Aaron, please try not to become verbose and nonsensical: <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> was pointed out to you to stop the complete non-starter that is the "Why does HE get an article and *I* can't" argument: been there, done that, got a closetful of t-shirts. You'll note that my response to your original <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> claim was to immediately slap a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPROD_4af6.html" title="Template:PROD">PROD</a>}} tag onto the other article: if it's been removed, Matt McAllister is coming to AFD, too.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is well-sourced, and fairly well written. Given the frequency of AfD noms for list and organisation-related articles, I wonder if a review is needed about the notability of user "groups" in general. If <i>millions</i> of people are part of a group, does that not at least give a group notoriety? While every group with 1,000,000 members may not deserve an article, neither do the many lists and collections of loosely associated articles. I think that a policy page dealing strictly with creation of "list" and "collection" style articles may be necessary, to reduce the number of AfD nominations produced daily.--<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcause365_3c3a.html" title="User:Lostcause365">Lostcause365</a> 00:38, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't know the guy. The convention on Wikipedia is to use the name the subject is most widely known as for the title (e.g., "Sting" instead of "Gordon Sumner"), whether or not it's their legal or birth name. If he's only called "Skip" in certain situations or by certain people, then no, that wouldn't be the one to go with. Maybe Joseph F. Ryan or Joseph Ryan (Minister). It's not big deal currently because this is the only Joseph Ryan article. However, if you hit the "what links here" button, you'll find there's a Joseph Ryan in the 1934 longshore strike, one in the 1904 Olympics, another who's an Irish-American mobster, and a Winnipeg Blue Bomber. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 15:56, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're right, it's a little off topic. But since no one who has an interest in the article is around, what else do we have to talk about?

<dd>I changed my vote to delete. Looking a little closer, the subject doesn't resonate outside a very localized church circle. He has 2 books, that technically aren't self-published, but if you google the titles, all they produce are websites trying to sell them. No reviews or indication that they provoked any interest beyond his own small flock, of which he is no longer the shepherd. He was the minister of a church with money, and that's why he was published. Newspaper articles? He wrote an editorial years ago in a Dallas paper. The same paper announced his retirement. Not much else. His controversial stepping down has been pretty much kept under wraps except for an announcement on the church website admitting that he's a drug addicted deviant, just another wayward sheep needing restoration by the church (which no doubt consists of purchasing non-notable books from Crossway publishing). No one outside the congregation seem to care or have noticed, or else are too nervous about incurring the wrath of the church by saying anything publicly (at least that's the impression given on the talk page). Besides that, he met with Bono, as have a kazillion other people. Looking at the article's history, Bono's "people" stepped in disallowing a photo of the rev and superstar from appearing on Wikipedia, which doesn't bode well in establishing notability. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 17:12, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Page is about an obscure language which is a subset of Esperanto. Supposedly the grammar is still incomplete. It was invented last year, and the author or someone close to the project wants extra exposure here on Wikipedia. Two PROD templates have been placed on the page, one by me, one by someone else. Both have been blanked by the original author, without the concerns being addressed. -- <a href="../../../y/e/k/User%7EYekrats_29d5.html" title="User:Yekrats">Yekrats</a> 10:55, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nominating two articles, which appear to be of the same organisation.

<li><b>Reply&#160;:</b> To answer your question yes it is, a limited liability company is a for profit organization that has to produce thier accounts to the auditor general/Department of Inland Revenue, every financial year or when requested. Furthermore the companies are registered by the government body "Samagam Medura" which means "Center for Companies" in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinhala.html" title="Sinhala">Sinhala</a>, it is mentioned in the image that this organization is registered with "Samagam Medura", it is required by law to publish an advertisement in a noted media if a limited liability company chooses not to use the term "limited" with their organization name and it should mention that they have permission to do so and the purpose of it. Hope this answers your question. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetmonger_08eb.html" title="User:Netmonger"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:green">ŇëŧΜǒńğëŗ</span></b></a><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:lightgreen"><sup><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetmonger_89b5.html" title="User talk:Netmonger">Talk</a></sup></span> 06:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I can not respond to these accusations, since they are unprecise at best. I can only express my regret that this is the case.

<p><b>Delete</b>: When first nominated for deletion, the article was really long, but was a real mess because its content was very un-encyclopedically disposed. The discussion lead to a "Keep", since the article was still young (it was marked for deletion on its first day) and seemed to be possible to develop. Three months later, it was again nominated for deletion because the article hadn't gotten better in the elapsed time. The result was "No concensus", because some thought that it should be deleted, and others thought that it should be rewritten. Now, considering that we are <b>five</b> months later, and the article is in no way better than it was for the first and the second nomination (unsourced or dubiously sourced statements, unencyclopaedic content), I therefore propose it for deletion. There is no real contributor interested in making this article better with reliable sources, NPOV, and everything that an article as controversial as a comparison of two major operating systems need. The almost sole contributors to the article are anonymous users throwing in their opinions or ideas, regardless of whether it is encyclopaedic or not, or whether it is sourced or not. My opinion&#160;: this article is doomed to fail, as it is the subject of a religious war for many people, and cannot gather "facts" to make a real comparison of operating systems. I will never become a good article in my opinion. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDravick_714c.html" title="User:Dravick">Dravick</a> 04:02, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Good points, but if it's deleted I think someone will create a new article the next day on this topic. It's better to fact tag every unsourced statement and delete it if sources doesn't appear, I think. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EINic_5861.html" title="User:INic">iNic</a> 03:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I do understand the issues raised by the nominator, the topic is real and nodoubtly can be sourced largely from reviews and comparisions that have been published widely. The other issues, namely that only anonymous user edit the article, and that it currently is a mess, are no reasons for deletion, however. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 14:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is problematic from the title forward. For one, we are putatively comparing <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_OS_X_b8d4.html" title="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a> which has gone through 6 major version changes over a period of 8 years, and the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> family of operating systems which has gone through 7 distinct operating systems and countless individual revisions. This is just dripping with confusion and leaves the reader wondering precisely <i>what</i> we are comparing. Comparison articles of this nature are further hindered by the fact that, while they are in direct competition, it is difficult to come up with objective comparisons as they run different subsets of software on different computer architectures. Combine these issues together and you really are comparing apples (hah!) and oranges. Furthermore, if you bother looking around for objective comparisons, good luck - it's about as easy to find neutral and objective comparisons between the two as it is to find fair comparisons between Republicans and Democrats - avoiding POV is hard. That said, I believe this article can be deleted on technical merit alone. Get rid of the unsourced information and you are left with "Some people compare Mac vs Windows. Mac gets less viruses." Sub-sub-stub and pretty much devoid of content. Arguments that there "should be more sources out there" and "someone could improve the article" are no longer valid - the nominator is correct in saying that the article has been given far more than enough time and no one has stepped up to bring it up to standards. Continually passing on the buck and relying on "someone else" to fix it is not a reason to keep it, particularly after so long. The article ahs had it's chance and lost. Time for it to go. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Comparison" is far too vague; it's easy to compare different versions of the same OS, but Windows and Mac OS are apples and oranges.

<li>I agree with your conclusion, but a general comparison article of Windowses with Mac OSes needn't be constantly out-of-date, so long as it focusses on stable features.

<li>Problem is this article doesn't compare any particular version of Windows with OSX. It's just says "Windows". That could mean XP, Vista, Longhorn, Server 2000, Server 2003, Windows 2000, Windows NT 4.... you get my point. Same goes for OSX. Doesn't specify which version of OSX. It could be anything from OSX Server 10 through 10.5.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article is neither nonsense nor unintelligible. The addition is done bitwise (so, 011+001=010, 110+110=000, 110+101=011, etc.) You can call this <i>XOR</i> if you prefer. A subset C of the set of n-bit words is then a cwatset if for each of its members c, there is some permutation π on the bit positions such that π(c+C)=C. For the example given in the article of a cwatset, C={000,110,101}, we may pick c to be the member 110 of C. We then have</li>
</ul>

<dd>

<dl>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>and π should be chosen to interchange the first and second bits and leave the third bit alone:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>π(c+C)={π(110),π(000),π(011)}={110,000,101}=C.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As for the relation between groups and cwatsets, the set of all n-bit words under bitwise addition (or XOR) is itself a group. If a subset C of this set is a group under bitwise addition, it will also be a cwatset as we may take π to always be the identity permutation. The converse is not true—{000,110,101} is a cwatset but not a group under bitwise addition. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpacepotato_5fc6.html" title="User:Spacepotato">Spacepotato</a> 08:38, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree with Spacepotato that the article is not nonsense (though it was badly written). I tried to improve the article because I was too lazy after researching the topic to write down exactly what I think about deleting or keeping the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have added some references to the article. Although there hasn't been much work on this subject, there seem to be sufficient sources for an article.

<li>'<b>Delete</b>. This is a good example of what is <i>not sufficient</i> for notability. The entire information is trivial list type data: locate, date of building, the number of playing fields, the scores on standardized tests, the 100% standardized "vision statement" the racial breakdown, the class schedule--that one keeps showing up &amp; it still startles me--what can possibly be notable about the time that any school says the pledge of allegiance? At least it won't need as much upkeep as some, for it doesn't include the names of each teacher &amp; the class presidents.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>What would be the equivalent for a business organization? the size of the building and the parking lot, the names of the manager, the working hours, that they intend to make money, &amp; when they were founded? - hopeful businesses keep writing such articles, and they all get speedied.
<dl>
<dd>So what would be sufficient for a school? Really distinctive program or building or founders--famous alumni--test site for important eduational research--major news story for one reason or another. (If we were to accept the first school in each state as N, we might get a total of 100 US elementary schools.) Just the same criteria as for every organization. So why do we have these schools without anything to say? do we need a rule that WP is notaclassroomexercise?</dd>

<ul>
<li>and, <i>there are no independent non-trivial sources.</i> Their website and the one for the district. The profile on Greatschools.net, which is about as distinctive as myspace, and references to where they found the test scores, the demographics, and the vision statement. Every one of these are trivial, non-indpenendent, or both. Even for those who think most or all elementary schools notable, there's still this problem about RS. The distinction for N is not which level school, but the individual school. This and below are the ones that fail. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:32, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would consider you wrong there. The article being in chemistry needs to be peer reviewed and reference the work it built upon, however, the number of bits of work it cites is not how it should be judged. Some of the most unique work cannot site much in the way of prior art.

<li>I realise that <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> can be tricky to hit with academia, but I would expect if Dr.Boyle had "significantly advanced the field of chemistry" as the article states, there should at least be some peer review or similar documentation available?

<li>I agree with your comment on "significantly advanced the field of chemistry" and feel that it is probably just him being big headed - so have editted it so that it just says what he actually did. However, an improvemnet in methodology can be important in the field as it is these changes that allow for whole new fields to open themselves up. I am also arguing the same case for the page Dr Alethea Tabor. - <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurious_Gregor_ba7f.html" title="User:Curious Gregor">Curious Gregor</a> - Synthesis for all 18:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Might I enquire, in terms of the h-factor, how are patents ranked against journal articles.

</li>
<li><b>Patents</b>: One could use the h factor principle for patents; however, I have not seen it used that way yet, and there would be technical difficulties. It is quite difficult to find all the patents for an individual person, include the ones that may have been entered under the name of a company, and sort out the duplicates, and then see which other patents cited them.. The public access databases, such as Scirus or USPTO, list <i>some</i>, but even Chemical Abstracts and Web of Science do not have the necessary facilities for an adequate citation search. This sort of searching is a profession of its own, and if we have anyone here with the knowledge and the access to the extremely expensive commercial databases,please let us know. Even having done found them all, I cannot imagine a rational way of combining this with journal article citations, for the principles about what one cites are different. Therefore, in WP , we use whatever patents we get told about of happen to find in an ordinary search. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

There have been numerous attempts to promote this technology on Wikipedia pages, apparently trying to influence public opinion to raise money, be it from public or private sources. Looking carefully over the published material one quickly finds out that the energy conversion efficiency of the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_Tower_9681.html" title="Solar Tower">Solar Tower</a> is far lower than competing <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_thermal_energy.html" title="Solar thermal energy">solar thermal energy</a> technology, and that the Cost of Energy (cents/kWh) is likely to end up 5x higher than other alternative sources of energy. Now the <a href="../../../c/i/u/Ciudad_Real_Torre_Solar_d983.html" title="Ciudad Real Torre Solar">Ciudad Real Torre Solar</a> is being promoted, an apparent attempt to promote yet another version of the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_Tower_9681.html" title="Solar Tower">Solar Tower</a>. The only source of information is a blog, AFAIK there are no concrete plans to built one, all there is is a "proposal". So until it is actually built, and in working order this should be considered "promotion", and does not belong in Wikipedia <a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdH_4dd2.html" title="User:JdH">JdH</a> 13:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate your trying to rein in the wikispammers, but this AfD nomination sounds dangerously like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> to me. Objections to the cost or conversion efficiency have nothing to do with the notability of the tower in question. If the tower has been seriously proposed, and if it has been written about in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, it deserves an entry. This looks quite real to me; see e.g. <a href="http://www.lasprovincias.es/valencia/pg060213/prensa/noticias/Espana/200602/13/VAL-ESP-051.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lasprovincias.es/valencia/pg060213/prensa/noticias/Espana/200602/13/VAL-ESP-051.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> and <a href="http://www.hispalibertas.com/noticias/2006/02/28/la-torre-solar.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hispalibertas.com/noticias/2006/02/28/la-torre-solar.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>.

<dd>I think keep the entries, but the current ones may need some serious fixup. Just because a topic is considered pseudoscience by some, or because a method of doing something is not the best(most efficient, most profitable) method of doing something, it does not mean it does not belong to wikipedia. On the contrary - the downsides and current consensus/dissent about the topic should be well presented, so that when one will leaves well informed after reading the wikipedia page on this topic, instead of empty handed (empty-brained?). I my personal opinion think the current pages need some serious balancing from the technical and financial difficulties side, in comparison with other technologies - same goes for the solar pond idea - but that does not mean an article has no place in wikipedia. Sometimes a bad article with lots of warnings is better than no article at all, at least for a start. Go back to the very early history on a lot of articles. Many started with 2 sentences, and were considered bad articles, but after about 3 years they often get nominated to front page. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESillybilly_95b4.html" title="User:Sillybilly">Sillybilly</a> 00:01, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> This article does not meet the standards of an encyclopedia. In addition, the link to the Keeley Hazell unofficial website may be used to solicite visits or income from users of the Wikipedia. Remember, the idea of the AfD process is to build consensus.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - I removed the prod tag that the nominator put on the page. She is known not only in the UK but also the U.S. for her modelling. Not only has she appeared in <i>The Sun</i> in the UK but also in the U.S. edition of <i>Playboy</i>. Granted, it was only one photo and a small bit of text but it demonstrates that she is internationally known. The modelling section of the article shows why she is notable.

Subsequent deletions at this title via PROD (1x) and <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G11" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G11</a> (2x).

<li><b>Delete and salt</b>. Weak consensus to overturn the deletion mainly on the argument that new Ghits establish <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Nevertheless the first several pages of hits seem to be all self-referential or from blogs, and none from reliable secondary sources. Given the author's COI issues and propensity to recreate I agree with the protection as well. When it can be demonstrated that this can pass <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and not just <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> then perhaps the protection can be removed but not now. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I assure you that there is no COI as I am not employed by the organization in any way. As for "propensity to recreate", please note that this is my first ever Wikipedia article. I'm seriously hoping that we can find agreement to fix what is wrong with the article rather than delete it. I realize that the page itself has had a rather rocky history. I wish to avoid a repeat of that, as trouble with an article wastes everybody's time. Trane Francks 22:18, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I apologize if I came across a little harshly, I suppose it was just unfortunate coincidence that the article was re-created by you when it was. As far as wishing to 'fix' the article rather than just get rid of it, it would be possible assuming that <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> can be satisfied. There may be a lot of Google hits for the term, which would establish that "Quantum-Touch" exists, but our attribution policy requires reliable secondary sources for our articles. That means discussion in published medical journals, newspaper articles, or otherwise well-known, peer-reviewed sources. Primary sources - those that are in some way intimately related to the subject at hand - can't be used for information until after attribution is satisfied.<br />
If you have some information that would meet those requirements than by all means share, and I would be happy to change my mind and support keeping the article. As I stated I did a quick search of my own and could not find any reliable sources for attribution. That does not mean they don't exist, but it means they are not readily available. While it might sound lazy on our part, the burden of proof in finding these sources lies with the contributors, and it becomes your duty to find them. But like I said - if you've got them please let us know. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 23:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the reply. I'll do my very best to flesh out the article in accordance with <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> before this discussion times out. Trane Francks 00:24, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just to let you know, I've added information regarding Continuing Education credits being given to RNs and CMTs who take Quantum-Touch classes. This can be fleshed further, I believe. Trane Francks 02:45, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>

<p>Non-notable academic; I considered marking this CSD for no assertion of notability, but for clarity I am bringing it here. See also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Timothy_Boyle_b8ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Timothy Boyle">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Timothy_Boyle</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 16:06, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I refer you to the discussion that you yourself make mention of. I feel that this academic should be kept for the same reasons but I shall restate them here. All academics with a PhD will have done a unique piece of novel work. If this is not a reason for being notable I have no idea what is. The reason for being a notable academic is currently a hot topic of discussion and so cannot be relied on for reasons to be deleted. Rather if we look at the general guidelines we find that:<br />
"Creative professionals: scientists, <b>academics</b>, professors, authors, editors, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, artists, architects, engineers, and other creative professionals. The person has received notable awards or honors. The person is regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by their peers or successors. The person is known for originating a significant new concept, theory or technique. The person has created a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, which has been the subject of an independent book or feature-length film, or of multiple independent periodical articles or reviews. The person's work either (a) has been displayed in a significant exhibition or as a monument (b) has won significant critical attention, or (c) is represented within the permanent collection of a significant gallery or museum of more than local significance."<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>So from this we can see that the academic is notable as they firstly are an academic and secondly they are seen as one of the leaders the field of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lantibiotics.html" title="Lantibiotics">lantibiotics</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanthionine.html" title="Lanthionine">lanthionine</a> based drugs). As such they surely must be considered to be important in their own field and to have created a well-known body of work that is both peer reviewed and cited.<br />
So as you said yourself non-notable academic - I feel that here you are displaying your own ignorance and disqualifying yourself from being able to judge these academics.<br />
We can apply this arguement independently to the majority of academics in the world today, each in their own research area will have a specialisation in which they are one of the leading figures. They may not shout their names from the rooftops but they do not need to as they shine forth with their ideas and techniques rather than their brash and vulgar claims, like the majority of popstars and celebrities. So give credit where credit is due and let us get the names of academics out there into the wider world, they will be the ones changing the world and making the future. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurious_Gregor_ba7f.html" title="User:Curious Gregor">Alex Jones</a> - Synthesis for all 17:26, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate your enthusiasm for academics. I think that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)</a> is a perfectly reasonable guideline (it's hardly a "hot topic of discussion") and both of these fine people would seem not to meet those criteria. Not all peer-reviewed research is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. Saying that these academics are not notable is not a slur. I have done a fair bit of research myself, but neither I nor my work deserves an entry in an encyclopedia. I think we simply have a difference of opinion about this. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 19:05, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I somewhat distrust the use of the h-index in general, because it is heavily biased towards authors producing a large number of papers rather than a few exceptional ones. So, examining the details in Web of Science, as I would do in evaluating a list of publications in the real world, there are 39 papers by AN Tabor, the most cited papers of heres have been cited 95, 58, 27, 18, 11, 11, 11, 9, times. This sounds impressive, but A/ the most cited work is from her postdoc, B/ the 2nd is a review article. On the one hand, review articles always get large numbers of citations, but then nobody is asked to write one unless reasonably well known. C/much of her work ins in synthetic organic chemistry, where it is customary to publish a number of small papers. (I've copied the results onto my userspace in case it gets deleted).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I conclude more or less the same as Peter and David, that the use of the h-index in this case does give a reasonable result. I consider it somewhat on the side of notable because of the review paper (in Tetrahedron, one of the very best Organic chemistry journals) , but it is borderline.</dd>
<dd>The rough rule of thumb used here frequently, that Assistant Professors (and their equivalents) are rarely notable, because they generally have not had time to establish themselves, also gives the same result. (On the other hand, a full professor has passed several very stringent reviews for notability by her true peers in her academic field,and all we need do is record the fact.)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>comment</b> I however note that <i>speedy</i> is only for use in <b>incontestable</b> cases of lack of notability (e.g. a beginning graduate student). An academic with published work or a permanent position--which always implies published work--is always worth the looking at. I commend Bikeable for realizing that. Probably if one is really skeptical a WP:PROD is more reasonable, because the 5 day period avoids the chance of a worthwhile article getting deleted without anyone noticing. And another test that does not make sense to me is that someone has to be more notable than oneself. I've seen that argument used here by distinguished professors who think that only the top prize-winners in the field are worth mentioning. There actually are many over-modest academics)<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:07, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> for the reasons given above by DGG. However, I would point out that "Reader" in a UK University is not equivalent to Assistant Professor in the US in any sense. It is equivalent to someone recently promoted to Full Professor, but not to a named or distinguished chair. It is awarded on the basis of research and is on the same pay scale as Senior Lecturer (SL). At one time, there was a limit of the number of SLs or above in a university to 30% of the total of all academic staff. "Lecturer" was considered the career grade and many people retired as Lecturers. I am not sure whether that has changed. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 00:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Who's-who entry without assertion of encyclopedic notability. Academics are not notable ex officio, and no evidence that Dr Tabor stands out among her peers has been offered. Not, from what I can tell, a PI or chair. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 20:00, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Undoubtedly a productive academic but writing papers is a normal part of her day job. No secondary sources saying that she has any particular notability nor endorsing any of her papers as outstanding. It should be noted that there has been a huge expansion in the number of universities in the UK in recent years and consequently the Chairs available; every <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_of_technology.html" title="Institute of technology">technical college</a> is now a university so someone who is not a full professor has work to do to demonstrate notability and she hasn't. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 15:50, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm guessing the ECWA Hall of Fame induction is the claim to notability. However, it's really tenuous.

<p>This list has significant potential to become EXTREMELY bloated. Some states and provinces have hundreds of roundabouts, perhaps even pushing 1000 or more. Considering the frequency of roundabouts throughout North America, I do not see how they are notable enough to all be listed here. Locational references would be needed for every location to prove whether or not it is indeed a roundabout, rotary, circle, or any other variety of circular intersections. In short: it is a long, steep slippery slope. <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisisbossi_e64b.html" title="User:Thisisbossi">Bossi</a> (<small><a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisisbossi_e64b.html" title="User:Thisisbossi">talk</a>&#160;;; <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thisisbossi_1d95.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thisisbossi">contribs</a></small>) 17:27, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some articles, such as the "magic roundabouts" of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Roundabout_%28Swindon%29_3124.html" title="Magic Roundabout (Swindon)">Swindon</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Roundabout_%28Hemel_Hempstead%29_56ac.html" title="Magic Roundabout (Hemel Hempstead)">Hemel Hempstead</a>, are notable for their design -- which is currently a relatively rare configuration. I would still suspect a list of "notable" roundabouts to be risky, as defining notability could be particularly difficult. Some may say that a grade-separated crossing of an alternate mode through the roundabout's right-of-way would make it notable -- some may agree; some may disagree. I could see a category of notable roundabouts, perhaps, as that shifts the notability criteria to a per-article basis and does not provide a forum for an overabundance of information. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisisbossi_e64b.html" title="User:Thisisbossi">Bossi</a> (<small><a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisisbossi_e64b.html" title="User:Thisisbossi">talk</a>&#160;;; <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thisisbossi_1d95.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thisisbossi">contribs</a></small>) 21:44, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Unlike Orangutans, pigs and pterodactyls (which are also under the deletion gun) Twinkies are patented and it is entirely possible (personally, I think probable) that the company that makes them pays to have them inserted into movies and television episodes. It's a common practice, and there's a name for it (I just can't remember the name). Almost every (or maybe every) reference here was to movies or TV. I find that suspicious. I think we should look harder at "[blank] in popular culture" items when "[blank]" is a patented product. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:01, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Incidentally, if we delete, Catherine, you can keep down any cultural references that pop up in the main article by demanding that any new items in a "Twinkies in popular culture" section be properly referenced. Stick one of those notices in just under the section title. Hardly anybody who sticks in these items seems able to reference them. You might get overruled by consensus, but I doubt it. And no, it's not a perfect solution, but nothing else is either.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:07, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>This article is just a list of external links to organizations (both commercial and non-profit.) I think this is outside the scope of what Wikipedia is meant to be. There are other, better places for a web directory such as this. Apparently, this list has been prodded/deleted/restored. I think an AFD to gauge consensus on this article is warranted. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeli_nk_ed07.html" title="User:Deli nk">Deli nk</a> 18:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wholeheartedly agree. Not only is this site a raw mass of links, but also several of the alleged not-for-profit sites are commercial ones (such as Climate Care) or rather dubious in nature. Malljaja 18:50, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It may look like a jumble, but it was actually requested, and it's growing a lot and may soon evolve into a fullworthy article. In fact, external websites have linked to it for the overview it gives of providers.

<li><b>Delete</b> The list is a sundry assembly of different providers many of which are simply companies trying to sell a product (an "offset")--in its present form it's bound to grow uncontrollably and become an advertising platform as more and more business-savvy people will enter this fast-growing rogue market. Non-profit companies, as they are far and between, can easily be accommodated on the relevant sites, such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_offset.html" title="Carbon offset">carbon offset</a>.

<p>This is kind of a dictionary definition. Also, it would be covered in the other articles on specific religions. Also, does it need to be said that to people who believe in something (anything) that people that do no believe as they do are disbelievers?

No they have to call them "people who believe in something else". If I say I am not a christian or a jew of a muslim <b>how can they then know that there is nothing else where I believe in</b>. If the bible of quoran speaks about "disbelievers" then they have not the right to call me a "disbeliever"&#160;! They have to keep me out of their ridiculous and dangerous doctrines. If I should me calling "disbeliever" why then not "person who will burns after his death in hell for eternity"&#160;!</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> the Archimedes Plutonium page from Wikipedia because the way Wiki is set up, novice editors who are untrained in logic and reason and objectivity and which allows a flood of demonizers to edit any page in Wikipedia spells only frustration to those serious about science and knowledge. Wikipedia stands at the opposite side of the spectrum-of-encyclopedia compared to when James Clerk Maxwell was the editor of Britannica encyclopedia in the 19th century. The sum total of quality-of-knowledge that the Wikipedia encycl gives is less than or equal to the sum of the intelligence of its combined-editors and that sum is a low-class sum. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Superdeterminism (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperdeterminism_5d7b.html" title="User talk:Superdeterminism">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Superdeterminism_7851.html" title="Special:Contributions/Superdeterminism">contribs</a>).</small> - 19:51, March 19, 2007

<li><b>Comment</b> Man, Archie, that's really a tough hurdle you're setting up there.. that Britannica, really had a lot of luminaries writing for it.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, for that is just the way Wiki is set up. That it cannot do a good job of objectivity or of science entries. The mind set of most Wiki editors is one of a friday night drunk fraternity party. Most of the kooks of the alt newsgroup have turned into being crappy Wiki editors. These sort of editors would be terrific if all Wikipedia did only Hollywood airheads, but when it comes to doing factual or scientific, Wiki looks like some grocery store tabloid. If Wiki were around when Copernicus or Galileo or Darwin came out with their science, you would have the same buffoon squad of editors that would only frustrated Copernicus, Galileo or Darwin. Wiki is contructed by mocking juvenile delinquents as editors. Take a look at Wiki's page of Archimedes Plutonium, for a reasonable person would see that he is given a page because of the Atom Totality theory, so explain this theory in the first three or four sentences, but for the past decade of the Wiki entry everything about eating candy and fruit and what clothing the bloke wears and trying to tie Plutonium to a murder case, everything but his original idea. So who needs a Wiki entry when the entire Wikipedia is mostly a piece of junk.
<p>When the Dalai Lama wrote a book in 2006 as "Universe in a Single Atom" where was the Wikipedia goon squad of editors mocking the Dalai Lama, yet when Archimedes Plutonium discovered the idea some 16 years earlier, the Wikipedia goon squad is falling all over themselves to mock and harrass AP. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Superdeterminism (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperdeterminism_5d7b.html" title="User talk:Superdeterminism">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Superdeterminism_7851.html" title="Special:Contributions/Superdeterminism">contribs</a>) 2007-03-20 04:35:31 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Hmm, interesting on the google hits, how do you find the real number? OK the problem is that his posts on usenet are primary sources, as such "Edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge. Primary sources are documents or people close to the situation you are writing about" So, it seems to me that edits based on searches in google groups would be an acceptable source for a usenet phenomenon. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreglocock_2608.html" title="User:Greglocock">Greglocock</a> 20:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>For the real Google count, just go to the last page of results--then again, and again, until you can't descend further.

<li>For comparison, my (real) name gets about 400 hits on Google.

<ul>
<li>OK. Well on that basis I get 814 results for "Jimmy Wales", so AP is half as googly as JW, and 6 times more googly than myself, or Loadmaster (incidentally is your name unique?). I don't know if googliness=notability, but it sure is /a/ measure of something related.

<ul>
<li>the quality of the source counts as well, and forum and/or posts never count for anything as they are completely unreliable... the sheer number of Google hits is also a supporting criteria, not a main. I.e., the phrase/some guy named <b>"Hipocrates Uranium"</b> might appear 50,000 times in Google, but that doesn't make them article-worthy by itself.

So if Wiki editors typically cannot even tell the factual truth, then no scientist would want to have a Wiki page. When Denny cannot even say the truth of 41,000, then he is hopeless when it comes to reading Atom Totality or Fusion Barrier Principle or Unification of Forces as a Coulomb Unification. I mean, Denny would be good in writing an entry for some HollyWood airhead who wants constant attention but to people serious about science. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Superdeterminism (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperdeterminism_5d7b.html" title="User talk:Superdeterminism">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Superdeterminism_7851.html" title="Special:Contributions/Superdeterminism">contribs</a>) 2007-03-20 04:35:31 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd><b>Neutral</b>: I'm changing my vote on the grounds that he may be noteworthy enough to warrant an article in Wikipedia, but then again he may not. What I said in the preceding paragraph still stands, i.e., that he is really only noteworthy because of his limited Usenet fame. He certainly does <i>not</i> deserve an article merely to promote his crank theory.</dd>
<dd>— As to his comments about Google hits, Google shows that there are 23,500 hits. But as has been pointed out several times here already, there are only 454 actual URLs, and almost all of them have nothing noteworthy to say. That's about the same number as there are for my real name, most of which reference a handful of articles I've have on my personal web page, and that's not enough to warrant a Wikipedia article about me.</dd>
<dd>— AP's insistence on an "articles of permanent barring" policy, is, of course, ludicrous. One personal cannot, and does not, dictate what is or is not worthy of inclusion in a public encyclopedia. And he can't possibly expect written history to vanish simply because he'd like to forget some of the more unpleasant things in the past.</dd>
<dd>— His claims of historical ideas to support his theory (which in fact, they do not) has no bearing on the article, for the simple reason that the article is about him the <i>person</i> and cannot be about his <i>theory</i>. His crank theory is mentioned only in order to establish the basis of the controversies surrounding it. As much as he'd like the world to hear his beliefs, WP is certainly not the place for them to do so.</dd>
<dd>— His personal attacks on "would-be editors" don't help his case either way. In fact, they only serve to prove the allegations of his Internet notoriety. Obviously, his comments should hold no sway at all concerning the status of the article.</dd>
<dd>— In the end, the article is essentially only about what a controversial person he is. I am undecided about whether that's enough for a WP article or not.</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> No reliable sources exist to establish notability. The glancing reference in the Discover article isn't enough. For this to be kept, he'd have to be a notable crank, which means that we need reliable sources established that he is more notable than, say, <a href="http://www.crank.net/harris.html" class="external text" title="http://www.crank.net/harris.html" rel="nofollow">James Harris</a>, who has no WP page. There are many cranks out there; we can't include them based on personal experience. If, for example, a reputable paper or journal ran an analysis of Usenet postings and determined that this person is remarkable based on their volume of posts, that would be a source. Or multiple non-trivial references in reliable sources mentioning him as a notable crank. I don't deny he may be notable, but there's not enough evidence of his notability in the article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 20:25, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Changed from delete to neutral because of the work done on finding sources. I still have concerns -- I think the phrase "a notable internet phenomenon" is a subjective assessment, and I also think many of the references are glancing only. The Francis reference appears to contain almost all the non-trivial information, and that doesn't really establish his notability as a crank, only his incidental involvement in the murder case. This is not enough by itself for inclusion in Wikipedia, otherwise the other incidental participants such as Roxana Verona (who is given more coverage than AP by Francis) would be in WP too. However, the sum of the other incidental references makes it borderline, and Francis's information at least lends credence to the notion that AP is a notable crank. So I'm switching to neutral. I still believe that if AP is as widely known as is claimed, other sources specifically (rather than incidentally) about him can and should be found. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 13:03, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I signed in to Wiki as Superdeterminism since I created a entry on Superdeterminism, but the day after I offered the entry it was rejected as "new research".

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I'm admittedly torn on this one. I am usually a stickler for a plethora of reliable, third party references published in scholarly sources, if at all possible. That's not possible here. On the other side, I recognize that this is a realm where Wikipedia can distinguish itself from other encyclopedias, and include an article on "someone" like AP. While getting up to speed on this topic, I clicked on the category Usenet people, and immediately recognized another entry - <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Deeter_4e53.html" title="Greg Deeter">Greg Deeter</a>. I'm not a Usenet user, but I am a stamp collector, and Greg Deeter is a familiar name. I skimmed the article WP has on him, and, I have to say, I'm glad there is an article here on him since I didn't realize what he was a part of - and I recognize I may not have ever seen this aspect of him anywhere else. AP receives more "hits" I believe than Deeter ... thus ... by that reasoning alone ...

<li><b>Reasoning</b> for changing to "weak keep": I'm impressed by the work done by editors to recreate this article. I think the article shows multiple reliable sources (but just barely, therefore "weak"). I think any administrator who closes this argument and decides to keep would first need to decide that the sourcing of contentious material is, in fact reliable enough for Wikipedia to hang its hat on.

<li><b>Delete</b> Hello, I am Archimedes Plutonium, and I want this Wikipedia page of me removed. I am in the throes of having some of my work published in hardcover and the Wikipedia entry of me for the past decade has been mostly a detriment to that end, for it was full of mockery and character defamation. It never focused on any of my original ideas. When anyone comes up with a new and original idea, it seems like a flood of demonizers follow him. There is no-one on the Wikipedia staff who could do justice on a biography of Archimedes Plutonium. So I anticipate that publishing outside the Internet medium will turn the corner on this person who loves doing science and loves to discover new ideas. Wikipedia is only a stumbling block and another dartboard. There is not a single editor at Wiki who is objective.
<p><b>Comments</b> on why Wikipedia has been a decade's long demonization of Archimedes Plutonium</p>
<p>Here is what an objective page on Archimedes Plutonium would look like:</p>
<p><b>quoting what would be an objective page on AP</b></p>
<p>Archimedes Plutonium born 5 July 1950 with the name Ludwig Poehlmann in Arzberg Germany. (<a href="http://www.iw.net/~a_plutonium/)He" class="external free" title="http://www.iw.net/~a_plutonium/)He" rel="nofollow">http://www.iw.net/~a_plutonium/)He</a> earned a B.A. degree in mathematics from University of Cincinnati and a Masters from Utah State University. He was adopted in his teens and had his name changed several times, Ludwig Hansen, then Ludwig van Ludvig, then Ludwig Plutonium and finally Archimedes Plutonium. He is noted for many original ideas in science but his most noteworthy one is the Atom Totality theory. A brief history of this theory during human history follows:</p>
<p>The first idea of a Universe being one single atom appears to have been Democritus (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus</a>) some 2,400 years ago, one of the founders of the Atomic theory (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory</a>), as referenced by the book "A Short History of Atomism", Joshua C. Gregory, 1931, A.&amp;C. Black Ltd, page 4 "single Democritean atom might even be, so some said, as big as the world. The gigantic Democritean atom, if it ever existed, vanished from the atomic tradition."</p>
<p>Georges Lemaître hinted of the Atom-Totality or Single-Atom-Universe in his 'hypothesis of the primeval atom' first presented in 1927. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre</a> Ironic that Lemaître is credited with the discovery of the Big-Bang theory, and yet he begins the Big-Bang with saying that the total universe starts out as a atom-totality. Ironic that by 1990, the greatest rival to the Big-Bang theory will become the Atom-Totality theory.</p>
<p>Carl Sagan (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan</a>) hinted of the Atom-Totality or Single-Atom-Universe in the idea that the universe can be an elementary particle; as written in his book "Cosmos", 1980, Random House: pages 265-267 "so that an elementary particle, such as an electron, in our universe would, if penetrated, reveal itself to be an entire closed universe."</p>
<p>The Atom-Totality or Single-Atom-Universe does not come into full bloom until November 1990, Archimedes Plutonium announced a full theory of the Atom Totality theory, by stating what chemical element the Universe is specifically-- a big Plutonium Atom and that galaxies are dots of the electron-dot-cloud of this single big plutonium atom. AP states it must be plutonium to satisfy special numbers of physics and mathematics such as the fine-structure-constant, the 2.71 Kelvin cosmic microwave background radiation, quantized galaxy speeds, Sloan Great Wall of galaxies, and the values of (pi) and (e).</p>
<p>References: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Structure_Constant" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Structure_Constant" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Structure_Constant</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Great_Wall" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Great_Wall" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Great_Wall</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._Tifft" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._Tifft" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._Tifft</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulers_number" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulers_number" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulers_number</a></p>
<p>Interestingly, Archimedes Plutonium has the first Internet Book where he wrote the entire book and used the Internet to publish it. This first Internet published book is his Atom Totality Universe: Book: "ATOM TOTALITY THEORY REPLACES THE BIG-BANG THEORY OF PHYSICS", Archimedes Plutonium Internet book published 1993-2007 (assimilated in Jan-Feb 2007 in sci.physics,sci.math)</p>
<p>Curiously, the Dalai Lama published a book "Universe in a Single Atom" in 2006 by Time Warner. The Dalai Lama never referenced Archimedes Plutonium but then when does a spiritual leader ever reference and cite the way scientists cite? Reference, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama</a></p>
<p><b>end quoting of what would be an objective Wiki page of Archimedes Plutonium</b></p>
<p>The gang of Wiki editors never demonized Democritus for his say on the Atom Totality.</p>
<p>The gang of Wiki editors never demonized Georges Lemaître on his Wiki page over his Atom Totality.</p>
<p>The gang of Wiki editors never demonized and ad-hominemed Carl Sagan over his say on Atom Totality.</p>
<p>The gang of Wiki editors including Mr. Rubin and Mr. Dudley never demonized nor ad hominemed the Dalai Lama over his Atom Totality.</p>
<p>But when Archimedes Plutonium has a Wiki page, well, the worst in every editor comes out and rushes forth to put any demonizing and tainted and ad hominem and even libel on Archimedes Plutonium. As if the editors, judging from the below want to say just one word about Mr. AP--- call him kook. They do not want to call Democritus, nor Lemaaitre, nor Sagan, nor the Dalai Lama, but when AP appears, then every ugly opinion becomes part of a Wikipedia biography.</p>
<p>The above is a objective entry of Archimedes Plutonium, and why that is almost impossible and difficult for Wiki editors to do is really beyond belief. For the past decade Wiki has done nothing but a joke and mockery and demonization of Archimedes Plutonium.</p>
<p>Currently the References cited on AP's page are inappropriate for they reflect more on the game of demonizing Mr. Plutonium than to objectively understand what he has done. References of Ad Hominem on Mr. Plutonium</p>

<p>* Scott, Joseph C. "Sometime-scientist Plutonium says science is 'gobbledygook'", The Dartmouth, 1997-09-25.</p>
<p>None of the above references focus on his noteworthiness of his ATom Totality. Neither Kahn nor Scott ever attack Democritus for his Atomic Theory and Atom Totality, neither Kahn nor Scott ever attack Carl Sagan for his Atom Totality of elementary particle, and neither does Kahn nor Scott attack Lemaitre for his Atom Totality. But then again the reason neither Kahn or Scott attacks Democritus, or Sagan or Lemaitre is because neither Kahn or Scott know enough about science and about the Atomic theory. These are examples of two reporters who are ill suited to report on Archimedes Plutonium and they end up with a piece of demonizing and perhaps even libelous journalism.</p>
<p>Also, the current Wiki page on Mr. Plutonium gives two quotes, which have been there for a decade and which are so ill suited for his page because of their irrelevance to his noteworthiness of the Atom Totality. Which again shows that the editors of Wiki are so foreign to doing a decent job of a entry. The Wiki page on Archimedes PLutonium has been a magnet and dartboard for jokesters who like to demonize a person.</p>

They don't get it. To them the Atomic Theory is non-notable, yet Feynman said the Atomic theory is the single most important idea in all the world. So these Wiki editors, their logic says that Democritus, Atomic theory, Feynman, Sagan, Lemaitre are all nonnotables. You see what I mean that Wikipedia page on a scientist probably ends up as a frustation to that scientist because it ends up as a negative light on that scientist since the people whose words come to describe that scientist, have no scientific brains to be writing about that scientist. Only other scientists can accurately describe a scientist in an encyclopedia, not these "less than half logical minds". Wikipedia should stick to being an encyclopedia "only for" Hollywood females who need that 24/7 constant attention. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Superdeterminism (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperdeterminism_5d7b.html" title="User talk:Superdeterminism">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Superdeterminism_7851.html" title="Special:Contributions/Superdeterminism">contribs</a>) 2007-03-21 05:45:27 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Question to Greglocock</b> I would like to make a change to this Articles of Deletion. I would like for this to be a PERMANENT and FOREVER PERMANENT Deletion. In other words, after I become more famous, that Wikipedia is never allowed to put my name on anything of theirs. That Wiki can never have a page on Archimedes Plutonium. I have wasted so much time and frustration over this Wiki page that I would have the satisfaction that Wiki never can do a page on Archimedes Plutonium. Wikipedia is a blight to a serious scientist. So, Greglocock, can you change the above to be a Forever Permanent barring of Archimedes Plutonium from Wikipedia. And that would also include my entry of "Biophysics in the Bipedalism page of yours" to toss that out completely. In life, when I meet illogical people, I can only spend so much time, until I never want to waste another minute on them.
<p><b>Greglocock, please delete all of this, because, I, Archimedes Plutonium wrote it all</b> [edit] Biophysics of bipedalism</p>
<p>Notice in this picture frame above "A Man Running - Edward Muybridge" that there are two frames in which one leg is fully extended to a 180 degree position of upper leg and lower leg, simultaneous with the other leg almost contiguous of the upper leg with lower leg. This is the same physics features in overarm throwing snapping of the elbow (not overarm stiff elbow sling style) where the upper arm is virtually contiguous to the lower arm just before the thrust forward and snapping of the elbow joint. So just as in running, throwing achieves maximum thrust forward when the knee and elbow are midpoints in the configuration. Running is what physics would call the throwing of the body forward by two legs.

<li><b>Reply to Keesiwonder</b> Well how would you like it Mr. Keesiwonder, if Wiki did a page on you, and for ten years, a decade, that page had you tied to a Zantop murder. And for 10 years you kept trying to delete that reference from you page, where the editors constantly revert it and finally in the 10th year the editors locked the page because you kept removing the Zantop murder. So do you go around praising the Wiki editors as they mock you and make a joke of you for ten years. I would say my behaviour was pretty much constrained and well behaved in light of what I had to put up with for 10 years.
<p>These are the facts. Wikipedia does an awful job on science entries. It does not have the editors capable of doing biographies of scientists. And the end result of any science entry in Wikipedia, because it is always open to editorial changes by nonscientists, that every science entry in Wikipedia is a frustration to scientists. Wikipedia on science is like a grocery store tabloid on science.</p>
<p><b>Britannica Encyclopedia compared to Wikipedia on science subjects</b> A Wikipedia entry on science whether a person or a concept or theory is choppy because few entries are written by one person, who can make it all flow together. This is the frustrating problem I have had with my page on Archimedes Plutonium. That I need to show the flow of logic from Democritus to Lemaitre to Sagan to AP. Yet when hundreds of editors put their little tid bit to compose a page, you end up with nothing but choppy unconnected pieces of tidbits. So when you read Britannica on some science issue, it is integrated and a flow of logic. When you read Wiki on science it is logically bereft and wildly incongruent in thought or sense. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Superdeterminism (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperdeterminism_5d7b.html" title="User talk:Superdeterminism">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Superdeterminism_7851.html" title="Special:Contributions/Superdeterminism">contribs</a>) 2007-03-21 09:53:37 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Reply to Mr. UncleG</b> Well thanks, my memory is not as good as when I was young, but I do recall that Wikipedia had a page on me circa the late 1990s with its usual mockery of -- clothes I wear, obnoxious nicknames, sleeping in a cemetery, dishwasher/potwasher, and the Tim Skirvin reference to "crank" and Zantop murder. I was too busy in moving and getting established out west after leaving the east coast to bother about a Wikipedia page on me. But I am in the throes of hardcover publishing and have tried to recast that page to be objective in the past several years. And the harder I tried, the worse the page became. So, apparently, I am going to have to force a Elimination of that page as the only real viable way out of this. Question Mr. UncleG: is there a Articles of Barring of a Person from Wikipedia. For I have wasted too much time on this, when I should be doing real science. A total Barring of Wikipedia from ever using the name Archimedes Plutonium in any future Wikipedia entry.
<p><b>Wikipedia ARTICLES OF PERMANENT BARRING</b> The way I envision this is the strongest form of deletion of Wikipedia. Since Wikipedia is so poor in science entries and scientist biographies. That Wikipedia have a Articles of Permanent Barring, where any person who has a Wikipedia entry can sign the list of Barrement and Wikipedia must immediately remove that entry and is not allowed to name that person in any of their entries. So that I could end my Wiki entry today and not even have to vote on it. And further by placing my name in their Barrement section of Wikipedia, Wiki can never use my name in any of their entries. And this Barrement section allows any scientist in the world today to place their name to that section and for which Wikipedia can never mention that person. What this does is fix all those mocking jokers pretending to be editors of a encyclopedia.</p>

<li><b>reply to Greglocock</b> who wrote me on a different page but I am unfamilar as to how to talk to him there. So I post it here. I understand and accept what Greg is telling me. But this issue is larger than my case. This issue is larger because in the old days of science writing and science biographies was done by other scientists in a refereed hardcover book format or in newspaper print. It was not done to a world public medium where any nonscientist can alter and mock and jeer and harrass a entry of a biography of a scientist. So there is a huge wide difference between science encyclopedias and science books and science biographies of the past history, compared to Wikipedia which is wide open to everyone to alter facts. Facts and truth to scientists is very much foremost, but because Wikipedia is open to change by everyone in the world, that Wikipedia needs a ARTICLES OF PERMANENT BARRING as an invasion of the privacy of some scientist who do not want to be invaded of their privacy. So this becomes to the USA Supreme Court an issue of privacy since Wikipedia is wide open to changes by anyone in the world. Some scientists are not going to like being entered in Wikipedia where they can be mocked and libeled such as I have been for nearly a decade. So what I am saying is that Wikipedia should have ARTICLES OF BARREMENT for which some scientist can easily place their name to that list which forever forbids Wikipedia to have an entry of that person or to ever use his/her name in Wikipedia. Now if Wikipedia changes its policy of "open to all to edit" then this Barrement Article can be relaxed. signed Archimedes Plutonium</li>

<p><b>comment to the earlier Google book reference by Eric Francis</b> This is why I say to be objective about a Archimedes Plutonium entry would be a short and simple entry that deals with his birth, his education and then the rest about his Atom Totality theory which makes him notable. During the 1990s when Mr. Plutonium was posting his theory to the Internet there arose such a gang of hatemongers including Eric Francis who then wrongfully included Mr. Plutonium into his murder book. So then, if Wikipedia references Francis, well, that is a tainted a and libelous reference. I am not saying that it is easy to write a objective entry for Mr. Plutonium, given that the world is filled with hatemongers who have referenced Mr. Plutonium. So that is why I keep saying that a Wikipedia page on Mr. Plutonium has to be bare facts and Atom Totality and nothing else.</p>

<p>ERIC FRANCIS is a freelance reporter and photojournalist whose work has appeared in dozens of newspapers and magazines in over 30 countries. A staff correspondent for People Magazine, Francis has also covered several notable murder cases for The New York Times, the Boston Globe, and Time Magazine. He lives on the Vermont-New Hampshire border and was one of the first reporters on the scene of the Zantop double homicide in January, 2001.</p>

</pre>
<p>Archimedes Plutonium for years with his spew of hatred and demonization.</p>
<p>Anyway, when people hate other people in the way that Eric Francis hates Archimedes Plutonium, then their little minds do a trick on them. That they look for moments of opportunity to tie and connect innocent people like AP with a tradegy. Where they mix innocent people up with a murder. So that innocent people like AP is forever tangled up with something he had absolutely nothing to do with.</p>
<p>Anyone who reads this message, how would they feel if a reporter hated you, and then as soon as that reporter gets involved with some murder, includes your name in a page of that murder in a book? I think most people would be very much angered by the action of Eric Francis.</p>
<p>Because when the Zantop murder occurred, Archimedes Plutonium had departed Dartmouth about 2years prior and was living calmly and peaceably in the Midwest some thousands of miles away from Dartmouth. Yet AP was called by the Hanover New Hampshire police.</p>
<p>I believe this is libel if ever I have seen libel. In that how in the world can a news reporter demonize me in a book about a tragic murder for which I was half the continent away and which I had nothing to do with.</p>
<p>Does anyone know the statue of limitations for libel? And if a lawyer is reading this and who knows something about me as per my love of doing science on the Internet and would like to help me to "get some justice put onto Eric Francis, please indicate in a followup post.</p>
<p>I am very busy with science and hate to have to leave it to correct what I call "people problems", but I feel that Eric Francis needs to be punished for how he has victimized an innocent person-- Archimedes Plutonium. Because if I do not seek justice on Francis, then like Kant's Categorical Imperative-- Francis will then victimize some other innocent after having gotten away with victimizing me.</p>

<li><b>Question for Arthur Rubin and Uncle G</b> already the page is one day old and already tussling over it. I want to know why it is that so much "crazy energy" is spent on Wikipedia biographies wherein the first sentence the main focus is on a nickname. Is it because Jimmy Wales page starts out with the first sentence calling him Jimbo? If Wikipedia did a page on George Washington, would the first sentence be: George Washington, born ... was nicknamed G.W. Is this nickname obsession some reflection of the age of Wikipedia editors that they seem comforted in knowing what a persons nickname is as the most important data on that person. And why has Uncle G and Arthur Rubin reverted my change of "Arky" to "A.P." On the Internet and most everywhere, people refer to me as AP or A.P. as short for Archimedes Plutonium. Just because a murder book says that some few unknown people are alleged to have called me "Arky" and are alleged to be fans, is highly inappropriate to put into a Wikipedia biography. Francis may have stood on a street corner and asked a passerby if he/she knows Archimedes Plutonium and they may have said "oh, Arky". And Francis then publishes Arky, but is that any reason to start the encyclopedia of Wikipedia on Archimedes Plutonium over something as dumb and stupid as "Arky". How would Arthur Rubin like it if Wikipedia did his biography and the first sentence is "Arthur Rubin, born ..., is nicknamed Arty by his grandparents." Maybe instead of asking this question, maybe instead I should ask for a 3rd attempt at Articles of Deletion because already my frustation thermometer is beginning to rise. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Superdeterminism (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperdeterminism_5d7b.html" title="User talk:Superdeterminism">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Superdeterminism_7851.html" title="Special:Contributions/Superdeterminism">contribs</a>).</small> 06:51, March 23, 2007

<li>Think of it this way, if you like: Prior to the recent improvements, the article had grown a list of nicknames, including such things as "Archie-Poo", added by people in a casual fashion.

Whilst you may think it inconvenient, by insisting upon good sources for this (and indeed everything else) we are aiming to <i>keep out the other nicknames</i>, and prevent a long list of such nicknames growing by editors simply inventing new ones and adding them. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:12, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Further question to Arthur Rubin. Sorry but this nickname stuff is still bothering me. I see it as a form of</b> degradation that what some "other person" calls you ends up in your biography, especially when unfriendly. I am thinking, Arthur, that the policy of nickname is not a requirement but merely "optional". And further, that the nickname policy varies as per occupation of individual. So that if you are doing a sport figure or artist or comedian or politician that nickname is desirable as a option. But when doing scientists, the other extreme of where scientists are no-nonsense, and have no nickname applied. Also, Arthur, I have read the Wiki biography of at least 100 scientists and not once did I see a nickname attached. And on my page I refer to Richard Feynman, John Bell, Georges Lemaître, Carl Sagan, Wendy Freedman, Alan Sandage, William Tifft, Paul Dirac, to name just a few, and not a single one of them has a nickname in their biography. So I wonder if I am being singled out here. Can you please check to see of the nickname policy is optional or required and if the policy is different for different occupations. Because this is really strange to me that some enemy of me could make up any deprecatory nickname and it ends up on a encyclopedia biography of that person. I could almost bet that the policy is optional. Thanks for your time.</p>
<p><b>Statistical Count of the editors on this page who have called Archimedes Plutonium as AP</b> Greglocock 2 times Loadmaster 3 times Mike Christie 6 times Arthur Rubin 1 times Keesiwonder 4 times Phiwum 4 times Greg Deeter 2 times</p>
<p>So, what I am going to do is edit the Wikipedia page and scratch out the deprecatory nickname and replace with a valid nickname and cite this Articles of Deletion with the proof that everyone who debates me, falls into the nickname of preference AP. Now AP is close to the "associated press" so I am going to also add A.P..</p>
<p>So can I please get some help from either Uncle G or Arthur Rubin to stop reverting this edit and to cite this actual Articles of Deletion where most of the editors themselves have nicknamed me withou me goading them or prompting them.</p>
<p><b>Can Uncle G list the relevant paragraphs</b> of this statement "**It's <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_style_f2a6.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of style">Wikipedia house style</a> to list alternative names in the first section, and it is Wikipedia policy to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">go with what the sources say</a>" Because I do not see any scientist biographies with nicknames. So are you arbitrarily applying something to Archimedes Plutonium? Can you cite the paragraphs that state -- nicknames are required?</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article attracts Wikipedia editors who do not provide reliable sources for the many claims they want to make about living persons, resulting in continual violations of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a>. If there are several high quality, reliable published sources describing why Archimedes Plutonium as a notable Usenet personality, then those sources should be used to support inclusion of the name Archimedes Plutonium in the list at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html#Usenet_personalities" title="Usenet">Usenet#Usenet personalities</a>. For biographies of living persons, "reliable sources" means, for example, book-length biographies published by reputable publishers who employ book editors and biographical articles written by professional journalists and published by reputable magazines with fact checkers and editors who review the contents of the articles. There are not enough reliable sources to support an encyclopedia article about Archimedes Plutonium. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 14:41, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>My sympathy with JWSchmidt's comment</b> A Wikipedia biography of a person who is very much controversial because of his "theory the universe is an atom" not only attracts biased hate storm, but it attracts editors inside Wikipedia who cannot place themselves objectively in maintaining the entry. It is my opinion that biased people of AP such as Eric Francis, Erik Max Francis (whether one and the same as Eric Francis), Tim Skirvin, James Kibo Parry, Uncle Al, are probably established editors of Wikipedia and who have established opposition to AP. A clear example is the nickname issue. Where Wikipedia has not one single scientist entry of a "deprecatory nickname" but when it comes to AP's entry, each and every sentence is looked for the opportunity to <b>mock</b> Mr. Plutonium, and if justification for that mockery is asked for such as what is the nickname policy then a Wikipedia editor such as Uncle G calls it a "house policy". This is what Mr. Plutonium is frustrated about and why he was for deleting this entry, is because the editors of Wikipedia simple cannot give Mr. Plutonium a fair objective shake. There is only one editor that writes with his real name-- Arthur Rubin, and I looked up his Wikipedia entry and there was no nickname mockery. I looked up every scientist connected with the reference to Atom Totality and not a single scientist enty has a nickname. But when it comes to Mr. Plutonium's entry, whenever there is an opportunity to mock him, that opportunity is grabbed at and given justification that it is some "Wikipedia house policy".</p>

<p>The result was <b>Delete without prejudice to recreation</b>. A complicated case, with strong arguments on both sides. However, even those expressing a "keep" opinion largely agree that the current article (and by implication its history) is of questionable standing. While the subject may be notable, and there may be reliable sources with which to write an article, consensus seems to lean toward stating that the current/recent article isn't it.

<p>My name is Gordon James Klingenschmitt. I am the subject of a biography of a living person. I did not create this page, but improved on a stub originally created under Gordon_Klingenschmitt and changed the name to Gordon_James_Klingenschmitt (also Klingenschmitt). I now propose deleting all three pages, for several reasons.</p>
<p>1) Somebody stole my private information (including my personal VISA card number) and posted it on Wikipedia with the apparent intent to disparage me.</p>
<p>2) More than 5 regular editors of my page regularly disparage me with personal epiphets. (Just read the last 8 entries on the discussion page...honestly, I haven't been called "Slingensh**t" since 4th grade).</p>
<p>3) Whenever pro-Klingenschmitt editors post neutral sources (such as the Washington Times or Worldnet Daily, or original documents posted at persuade.tv), they are quickly deleted by those wishing to disparage me.</p>
<p>4) Even those 5 editors, all anti-Klingenschmitt writers, have agreed my article should be deleted.</p>
<p>While I originally hoped to spur a lively discussion, it's now apparent that I agree with them. The only person not in favor of deletion seems to be DGG, whose impartial edits vainly attempted to save this page. Yet his attempts to discipline the crowds have gone unheeded.</p>
<p>I respectfully request Wikipedia delete all references to Gordon James Klingenschmitt, and let us all return to peaceful co-existence as private citizens.</p>

<dd>It is unfair to the subject, for it casts him as an unreasonable man with dubious honesty,, when he is only trying to express his honest religious beliefs. As he will never be able to edit the article to make it honest, please delete it.</dd>

<p>As my personal summary, he is N. He has deliberately taken an extreme position, offending many non-Christians and liberal Christians, and has knowingly or unknowingly become a tool of the extreme right wink political groups. It is impossible to know whether our not his extremism is sincere. He has throughout this sought publicity--he has paraded in front of the White House, he has given interviews, he has written his side of it for partisan propaganda. He and his supporters have cleverly managed to get their political opponents caught in a dilemma between a defense of his free speech and religion, and the defense of his auditors' freedom of religion to not have to hear what they find offensive. He has done everything he has done deliberately, and has no right to request the deletion of an account of what he has quite consciously done. ( Some of the comments about the talk page are justified. I attempted to refactor it to remove the reciprocal insults, as outrageous as any I have seen on WP, but even my attempt to archive it was reverted. I would suggest blanking it as a courtesy to all concerned. ) <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:52, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

They cite NPOV as their reason to delete anything favorable to the guy. Come on.</li>

<dd>Mr. Jimmy Wales, Once again, I am informed that somebody posted my VISA card number on Wikipedia, during the discussion about whether to delete my profile. Since it appears you're unable to control your users, I am (again) requesting (for the last time) that Wikipedia immediately delete all articles about Gordon_James_Klingenschmitt and Gordon_Klingenschmitt and Klingenschmitt from your entire program. These violations of my privacy by the Wikipedia Foundation are in direct violation of the 1974 Privacy Act. I've tried (twice) to follow your instructions for deleting the page, without success. You have one week to reply, or delete my page, or I'll begin discussing proper actions with my lawyers. Gordon James Klingenschmitt</dd>

<li>The violations of privacy that you discuss here are extremely serious, though they are not directly related to the question of whether there should be an article about you. I am bringing this matter to the <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">administrators' noticeboard</a> for further discussion. Please note that <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">legal threats</a> against Wikipedia or its editors are not permitted if you wish to remain editing. Such matters may be raised directly with the Wikipedia Office directly if necessary. I do not believe that a claim of legally cognizable invasion of privacy would have any merit but I do agree that we need to be alert to, and immediately address, any genuine infringements of privacy or postings of personal information that may take place. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see any realistic way in which we can delete an article because its subject is unhappy about it.

If we aim to present <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living people</a>, then we must not merely recognize the problems addressed here but decisively <i>solve</i> them.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and whittle down. As it reads now it 'seems' okay, and illustrates conflicts inherent in service to two domains. However, the participants are quite enthusiasticly enraged. "Only Klingenschmitt would know his own Visa number certainly no one on the forum would have access to it." seems to be the nicest quote I can find which illustrates one fundamental flaw in the approach of most editors here - this isn't a open forum for discussion and disparagement of the person. It's supposed to be about the article, even on the talk page. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 00:28, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - a brief review of the sources used for this article indicate that few of them would be considered "reliable" - for example, the Statement of Claim (a document that contains only unproven allegations) being used as a source. By the time all the garbage sources are kicked out, there will be very little left of this article. It is very POV.

<li><b>DELETE This Article!</b> This article should have never been written in the first place. It originated as a self-promotion piece by the subject. Note that this article is the second response on a Google search of the individual in question. It is evident that he wanted to use wiki as a vehicle to propagate his own political agenda. A cursory look at the subject's own press releases and the subject matter in this article show that he is definitely not notable enough for an autobiography to appear on wiki. The fact that he is an officer who was convicted at Court Martial, though not an every day event, is similarly not notable enough to warrant his posting an autobiography on wiki. There are a number of Navy chaplains who have been court martialed for violating Federal law as the subject has done. The only difference in this case is that the subject is attempting to claim religious persecution as mitigation of his crime. It just doesn't wash. <b>DELETE, DELETE, DELETE!</b> <a href="../../../u/s/m/User%7EUSMC_Padre_6dc8.html" title="User:USMC Padre">USMC Padre</a> 06:56, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

It can be recreated if there is good cause to. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 10:51, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with Blacketer, the subject is of extremely marininal notability and definitely a flash in the pan as far as longevity goes. His crime was such a basic violation of US Code governing military behavior that it is only an oddity at best. The subject repeatedly used this article and WP for his self-promotion and has admitted it in his comment on this page. The fact that some editors objected to his spin does not make them "attackers" or "haters" as some have commented on this page. I find it troubling that mere disagreement with the subject's political spin is so casually categorized as hate by so many editors on the page. Stating the fact that the subject is a federally convicted criminal is not a negative attack, but a statement of fact. If that is "hate" or an "attack" then we need to delete the WP articles on Hitler and Stalin! Somewhere along the lines WP needs to decide if stating facts is acceptable or not. Since so many of the editors here seem to have such problems with a dispassionate recitation of the facts of the story, I say delete the whole story. Many of the comments made here makes one wonder about the value and/or legitimacy of WP in the first place. <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENavyChaps_12ca.html" title="User:NavyChaps">NavyChaps</a> 14:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hmm, the subject is definitely noted and thus notable, but the history of both the article and the talk page are rather libellous. I'd say delete both the article and the talk page and the talk archives, recreate a small stub, and watch meticulously to make sure this doesn't happen again. It's sickening to see how distasteful some of the conversations in the talk archives are. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 19:06, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> But if you keep it, leave it fully protected from vandals, especially on the discussion page. I tried moderating a reasonable discussion there last year, and was shouted out by hostile attackers, the same ones now using repeated vulgarity.

<li><b>Keep</b> The nominator of this article has nominated a number of articles about non-orthodox sexual practices, and succeeding in deleting some of them. As anyone who uses an uncensored version of the internet knows, they are all of them in use, they all of them are discussed, and there are abundant illustrations, fictional and real. I do not want to speculate on others' motives. I think I know my own: they are most of them not things I find personally appealing, except in an anthropological sense. In that sense I find all human behavior interesting, &amp; wish to know about it -- from a safe distance--and I think that people in general do or at least should also find that nothing human is alien to them. An encyclopedia is a relatively safe place. It is better that young people first discover these thing here than on the open web, and I wish such resources had been available to me.</li>

<dd>I think I just said: "...I also admit that I did little to search...". Given the body of work out there, <i>someone, somewhere,</i> has likely commented on it. In fact, it is the subject of one part of the book Deviant Desires (the lone ref in the article currently). So, someone has added a reliable source. More likely exist. Just because I don't choose to make this <i>my</i> topic of research currently doesn't mean the article should be deleted. Attribution requires that <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source...</i>. This material is attributable (and one ref so far attributes it). It's also pretty obvious that when the subject is sexual fetish, the NYT or WSJ aren't going to run front page stories concerning the subject. This pushes our given requirements for "reliability" to their limit and takes longer to find such valid sources. I don't think it's unreasonable to keep this article until more of these hidden resources are found. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 12:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable actress. According to IMDb, appeared in a grand total of 7 productions (5 television shows and 2 television movies) over a 20-year timespan. Speedy-delete was contested on grounds that some of these were "popular national TV shows", however that argument seems weak given that she appeared on <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a> only 4 times in 3 seasons. No information in the article other than her acting credits.

<li><b>Delete/Comment</b> This argument has raised its head before and I think <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> needs to be clearer about it - you can't take the sentence "... actors, comedians, opinion makers, and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions." <b>without</b> also including the next one: "Notability can be determined by.... Multiple features in credible magazines and newspapers / A large fan base, fan listing, or "cult" following / A credible independent biography / Wide name recognition / Commercial endorsements of notable products". Otherwise, every actor who has appeared in Coronation Street for ten seconds standing in the background is notable.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Here's the thing, on one hand, I think that's enough appearances to pass WP:BIO if she were a guest star, but she's not. She might be notable if these 7 productions were over a 3 year period, but they are over 20 years. Further, there's no additional information about her, other than the appearances. What makes her notable other than just being on the show? Does she have wide name recognition? I don't think so. It's tough, I feel like this is sort of borderline, but I just cannot go with keep on this one, due to lack of notability, lack of sources, and lack of growth potential beyond stub status. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 10:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The criterion noted by Oakshade is one of a number of indicators that the individual <i>may</i> have achieved notability. The primary notability criterion - and actually the only one that matters - is: has this individual been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject? No evidence is presented that they have. This looks like a generic bit-part player, perfect for IMDB but not for Wikipedia due to lack of secondary sources. 125 unique Googles outside Wikipedia is not a good sign, especially since quite a number (most, I think) are unrelated, Wikipedia is top Google hit, also not a good sign, and only three images on Google image search(!).

<p>Subject is non-notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Note that my primary reason for bring this here is that the article was just deleted through prod, and the article's author has exercised his right to challenge that deletion by re-creating the article. So, with that background in mind, it should definitely be discussed here. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 20:57, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Claim to notability would be that he served as mayor of a small town (population 600) for 14 years. That's short of the politician guidelines in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. With such a long time in office, I'd be willing to consider that he might still be notable, but a check of the sources provided in the article reveals the article to be problematic. Almost the entire article is sourced by his paid obituary in the newspaper (i.e. not an <i>independent</i> secondary source) and a personal conversation between the article's creator and a town official where Reese lived (i.e. clear cut <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>). Take those away, and all you have left is that he was the mayor, he once proclaimed a day in honor of a local football coach, and he was donor to the Republican National Committee. Doesn't really seem to be much of an article to me. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 21:03, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hmm, OK. Then you're seeing something on Google that I don't. When I Google his name, I get 15 hits.

<p>A <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV fork</a> of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantyhose.html" title="Pantyhose">Pantyhose</a>, full of coercive statements and OR. As the author admits on the talk page, <i>"Why I created this article is the point that most men who wear pantyhose are not any more 'fetishists' or 'crossdressers', AND that pantyhose for men is an individual type of pantyhose just like stockings or leggings that may be separated from pantyhose."</i> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>; the gender connotations of clothing are already widely discussed in other articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Fits notability guidelines and is certainly well-written and well-referenced. It may need some cleanup and possibly an NPOV review, but neither of those are reasons to delete it!

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Well written and well refrenced article addressing a specific and relatively new segment of hosiery.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think that this topic does have a specific aspect, the article is written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>, it's using <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, stands up to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and doesn't contain OR; and that it doesn't simply fit into <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantyhose.html" title="Pantyhose">Pantyhose</a>. Obviously it's not perfect - as one of the authors I would be happy to go on with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here comes Socrates' Defense.</p>
<p>First of all I object the way Krimpet nominated the article for deletion: he/she merged it without placing a merge tag before or making any suggestions to improve the article including placing other usual tags like NPOV into; and when I objected he/she simply put the AfD tag into. This is an article that was created more than six months ago and has been worked on a lot - it deserves a merge tag followed by a discussion at least. This is not <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> from someone who aspires to become an administrator.</p>
<p>Second I object for the lack and/or poor quality of clarification of the merge act and the deletion nomination as follows:</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pantyhose_for_men" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pantyhose_for_men" rel="nofollow">discussion page</a> Krimpet states the following reasons for merge/deletion:</p>
<ul>
<li>'<i><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a> in the article'.</i> We carefully tried to avoid any OR in the article. Please be specific and cite some.</li>
<li><i>The article 'cites questionable sources'.</i> The article uses sources like the US.Gov's National Library of Medicine, and the International Herald Tribune amongst others. Some online articles cannot be recovered at the original place anymore indeed.</li>
<li><i>...and is a <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">synthesis of material</a>'</i> - very much as with OR, we did not want to advance any of our positions (why should we/I?). Citations please.</li>
<li><i>...reads like an advertisement for male pantyhose'</i>. This is really sad and should be improved! We have worked a lot on this already with the help of other more experienced Wikipedians (check the article history and/or discussion page). Your help is welcome!</li>
<li>'merging this back into Pantyhose' - it wasn't emerging from the Pantyhose article; sounds like preconception.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here in the deletion discussion page Krimpet states the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>A <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV fork</a> of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantyhose.html" title="Pantyhose">Pantyhose</a>.</i> It is a bit of a summary style article - it is to ensure <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. Summary style articles are not content forking.</li>
<li><i>full of coercive statements'</i> - please be more specific. 'Coercive statement' is rather a legal expression used for something very different.</li>
<li><i>OR</i> - see above - we did everything not to include any OR - please cite some.</li>
<li><i>Soapbox</i> - the article doesn't want to do anything with any propaganda/advocacy/self-promotion/advertising - but if it sounds like, please help to improve it.</li>
<li><i>Gender connotations</i> are not discussed in the article but rather in the discussion page of the article... just as Krimpet points out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I am sure it's not a perfect article and would happy to go on with it.</p>

<p><s>Self-promo page of zero worth.</s></p>
<p>A great deal of artists have been trying to push forward the Hardcore Breaks scene, and it is growing steadily day-by-day because of it. A lot of people ask what exactly the genre is, and this wiki is probably the best way to explain that by placing all available information about it in a centralized place. It is a bona fide genre of music, and I believe it deserves a wiki page just as much as any other genre. If you decide to delete it, then you must delete all other genres of music from this site.</p>

The article is a on celebrity, and is not a vanity page. Use of "Notability" to delete articles on lesser-known celebrities is an abuse of the term. As a sign of her notability in Japan, out of the hundreds, if not thousands of actresses who have made adult video debuts yearly in Japan since the early 1980s, editors of Japanese Wikipedia give this actress a <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E%E5%92%B2%E6%B2%99%E8%80%B6" class="external text" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E%E5%92%B2%E6%B2%99%E8%80%B6" rel="nofollow">lengthy article</a>. Pornography has long been, and continues to be a very significant part of Japanese popular culture, and English Wiki's coverage of the Japanese porn area is woefully lacking.

Also, "In addition to the influence of pornography on mainstream cinema, the line between pornography and family entertainment, such as daytime television, is blurred.

<li>The only reason I can see for deleting this article is because it lacks sources. Any other reasons are just absurd and unfounded. The fact the Nsider article was deleted has little to do with this, because we don't know WHY it was deleted. Arguing that because this is similar, therefor must also go, means we should be going around deleting every article that is about websites. Remember this is not about the forums, this article is about the PlayStation Underground, which is a whole website system, which includes the forums, exclusive gamer "clubs" (GAP), etc.... I like the idea of maybe merging it with the PlayStation article, or making it a stub of that or w/e. Personal feelings and vendettas should not effect the status of this article. Also, no reason was given for marking the article for deletion.</li>

He wasn't using it in the way we intend it to be used, definitely, but I wouldn't call what he was doing vandalism - which is, AFAIK, why the manner in which the account was blocked was more than a simple response to persistent vandalism.

<p>The list is no less valid than any other in the same field; it expands upon the work I completed in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a> entry, and is presented as this list so as not impinge upon the general them of the rest of the work. The field of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">Superhero</a> has several lists of it's own, and if anything, it should be added tothem rather than deleted. The very size of the document indicates it is a point of interest to Superhero watchers; to wit, the very fact that so many characters use the title of Captain makes it a valid point of study, and probably for the reasons indicated on the 'Further Information' entry on <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a>. If this list is to be deleted, then a similar "Sledgehammer" application needs to be applied upon the other lists upon which it was based. List of Fictional Captains has no more or less right to exist than this original work. The information is valid and relevant to the associated fields. If it is simply my authorship which is the problem (demonstrated elsewhere0, then I am happy for somebody else to take the credit, but deletion of such valid reference is tantamount to power exercised for it's own sake.</p>

<li>Since both the "Further information" section of <b>Captain</b> and this list flow from the same source, arguing one validates the other is suspect, at best. Further, Wiki articles are <i>not supposed to be places for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a></i>, which this is.<br />
This AfD is about this article and <i>it's</i> merits, or lack there of. Other articles should be dealt with in their own time. <i>If</i> the article <b>List of Fictional Captains</b> existed, that mere existence would not exempt <i>this</i> article from Wiki guidelines and policies. <i>Categories</i> such as Category:Fictional Captains have even less bearing on this and, like other articles, they have their own place to have their retention or removal debated.<br />
On the point of Wiki policy, <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEAT_8cd6.html" title="WP:MEAT">meatpupetry</a>, such as what you have done <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Captain&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=116504721" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Captain&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=116504721" rel="nofollow">here</a> is not to be done. IF you are going to point people to the AfD, do it in a neutral manner. If you <i>cannot</i> do that, <i>do not</i> point people to it.<br />

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Note that should the list survive it will need to be pruned since whoever made it couldn't be bothered to double-check that all of the listed characters are actually super heroes. I also removed the OR essay that led the article because, well, it was an OR essay. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:00, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>CREATOR I made this list, very recently, and is a work in progress. If I understand the reference to meat puppetry correctly, you are in error. I have created the list rather than add it to my extension to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a>, else it become unweildly and to diverse. I have solicited nobody to assist in this, and had hoped to complete the work without interference. This has not been the case. The stsement that I have not bothered to check information is insulting and must be considered personal. perhaps I tread on toes (again) by daring to add to peoples pet pages, and therefore deletion is the usual punishment, perhaps. What i hav edone is to bring the plight of this creation to those whom I thought might have a vested interest in seeing it's continuation; Sadly, this does not seem the case, and perhaps I have alerted the wrong peope to it's existance. Apologies to all. My earlier statement still stands. This page is a valid reference tool and one suitable for research purposes. It is an original work and worthy of survival on its own merit. It does not deserve deletion simply because a handful do not find an immediate use for it.</p>
