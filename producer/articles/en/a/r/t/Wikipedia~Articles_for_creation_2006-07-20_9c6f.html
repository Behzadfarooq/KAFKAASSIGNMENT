<p>FITZ HENRY WARREN (1816-1878)was born in Brimfield, Massachusetts, January 11, 1816. In August, 1844, he moved to Burlington in Iowa Territory. He was an early political activist in Whig Party. He was reported to have been the first to to propose the nomination of General Zachary Taylor for President. He was a delegate to the National Whig Convention in 1848.</p>
<p>Upon the inauguration of President Zachary Taylor, Fitz Henry Warren was appointed First Assistant Postmaster General. After the death of President Taylor, Warren resigned over President Millard Fillmore's support of the Fugitive Slave Law.</p>
<p>With the growing support of Anti-Slavery Whigs, Fitz Henry Warren was made secretary of the Whig Party National Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Warren was chairman of the Des Moines County delegation to the convention of 1856 which organized the Republican party and and nominated General Charles Fremont as the first Republican Presidential Candidate. In 1861 he was one of the chief editorial writers on the New York Tribune and the author of the controversial "On to Richmond" articles after the Battle of Bull Run. He also was a frequent contributor to the editorial columns of the early Burlington, Iowa Hawkeye.</p>
<p>He returned to Iowa following the First Battle of Bull Run and, as Colonel, helped to raise the First Iowa Cavalry. In 1862 he was promoted to Brigadier-General with a command in the army in Missouri under General Samuel R. Curtis.</p>
<p>In 1863 General Warren was the leading candidate before the Republican State Convention for Governor, but by a combination of the supporters of other candidates, Warren was defeated. Before the close of the war he was brevetted Major-General.</p>
<p>In 1866 he was elected to the State Senate. After serving one session, he was appointed by President Andrew Johnson as the United States Minister to Guatemala where he served two years.</p>
<p>He died at Brimfield, Massachusetts, in June, 1878.</p>

<p>Flame 4 cash (F4$) -formerly flame4cash.com, was a website that was dedicated solely to the art of flaming. The site was created by Jeremy "Ruthless1" Daspin, who is considered the father of internet flaming.</p>
<p>In 1999, Ruthless1 posted on a board known then as antisocial.com (no longer exists) and met up with one "BaileyHankins" while there. While at that site, he began crafting what would become his legendary style of in your face verbal warfare. Eventually he found himself into an argument with five other people. When they resorted with typical insults such as "eat shit" he would reply in full by threatening to uppercut people the fuck up right out of their Peppermint Patty sandals and punch olympic size holes into people's chest and yodel the star spangled banner inside. The other members were unable to hang, and thus he left. BaileyHankins, so impressed with this new style, went with him. Ruthless1 eventually found his way to <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> and there he met Redeye and Dvlos, who would be influential with the F4$ webpage for years to come. He also received help from a coke addict from Australia named Shane "Sinister" Duffy, who helped with the initial site design and board maintenance.</p>
<p>Eventually, Redeye, Dvlos and other members of Something Awful got into arguments with webpage founder <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Kyanka_e590.html" title="Richard Kyanka">Richard Kyanka</a> aka "Lowtax". The FYAD forum, meant for verbal warfare and free speech, became a battleground with two sides forming - those who were taking a liking to Ruthless1's new flaming style, and those loyal to Lowtax and his sidekick Al. After some time, Redeye, ripped a "new asshole across Lowtax's face", Dvlos and Cap'n Yoaz did the same to the rest of the forum. Several bannings were issued, and Ruthless1's site F4$ became the new home for those who were unhappy at Something Awful.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-20_9c6f.html" title="Edit section: Rise to Flame (2001-2003)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rise to Flame (2001-2003)</span></h3>
<p>In 2001, F4$ received a large number of posters who would become prominent contributors to the site for years to come from the fallout at <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> and the site began to come into its own. Some of these people became what was and still is today called the "Crew" of F4$ - handpicked by Ruthless1 himself. Crew were generally the best flamers, diverse in multiple methods of flaming that served as judge and jury of the boards. While the board had multiple forums, Hells Kitchen was where all the action was and flaming matches took place. Anyone could make threads about anyone they wanted, but to gain respect you would have to win with something called Randoms. These were set up by the Crew, pitting two random members together for a series of three verbal exchanges. (It was originally five, but cut down to three). Randoms were unstructured and allowed flamers to use verbal flames, pictures, mock stories or web pages or anything else they felt would be views as funny. The other way to earn respect was to make a Callout at a specific person. Callouts were similar to Randoms, conducted by people who wanted a piece of a particular person who they wanted to run a lance through. The best flames would be submitted by users to the "Hall of Flame" and each week a "Flame of the Week" would be featured.</p>
<p>The board saw many rivalries and alliance form over time. One of the earliest wars erupted when the Australian legend known as "deviot" tore apart the well known Tarall. Shortl after, deviot got mouthy with Ruthless1 and soon after deviot and the mortal enemy of the crew - BaileyHankins, were swapping verbal shotgun blasts with Dvlos, Redeye and Ruthless1. Another enjoyable moron was simply know as "Madskillz" and was quickly and efficiently made into a parody when his picture was discovered on the net, as well as his online diary, and it was revealed that he was experimenting with anal sex with sheep he owned on his farm. Madskillz eventually "had his glass jaw shattered so hard, that he'd be waking up in the morning collecting $32 under his pillow courtesy of the tooth fairy" in the words of Redeye. Madskillz quickly left the site and never returned.</p>
<p>Another owned bitch was named Ming, who hailed from a site called loaded gun. Ming fancied himself and his site as good at verbal warfare. Ming made some boastful comments towards the site, and quickly had his asshole kicked up between his shoulder blades by Redeye and Tuff. To quote Ruthless1: "And again the point sails over your head like the cardboard cutout hand of Bugs Bunny measuring kids at the fun park, shrimp" as Ming just never understood how badly he was verbally outgunned. Shunned by his own site, he faded into obscurity and a few from his site joined F4$. They were mocked for this.</p>
<p>Some other notable members deserving mention are/were: forum punching bag and staple looney, Gruesome Worms of Hate, Mistress de Sade, Lady Filthmuck, Brady Bunch Lawnmower Massacre/sum CunT, Blackout, Drunk Monk, The Riddler, beer bitch swede and the one and only legend himself - The Joke.</p>
<p>The Joke holds the honor of being the only flamer to make someone throw up from laughing so hard. He also would type up outstanding witty and funny material while receiving oral from multiple women at a time, which he would prove with pictures. His current whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>Throughout the boards best years however, the most entertaining threads would usually involve BaileyHankins and Ruthless1. Hankins had a way of getting under Ruthless1's skin. BaileyHankins once registered as "Jeremy Daspin" and began posting things such as how he touched himself when watching choirboys on Sunday mornings and couldn't drive cause he had a phobia of steering wheels. Hankins also submitted Ruthless1's live cam to gay porn sites, declaring he was "single and looking" as well as posing as one "Dr. Uri Katz" and pretending to report the site for malicious content and exchanged a few emails with him, then posted on the board it was him jerking him around yet again. Ruthless1 scored his own victories by calling out Hankins in a straight "official" callout. Hankins declared he won anyways, which led R1 to reply "What? You won?! You couldnt win a cigar after giving birth in a tobacco field in Havana, fuckchop." This continued off and on throughout the site's existence. Eventually, Redeye buried Hankins, causing him to have a meltdown. The man posing as BaileyHankins (real name unknown to this day) reportedly got drunk off his ass and went out and flipped his BMW telling the cops "It's Redeye's fault, he hit my car". He was released on bail and somehow missed serving jail time.</p>
<p>A few clone sites began to pop up, trying to match the verbal wit, homor and intensity of Flame 4 Cash, but none succeeded. The most notable was brawl-hall.com, which was one of the most <i>unfunny</i> sites to ever grace the internet, who were borderline obsesed with Ruthless1. A newer site known as Flame Champs (www.flamechamps.com) has also came into existance, trying to keep the game alive.</p>
<a name="F4.24_Champions" id="F4.24_Champions"></a>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-20_9c6f.html" title="Edit section: F4$ Champions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">F4$ Champions</span></h3>
<p>The flamers who showed the most aggression, wit, and talent would make it to the championship round. Whoever won the championship round, would be crowned champion and the recipient of $100 from Ruthless1 himself. Hence, the name "Flame 4 Cash" would live up to its namesake. Over the site's history, ten people were crowned champion.</p>
<p>Projectile Vomit Buzzsaw Herro deviot Tuff flu Running Gag Sicness BaileyHankins Z</p>
<p>Who the best ever was is often debated, but there were a variety of styles to each flame, so everyone had different opinions. Vomit was an analytical style of flaming by making you feel stupid. flu made fun of himself and you at the same time, aggravating people trying to flame him. Tuff was always angry and just described new and unique ways he was going to disfigure your body. However, it should be mentioned that buzzsaw was undefeated in his tenure at the site. It should be noted that Ruthless1, Redeye and Dvlos never ran for the cash simply because they were running the site. In addition, The Joke never ran simply cause he was never around for long enough periods to run. Most posters on the board were quite afraid to engage The Joke in verbal warfare.</p>
<p>The best championship match ever was hands down between flu and Running Gag. Similar to Sugar Ray Leonard vs Marvelous Marvin Hagler in many ways, not many gave flu a chance. Over time, he frustrated RG and when the time came, he won the final championship thread. The Crew was torn on whom to pick as the winner, eventually picking flu cause Ruthless said so. This led to bitter feelings between Ruthless1 and Running Gag, which exist to this day.</p>

<p>In October of 2003, F4$ went down for a few months due to lack of activity and many people taking a hiatus. Conflicts began to arise between many of the members and Ruthless1 and his Crew, as well as with other members. In 2004, Brian "flu" Jiang made his own site called napalminthemorning.com (also no longer up) which had many F4$ posters, as well as new people. Flame matches took place, but not for cash any longer. It enjoyed moderate success, but lacked one thing that F4$ had - Ruthless1. Few wanted to admit it, but the flaming game wasn't the same without the father of flame himself around, and the site eventually began to lose steam. flu became a bit unstable and began firing his moderators and deleting forums. He eventually turned his site into a porn site for a brief time before deleting it for good.</p>
<p>Since that time, F4$ has undergone a name change for the time being, but talks of bringing the site back have recently emerged. The new site can be found below under sources.</p>

<p>Michael Andreyevich Romanov is the most valid heir to the Russian Imperial Throne, vacant since the Russian Revolution and the heartless massacre of the Imperial Family. Rumors that his mother was a scullery maid, and a "bawdy musician" were disproved in 1975 and a slander suit was upheld in the Royal Courts of Scotland.</p>
<p>The Heir Presumptive is an avid skiier and a collector of mustard jars and is internationally known for his collection of pickle forks. His collection was started by his mother when he was a wee prince, living in exile in Oslo.</p>

A fish tape is a steel or fiberglass tool, used generally by electricians for running wire. The two main uses for the fish tape are pulling wire in conduit or pulling wire inside finished walls in existing homes. A fish tape consists of a long steel or fiberglass line of about a eighth of an inch with a loop on the end to attach the wire. The tape is pushed through the conduit or down the wall, the wire or wires are looped in the loop on the tape and secured with electrical tape. then the fish tape is pulled back and the wire is pulled behind it.</p>

<p>The extreme lateral part of the <b>ventromedial nucleus</b> of the hypothalamus is responsible for feeding. Stimulation of this area cause increase food intake. Bilateral lesion of this area cause complete cessation of food intake. Medial part of the nucleus has got controlling effect on the lateral part. Bilateral lesion of medial part of the ventromedial nucleus cause hyperphagia and the animal become obese. Further lesion of the lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus in same animal produce complete cessation of food intake. There is different hypothesis related to this regulation.</p>
<p>1. <b>Lipostatic hypothesis</b>-This hypothesis holds that adipose tissue produces a humoral signal that is proportionate to the amount of fat and acts on the hypothalamus to decrease food intake and increase energy output.It has been evident that a hormone <b>Leptin</b> acts on hypothalamus to decrease food intake and increase energy output.</p>
<p>2. <b>Gutpeptide hypothesis</b>-Gastro intestinal hormone like <b>Grp,glucagons,CCK</b> and some other hormone claimed to inhibit food intake. The food entering in the gastrointestinal tract triggers the release of this hormone which acts on the brain to produce produce satiety. The brain contains both <b>CCK-A</b> and <b>CCK-B</b> receptor.</p>
<p>3. <b>Glucostatic hypothesis</b>-The activity of satiety center in the ventromedial nuclei probably governed by the Glucose utilization in the neurons of it. It has been postulated that when their Glucose utilization is low-consequently when the arteriovenous blood glucose difference across them is low-their activity is decrease. Under these conditions, the activity of the feeding center is unchecked and the individual feeling hungry. Food intake is rapidly increased by intraventricular administration of 2-deoxyglucose that decrease glucose utilization in cells.</p>
<p>4. <b>Thermostatic hypothesis</b>-According to this hypothesis a fall in body temperature below a given set point stimulate appetite and a rise above the set point inhibits appetite</p>

<p>"I'm A Man" is a fast, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammond_organ.html" title="Hammond organ">Hammond organ</a>-driven blues rock track written by <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spencer_Davis_Group_b9b2.html" title="Spencer Davis Group">Spencer Davis Group</a> singer-songwriter <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Winwood_d50d.html" title="Steve Winwood">Steve Winwood</a> and record producer <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Miller_02b8.html" title="Jimmy Miller">Jimmy Miller</a>. It was released as a single by the SDG in early 1967, reaching no. 9 in the UK singles charts. It was the last hit single by the band before the brothers Steve and <a href="../../../m/u/f/Muff_Winwood_3ff7.html" title="Muff Winwood">Muff Winwood</a> left to pursue their own careers.</p>
<p>The song is sometimes confused with another SDG hit, "Gimme Some Lovin'", which has been a hit for various bands and was also featured by Winwood's next band, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traffic_%28band%29.html" title="Traffic (band)">Traffic</a>, as a fast, organ and conga driven version much more similar to 'I'm a Man' than its original recording.</p>

<p>The basic factcheck source for this is <a href="http://www.brumbeat.net/sdgroup.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.brumbeat.net/sdgroup.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.brumbeat.net/sdgroup.htm</a> (which is the section on the Spencer Davis Group) plus the back of the 1967 album The Best of the Spencer David Group Featuring Stevie Winwood which I am looking at right now. Other comments are from personal witness but I can't provide a written corroboration. The Traffic version of Gimme Some Lovin', which was only played live and never recorded as a studio track, is on their album Welcome to the Canteen. You may feel the second paragraph is too detailed for a stub type article.</p>
<p>The track (I'm a Man) was already around in 1966. It seems not to have been included on any SDG album recorded during the band's lifetime, but it is featured on the recent Spencer Davis Group DVD "Gimme Some Lovin' Live 1966", which was recorded live in late 1966. I saw the song on Top of the Pops in the 1966/7 Christmas school break, already in the charts, so it's only a "1967" track by a hairsbreadth.</p>

Piercarlo Bormida is the co-founder and label manager of BETULLA RECORDS, respected for his seducing and uncompromising live acts, he's active part in the STREK vs ATZMO (as STREK), PROCTON, CERVO BOYS, COUNT OF SAINT GERMAIN projects, with which he published records for MINUS HABENS (Italy), MOTOR BASS (Germany), ELECTA-IRMA (Italy) labels. The beginning of his discographic story dates 1992 (after his debut in the 80ies cult techno-pop band Tristan Tzara), when he put out his first mix as ACID FRONT on MUZAK label (Fabrice, Gemolotto, Leo Mas), receiving good and wide approval in Germany and USA (from the Analog Records of Freddie Fresh). STREK has been fed on classical music even at pre-native stage thanks to his Mozart and Chopin-loving and piano-playing mother's knowing care. Very soon he embraced the joy of Beethoven by cultivating a big passion in drawing and court games. Even so it's "The Valkyrie" who really influenced the little Lord's small world. He was generated by very distant origins: Saxon, Piedmontese and African ascendants all nourish his baroque family tree. He lived his childhood between Africa and Piedmont, immersed in the colonial atmospheres of formerly Belgian Congo, admiring dusky Eritrean hawks flying about in the winter, rejoicing at the furious wind in Cervo Ligure and enjoying the fragrant smells of Piedmontese Langhe in the summer, fondled by the Knights of Wine and Truffle. Devoted to classical studies and destined to a bright diplomatic career, one fine day at Cuneo's episcopal seminary desk he met an original blond and blue-eyed boy (ATZMO), in faultlessly grey clothes: they have since then made electronic music their reason for living.</p>

<p>A GBA Flash Cart is a special cartridge for the popular Game Boy Advance video game system. Unlike regular cartridges for the system, a Flash Cart contains flash memory onboard so a user can either transfer data (often homebrew software) to their GBA, or back up the firmware of the GBA.</p>

Anuha Island Resort was located on Anuha Island in the province of Malaita in the Solomon Islands. It was an Australian-owned luxury resort that had its own airport and airline. The resort was burned down over a land ownership dispute in 1988. Throughout the past years, plans have existed to re-open the resort. These, however, never came to execution.</p>

<p>These networks introduce your guest in semantic Web in a direct way, by facilitating the passage of the idea in the discovery of a word which can precede an interrogation on search engines, and in a indirect way, by facilitating the passage of the terms in the conventional and logical terms which future semantic Web sets up gradually.</p>

History:</p>
<p>Any person who has not witnessed the magic of this video has not yet lived a substantive life. It features and stars Marc "Autistic Hoeffer Fucker" W., aspiring Martyr and Lawyer (what an interesting combination). It also features brief appearances by David "Third Wheel" S AKA DSEID., Jerry "Darwin" M., Ben "Yahoo Goggily Moogily" Y. and Morris "Wings of Fire" B. In this video, we are privileged enough to witness the dancing of the star to Mortal Kombat and Michael Jackson. We ask that any who were fortunate enough to view the movie do not submit it when "Autistic Heoffer Fucker" runs for president. Unfortunately, its lifespan was so very short. Despite overwhelmingly positive reviews, a giant blubbering vagina (DSEID) forced its removal from the internet. It now lives only in the memories of a lucky few.</p>

<p>Company Background Bob Siemon Designs manufactures and supplies jewelry and gifts of exceptional quality which will inspire people to express and share their faith. To accomplish this goal, the company has developed and executed clear values that maintain high standards and allow operations to include more ambitious projects for the sake of sharing the message of hope.</p>
<p>The success of Bob Siemon Designs is built on the foundation of a singular vision that began with one ring. Shortly after completing school, Bob Siemon coupled his passion for fine jewelry with his faith to create a sterling silver ring that would become the first design in a line that now includes over 3,000 products.</p>
<p>Bob Siemon Designs was formally established in 1970 in Calabasas, California, where Siemon ran the business from a circus wagon, both casting and distributing rings to retailers throughout the area. Today the company resides on five acres in Santa Ana and employs more than 150 skilled professionals and artists who contribute to the same vision Siemon initially defined. A commitment to the values that helped the company become an industry leader is what separates Bob Siemon Designs from other designers. The highest standards of quality and creativity are applied to each and every design and an emphasis on service has allowed the company to maintain a personal connection with our customers as it has grown to over 6,500 accounts worldwide. All operations, including designing, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, and customer service are performed in-house, in the United States.</p>
<p>The only difference between 1970 and today is the magnitude of which the vision has been shared. In addition to rings, Bob Siemon Designs has become a leading designer in other sterling silver, 14-karat gold, and solid pewter jewelry including pendants, bracelets, and earrings. By 1997, the company became internationally recognized for the popular WWJD? collection, which served as a reminder asking “What Would Jesus Do?” Since then the company has partnered with organizations including True Love Waits, Women of Faith, and Big Idea Productions to design collections that further spread the message of hope.</p>
<p>More recently, Bob Siemon Designs worked with Icon Productions to create an officially licensed jewelry collection inspired by the 2004 surprise blockbuster movie The Passion of the Christ™. Over 2 million witnessing cards from the collection were sold and 10,000 Nail pendants were manufactured per day during the project’s peak period.</p>
<p>In 2005, Bob Siemon Designs partnered with Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media to introduce a jewelry collection based on the movie adaptation of C.S. Lewis’ The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe™. In 2006, the company announced partnerships with the New Rebellion Handbook and GMA-nominated Christian pop/rock artist Krystal Meyers to promote her Anticonformity movement and inspire teenagers to be the person God wants them to be.</p>

The FA Community Shield match is the traditional curtain-raiser to the premiership season between the League champions and the previous year's FA Cup Champions. The competition is Ffrmerly known as the Charity Shield.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first "Charity Shield" match was played in 1908 between Manchester United, then Football League Champions, and the Queens Park Rangers, reigning Southern League Champions. In 1974 FA Secretary Ted Croker proposed that the Shield should be played at Wembley as a curtain-raiser to the new season between the reigning League Champions and FA Cup holders.</p>
<p><br />
Currently, Jose Mourinho's Chelsea are the Shield holders edging out London rivals Arsenal 2-1 in Cardiff.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The FA Community Shield on 13 August 2006 will be played at the Millennium Stadium between Chelsea and Liverpool. <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://www.arsenal.com/images/b/bergkamp tribute31.jpg?t=1">Image:Http://www.arsenal.com/images/b/bergkamp tribute31.jpg?t=1</a></p>

<p>It has come to my attention quite recently that there is this guy called Conor Shinkwin he hails from the remote town of Linden Village and apart from being a total genius he knows how to handle himself with the ladies.FHM recently did a six page article on how cool he is and i think he and everybody else realises hes just a better all rounder than kevin henn who has over the course of his career been compared to Pat Boon and (James) Brown.Once again Conor Shinkwin Is A total legend.</p>

<p>The Law City Zenebatos is a wingly city in the game Legend of Dragoon. It is full of the winglies' creations and has a complex law making system. The creations halt Dart and company on there way to protec the signet sphere from Zieg. Dart and the others had to revise a law that forbade humans and others from going to the signet sphere. Luckily they found a way to revise the law and gain access to the signet sphere. Right before the signet was the judge of Zenebatos. He ordered their execution and three creatures came out. One armed with a scythe and an instant death attack, one with a huge pair of scissors, one that heals the others and make them grow to enormous sizes. Dart and company defeated the gruesome trio and entered the chamber of the signet sphere only to find that zieg has already destroyed it. Dart and company then departed for the death city Mayfil.</p>
<p><br />
Upon the company's arrival to Zenebatos, they are greeted by a frined who helped them in the Magic City Aglis. He was thought to have been dead but turned himself into a creature that will take u anywhere in the game. This is a useful feature if the player wishes to collect stardust that they missed before that point in the game.</p>

<p>Mission and Values</p>
<p>A non-profit organization, Little Sisters of the Assumption includes vowed members, lay professionals, and volunteers working together for the health and dignity of all people through home health agencies and family services. We bring together the least advantaged and the privileged in a spirit of family to inspire everyone to participate in creating a just society. Little Sisters of the Assumption began as a community of women religious. Responding to social needs in the wake of the Industrial Revolution, Antoinette Fage and Father Etienne Pernet founded the congregation in Paris, France, in 1865. In 1891, Little Sisters of the Assumption followed the call from the United States to improve the lives of the poor and hurt with their social and spiritual services. Today, we extended our services from New York Citys distressed neighborhoods to Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Florida. Nationally respected in the field of community development, Little Sisters collaborate with public, governmental and other non-profit organizations to improve the physical, social and spiritual health of needy children and impoverished families.</p>
<p>Our founders mission to unite hearts in a spirit of family remains unchanged over the years. As Little Sisters of the Assumption, we base our values on the Gospel and see Mary, the mother of Jesus, as a role model for our mission. Just as God raised Mary to a new life, we work to renew the whole person by developing communities that lift each other up -- physically, socially and spiritually. This mission resonates with documents such as the United Nations Charter on Human Rights. Viewing society as one large family, Little Sisters promote social justice and human rights to all people, gradually improving society -- one person, one family, one community at a time</p>
<p>A vocation is an invitation. Some women feel the Spirit speaking to them, asking them to consider an invitation to serve God by dedicating their lives to serving the human family. All Christians are called to create a just society. As vowed Little Sisters, though, religious women have the opportunity to maximize their potential for doing just that, healing the ills of society at its roots. Strengthened by living in a faith-based community, Little Sisters become active members of the distressed neighborhoods they live in, while being part of a global network of women seeking God in the people they work with. Little Sisters receive the education and training necessary to respond whenever and wherever they feel called. With a presence in 26 countries and a wide range of professional opportunities, a Little Sister has a chance to follow her calling worldwide.</p>
<p>Life as a vowed member of Little Sisters is personally fulfilling, spiritually enriching and socially meaningful. A vowed Little Sister of the Assumption knows that Mary is her companion, and like Mary, believes in the capacity of all to rise----- here and in the world to come. Sometimes, the decision to enter religious life comes after traditional lifestyles have been explored. At other times, women hear the call early in life and seek a community that fits them best. Often participating in a Volunteer Program helps a woman find her spiritual match.</p>
<p>God is discovered and proclaimed in the concrete works of justice and peace. This belief is the heart of a Little Sister 's life and mission. It is a mission shared by people of diverse races, cultures, faith traditions, classes, people whom Little Sisters unite in one human family. Contact us today to learn more about our mission and your invitation to participate</p>

Tetis Tgei was an early entry canidate for the 2006 NBA draft. He was born in Kenya in 1986, the exact date is currently unknown. He only recently became an NBA prospect after a post-draft workout with the Boston Celtics. Director of Basketball Operations, Danny Ainge has bought out the 6'8 PG's rights from his Kenyan team. He isn't expected to be apart of the team any time soon, but all reports from within the Celtics' organization say that Leo Papile, Red Auerbach, Danny Ainge, and the man who discovered Tgei, Chris Wallace all have high hopes for him.</p>
<p>He is currently getting set to continue to play in the European league this upcoming season. Walter Szczerbiak (Father of the Celtics' Wally Szczerbiak) has said in Spanish news papers that there are atleast 5 teams looking heavily into getting Tgei. His passing, and dribbling skills will be unparalleled in all of the Euro league. His unique size for his position will give him increased advantages.</p>

<p>Colonel Von Strohm is the commandant in the French town of Nouvion, he had his assistant Captain hans Geering have stolen the painting of fallen madonna with the big boobies and are planning to sell it after the war. But Herr Otto Flick of the Gestapo has been sent by berlin to find the painting for the Furher's collection. The colonel 'persuaded' Rene Artois the owner of a local cafe to hide the painting in his cellar. This leads to a complicated series of events involving Renes 'death' and the arrival of his 'twin brother' and the making of several copies of the painting to fool the Gestapo and Hitler.</p>

The Maple Leaf Forever, while not the official anthem of Canada, is thought by some to be much more partiotic than O' Canada, the current national anthem of Canada. The lyrics can be found below:</p>
<p>In Days of yore, From Britain's shore Wolfe the dauntless hero came And planted firm Britannia's flag On Canada's fair domain. Here may it wave, Our boast, our pride And joined in love together, The thistle, shamrock, rose entwined, The Maple Leaf Forever.</p>
<p>[CHORUS] The Maple Leaf Our Emblem Dear, The Maple Leaf Forever. God save our Queen and heaven bless, The Maple Leaf Forever.</p>
<p>At Queenston Heights and Lundy's Lane Our brave fathers side by side For freedom's home and loved ones dear, Firmly stood and nobly died. And so their rights which they maintained, We swear to yeild them never. Our watchword ever more shall be The Maple Leaf Forever</p>
<p>[CHORUS]</p>
<p>Our fair Dominion now extends From Cape Race to Nootka Sound May peace forever be our lot And plenty a store abound And may those ties of love be ours Which discord cannot sever And flourish green for freedom's home The Maple Leaf Forever</p>
<p>[CHORUS]</p>

<p>Bocconcini originated in Naples and was once made only from the milk of water buffaloes, but now is usually made from a combination of water buffalo and cow's milk. Bocconcini is a semi-soft, white and rindless unripened mild cheese. Bocconcini is packaged in whey or water, has a spongy texture and absorbs flavours. This cheese is described by its Italian name: "small mouthfulls". Made by dipping curds into hot whey, it is about the size, shape and colour of a hardboiled egg.</p>

A milkshot is a photograph or video of a smokeing device (usualy a bong or glass pipe) in which the visable internal chamber(s) is full of smoke that has not yet been inhaled, giveing the smokeing piece a cloudy/milky apperance. The word was coined several years ago on a marijuana discussion forum online.</p>

Artist Antonio Roybal was born (october 1, 1976) in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was drawn to art from a young age. At the age of 5, he wanted to be Pope. At age 14, he traveled to Portugal on a religious pilgrimage and studied with Robert J. Fox (one of the top 100 catholics of the 20th century). At age 17 he moved from Santa Fe to Colorado to study computer animation and fine art. In 1999 he moved back to Santa Fe to study with Linear Expressionist, Jean Claude Gaugy. In 2000, he traveled to Austria, Germany, Italy, France and Monaco. During this time he had an international show and studied with Fantastic Realist Ernst Fuchs. In 2002 he was named one of the top 100 contemporary hispanic artists by The National Hispanic Cultural Center. In 2005 he had a show in Key West Florida and in 2006 The National Hispanic Cultural Center acquired one of his paintings for permanent display. Today he continues to paint and develop his style which is inspired by early mannerism and symbolism.</p>

<p>Kishkumen, also known as Mute, in blizzards game World of Warcraft. He got famous in the World of Warcraft community for his movies about how overpowered the rogue class was. He showed how he could kill any other class whenever he wanted to and how easy it was as a rogue. His opinion was "Rogues takes zero skill" as the name of his guild. When his movies reached blizzard , they started nerfing rogues to the limit until they became so totally gimped that any class can win against a rogue unless the person behind the rogue himself carries great ninja-skills. (And Epic Purple Gear) Now people has starting analyzing his videos closer and many have noticed how most of his opponents in the movies are either Newbies, Clueless retards, or just Away from Keyboard. Still, many fellow rogue players still worship Mute, even though it was kind of his fault rogues got nerfed.</p>

<p>Mark R. Harrington was born in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland.html" title="Portland">Portland</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> and grew up in <a href="../../../l/o/n/Londonderry.html" title="Londonderry">Londonderry</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>.

Currently he is SVP of Marketing for Ecount, a strategic partner of Visa which provides payment programs for Fortune 100 companies.</p>
<p><br />
Over his career Harrington has co-founded several successful online properties, including Half.com (1999), CompanySleuth.com (1998) and FightOnState.com (1996).</p>

<p>StuntCock was formed summer of 2002 in Anchorage Alaska. The bands current lineup is, Myk on guitar, CRS on drums and Ryan on bass. All three sing. Influences range from So/Cal Punk veterans NOFX, Bad Religion, Dead Kennedys, and The Vandals to east coast punk/hardcore like Minor Threat, The Misfits, Agnostic Front, S.O.D. and even some old school metal like Slayer, Exodus and Anthrax. Past members Bret Johnson, Brian Stiles &amp; Nate Anderson. Given their over 30 years of combined musical appreciation there is plenty to draw inspiration from. StuntCock's musical style is based in punk with tight, fast song structure in short bursts. The band has been fortunate enough to share the stage with Forensics, Autonomatic, Coach Whips, Exodus, Agent Orange, The Dead Kennedys, Fourth Rotor &amp; Defect Defect. StuntCock has had two releases prior, a three song demo released in 2002 and a five song EP released in 2003, both self-titled. All three releases were recorded and produced trough their own makeshift recoding studio, PoorBand Studios, here in Anchorage. The band relies solely on D.I.Y. creativity for all of it's projects. StuntCock is not trying to musically reinvent the wheel, they do what they do with their instruments and leave it at that.</p>

Monthsary is a commonly used word in the Philippines. It was derived from the word Anniversary.</p>
<p>It is somewhat similar to the word Anniversary. The only difference is that an Anniversary is celebrated or remembered yearly, while Monthsary is monthly.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-20_9c6f.html" title="Edit section: Lava Man (Horse)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lava Man (Horse)</span></h2>
<p>Lava Man is a North American thoroughbred racehorse who rose from the lowest levels of claiming races to become regarded by some as a legend in his own time. This gelded son of Slew City Slew was born in 2001. He began his racing career in the claiming ranks, first running and finishing fourth for a claiming tag of $12,500 at the Stockton Fair. While Lava Man showed some prowess on both turf and dirt tracks, it was not until he was claimed for $50,000 in 2004 by owners STD Racing Stable and Jason Wood, and brought under the supervision of trainer Doug O'Neill that Lava Man showed his greatness. After the claim, Lava Man won the Derby Trial Stakes at the Pomona Race Track and finished a gallant 2nd to the highly touted Rock Hard Ten in the Grade 1 Malibu Stakes.</p>
<p>After losing several races in a row, O'Neill fitted Lava Man with blinkers and he went on to win an allowance race, followed by the Grade 2 Californian Stakes at Hollywood Park. In his next race, in July 2005, the $750,000 Grade 1 Hollywood Gold Cup, Lava Man turned in his breakthrough performance, winning by a track record margin victory of over 8 lengths and earning a Beyer speed figure of 120. Lava Man lost his next 3 races and suffered a career-threatening foot injury in the Japan Cup. Despite the poor end to his 2005 campaign, Lava Man was named the California-bred Champion Older Horse and Horse of the Year for 2005 by the California Thoroughbred Breeders' Association.</p>
<p>Lava Man came back from his foot injury in 2006 and has blossomed into a superstar. His first 2006 race, the $1,000,000 Sunshine Millions Classic restricted to California and Florida-bred horses was an easy score. Critics, however, doubted that, once matched against all-comers that he'd be competitive. In his next race, the $1,000,000 Santa Anita Handicap, Lava Man faced the favorite, High Limit, 2005 Kentucky Derby Winner, Giacomo, and the 2004 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Champion, Wilko, and he scored a 3/4 length victory over the overlooked, high-quality horse, Magnum. Because of Lava Man's turf ability and pedigree, O'Neill, next, entered Lava Man in the restricted Khaled Stakes at Hollywood Park. Lava Man won easily and set a new track record for 1 1/8 miles. Keeping Lava Man on the turf, O'Neill followed up the Khaled victory by entering Lava Man in the Grade 1 Charles Whittingham (formerly Turf Invitational Handicap) at Hollywood Park. Lava Man rolled to a comfortable victory in the 1 1/4 mile Whittingham. Lava Man's win in the Whittingham made him the first horse since Vanlandingham in 1985 to win a Grade 1 Turf and Dirt race in the same year.</p>
<p>Next up for Lava Man was an attempt to repeat in the Hollywood Gold Cup. Only the legendary California-bred and Hall of Famer Native Diver had ever repeated in the Gold Cup in 1965-66-67. Lava Man stumbled badly at the start of the race and had to ride more off the pace than he generally wishes. Nevertheless he took the lead in mid-stretch and held off by a short nose the gallant run of longshot Ace Blue to acheive his Gold Cup repeat. Lava Man earned the remarkable distinction of winning the Gold Cup by the largest and shortest margins.</p>
<p>By winning the 2006 Gold Cup, Lava Man became the first horse since 1979, when racing's last Triple Crown Winner, Affirmed, won the Santa Anita Handicap and Hollywood Gold Cup in the same year. He, also, became the first horse to win the Whittingham and the Gold Cup in the same year since the great Exceller in 1978. Finally, he was named "Horse of the Meet" for the second consecutive year at Hollywood Park - the first horse to win the coveted title since the great Native Diver. As of July 15, 2006, he is being pointed to the $1,000,000 Pacific Classic Stakes at Del Mar. If he wins the Pacific Classic, Lava Man will be the first horse to achieve a sweep of the Santa Anita Handicap, Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic in the same year. His earnings currently stand at just below $3,000,000 and he is the richest horse off of a claim in racing history. Finally, he's the 6th highest earning California-bred thoroughbred in history. <a name="Sources_87" id="Sources_87"></a></p>

<p>THE MCCRONE RESEARCH INSTITUTE The World’s Premier Microscopy Educational And Research Organization</p>
<p>The McCrone Research Institute (McRI) founded in 1960, is the largest independent organization in the world dedicated solely to teaching microscopy. McRI has a full-time staff of professors and offers 50 or more microscopy courses each year mainly to scientists, technicians and other specialists. A typical course in applied polarized light microscopy (PLM) might include students from the chemical and drug industries, military, government, environmental, industrial research and forensic laboratories. 25,000 practicing scientists and technicians have taken these courses since the Institute was founded by the late Dr. Walter C. McCrone and his wife Lucy B. McCrone. About three-quarters of these 25,000 students were taught in the Institute's own 11,000 ft2 building on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. The remaining one-quarter were taught “on-site” at the student’s own facilities. The Institute has millions of dollars invested in equipment and microscopes and various scientific digital imaging systems. It houses a museum, library, particle reference collections, prepared microscope slides, sample preparation tools and reagents, chemicals, textbooks, atlases, databases, and other microscopy teaching materials. McCrone Research Institute regularly teach for particular industrial, governmental, and university laboratories and many police department forensic crime laboratories worldwide. In addition, the Institute own and publish microscopy textbooks, handbooks and atlases including The Particle Atlas, the world’s premier atlas of microscopic particles, and an international journal, The Microscope, dedicated to the advancement of microscopy for the scientist and technician. McCrone Research Institute is an independent and not-for-profit educational organization [Section 501 (c) (3)] pursuing its mission of providing the highest quality microscopy education and research.</p>

<p>Street Fighter Online is a fairly old progect that re-introduces the classic arcade feel of X-Men VS Street Fighter. When signing up for this free game you start out with a basic line-up of characters from both worlds of Marvel and Capcom. The first set of playable fighters are: Wolverine, Cyclops, Ryu, and Juggernaut.</p>
<p>If you win a certain ammount of 'wins' meaning defeating the required ammount of human players you will unlock a character. Currently the only avaliable unlockable charaters are: Chun-Li, Akuma, Sentinel, Ken, Sakura, Spiderman, Onslought, and Bison. <b>Note that Onslought is only avaliable if you become a VIP.</b> More characters become avaliable when a random poll is issued to the users of the game. Whichever character is voted for next will be added in the next update.</p>
<p>A VIP is player who decides to donate an ammount of money to support the game. This means that if you decided to pay (voluntery)then you will recieve a token of recognition. A VIP in all matches excluding a special tournament server can change appearence durring and before game-play. This also upgrade the players move set. This to some is an unfair advantage but it is credited that it fair that one spends there hard earned cash on the game.</p>

Juliana Luecking</p>
<p><br />
Juliana Luecking writes and records stories about eccentric folks and the odd things they do. She was a unique part of the 1980's hardcore music scene in Washington, DC, where she jumped on stage between bands to perform gripping monologues. Her first record, Wheel, (Simple Machines Records), scored rave fanzine reviews and hit the college radio airwaves, „...with a quiet, biting sense of stark reality. (Groundbelly)</p>
<p>Juliana's Kill Rock Stars release, She's Good People, is packed with charmingly peculiar stories recorded at the 1992 Riot Grrrl Convention. She wrote and produced Big Broad, a CD of 30 humorous gems with lush sound scores, and DreamCumGoDown, a mischievous documentary CD of sex truths and fantasies. (Tracks are available for download.)</p>
<p>She is a guest on Semiautomatic's CD Resident Genius, and Le Tigre features her voiceovers on their CDs. One of her video shorts, Playing Doctor, is part of KRS Video Fanzine #1, and Some People I Know #2: Truth, is a highlight of the KRS Video Fanzine #3. Now living in Brooklyn, New York, Juliana is writing a new generation of stories for radio and internet broadcast, and examining the twists and turns of life with documentary videos.</p>
<p>Juliana received both a media arts grant and a performance art grant from the District of Columbia Commission on the Arts and Humanities, and an interdisciplinary grant from the New Forms Regional Grant Program. She was also selected as Artist-in-Residence for the District of Columbia Youth Outreach Program.</p>

TALISMAN is an excellent hard rock band whose main brand mark is a melodic/powerful international sound.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://www.jeffscottsoto.com/~espanol/picts-talisman/talisman-90.jpg">Image:Http://www.jeffscottsoto.com/~espanol/picts-talisman/talisman-90.jpg</a></p>
<p>TALISMAN started off more or less as the brainchild of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Jacob_673c.html" title="Marcel Jacob">Marcel Jacob</a>. He previously played with bands like Rising Force, <b>John Norum'</b>s Group and <b>Power</b>. On the first self titled album, TALISMAN was not really a band: when Marcel started working on those tracks he was playing with John Norum and thought that the songs would end up on the second Norum's solo album after he left <b>Europe</b>. <b>Göran Edman</b>, who was also with John at that time, sang on the demos.</p>
<p>But John rejected those songs and Göran was offered to join <b>Yngwie Malmsteen</b>. Marcel was later contacted by a guy who had been fired by the label which originally showed some interest in the demos. This guy was pretty much sure that a couple of tracks could become a hit. This was very good but Marcel didn’t basically have anyone lined up. So he started looking around for musicians but the auditions done to some Swedish vocalist contenders were unsuccessful. <b>Cary Sharaf</b> (ex <b>Wasa Express</b> guitar player) suggested that <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Scott_Soto_439a.html" title="Jeff Scott Soto">Jeff Scott Soto</a> might be available: he was called, he got the material and said yes! Both Jeff and Marcel had played on Malmsteen's "Marching Out" in 1985, hitting the road to support the album and making quite a stir in Japan.</p>
<p>In February of 1989 the recordings for the first album took place in Stockholm with <b>Christopher Ståhl</b> (Power) and <b>Mats Lindfors</b> (Norum, Grand Slam) on guitars, <b>Peter Hermansson</b> (220 Volt, Norum) playing drums on some tracks and <b>Mats Olausson</b> (Yngwie Malmsteen, Glory) on keyboards. Marcel programmed the rest of drums and played all rhythm guitars with the help of the producer <b>Mats Lindfors</b> on "Women, whiskey and songs"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Electra, the label Marcel was signed to, went bankrupt just when the mixing was finished, therefore the album was locked for a while. Nothing happened for some time and Jeff US based project Eyes got signed. Marcel left for LA where he was helping <b>Eyes</b> demo and record what would be their first release. During this time somebody from the label that originally signed <b>TALISMAN</b> had found a new label to work for and the masters of the first album were bought from the bankruptcy. So “Talisman” was eventually released in February 1990 on the Airplay/Vinylmania. The first single "I'll be waiting" was tested on the biggest hit radio show and reached number 2 in the top ten of the singles chart! The album ended up selling more than 33.000 copies in two months in Sweden!</p>
<p>On live gigs the band featured <b>Jason Bieler</b> on guitar (Saigon Kick), <b>Jakob "Jake Samuels" Samuelsson</b> on drums and <b>Thomas Wikström</b> (Talk of the town, Candlemass) on keyboards and backing vocals. <b>TALISMAN</b> ended up on the top ten list of drawing acts in Sweden in the summer. Unfortunately, the label went bust putting an end to any chances of international adventures for the album.</p>
<p>The time following summer 1990 was difficult. Jeff was signed to the label Pasha doing Eyes. <b>Jason Bieler</b> was enjoying some success with <b>Saigon Kick</b>. Marcel got signed to Warner Sweden because of the success of "Talisman" and had to put together a band. A trip to the US and the UK followed, looking for talent but nothing really worked. Eventually Marcel met again <b>Matti Alfonzetti</b>, an old acquaintance from grade school and from touring in 1986 with Swedish fusion/rock group <b>Wasa Express</b>, and they started writing and recording together in 1992. After some auditions, Matti, Marcel, and <b>Jake Samuels</b> decided on young <b>Fredrik Åkesson</b> (19 years old at the time) as guitar player. When everything seemed to be perfect, the guy that got Marcel signed to Warner left and the new guy didn’t want to deal with any acts he hadn’t signed himself. Since it took most of 1992 to find a new label, <b>Matti Alfonzetti</b> left and joined <b>Skin Trade</b>. <b>Christer Wedin</b>, who was doing some press and promotion for the label that released “Talisman”, became the Swedish label manager for Dutch/Canadian label <b>Dino Music</b> (later become <b>Empire Records</b>). Christer was interested in releasing a second <b>TALISMAN</b> album, if only Jeff was available. As <b>Eyes</b> were history (the album was released on a label apparently dealing with rock music for the first time), JSS agreed. So back to the studio once again!</p>
<p>In the meantime <b>Jake Samuels</b> had left to join Zinny Zan's band and so Marcel programmed all drums. The new album "Genesis" was recorded in three weeks’ time December 1992 at Stocksund Recording in the elegant quarters of Stockholm, where the band shot also the video for "Mysterious". Jeff joined the guys with his then girlfriend <b>Julie Greaux</b> (Billy Idol, Axel Rudi Pell) who ended up playing the grand piano on "All I want". In conjunction with the release of "Genesis" early 1993, Dino Music managed to obtain licensing of the first album from Vinyl Mania and re-issued "Talisman" adding six live tracks taken from some gigs played in Sweden in 1990.</p>
<p>When the album was released, the single “Mysterious” got some airplay, and the album immediately sold more than 15.000 copies in Sweden. Furthermore, both “Talisman” and “Genesis” gathered some international interest and were released in Japan on Zero.</p>
<p>The band did a club tour in Sweden in March with <b>Julie Greaux</b> on keyboards and <b>Jake Samuels</b> back again on drums. While the band was planning a tour in Japan, Jake left again to pursue a singing career. The new drummer was found in <b>Jamie Borger</b> (long time favourite drummer for Marcel) from the band <b>Treat</b> that had just broken up. TALISMAN became a group for the first time and it was now ready to tour Japan (where the live album "5 out of 5" was recorded and released postponed) and then Europe.</p>
<p>For the next album the group prepared more than for any previous recording. After the end of the European tour early October, the guys were supposed to fly to LA to record the available material. Those plans were scrapped and the recording got delayed. The following two months were spent by Fredrik, Jamie and Marcel in a rehearsal studio in Upplands Väsby, just outside Stockholm, writing, playing bits of music, improvising arrangements, learning the new stuff and collecting tonz of material.</p>
<p>In January 1994 Jeff joined the guys and the band recorded and mixed the new album "Humanimal" at Sound Trade Studios in Stockholm. Everything was perfect: the recording sessions, the working environment, everyone having much fun! Except for Jeff being anguished over his home situation because of the huge earthquake which hit LA killing 60 and injuring around 8,000 persons.</p>
<p>Additional musicians on “Humanimal” were <b>Julie Greaux</b> as backing vocalist and the sound engineer <b>Ronny Lahti</b> playing the wah-wah guitar on the verses of the song "Seasons". The guys, being so pleased with the recordings (22 tracks recorded and mixed in 22 days), wanted to make it a double album at first place but then decided against it since pretty much all the material would fit on one cd. So Jeff and Marcel chose the set of the songs to be on the album. Unfortunately, the Japanese Label, Zero, was given free hands to put together their own version of the album suitable for the Japanese audience. The whole matter turned out to be a mess: the German version by Polydor was different from the Swedish one because it contained "Hypocrite" as bonus, the Japanese had to release the Swedish version too because of the amount of imports, then there was a second European release with the outtakes. "Humanimal" was greeted with great enthusiasm: it combines metal, funky, and pop influences and is still the favourite album of several fans and of more than one member in the band. Despite some good album sales, no touring was done for this album.</p>
<p>In 1995 Marcel and Jeff worked together in LA to write the songs for the next album "Life". Drums were recorded by Jamie in a very short time at Park Studios. After doing overdubs, the tapes were sent to Jeff so that he could record the bulk of the vocals at home. The original mixing took place in the same studio where "Genesis" was recorded, once again with the help of <b>Mats Lindfors</b>, but something didn't seem right and it ended up being remixed for the European version. At the same time, several problems with the labels occurred, leading to the band having difficulties and not getting any touring done for the album.</p>
<p>The guys took a hiatus from TALISMAN for 3 years... Jeff went on to do things with <b>The Boogie Knights</b>, although he and Marcel had taken some time to record the <b>Human Clay</b> albums. TALISMAN also had the opportunity to play a couple of gigs and to open up for <b>Yngwie Malmsteen</b> in Stockholm. For those shows the band enlisted <b>Pontus Norgren</b> on guitar (ex <b>Great King Rat</b>) because Fredrik had left in the fall of 1995 to pursue a more metal oriented direction (see the band <b>Southpaw</b> featuring <b>Mats Leven</b> on vocals and <b>John Levén</b> on bass).</p>
<p>In 1998 the guys were requested from Christer Wedin (Empire Records) to do a new TALISMAN album. Marcel travelled to LA to write songs with Jeff. Jamie and Pontus joined the guys a few days later to rehearse and record drums in a small studio and do overdubs in Jeff's home studio. The new album "Truth" saw the light. The guys had a lot of help with the recording and the mixing from John Ellis (Prism Sound Studios, Boston). The album included a range of covers: “Darling Nikki” of <b>Prince</b>, “Let me entertain you” of <b>Queen</b> and “Frozen” of <b>Madonna</b> (which apparently became very popular in clubs in Germany). Once again there was no touring done for the album unfortunately.</p>
<p>In May/June 2001 Pontus and Marcel were busy recording the album of the band <b>Humanimal</b> and Jeff was in Sweden working on laying down vocals for that album. DJ Dr. Rock from the Swedish Radio Rock Klassiker persuaded the guys to perform at <b>Sweden Rock Festival</b>.</p>
<p>Two nights before the festival gig, TALISMAN had played in Stockholm. Owing to a miscommunication between Jamie, Pontus, Marcel and the guys doing the mobile recording stuff, Marcel's entire gear (bass included!) were left at the venue in Stockholm instead of travelling with everybody's else gear down to Sölvesborg, south of Sweden, where the Sweden Rock Festival takes place.</p>
<p>Marcel wanted to leave the festival but, after looking inside the tent which was fully packed with a crowd shouting for TALISMAN, he didn't turn his back on the people waiting for them to perform. So Marcel and other people started to run around the festival area to look for a bass he could borrow in time for the show. Magnus Rosén from <b>Hammerfall</b> lent Marcel one of his bass guitars.</p>
<p>The show went great and, since another band playing at SRF had a mobile hard disc recording unit, Christer Wedin managed to get the TALISMAN show recorded as well. Later Marcel and Pontus went to a studio where they recorded live together the entire show exactly the same way they would have done it on stage, since the sound Marcel had at the show was not too exciting and some out of tunes guitars needed some fixing. The live album was released in Sweden only October 2002 through Empire Records, charting at number 18 the first week! In the same year, the entire back catalogue of TALISMAN was re-issued with bonus-tracks on Frontline Records in Brazil.</p>
<p>Jeff, Marcel and Pontus later joined forces with drummer <b>Thomas Broman</b> (Great King Rat, Electric Boys, Amaze Me) and finally released the self titled debut album of Humanimal in 2002. In May the band played a couple of shows to support it. Unfortunately, this was not a good moment for the guys owing to some personal, professional and legal problems. Pontus and Marcel had a falling out and this meant that Pontus was out both of TALISMAN and <b>Humanimal</b>.</p>
<p><b>Humanimal</b> split. Marcel and Jeff had a meeting with <b>Christer Wedin</b> where he explained that the guys were basically free to go into business without him. Since Jeff had already landed a deal with Italian label Frontiers for his solo effort, he talked to them about doing a new TALISMAN album. Frontiers showed them open arms.</p>
<p>Now the guitar issue had to be sorted. Jeff had had Howie Simon playing on his solo album and was now pushing for Marcel to agree on using this guy. Jamie was at the same time pushing to get Fredrik back in the band. It ended up with Fredrik back in the studio and Howie joining the band later for some live gigs. Interesting coincidence, <b>Christer Wedin</b> had been contacted by an Italian recording studio willing to let TALISMAN use the studio for free. This contact was reopened and the guys spent two weeks’ time at the Music Planet recording studio in Acqui Terme, near Turin, with Jeff being in charge of everything in terms of logistics and dealing with <b>Frontiers Records</b>.</p>
<p>After having finished in the studio, Marcel and Jeff flew to Boston where they worked with engineer and friend John Ellis for the second time. They were supposed to be mixing, but had to do some editing first and so John did the final mixes without Marcel and Jeff. “Cats and Dogs” was released in May 2003 and a tour in Europe (including a headlining slot at the <b>Gods of AOR Festival</b> in the UK, a performance at the Frontiers Showcase in Italy, a new appearance at Sweden Rock Festival and a show at <b>Lokerse Festival</b> in Belgium) took place in the following months.</p>
<p>Always in 2003 through <b>GMR Music Group Sweden</b>, the entire back catalogue of TALISMAN was re-mastered and re-issued, complete with bonus-tracks, demos, live gigs, promotional videos, liner notes.</p>
<p>In March 2005 through <b>Frontiers Records</b>, TALISMAN launched a double DVD package “World’s best kept secret” which coincided with the 15th year anniversary of the release of the first TALISMAN album. The set comprised two complete shows from the “Cats &amp; Dogs” tour in 2003 (Sweden Rock Festival and Club Mondo in Stockholm), archive live and backstage footage, all the band’s promotional videos, an instructional video from Marcel Jacob and much more! A double live album “Five men live”, including the gigs at Sweden Rock Festival and at Club Mondo, was also released at the same time.</p>
<p>Since the end of 2005, TALISMAN has been working on a new album at the XTC Studios in Stockholm with Jeff doing all the vocals in his home studio in LA. According to <b>Marcel Jacob</b>, the material is very melodic and groovy. No release date has been announced so far. The band will hopefully go on tour to support the new album. GET READY TO ROCK!</p>

<p><b>After-Death</b> is an online Text based Mafia Style Role Playing Game. It evolved from a dispute on a similar game called Dark Future.</p>
<p>Set in the modern day, After-Death can be played at <a href="http://www.after-death.net" class="external free" title="http://www.after-death.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.after-death.net</a>, and is also supported by an IRC client on the Twistification server. Run and operated primarily by two Dutch programmers, Thijs and The Hunter, AD took a radical change for the better in June 2006 when the long awaited improvements where implaimented. This finally helped push AD away from regular Text Based Mafia Games, such as Mafia, by primarily implaimenting a Role play based ranking system, whereby players are awarded points for posts in the various forums. Other players award 'Mod Points' based on how good or bad a post is. Another new element, is Multi User Crimes, where up to 6 players can combine their talents to pull of some truely momentous organised crimes. As with most online Text based RPGs, AD has a lot of Standard features, including Petty and Felony Crimes, Gambling, Murder, Trafficking and Jail breaks. Other not so mundane features include Lotteries, share trading, and FBI warrents &amp; Bounties.</p>
<p>Although primarily a Mafia based game, AD has recently seen an increase in membership from former Eastern Block Mafias. Currently AD has players from as far a field as Europe (UK, Ireland and Netherlands primarily), Egypt, America, Canada and Mexico.</p>
