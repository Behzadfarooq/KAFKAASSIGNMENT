	    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>This is my first edit, and I hope it's okay. I wasn't sure if I could/should remove the "Cleanup" template. I intend to keep watching this page and adding as I can. I wanted to get more information on the page. I also saw what looked like a direct copy / paste from another web page and I wanted to get that out of there, even if I wasn't finished with the information that I could add.</p>
<p>I disagree with merging with ACEOs. I am an ATC artist and had never heard of ACEOs until I came to this article. I think most artists who trade ATCs would not consider them to be the same. Sure, the format is the same, but the concept of ACEOs seems to be the antithesis of the spirit of ATCs. Call me crazy if you want. &#160;:-)</p>
<p>--Jfer 20:38, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Even though ACEOs are the antithesis of artist trading cards, they are like opposite sides of the same coin, and thus belong together, just as there is often a "Criticisms of X" in the article on X (unless of course there are so many criticisms of X that they deserve their own article, but there is not enough in this case, so far, about ACEOs to justify giving them their own article, so I have merged).</p>
<p>I see ACEO's as being quite contrary to the spirit of ATCs. The idea that ATCs are only open to trade among artists is, in my opinion, a misconception. Anyone is welcome to make and trade ATCs. As a professional artist and an active ATC creator, I encourage people who do not consider themselves to be artists to participate, and I trade regularly with artists and non-artists alike. --142.177.233.203 15:41, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>ACEO is not a generally accepted art category. It does not (yet) appear in university art courses or in glossaries or encyclopedias. It is a de facto (though non-registered) trademark and marketing keyword on eBay for members of the ACEO group there and on a related member-only website. ACEO vigorously defends against non-members using the term and has filed complaints against non-members with VeRO (eBay's intellectual property arm). Should we be promoting a marketing concept?</p>
<p>Possibly yes as ACEO may be of interest to our readers. It is listed by eBay as a top keyword search in the self-representing artist category. What do others think? Disclosure: I actively sell ACEO art on eBay and stand to benefit financially from this. However, I believe it may be in violation of WP commercial promotion guidelines. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaltrop_619d.html" title="User:Caltrop">Caltrop</a> 16:53, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>-- This previous statement seems to be incorrect. I've been told that ACEO is not a trademark, but rather an abbreviation only referring to a type of art. Anyone, "member" or not, is free to create what is called an ACEO as long as it fits the size specification. VeRO is only used when a particular piece violates copyright laws, or ACEO is used to descibe pieces of art that are not ACEO sized.</p>
<p>-- As the webmaster of the ACEO page I can confirm that this is incorrect. Anyone, member or not, is welcome to use the abbreviation ACEO. It has also been used widely on other well known art sites, such as WetCanvas, for over a year, and other online art auction sites have categories for it. As for it being commercial - yes, a lot of things are commercial. Do you not have a listing on the Wiki for "diamonds" because they are sold? And yes, there have been off line "real brick and mortar" galleries who have held ACEO art shows. Many people also use ACEO to raise money for charities.</p>
<p>-- It is also incorrect that ACEO or ATC's aren't taught in schools. Here in New England several od the art colleges have taught ACEO/ATC art and I know one of the students who took that class went on and taught it in area highschools as a workshop as well.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Talk%7EArtist_trading_cards_c839.html" title="Edit section: Definitions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definitions</span></h2>
<p>Actually stating one of the rules of ATCs as being "The cards must be traded - never bought or sold." is IMO total nonsense. Because the nature of a work of art doesn't change according to the method of exchange. The point is whether you swap an art work for ideas, a loaf of bread, a pint of beer or for money you are using the artwork as a form of currency and making a trade. The other aspect is regardless of the method an artist may exchange or trade an art work (or simply give it away as a gift), if the artist's work becomes collectable in the art market then obviously all the works by that artist have a monetary value and of course that would include ATCs regardless of the original method of trade or exchange.</p>
<p>So IMO that rule is simply heretical and as more to do with theoretical politics and out dated closed minded ivory tower academic elitism that than any form of reality prevalent in the real World. It's simply snobbishness IMO.</p>
<p>Personally I would argue ATCs and ACEOs are the same thing the main advantage of ATCs is being small they are relatively inexpensive, the advantage of that is they make Art accessible to more people and bring art to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Of course the advantage the Internet and places such as eBay give artists is the ability to market their own work outside the gallery system, and in many ways the point of ATCs is they always were "traded" outside the gallery system. This is perhaps the reason why there is confusion over the involvement of money. But the Internet and ecommerce has changed and is changing the nature of the art world and the art market and empowers artist to market their own work. The fact that ATCs have evolved away from simply being a method of trading small original art works amongst artists outside the gallery system without monetary exchange, into ATC/ACEOs being traded on the Internet and on eBay involving the exchange of money is simply a result of the way technology and the Internet has change the nature of the reality we live in.</p>
<p>So to state "The cards must be traded - never bought or sold." as a rule defining what an artist trading card is to fail to recognise the nature of the reality we actually now live in which has rendered such rules irrelevant. Evolution is the nature of the beast. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Artberry (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Artberry_46bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Artberry">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I agree. It would be nice if hobby artists (and, for that matter, career artists) could follow their vision without regard for the economics of the situation. Unfortunately, art supplies and equipment cost a lot of money (although eliminating the galleries must help a lot). <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonMerlin_5f2b.html" title="User:NeonMerlin"><span style="background-color:#000000;color:#00ff00;text-decoration:underline overline"><span style="color:#ff0000">Neon</span></span></a><a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeonMerlin_f87e.html" title="User talk:NeonMerlin"><span style="background-color:#00ff00;color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline overline"><span style="color:#000000">Merlin</span></span></a> 03:10, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the exact size of the card really crucial? Was this maintained in the 16th century? This seems suspicious - to state this was always the case. <a href="../../../c/l/u/User%7EClubmarx_4ca5.html" title="User:Clubmarx">Clubmarx</a> | <a href="../../../c/l/u/User_talk%7EClubmarx_b93a.html" title="User talk:Clubmarx">Talk</a> 22:27, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It probably wasn't the case. The rules stated are what is currently held by the ATC community. It was probably expected that in the past, cards were roughly that size, and modern times codified a standard size. I've changed the article to reflect this. --<a href="../../../n/e/k/User%7ENekura_6586.html" title="User:Nekura">Nekura</a> 19:35, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For those of you watching this page or just browsing content. Is anyone aware of trading through <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocaching.html" title="Geocaching">Geocaching</a>? It's a bit inderct; however, it could be an entertaining interaction with <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature.html" title="Nature">nature</a> and the ATC community.
