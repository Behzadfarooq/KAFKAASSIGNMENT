<p>The article doesn't follow WP:SCHOOL in asserting notability and is biased as of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ridgewood_High_School_%28Florida%29&amp;oldid=98621933" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ridgewood_High_School_%28Florida%29&amp;oldid=98621933" rel="nofollow">this revision</a>. I can't find the district's page, but if it is created then the article can be merged with that. Also, see the edit history and talk page to see the problems with the article since its creation. It seems like the images might not be free too. <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvaGears_3848.html" title="User:EvaGears">EvaGears</a> 11:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Article makes explicit claims of notability per <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, especially regarding multiple sports championships. This is a thorough article that more than adequately covers the school and its activities. This is yet another pathetic case of an article that should have been tagged for sources, tone or image issues. There are dozens of tags that could have -- and should have -- been applied. There is no reason that an AfD needed to be initiated to address these issues. A few minutes at the keyboard was more than enough to address POV concerns and add several sources. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:56, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Let's start taking apart the statements made above from the beginning, with the creation of this article. I did it. I admit it. I created this article. I created it after someone had edited the original article "Ridgewood High School", which was about a school in New Jersey, and overlaid the text with the description of a school somewhere in Florida. After some back and forth, I restored the New Jersey school article, took the Florida text and pasted it in to create the <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridgewood_High_School_%28Florida%29_cb0a.html" title="Ridgewood High School (Florida)">Ridgewood High School (Florida)</a> article. You can take a gander at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ridgewood_High_School_%28New_Jersey%29&amp;diff=54786414&amp;oldid=54767304" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ridgewood_High_School_%28New_Jersey%29&amp;diff=54786414&amp;oldid=54767304" rel="nofollow">this link</a> for some of the details. A disambiguation page was created shortly thereafter at <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridgewood_High_School_89a9.html" title="Ridgewood High School">Ridgewood High School</a>. My only connection in creating the article was to resolve a nascent edit war by creating a new article. I don't attend the school. I'm not an alumnus. I don't know where New Port Richey is, nor do have any idea of where the original Port Richey is located. I do know school articles. And I also know that if the AfD nominator states that "[t]he article doesn't follow WP:SCHOOL in asserting notability", then indicating why it does indeed meet the notability criteria specified by <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> would be an appropriate refutation of the claim that it should be deleted. As the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> argument fails, and the concerns about "bias" and images can be or already have been easily addressed, my argument for a <b>Speedy Keep</b> seem rather well justified. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 23:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Some fairly good results in sports do not grant notability to the institution.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 19:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — It satisfies my personal criteria for High School notability. I couldn't find the bias mentioned above. The article seems sufficiently neutral. The images are irrelevant to the AfD since they can be removed. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 19:32, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You are a student of the school which can lead to bias. Please give a reason on how the school is notable other then that it serves a large community. If that is the reason why there should be an article, then many schools can have their own articles, but <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> or a <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information.23wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">directory</a>. I can see how you feel because I went to the school for two years myself and lived in Pasco, but the school is nothing special. I also believe you written the <a href="http://rhs.pasco.k12.fl.us/School_Info/school_history/history_home.html" class="external text" title="http://rhs.pasco.k12.fl.us/School_Info/school_history/history_home.html" rel="nofollow">history</a> of the school but please keep it in the school's website.

<li>So, now we see the bias of the nominator in creating this AfD. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is the poor man's excuse for deleting an article, resorted to by those who can't appeal to a relevant Wikipedia policy or guideline. A reading of the clearly worded <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> states that the definition of "Wikipedia is not a directory" as "1) Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons (real or fictional)." <b>No</b>, "2) Genealogical entries or phonebook entries." <b>Not Close</b>, or "3) Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guides, or a resource for conducting business." <b>Not a Prayer</b>. I understand that you have a bias, after all familiarity breeds contempt, but please recognize that the article is a complete and thorough description of the school, and that the article makes explicit claims of notability in compliance with <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, contrary to your assertion in the AfD nomination. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 23:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
