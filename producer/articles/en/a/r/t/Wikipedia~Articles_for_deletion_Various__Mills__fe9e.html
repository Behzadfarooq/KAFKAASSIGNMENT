<p>This is a group <b>deletion</b> I'm proposing for all the individual Mills owned malls and shopping centers. An article about the chain as a whole is probably appropriate, but none of these individual malls are notable, so their individual inclusion and detailing strikes me as advertising.

<li><b>Keep</b> if the user above would have done some research, which by this nomination it only shows that either they didn;t or they decided to ingnore anything that they have seen, they would have found out they the majortiy of facilites are major enocomic factors in the areas that they are located, some even more so then the over-hyped mall of america. The also serve as major congerating ponints as well, with several placning in the top 5 if not the top tourist destination in the state in which they are located. Also many new builds have served as anchors for substantinal development , where the rebulds have served in major as the core of major redevelopment projects. If these articles are deleted then i will afd ever skyscraper, ever other mall and related srtucture for the reason that these are pening deleted. But this is just another reson why the VFD is the same broken process with a different name. The ingnorance of people doing the sligest amount of research is amazing. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">comhrá</a> 20:10, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: A lot of small American towns have individual Wal-Mart stores that "are major enocomic factors in the areas that they are located," "serve as major congerating ponints," and "have served as anchors for substantinal development." So by your logic, each of these individual Walmart stores would merit their own article. But these facts can all be noted in the main Mills Corp and Wal-Mart articles, so there's no need to have individual articles about individual malls. Just like McDonalds, or any other chain, the chain itself may be notable, but individual franchises (or company-owned stores) usually aren't. Also, if you follow -up on your threat to propose the deletion of those other articles then you'll be violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 20:28, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

Sounds notable enough to me for a keep.

<li>Yes, I've looked at all the articles and have seen a lot of repetition and nothing that struck me as noteworthy about any of them. As for the Vaughan Mills, I would be willing to excluded it from this AFD in the interest of focusing just on the malls with no obvious notability. But I am very dubious about Vaughan Mills' claim to notability as "one of the largest shopping centers in Canada." One out of how many??? And where's the substantiation of this? Also, its Google test doesn't show much notability - it gets under 62,000 google hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Vaughan+Mills%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Vaughan+Mills%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, compared with 196,000 for Wal-Mart and Green Bay <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=qPR&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22green+bay%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=qPR&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22green+bay%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>(should the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Bay%2C_WI_f043.html" title="Green Bay, WI">Green Bay, WI</a> Wal-Marts get their own article too?) and over one million for "Mall of America." <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22mall+of+america%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22mall+of+america%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 20:59, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> That's a bit of flawed reasoning. For any given metropolis, there's only going to be one Mills location tops. But for the same area, there could be a dozen Wal-Marts. For example, Vaughan Mills serves the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Toronto_Area_aadf.html" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a>; the same area contains 21 local Walmart stores. <a href="http://walmart.crosscap.ca/wps-portal/storelocator/Canada-Storefinder.jsp?page=sfd" class="external autonumber" title="http://walmart.crosscap.ca/wps-portal/storelocator/Canada-Storefinder.jsp?page=sfd" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>
<ul>
<li>It may not be a perfect analogy, but there's no flaw in the reasoning. You can also look at towns which only have one Wal-Mart store, like Markham, ON <a href="http://walmart.crosscap.ca/wps-portal/storelocator/Canada-StorefinderResult.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://walmart.crosscap.ca/wps-portal/storelocator/Canada-StorefinderResult.jsp" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, whose Wal-Marts still get more Google hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22Markham%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22Markham%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> than the supposedly noteworthy Vaughan Mills. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 21:24, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> If you're going to be specific, the Wal-Mart is located at Markville Shopping Centre, I go there semi-regularly. So when you do a combined Google search for "Markville Shopping Centre" and "Wal-Mart", it only yields 1,360 hits <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?as_q=Markville+Shopping+Centre+Wal-Mart&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;safe=off" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?as_q=Markville+Shopping+Centre+Wal-Mart&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;safe=off" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. I looked at the combined hits for "Markham" and "Wal-Mart" and lot of them contain references to <i>other</i> Wal-Marts in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Toronto_Area_aadf.html" title="Greater Toronto Area">GTA</a> or Ontario in general, not the specific store at Markvile Shopping Centre, Markham. Some of the results in the same search yielded links to Robert Markham or to stores in Arkansas, lol. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 21:32, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I added "Ontario" to the search, and still got almost as many hits as the supposedly famous Vaughn Mills <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22Markham%22+ontario&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22Markham%22+ontario&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, even though this was certainly excluding a good number of websites which mentioned this wal-mart without bothering to spell out the name of the provence. Names of the shopping centers are often little-used, in favor of the center's location or the name of it's most well-known store, so the number of hits for "Markville Shopping Centre" isn't really relevant. The point still stands that Walmarts in many cities have a level of notability on a par with, or even surpassing, that of the idividual Mills chain mall in the area. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 22:06, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> Each Mills mall has its own distinct identity; they're regional shopping centres so they have to cater to the tastes of their particular regions. They're also magnets for (tourist) shoppers because of their size, something that can't be said for Wal-Mart, which has hundreds of locations with a homogenized selection of products. Unlike Wal-Mart, each mall has its own distinct set of stores, attractions (skate parks, go kart tracks, bowling alleys, etc.) and architecture.
<ul>
<li>I think you miss the point that Mills Corp is both a brand <i>and</i> a retail developer. A lot of malls were built by a single developer. For example, <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadillac_Fairview_79dd.html" title="Cadillac Fairview">Cadillac Fairview</a> owns a portfolio of shopping centres throughout Canada including the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Eaton_Centre_bc0f.html" title="Toronto Eaton Centre">Toronto Eaton Centre</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairview_Mall_147d.html" title="Fairview Mall">Fairview Mall</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Galeries_d%27Anjou_d4b5.html" title="Les Galeries d'Anjou">Les Galeries d'Anjou</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto-Dominion_Centre_0f52.html" title="Toronto-Dominion Centre">Toronto-Dominion Centre</a>, yet I don't see anyone making a fuss of removing those articles because they're all part of the same chain. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 21:02, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm very dubious about how much "distinct identity" any of these malls have. Wal-Marts will cater their selection to their location as well. For example, the Wal-Marts in North Dakota have a much larger selection of winter coats than the Wal-Marts in Florida, which have a much larger selection of swimming suits. Also, none of the malls you listed there are noteworthy either, and just becuase someone hasn't gotten around to proposing them for deletion yet doesn't mean they're deserving of inclusion. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 21:37, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If nothing else, one way to determine notability is by having people who live near the malls vote on it, based on their perception of how significant the mall is to their region. Only the vote can determine that. Also, I don't think that articles about corporations should go out of their way to tout how notable they are (square feet of space, number of visitors, tax revenue, percentile rankings, etc), as that makes the article start to read like a corporate advertisement. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 23:32, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Qirex makes some important points. Too much attention was paid to the Walmart analogy, which though useful was not the best one. A more apt comparison would be to other chains that usually just have one store per metropolitain area and can draw customers from the surrounding region - stores like <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabela%27s.html" title="Cabela's">Cabela's</a> or tourist hangouts like the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Rock_Cafe_d94d.html" title="Hard Rock Cafe">Hard Rock Cafe</a>. While these chains are both notable, none of their individual stores are, in spite of some regional variation between them. As Qirex also noted, in order for a mall to be considered a bonified tourist draw, it has to be a <i>primary motivating factor</i> that induces people to travel to the area, not just a place they might happen to stop at while they're there or on the way there. Additionally, if the claim of siginficant uniqueness of any of the stores is to hold water, they have to also be a primary motivating factor for significant numbers of people who live in close proximity to one Mills Mall to travel significant distance to visit another. Many thousands of people who live in the Boston area travel to San Fransisco each year to experience its unique culture and attractions (and vice versa), but I highly doubt that hardly anyone who lives in Cincinnati Ohio (near the Cincinnati Mills) would travel to Toronto or Charlotte areas (with a primary motivation being) to visit the Vaughan Mills or the Concord Mills. So therefore there's no unique notability. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 01:13, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's a ridiculous comparison. Libraries don't need to qualify as tourist attractions to be included (though Chicago's, with its unique history, probably would qualify). Chicago is famous for it's "L" system. Also, commercial businesses are held to higher standards of notability than public landmarks in order to avoid advertising. And individual stores within a chain must be held to especially high standards. Metro-Chicago may be known to some people in Rockford or Bloomington as a big city where they can go to shop at big malls, but someone from St. Louis or Cincinati (with their own Mills stores) isn't likely to travel to the Chicago area to shop at the Gurnee Mills. If it were a unique tourist attraction then they would. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 02:11, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> That's the point of a Mills store. It isn't suppose to draw in everyone across the continent. It's suppose to be a <i>regional</i> shopping destination.

<li><b>Comment.</b> The problem with that analogy is that Hard Rock Cafes are still more commonplace than Mills locations. There's only 25 or so Mills locations globally; there's 143 Hard Rock Cafes worldwide. A better example would be comparing them to the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Flags_1bbd.html" title="Six Flags">Six Flags</a> franchise; which have a comprable number of locations. Each park is part of the main brand, but they still have individually distinct rides and themed areas. Likewise in the article, <a href="http://www.building.ca/archive04/on4_shopping%20in%20a%20native%20land.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.building.ca/archive04/on4_shopping%20in%20a%20native%20land.htm" rel="nofollow">"Shopping in a native land</a>, it indicates that "a unique hallmark of Mills centres, aside from their collection of discount stores, is the attempt to draw on local geographical or cultural motifs and iconography in the design of the shopping centres."</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> (though I also would be okay with redirecting them all to the main article). Individual malls do not pass any of the traditional senses of "encyclopedic". As economic entities, none of them meet our generally accepted criteria for inclusion. These articles are more like advertising copy than real articles. They include directory listings of stores, directions to the mall, etc. These are the contents of the marketing brochure, not an encyclopedia. We make exceptions for truly notable malls - entities which have an impact well outside their immediate area. I could find no evidence supporting such an exception in any of these cases. Drawing in customers from a multi-state area does not, in my mind, meet the necessary level. Furthermore, I find the arguments about "consistency" and "precedent" unpersuasive. Just because we haven't yet deleted other equally non-encyclopedic articles does not mean that we should perpetuate the mistake here. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:12, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> Each of these malls also has its own unique history. For instance, <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Mills_041b.html" title="Cincinnati Mills">Cincinnati Mills</a> started its days as Forest Fair Mall, which struggled for a long time and underwent numerous alterations and such, and also weathered a fire at some point in its history <a href="http://www.deadmalls.com/malls/forest_fair_mall.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.deadmalls.com/malls/forest_fair_mall.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. So the way I see it, we're not only thinking about these mall pages as far as describing present offerings, but also thinking about retail history buffs, for instance, whose interest is on how these malls came to be in their current situations. So I think there's definitely reason for all of the individual pages to exist, and also plenty of room to expand these articles, too. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 01:00, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is very strange to say that Vaughan Mills is not notable. Its opening was reported on TV as a worthy news item.

<li><b>Keep All</b>. According to <a href="http://www.sponsorsource.com/mills.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sponsorsource.com/mills.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, each of these malls are drawing 10-25 million visitors annually. Even allowing for repeat visits, this figure more than meets the criterion from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECompanies%2C_corporations_and_economic_information_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_bc24.html" title="Wikipedia:Companies, corporations and economic information/Notability and inclusion guidelines">Wikipedia:Companies, corporations and economic information/Notability and inclusion guidelines</a> which states a company should be included if "the company has more than one million customers." Logically the criterion should apply equally to subsidiaries of a single company like the individual Mills malls. These are not ordinary malls; they do a huge amount of business and are dominant in local retail. They dwarf most downtown commercial districts in both economic scope and square feet. Are they largely similar to each other? Sure, but so are lots of things that have articles in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/_/m/User%7ED_Monack_6280.html" title="User:D Monack">D Monack</a> 03:31, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now, without prejudice against a later renomination once some reasonable standards of notability are established, because the current ones are broken.

<li><b>Strong Keep All</b> Mills is on the leading edge of retail and the projects associated with them have a huge impact on communities, economics, and trends in retail. The articles need to be developed further and it looks like there are many people here who have information about the articles that can be used to strengthen them. An article should not be deleted because it appears weak and someone therefore thinks it is not notable. Most articles start off small and need time to grow. These articles have been growing due to the contributions of many users. They need more time to develop. Information should be added to them about when they were first opened, the retail concepts used, and what makes them unique. For those that want to delete these, please instead focus your energy on making articles in Wikipedia better, rather than trying to rip away the work of others. 24.240.204.226 19:23, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As someone who has lived by two of the Mills malls as well in a small town where WalMart was <i>the</i> economic powerhouse for the area, the comparison is a severely mistaken one. However, I feel that many of you miss the point here. I don't see any point in deleting them. Are we running out of space? I mean, I frankly don't care whether they're one page or many, as long as the search gets the information. But since they're already there, is there a point in merging them? I mean, it is very mistaken to say that Potomac Mills, for example, isn't a notable landmark for Virginia, Maryland, DC, and West Virginia. Lakeforest Mall isn't nearly as important, but it's a fairly major landmark for the DC Metro Area. From what I've read, a number of the other malls serve as economic and social epicenters throughout multiple states, as well. And while I've lived near the largest WalMart on the east coast, and I've known people to cross state lines to come to said WalMart, they come because they don't have a WalMart. And the state line is mere miles away. It's hardly analogous, unless you're ignoring scale entirely. Moreover, I hardly think the information on the articles is advertising. It served as merely informative, for me. I hope I'm not giving other people too much credit when I say I think that they'll see it the same way. So as long as there are no plans to delete relevant information about the individual malls (location, notable features, etc), I don't care whether it's one article or twenty, though I don't really see the point of consolidation. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchrodingersRoot_1024.html" title="User:SchrodingersRoot">SchrodingersRoot</a> 15:49, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I strongly disagree with the broad statement that individual malls do not merit their own articles unless they are "famous". First, I have real problems with someone outside of Canada determining what is "famous" or "distinct" in Canada. Case in point: someone above mentioned that (s)he didn't think that the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Eaton_Centre_bc0f.html" title="Toronto Eaton Centre">Toronto Eaton Centre</a> has a "distinct identity" worthy of an article, which is downright wrong given the centre's history and status in both Toronto and Canada. Someone in Texas might never have heard of it, but since when is that the test for inclusion?</li>

<dd>Vaughan Mills, as the first Canadian Mills mall, has had significant land use and retail implications for this country, and although these impacts have not yet been fully explored in the Vaughan Mills article (the mall just opened recently), I think it's just plain incorrect to suggest that these issues could be properly addressed in a general Mills article that deals primarily with U.S. issues.</dd>
<dd>In this day and age, malls and retail centres often function as community and local landmarks. While such malls might not, upon a quick glance, seem "distinct" to someone who is not from that area, those centres are often of great importance to that local and broader areas. For that reason, I can't say whether some of the other Mills malls are worthy of individual articles or not, because I'm from Ontario, and frankly I can't speak to the importance of say, a Mills mall in Florida, to the people in that state. I think these determinations should be left to the people who actually know these places. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 20:30, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Just to add - I <b>do</b> agree with some of the comments made about these articles being "advertising" for the malls and or mall owners. I've seen a few of these articles that come across as promotional copy (even though they might not have actually been written by the mall's marketing people). Although I don't agree that the articles should all be deleted, this particular problem does merit attention. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 20:47, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>KEEP! Southdale Mall was the first fully enclosed shopping center in the United States. It set the standard for the common malls that we see all over the world today. I think that at least the Southdale Center Article should be kept.--<a href="../../../g/e/p/User%7EGephart_a457.html" title="User:Gephart">Gephart</a> 07:29, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>KEEP! Maybe a single entry for the rest of the Mills malls would be appropriate, but the Southdale shopping center is a landmark event for the social and cultural study of mall history (and people really do study this--see James Farrell's book <i>One Nation Under Goods: Malls and the Seductions of American Shopping</i>, Smithsonian, 2003). Subsuming this entry into an article about the Mills mall chain or whatever it is would be a patently bad idea.--TheChickens 08:13, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
