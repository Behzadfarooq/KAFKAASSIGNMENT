<dd>You guys can delete it or whatever you want to do. I tried to research the counting sort after Black said that's what it was just as I did when someone claimed it was a bucket sort about ten years ago. I have no doubt that someone else has discovered it long before me but I haven’t been able to find that out either. As for it being original research as the basis for its deletion go ahead I can't prove that it is not and in fact I worked on it for a very long time before it became the sort you now see. This raises another question. I thought that no original research applied only to a situation in which the claim about the research was invalid or could not be verified versus simply the person who did the work or made the discovery not publishing it on the Wiki. I mean if something is verifiably correct then what's the problem? Oh well bottom line for me is that the Rapid sort is what I ended up with when I tried to improve another sort after many, many, many days and nights and weeks and month trying to make that other sort better. Okay so do whatever you guys want it truely makes no difference to me. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 18:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC) PS By the way I just through that part in there about it being a variation of the Pigeonhole sort but honestly I have no idea. I was just in a hurry to get it posted so I could go on to something else. My guess is that you guys will figure out what to do without any further help from me. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 18:49, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi Pce3. I realize it's disappointing, but regardless of its veracity it really does still qualify as original research, because it's a publication of your own ideas that have never before been exposed in any other forum to public scrutiny. Also, I'm pretty much certain it is exactly counting sort, which is an O(n) time sort, and is often the best choice of sort for elements with a very small range like your 1..4 numbers. It's not used in place of sorts like quicksort because it doesn't work well for elements that take on a very large range of values, such as arbitrary 32-bit integers - the array would have to have 2<sup>32</sup> entries. I agree that the counting sort article could definitely use some work. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 18:51, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again if you guys want to deprive others of the knowledge of this sort then go ahead. It does not matter to me. As for previous publication I published it on the Internet in at least 1996 and the only response I got was an email suggesting it was a bucket sort and I have never heard of a counting sort prior to hearing about it here. So as tight lipped as the ACM and IEEE and other such organizations are it could very well have been created and filed away long before my efforts resulted in its creation back in 1972. so have at it. If you don't want others to know that it exists fine with me. Hide it, burry it, paint it do whatever you want I can still enjoy the very elegant result of my hard labors without any further ado. Whatever you decide will only make a difference to others and will not make any difference to me. 19:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC) And PS again... As for being a memory hog that it is but then imagine an Internet protocol (why they didn't think of this one back then is a stretch for me) like a the echo of time or quote for sorting on the basis of the Rapid sort such that you simply enumerate you data like converting an "A" to ascii 65 and then using that enumeration as an Internet address which when done returns a count. Doing it that way would allow you to avoid incrementing through all of the addresses that had zero count values. Call it the Sort Port!

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> unless the notability of this sorting method can be shown. There are literally thousands of sorting methods, many are very obscure variants.

<li><b>Strong Not Delete</b> Why? It occurs to me that while I don't care for myself if the article is deleted that I do care for anyone who might want to further research the possibility of overcoming the "zero" problem such as by the method of time delay or who knows what someone might come up with? For this reason I think you need to leave this article alone especially since the sort can be implemented in hardware where the "zero" problem can be handled in a different way than with software and where even incrementing through all of the zeros will be accomplished exceptionally fast. Think in terms of a sort chip, if you will. I am also including here below the discussion with DECO he moved to my talk page. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 21:44, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A hardware sort based on sending the data to the address bus of a random access memory is far superior to and different from a sorting network which is defined as follows: "A sorting network is an <i>abstract model</i> of a network of wires and comparator modules that is used to sort a sequence of numbers." Unlike the "sorting network" the Rapid sort (or <b>Instant sort</b> as is the name of its hardware version) is <i><b>not</b></i> an abstract model but a real and working hardware based sort routine which can blow away any other sort you can come up with whether hardware based or not. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 04:19, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Pce3. Just to emphasize that I harbour you no ill will, I've scanned <a href="http://moonflare.com/misc/CountingSort.zip" class="external text" title="http://moonflare.com/misc/CountingSort.zip" rel="nofollow">a description of Counting Sort</a> from the seminal textbook <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>. They don't cite a particular researcher who came up with it, but the book was first published in 1990 and mostly describes classical results from the 1970s. I think if you take a little time to read it you'll realize that what it describes is very much the same idea that you describe. Bucket sort and pigeonhole sort are variations on these ideas. If you'd like to incorporate some of your ideas or implementations into the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counting_sort.html" title="Counting sort">counting sort</a> article, that would be great. Please keep editing, and keep thinking about algorithms too! <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 19:48, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your research efforts on my behalf but I have already decided to reclassify the Rapid sort as an address sort. Thanks anyway. I will however read your material. Thanks. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 19:52, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Okay I've looked at the material and here is my conclusion. My work on the rapid sort began with an effort to improve the Shell-Metzner sort. I wrote this up when I published it on the Internet in 1996. I may even have a record of each step that was taken but they led me to this idea of simply using the data to address memory. Although there is a similarity with the counting sort in that the data in one array is used as an index in another array which is incremented the difference is that my goal was to both maximize speed and to achieve ultimate simplicity since at that time my favorite endeavor was logical equation reduction. Since I had already started from a sort that compared data I was enthused when it turned out that what I was working with did not require a comparison at all. Furthermore since my goal was to eliminate excessive baggage I in fact recall abandoning the idea of using more than one array or even a multi-dimensional array to accomplish the sort. My goal was to reach an end point which this sort represented rather than to then expand upon this idea and add multi-dimensions or other arrays, etc. Why you ask? Again my goal was to find the ultimate sort which the Rapid sort represents. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 20:15, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are some implementation differences - namely, you directly use the input list as it is generated instead of an input array, you print your output instead of storing it in an output array, and you don't perform the intermediate loop on the array which the book is just showing for exposition (most implementations I've seen don't have it). But these are not big differences. As you can see, they also don't use comparisons or multidimensional arrays either. I understand that you're very attached to this algorithm that you've committed a lot of time to thinking about, but it's really nothing new and it's not appropriate for sorting elements that take on a large number of values, not only because of the memory required for the array but because of the time required for the final loop. There is no simple way to "remove the zeros" without increasing the complexity. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 20:23, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well you have not read my further reply to this argument on the Rapid sort deletion talk page so I will repeat it here. Assuming that even though there may not be a client computer or server with a Sort port (similar to an echo or quote port) such capability can be provided by even the router that is home for a particular range of addresses. The idea being that the router or server or client computer returns a count that corresponds with each [identical] address that was sent. The trick then becomes how to get the counts back in sequential order. This can be accomplished simply by implementing return of the count on the basis of a schedule derived from the address [(converted data)] that was sent with a sufficient interval to overcome all types of potential delay. The same scheme could be [implemented] locally and even within the same computer that sent the data as an address with far more certainty [and precision] of the interval being long enough. Instead of an address sort you could call this a time delay sort. Also did I mention that I implemented this sort using random access memory and that an integrated chip that would do test for none zero memory and do the incrimination as well would probably beat any other method that can be implemented in hardware or software? <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 20:57, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you'd prefer to discuss it here that's okay. First I'll say that even if this "port sort" idea were novel research, it still counts as original research - we describe things that are well-known (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>), not things that we come up with on our own. For sort algorithms, this usually means they have to be published in a reputable, peer-reviewed journal or conference.</dd>
<dd>As for the idea itself, it's a fun idea, but unfortunately does not yield a speed improvement - the key problem is that the nodes are unaware of one another. Just think of the case where there's two values, one the smallest and one the largest. The largest could not send its count as soon as the smallest has finished, because it doesn't know that the nodes for the intervening values don't have counts to send. To be correct, they'd each have to be allocated a time slot, requiring the same time as counting sort. Besides the fact that overhead makes it entirely impractical. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 22:02, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is just a special case of counting sort and has no interesting features. It's usefulness is limited by assuming that the data consists only of keys, and not of records that include a key together with other things. That assumption is the only reason it looks simpler.
