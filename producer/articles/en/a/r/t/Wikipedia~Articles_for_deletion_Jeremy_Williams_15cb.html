<p>Webmaster of a <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rammstein.html" title="Rammstein">Rammstein</a> fansite. At best, the site should get a link on the Rammstein page. However, I can't see how this guy is notable, even if his site is. Vanity either way. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 16:00, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>He is notable because he is probably the most famous person in the Rammstein community next to the band members. I know you probably couldn't care less about him, but I know that a lot of fans of the band do. KarlKarl 17:22, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry, but being a big fan of a music group does not warrant encyclopedic inclusion. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 18:25, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I've already deleted this thing three times and blocked the original anon that created it (whose only other "contribution" to Wikipedia was vandalism just prior to creating this article the first time). Note that the picture accompanying the article is titled "Me4". Vanity, nonsense, nonencyclopedic, trolling. And delete the picture, too. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:36, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Jeremy has to be responsible for gaining atleast half of Rammstein's Fans worldwide!!! Not to mention introducing every Rammstein fan to other amazing German bands such as Megaherz, Eisbrecher, OOMPH!, Stahlhammer, Herzer, In Extremo, Subway To Sally... just to name a few</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jeremy could easily be considered the seventh member of Rammstein. How many people who run fansites get asked to run the official website of the band they've dedicated a good majority of their time to and actually mean it? That in itself is completely extraordinary and definitely deems Wikipedia status. He's even thanked on the "Thank You/Credits" section of Rammstein's latest album "Reise, Reise" for Christ's sake.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I hope I'm not bursting anybody's bubble here, but while both of those are pretty cool in their own way, neither of them is all <i>that</i> unusual. I've seen many large fansites become official or semi-official after getting recognised by the band or artist. And I know that if I was a big Rammstein fan, getting thanked in their liner notes would make me very, very, very happy... but would I expect myself to be listed in an encyclopedia because of it? Of course not! <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:42, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One more vote for the page: Jeremy is essentially a celebrity within the Rammstein community, and has managed to branch out and create official websites for other German bands. He is more than a one hit wonder, and has gained the respect of a large number of German bands, as well as avid fans of German music. He offers people avenues to explore a culture of music that might otherwise go unknown to them. And one more tidbit, the guy has at least 2 songs written about him, so he must have something going on, to warrent such attention.

<li>Here's another article about a webmaster, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Knowles_1503.html" title="Harry Knowles">Harry Knowles</a>. This article is even more informative than that one. KarlKarl 16:26, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep it, he's a big part of the Rammstein fan community, and now a bit part of the band's activities, too.

<li>Above unsigned vote by 138.217.52.170, first and only edit from that IP. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:14, Mar 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li>You seem to be one of those who judge people by their post counts. Just because it's their first post, it doesn't mean they're braindead and just because it's their 10000th post, it doesn't mean they're credible either. In any case, you've seen the precedents which have been set by the above two Webmasters. It also takes a lot of time and effort to run not one, not two, but three band sites all filled with content and information which fans would otherwise not get from anywhere else. He may not play the instruments of Rammstein but he is an important part of the crew. If this encyclopedia allows Harry Knowles, don't tell me it can't make room for Jeremy Williams ---Jon 08:21, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, pointing out unsigned/anon/new-user votes is common practice here on VfD. When admins close the VfD debates, such votes are generally not counted. I call your attention to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators</a>, which clearly states: <i>administrators can disregard votes and comments if they feel that there is strong evidence that they were not made in good faith. Such "bad faith" votes include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article.</i> Basically, not only is this a bad idea because the votes won't count, it also tends to annoy legitimate voters and admins. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:32, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What the heck, I'll be nice and answer your question too: Both Knowles and Kyanka are notable for things other than being a webmaster. Knowles' "Ain't It Cool News" was also a TV series, he's guest-hosted on Siskel &amp; Ebert more than once, he's producing a movie, and he's appeared in several major motion pictures. We get plenty of webmaster articles on Wikipedia, and they're always deleted by voting unless the subject is also notable for something else. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:45, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Interesting points all around. (<a href="../../../e/x/o/User%7EExoriven_5ab8.html" title="User:Exoriven">Sean</a> 21:50, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC))</li>
<li>What is Richard Kyanka notable for other than being the webmaster of a popular comedy site? KarlKarl 21:16, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to the article, he publishes DVDs and owns a clothing line. He also starred in the acclaimed film "Doom House". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:05, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete this article since the "legitimates" FEEL that these votes don't mean anything and they were made in so-called "bad faith" and by "sock puppets". Ok, I'll try to make you happy: all of this discussion is really pointless just for a few kilobytes of server space. It's really pointless. Go feel like you've done your "wikiduty" and go ahead and delete this. Yeah, when newbies post favourable opinions, you finally count it as being on "your side".</li>
