<li><s><b>Speedy Delete</b></s><b>Keep</b> Disclosure: I have been in extensive dialogue with Barb Biggs on her talk page. The page submitted is an autobiography written by the subject. I think before we can accept this there will need to be many independent sources cited and/or an extensive reduction of the content. I advised her to compile her notability sources and I was intending to consider writing one myself if, after verifying the sources she had a notable and verifiable biography. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 06:12, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oakshade, if this is your position, than strip it down to a stub based on referenced material and the AfD debate can continue on the stub article. My may concern is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Conflict of Interest</a> at this point. I have been working with Barbara on her talk page and I intend to continue to do so to find material that may be relevant.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 07:40, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite the fact that I have been working with Barbara on her talk page, due to this process, I have taken some time to look at the reposted article. I removed all references to articles Barb Biggs wrote as that would clearly be Conflict of Interest. Further, I reformmated the 3 provided citations and removed a great deal of uncited statements. That said, I offer this section of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wp%7Ebio.html" title="Wp:bio">wp:bio</a> for contemplation as I think this is the nature of our debate:</li>
</ul>
<p>--- The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</p>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries except for the following:
<ul>
<li>Media reprints of the person's autobiography or self-promotional works.</li>
<li>Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>--- The citations we currently have in the article, two of them are interviews and one is an independent article. The interviews, I am interested to read the thoughts of others. Do we consider interview statements made by the subject reliable sources? Barbara is making some rather controversial statements about the barrister, that I have not seen confirmed by anyone but Barbara herself. If we choose to accept the interviews as reliable sources we may be reprinting something that is not a reliable statement. Lastly we have the "Hollingworth in 'journey of discovery'" article from theage.com.au. The Hollingworth article reads as credible as it is not simply an article, but I personally cannot speak for the reliability of the source. Anyone on that subject have a thought? I have not touched on the book citations, I would like to read your thoughts on these 3 first. Thank you for your patience. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:07, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm having trouble understanding your issue, Alan. First of all, she was a sole primary guest of the BBC program <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman%27s_Hour_70ce.html" title="Woman's Hour">Woman's Hour</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2004_38_tue_02.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2004_38_tue_02.shtml" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and that's the audio interview (actually, by listening to it, it sound more like a discussion with the host <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/ram/2004_38_tue_02.ram" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/ram/2004_38_tue_02.ram" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>). That she was chosen as the primary guest on a long running popular national radio show is an example of notability in itself. And I would strongly argue that an "inteview" is very different from an "autobiogrpahy". The other two pieces currently in the article certainly aren't "trival coverage" (not just a "mention" or a listing).<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/11/24/1164341378905.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/11/24/1164341378905.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/03/1083436541695.html?from=storyrhs" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/03/1083436541695.html?from=storyrhs" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> She's the "Primary subject". As almost always, when there's a journalistic piece of somebody, they contain quotes from the subject. Correct me if I'm but, but just because they contain those quotes, you seem to be labeling these as autobiographies. They're not at all. And none of these are "self published works" in any way.&#160;; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a> articles and the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> interview are not published by this subject.

<dd>The point I am raising for discussion is the value of sourcing a statement the subject of the biography made in an interview. I think the idea of independent sourcing relates to remarks others have written that support the article about the subject. When you are citing the subject, even if it's in a national interview, the source is not the interviewer, but the subject themself.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:48, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm only dealing with the issue of notability, not exacly verification of the article content. I'm looking at these articles closely and I'm finding a majority of the Nitika Mansingh and Damien Murphy written ones have only a small minority of actual quotes of the subject and are mostly about her rathing than listening to her. I agree that the article content should not be verfied by the actual statements of the sujbect, whether they are from that BBC interview or the written articles, except as written in journalist form that actually cites the subject, ie. "According to Ms. Biggs, when she was 5..." --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 09:05, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><s>Comment</s> Keep</b> I am not familiar with the radio show in question, but in the U.S., being the primary guest of a tabloid TV show means very little. Some shows even put on fake guests or coach guests into elaborating their stories. The reputation of the show is very much at issue here. That said, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_Living_Persons_6806.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of Living Persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of Living Persons</a> requires that any accusations she has made against still-living persons be independently verified, or else that the accusation itself be sufficiently notorious that it has wide press coverage. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 13:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>A friend alerted me to this page which I didn't even know existed, although Alan had mentioned there was a debate going on somewhere! - main reason I haven't responded to the debate. First point I'd like to make is that the barrister died in the 1990s. This was first rreported in a fourpage article Good Weekend, one of Australia's most respected liftout magazines in the Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers (Melbourne) in 2003 when my book came out. I will try to find a reference to this, however I find that often older articles are hard to find. The main reason dozens of articles about me haven't come up when I do google searches I presume. I was also interviewed on BBC World Service when In Moral Danger came out in the UK. Once again, if I can't find it on google, I don't know where else to find older references. If anyone knows, please let me know. In one version posted, there were references for the publishers sites listing In Moral Danger in Sweden, Greece and Japan. They are in the languages of those countries, but if you don't allow weblinks in other languages, this isn't necessarily going to be reported, since it isn't considered relevant news, in English publications. If anyone knows where such a source could be found, let me know. As for notability, there are pages of interviews about me on google, including some of the most respected interviewers in Australia - Phillip Adams, Robyn Williams (30 years presenting on ABC radio), George Negus (30 years Oz TV), Australia's top rating Sunrise breakfast news TV program three times. These are not cited but I will try to find them. As for the political career. Unsure why this was deleted since my candidacy was reported in Nitika Mansinghe's article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbbiggs_c3b1.html" title="User:Barbbiggs">Barbbiggs</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarbbiggs_5fe0.html" title="User talk:Barbbiggs">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Barbbiggs_389f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Barbbiggs">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Please remember to sign your posts with four tildes (~~~~). Thank you for clarifying that the barrister is no longer a living person, which relieves BLP concerns. If the name goes back, a date of death with citation would be nice -- perhaps he has a capsule biography in <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who%27s_Who_098a.html" title="Who's Who">Who's Who</a> or some equivalent?

<p>I've managed to find many articles and interviews which I've slotted in, but not the crucial Good Weekend one. It's too old I think. The Sydney Morning Herald archives only back back 12 months. Also, I've found a Japanese amazon.jp site and cited that for the Japanese publication (this is in Japanese, but the book, In Moral Danger and my name is written in English on the site) but amazon doesn't have websites in Greece or Sweden. Of course I cited Greek and Swedish sites before, but somebody has deleted them, presumably because they are in a foreign language. I'd certainly like to know how other people verify that their books have been translated into other languages. In any case, see how you go with the sources now cited and keep me posted <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbbiggs_c3b1.html" title="User:Barbbiggs">Barbbiggs</a></p>

<p>I can't believe the hoo ha, back stabbing, control issues, going on about this article. As a result of, I presume, adding source material and fixing typos to this article myself, I have been blocked from my username and can't log on. This feels more like a grade eight class of school kids fighting over what is basically an innocuous article that should have been a fairly straight forward process. My many 'edits' that I have disobediantly 'added' have been fixing typos, adding an apostrophe and adding sources. If you want ordinary people with something to offer to have a positive experience with WP, I suggest you get over yourselves and spend some of your time fixing up other, appalling and offensive entries (Recovered Memory Therapy, The Courage to Heal, Satanic Ritual Abuse) instead of wasting everybody's time with inoffensive ones like mine.<br />
I have personally spent some 20 hours trying to satisfy your every increasing demands on what is basically a few hundred words about a person who writes books and volunteers much of her time on an issue that most people find a turn off. Do with the article what you will. I resign. 203.36.217.79</p>
