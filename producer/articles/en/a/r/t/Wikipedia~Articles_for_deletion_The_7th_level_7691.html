<li><b>Don't Delete</b> By that standard any site that has humor, comics, etc is a rip off of something awful. By my Alexa bar, it was ranked 167,000 last month, and has experienced a traffic drop this month. Historically, it shows the traffic going up and down like this about every other month, so your current Alexa ranking isn't an accurate reflection of the site's popularity. And when you google the site title, yes it has one main entry. But if you google specific subjects that the site has covered, the articles are usually high up on the list. Several of its pieces are linked as external site links for many wikipedia entries, according to google. For example, if you google Dr. Phil, or "Dr. Phil Endorses the PSP" you find a fake Dr. Phil page the staff did a year ago that's not only linked all over the web, but apparently pulls in so much email from people actually believing it to be Dr. Phil's website that the staff get a mailbox full of Ask Dr. Phil emails every week asking for advice. Google lists it as having been linked here, on Fark, Alldumb, and on similar sites from numerous countries including Canada, France, Japan, and Russia. The head writer wrote for Whatever-dude, a now defunct but very popular spin-off of X-Entertainment, one of the most popular websites of this type. There are numerous sites that get less traffic and are less known than this one, that have wiki pages that have been up for over a year without being considered for deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.248.129.126 (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.248.129.126.html" title="User talk:65.248.129.126">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.248.129.126_7f85.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.248.129.126">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> It isn't about the inspiration of the site's content nor it's similarity to other websites; as far as I can see this website gets notable traffic and this wiki reads as an unbiased account of this website's history and purpose.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I am not sure what the issue is here. I have read the deletion policy and I believe that the page is compliant with all of the guidelines. It is an accurate wiki article. I believe that putting it up for deletion is rather childish, because I am of the opinion that the people who are wanting it gone are the same who have instigated disagreements with the website already and have personal and irrelevant reasons for wanting the wiki deleted.

<dd>The above user, Caitlin Des Rosier, is yet another first time editor. I put this up for AfD following standard procedures. Whilst I am not in a position to speak for any other users, I have only visited the site once when analyzing it for AfD. I used Alexa and Google to find potential relevancy and found none. This AfD, like most, isn't personal. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and therefore article subjects must have encyclopedic value which can be verified. This website is, thus far, not notable. That may change in the future, but for now it doesn't meet any of the criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Nothing personal. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 02:38, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I may be a first time editor, but I've been familiar with Wikipedia for long enough to know that this entire argument is rather ridiculous. I will, for now, ignore the unnecessary name-calling which lends no credibility to your argument, but I would ask that it please stop. If it is possible, this discussion should be mature. As for defending the wiki that has my name attached to it - I find this to be a natural reaction and not one that should come as a surprise to anyone. To address the statement that we are all "self serving" - everything listed on Wikipedia is self serving in that it serves itself by providing history and facts and links that are available to the entire internet and therefore is promoted to a large audience. If this entry is to be deleted, than there must also be deletions for absolutely every other article in Wikipedia about an entertainment website or web comic, for one is every bit as relevant or irrelevant as another. I also ask - who are you to judge what does and does not have encyclopedic value? I believe that it has been adequately expressed that the website is linked all over the world and this shows that while the website is not interesting to you personally, there are people out there who ARE interested and might like to read about the history of the website as well as any other information included in the wiki. Caitlin Des Rosier 02:58, 27 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have not called anyone names. The arguments aren't ridiculous as there are set standards (as I have pointed out numerous times) in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> that this site just doesn't meet. If you want to argue that the standards should be changed, go for it...but this isn't the place for that. I never said the site isn't interesting or that it is bad. I have made no judgement about the content of the site or the creators, merely that the subject isn't encyclopedic under Wiki standards. No, I don't decide what is or isn't encyclopedic, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does. If all these people who create accounts just to vote <i>don't delete</i> were to take the time to prove some level of notability and verifiability, then this AfD would be over and the article would remain. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 03:13, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have been to read the page you are citing as your reasons for wanting the wiki deleted and I still view the argument as ridiculous. If you had flagged the page to say it had missing information then this would be different, but you did not. So far I believe we've met all of the requirements and I do not appreciate the "sock puppet" reference. I know it must be a term used in Wikipedia a lot, but it is used on this page in a derogatory fashion that I am offended by. That is what I mean by name calling and I firmly expect it to stop immediately. Caitlin Des Rosier 03:23, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>View it as you may. It is, in fact, the criteria for this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 07:52, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your problem with reading comprehension is becoming annoying, sir. I said the argument that you've posed is what I find ridiculous, and not the guidelines themselves. If you are going to suggest deletions and then also have a discussion to defend your reasons, please try to read, <b>understand</b>, and <i>then</i> respond. Doing otherwise shows disregard for your argument and tends to hurt rather than help. he fact that you believe the 7th level is not compliant with the guidelines after little to no research or effort to find the truth alerts me that you either don't know what you are doing or that you are what I have heard referred to as an "internet troll". I do not, sir, thrive on argument, and since you seem to be incapable of normal discussion, I am going to stop participating on this page. I believe that my point has been made - there is absolutely no valid reason for the deletion as we have filled every requirement. 67.161.252.42 09:24, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So first you claim that I made personal attacks, and then you go on to insult my intelligence? As far as reading comprehension goes, my arguments are based on the guidelines. If you are done playing sock puppet (note you forgot to use your brand new identity) we are done here. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 09:34, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If nothing else, we meet the criteria number 3&#160;: "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators..." because every reference to a movie in our website has been linked at imdb.com and one of the web-comics featured has received nominations for two awards on thebestsatireawards.com and if the current voting trend continues, he should win those awards without any competition.

<dd>Actually, you don't meet number 3. Referencing a notable thing isn't the same as a notable thing referencing you. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 07:52, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, if you had actually read the sentence I wrote, I said very clearly that imdb.com linked us. This is obviously going nowhere and I am going to stop replying to you after I go to bed. We are in compliance, and that's a fact. 67.161.252.42 09:24, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note, that you continue saying <i>us</i>. Guidelines state that writing an article about yourself is vanity. You are in no way compliant with the regulations. If you were, you should have no problem whatsoever providing verifiable evidence...which you appear unable to do. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 09:34, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Irish guy's argument doesn't seem valid and he seems to be the only one who is strongly opposed to this article's existence. This article was written in an unbiased fashion and the website gets notable traffic. As for the first time editor bits, who cares. Really? If you do, then may I suggest finding yourself a bonnie lass with whom you can spend your time. Sugar Ray Dodge</li>

<dd>I think the point she was trying to make was that IMDB.com links to every movie review their site puts up, especially reviews for movies which IMDB.com itself hasn't posted a review for. techinically, that is distribution of material from an independent website. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.125.55.219 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.125.55.219_d952.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.125.55.219">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
<dd>Number 3 states: <i>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster</i>. IMDB is not a newspaper, magazine, broadcaster, nor publisher. It is a movie site that accepts information and links from any user. Therefore a link from IMDB placed by a 7th level user isn't the same as content distributed on a notable and independent source. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 20:15, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
