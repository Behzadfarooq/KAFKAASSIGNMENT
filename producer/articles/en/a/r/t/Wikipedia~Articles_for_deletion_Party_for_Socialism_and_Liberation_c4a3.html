<p>Repeatedly nominated for speedy deletion by an IP address, despite being removed. Arguments for deletion were "The PSL's New York City branch is based in Harlem.

It mentions that it has a branch in Harlem throughout the article.", CSD G11, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAPBOX" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#SOAPBOX</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> No vote yet, but unless they can come up with better sources than their own website and their own magazine, I would vote to delete.

<p>The PSL has since initiated a New York City branch based in Harlem, and has opened offices in Chicago. ...</p>
<p>It is published monthly and can be obtained from a variety of bookstores throughout the United States, as well as through PSL offices. ...</p>
<p>he Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) also maintains branches and centers in Baltimore, MD; Chicago; Los Angeles, CA; New Paltz and New York City, NY; San Jose, CA; Seattle, WA; and West Chester, PA. The PSL's New York City branch is based in Harlem. ...</p>
<p>Plus the only citation is themselves... This neeeds to be deleted. 68.161.73.206 02:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And in addition for reason for deletion is... Wikipedia states in the What Wiki is not page</p>
<p>"Self-promotion. It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects you have a strong personal involvement in. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest."</p>
<p>This page fits that. 68.161.73.206 03:01, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page is not notable either. As the criteria states:</p>
<p>One notability criterion shared by nearly all of the subject-specific notability guidelines, as well as Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not1, is the criterion that a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sites such as <a href="http://www.broadleft.org/us.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.broadleft.org/us.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.broadleft.org/us.htm</a> attest to their existence. They may be small and little-noticed by the press, but so are all the other socialist/communist parties in the U.S. Indeed the history of all these parties, and the fact that they spend 90% of their energy fighting in factional splits against each other rather than gaining new adherents, is a salient part of why socialism and communism have never gone anywhere in the U.S. Thus this article is relevant and notable. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 04:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because, at the moment, the article's only sources are the party's own site &amp; publication, so notability isn't established, and I think it's fair to say that not every splinter party in the U.S. needs a Wikipedia article. That said, if this article can be properly referenced and the party is shown to be more than just a fringe/splinter organization, I would suggest that the closing admin consider this a weak delete or even a neutral vote (depending on the strength of the evidence). | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 04:39, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Just existing does not satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability requirements. We require political candidates to have held office and it's not even clear that this political group has accomplished anything of worth in its history...other than to distinguish itself as not the same as another communist group. Congrats to them, but I'm not seeing the notability. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 05:50, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per Ju66l3r.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: Notable group. Article could definately be expanded. WWP is one of the major left parties in the US, and plays a prominent role in anti-war movement etc..

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> does not meet the notability requirements - only source is their own websites. Also, is written in such a way for self-promotion and violates the "Wikipedia is not a soapbox"</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Deleting a political party on non-notability seems very marginal reasoning. Unpopularity cannot be a reason not to have an article. Furthermore, this provides useful information to users. Though, this article is in serious need of rewrite. <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 21:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> We can verify that they exist, but not much more. Even among below-the-radar small political groups, nothing makes this one look significant.<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 22:54, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>You don't expect that all the groups in that list gets a wiki article. Not all of those groups are notable. I would also dispute the website as a source of notability. This is not a reliable source and it is bias. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Non-scholarly_sources" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Non-scholarly_sources" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Non-scholarly_sources</a> I don't see how being a group coming from another notable group is substantial to say it is notable.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, broadleft.org is highly reputable on this subject. It is probably the most comprehensive collection on information on left movements around the world. Regarding notability, broadleft.org does practice similiar notibility requirements as on wiki, i.e. not listing locally limited groups. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 13:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
