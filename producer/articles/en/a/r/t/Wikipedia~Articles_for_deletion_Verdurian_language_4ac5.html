<ul>
<li>Wholehearted <b>keep</b>. Verdurian is one of the most develloped online conlang.

<li>hi. i am not suggesting that the articles, Mark Rosenfelder or zompist.com, be deleted here. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 19:45, 2005 July 23 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A point raised here though is what distinguishes the article on the Verdurian language from those other two, other than it concerns a conlang? Personally, given that the language is the most widely-reported feature of the Zompist.com website, this entry should take precedence over both <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Rosenfelder_4041.html" title="Mark Rosenfelder">Mark Rosenfelder</a> and <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zompist.com.html" title="Zompist.com">Zompist.com</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 23:13, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a>, calling in your pals from the zompist.com bboard <a href="http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=11032&amp;highlight=wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=11032&amp;highlight=wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> is less than cool. I'm sure they're great folks, but if they are hanging out there, they don't have an interest in Wikipedia and they do have an interest in promoting conlangs. I'm sorry, but Wikipedia is not your soapbox. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 19:58, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Excuse me? "Hanging Out" in one forum or another precludes an interest in Wikipedia? While I may only have been editing for a short time, I have certainly had a far longer acquaintance with and admiration for Wikipedia than the ZBB- whenever I want brief information on something I search Wikipedia first, not Google. And I would hardly refer to Circeus's stance as a "soapbox". <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewrad_5dc4.html" title="User:Dewrad">Dewrad</a> 00:10, July 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what's the word for using Wikipedia as the vehicle for the promotion of some concept, if not "soapbox"&#160;?? Of course participating in one forum or another does not preclude participation in Wikipedia -- <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> apparently participates in both -- the point is that you only need advertise elsewhere to get someone's attention when you know you won't find them here. For example, <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarmaster_fa18.html" title="User:Warmaster">Warmaster</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurlyjimsam_032d.html" title="User:Curlyjimsam">Curlyjimsam</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewrad_5dc4.html" title="User:Dewrad">Dewrad</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 00:46, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As we're all registered users, I think it's not fair to say that you "wouldn't find us here". And what's wrong with letting us know about a VfD going on? Were, say, Star Trek up for deletion, I'm sure word would get around Star Trek forums fairly quickly. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewrad_5dc4.html" title="User:Dewrad">Dewrad</a> 00:53, July 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>So you've noticed that any special interest group can game the VFD system. This is a bug, not a feature. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 02:37, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since you seem to be so interested in the personal background of the people who vote here, I just noticed a few things: that the person who submitted this VfD has been pretty active gathering no-voters himself; and that your own favourite passtime seems to be reverting and deleting other people's work much rather than contributing anything substantial yourself. I haven't found the faintest suggestion that you are knowledgeable about constructed languages at all! --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a>
<ul>
<li>hi. perhaps the above is a little misleading. i notified two users. one user is a linguist whose name i had seen on the deletion pages often concerning conlangs - so i invited him to vote. he has not voted <i>delete</i> on all candidates. the other invitee was invited because i saw this user's name on the page history where this user had previously put a VfD but then recanted with the note "too much trouble". so invited the user to participate if he was interested now. i only invited her/him to vote for this one article. i am not trying to rally support for a certain outcome. i really leave that to all of you. thank you. – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 15:51, 2005 July 24 (UTC)

<li>Correction - i have made many edits to Wikipedia thank you very much, mostly about my city and different Anime pages, but it still stands. i personally think this article should stay, and saying that 'i was dragged from the board' is a blatant lie. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarmaster_fa18.html" title="User:Warmaster">Warmaster</a></li>

<dd>hi. i dont hate conlangs (or conslags - what is this?). i have no opinion except that i wish that more conlangers would be interested in learning more about endangered minority languages and make word lists of those (it would probably be beneficial). but, creating an artificial language is probably a nice, fun pastime for many people. i encourage people to enjoy life. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 19:55, 2005 July 23 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ishwar: what does that have to do with anything? It's not as if conlanging is destroying minority languages! And for the record, I know many conlangers who are learning several different languages, not all of which are the major European ones. Most conlangers aren't mindless hobbyists, but educated people enjoying language and experimenting with it-- just like many poets and writers do. In any case, I think any activity that increases interest in language and languages is well worth it, and since conlanging is of growing interest to many, I believe that they should be included in the Wikipedia. Also, I happen to agree with the person above me-- if you are indifferent, why are you actively fighting for the deletion of so many conlangs? <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrisheye_ac98.html" title="User:Irisheye">Irisheye</a> 17:57, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>hi. it doesnt have anything to do anything. i was responding to user Renate3's speculation about my feelings involving conlangs. i see no need for speculation when i can just write it here. i didnt say that conlanging was destroying minority languages. their loss is part of a very large &amp; complex interaction between political dominant cultures and smaller local cultures. i did not mean to suggest that conlangers are learning or not learning any language of particular geographic region, or mindless and/or uneducated, or dissimilar from poets or writers. (i also dont think that uneducated people are mindless either.) and i dont think that hobbies are mindless. information about conlanging and specific conlangs is included in Wikipedia. the reason why i acted as i did is stated at the top of this page, namely the inclusion of inappropriate material in this encyclopedia. although i am indifferent to the creation of conlangs or their creators, i am not indifferent to the editorial decisions of Wikipedia authors. additionally, i disagree with your fight metaphor: i am not looking for a fight but rather an election which is what i understand this to be. i hope this addresses your concerns. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 18:29, 2005 August 1 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, Ishwar, but for someone who issues a whole series of VfDs in a row, I find your argumentation pretty weak! You were just "responding to someone's speculation about your feelings involving conlangs"? Now come on! If I ask you about your feelings regarding <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>, are you going to do the same in that field too? The only legitimate reason for issuing a VfD (not just voting in it, but starting it, mind) is that you strongly feel an article múst be deleted, and you must have some pretty good reasons for that. As I can see in this case, you were just shooting at random. You mention something about <i>editorial decisions of Wikipedia authors</i>? Sorry, but I don't buy that! There are thousands of articles of far worse quality than the conlang articles in question. You must have had a reason for picking this field. Besides, you picked your conlangs pretty badly: there are conlang articles here that should have been deleted long ago (for example the article about Nalona, an insignificant conlang with no web presence at all: just one sentence and two broken links). Strange you didn't pick those. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 19:11, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>perhaps i was unclear. the response i was referring to above is my response to Renata3 @ 19:55. i was not referring to my deletion voting action &amp; comment @ 15:59. i guess my referent was not that clear.</dd>
<dd>i felt strongly enough &amp; i gave my reason as mentioned directly above &amp; at the top of the page. i was not shooting at random as i have stated on other vfd pages. my choice of conlangs was in a couple of lists of user Assdl (again this i have written on other pages). if the choice of conlangs is pretty bad, it is only because Assdl's lists did not contain the conlangs you would have liked for me to act on. the reason for picking this field is because Assdl added a list of numbers from his conlang into the <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numbers_in_various_languages.html" title="Numbers in various languages">Numbers in various languages</a> article. a short exchange between me &amp; <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">User:Mikkalai</a> led to my vfd actions. it is not so strange, i think: i just looked at what someone put before me.</dd>
<dd>i did mention editorial decisions of authors, yes. this was &amp; is my concern &amp; that is what i wrote. i dont know why you question/disbelieve, but if you do, i guess i simply have no response to that. i am not trying to sell anything, so, no, you need not buy.</dd>
<dd>yes, there are thousands of articles that entered Wikipedia without any kind of editorial policy used to determine their inclusion. again, my concern here is not of the quality of an article, but rather of its appropriate inclusion. i think that my contribution to this project will be more valuable in the coverage of languages &amp; linguistics (since not so many people seem to be interested in this) rather than in the form of regulating content. i get the impression that there are people who enjoy regulating content, voting for deletion, etc. in short, my time is better spent doing research and not decision making. this is the reason why i have not considered the coverage of Star Wars and other fields.</dd>
<dd>i didnt know my reasons for action would be so interesting to so many. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 23:28, 2005 August 1 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, you were indeed a little unclear, but that's clarified now. Nobody is attacking you personally, and nobody is accusing you of dishonesty. That's not the point. The reason some people are a little touchy about these things is that there are a lot of people who carry some personal grudge against conlanging and conlangers, God knows why (remember why Tolkien spoke about "the Secret Vice"), and a VfD like this one is enough to trigger them. If some of us overreacted a bit, it's because we are tired of those unfounded attacks. If you issue a VfD just because someone shows you a few links and you have a hunch that they might be unnotable, that's a little thin for a motivation, if you ask me. But I must give you this: you díd succeed in provoking a discussion, and without your VfDs the current discussion on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConlangs_9d9c.html" title="Wikipedia:Conlangs">Wikipedia:Conlangs</a> about the criteria for objectively establishing the notability of a conlang probably wouldn't have taken place. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 08:13, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>And why is his argument <i>(note: not the one you "quoted" - re-read his post)</i> not? If the argument for deletion is "it is a conlang", and the vote passed as "delete", then all conlangs should be put up at VFD.

<dd>With respect, yes it is. A comprehensively developed conlang with learning materials etc. online is more notable than one that is not (though a legitimate discussion can take place on where exactly the boundary can be set, the point to recognise is that this particular conlang is <i>more notable</i> than some others). <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 23:13, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In conlangs, yes it is. You can whip up a grammar and a few hundred words of vocabulary at the rate of about one language per day if you're talented, especially if you just transform Esperanto, Interlingua (like my own Idido and Faux Romantique, respectively), or some natlang; Verdurian is notable because, instead of these quickly whipped-up conlangs, it has a full <i>and naturalistic</i> grammer and vocabulary, which evolved from a previous mother language, which itself evolved from a 'proto-language', including sound changes over time and borrowings from distantly related languages. In conlang terms, this is the difference between a band like <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Garden_2fc8.html" title="Savage Garden">Savage Garden</a> and a band like ToxicMercury (although neither can touch the Britteny Spears of <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>). <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 02:45, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> As I indicated on the article's talk page, I think there are arguments for both sides and I'm not too fussed either way. Unfortunately, however, Ishwar hasn't put out anything in the way of notability criteria as applies to conlangs (something that would be useful, imho). I respectfully disagree with Wile's assesment that this is a "personal project looking for advertising". As far as I'm aware, Rosenfelder himself hasn't had anything to do with the article. While honestly I'm annoyed at Circeus' response to immediately run to the bulletin board, the points raised by some of the members posted here do have validity. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 23:13, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm a conlanger. Ishwar, what have conlangs done to you that justify you going on a vendetta against all articles about them? I don't see a good reason for not having someone go to all conlang VFDs and voting keep if you basically did the same thing with the same VFD reason for most conlang articles out there. I'll agree that not all conlangs need an article (mine most certainly doesn't), but Mark Rosenfelder is a big name on the online conlang scene, as is Almea and Verdurian, his most developed conlang. Also, I question whoever said that conlangs are "a goofy way to spend your life" about the "goofiness" of knowing so much about a videogame. <a href="../../../c/c/t/User%7ECctoide_7bfb.html" title="User:Cctoide">Cctoide</a> 15:56, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>hi Cctoide. i am not a conlanger, but i am a langer (&amp; also a linger). conlangs have not done anything harmful to me, i dont think. i do not have a vendetta against articles about every conlang, but i do question the inclusion of the articles that i have acted on. the main source of my actions here is results from a conlanger's question about the inclusion of certain conlangs. the articles that i have acted upon are those that appear in this conlanger's list. i additionally, voted on another conlang because i happened to see it in that day's viewing of the deletion pages. i have not acted on any other conlangs and i dont anticipate any further action (because i want to work on Wikipedia's documentation of American languages). i see a good reason for not acting as you suggest: i carefully considered each article and acted accordingly, i (gently) encourage us all to do the same. if my evaluation of the article is uninformed and in bad perspective, hopefully this will be remedied by wiser voters. i also wish that "goofy"-ness was not mentioned as this could perhaps be viewed as negative by some readers. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 00:09, 2005 July 27 (UTC)</li>
