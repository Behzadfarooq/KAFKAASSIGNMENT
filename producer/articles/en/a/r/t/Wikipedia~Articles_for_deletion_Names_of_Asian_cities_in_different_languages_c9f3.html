<p>There is no particular reason why an incomplete list of cities in Asia in different languages is in any way relevant or notable to an English-language encyclopaedia, particularly as it violates <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. While some articles include the name of a place in different languages that may be relevant to the place in question, there is no reasonable reason why a Wikipedia user needs to know what Tokyo is called in Hindi. If anything; this should be either deleted as irrelevant or moved to WikiDictionary or WikiSource. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN"><b><font color="#000000">Páll</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/z/f/User_talk%7EPZFUN_5839.html" title="User talk:PZFUN"><font color="#FF66CC">(<b>Die&#160;pienk&#160;olifant</b>)</font></a></sup> 05:04, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As per the discussions about similar lists for European and African cities (see above) I can easily think of many contexts in which someone would want to know what Tokyo is called in Hindi. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, per nom and my arguments on the other inter-language AFDs. These cross-language articles cause huge problems for verifiability (OR), and Wikipedia is not a translation service. If you want to know the name of a city in another language, then click on the relevant inter-lingua link on its article. It has a far better chance of being verified and correct. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 11:08, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not to discount the other arguments for deletion but the "inter-lingua link redundancy" argument is specious. First, not all of the foreign language variants have Interwiki pages. Second, foreign languages using non-Latin alphabets do not usually contain transliteration or pronunciation information. E.g., Damascus has no Kurdish article and the Japanese article does not tell how to render ダマスカス into something readable to a non-Japanese.</dd>
<dd>In general, Interwikis are very Eurocentric whereas lists such as these have the potential to include important non-European forms. <a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAjaxSmack_7ea4.html" title="User:AjaxSmack">AjaxSmack</a> 17:58, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So fix it. Wikipedia is not a translation service, and if articles on other language wikipedias are inadequate or missing, fix those. Lists like this cause huge problems... for very little gain. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 18:15, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A Greek, Japanese, or Chinese would have no need for a phonetic rendering of something in his own language -- that's something only appropriate to a foreign wiki. And one might know the name of Damascus in Hebrew but not be qualified to write an article in the Hebrew Wikipedia on Damascus. Whether encyclopedic or not, these lists provide information that Interwikis either cannot or will not. <a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAjaxSmack_7ea4.html" title="User:AjaxSmack">AjaxSmack</a> 19:11, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> (like <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages_054d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Names of European cities in different languages">here</a>) because this information was deleted from several articles about cities, based on the fact that they are available in this list anyway. If we delete this list, the information should be moved piecemeal into the individual articles for fairness but I hardly think it's worth the effort; we'd rather keep this list. Also, names of cities say a lot about the history of the counties that speak those languages (eg Hungarian names often reflect German influence, due to historical reasons), they are not just a random collection of data. Moreover, most names <i>are</i>, in fact, verifiable from the interwiki links of the specific cities. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 19:10, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - This information is much more likely to be useful divided up into the respective articles.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per the European page discussion. In addition (from that discussion) I add my comment -- and yes, I know Berlin is in Europe not Asia, just subsitute Tokyo and German if you feel the need -- The mere fact that some editors cannot verify some of the contents of some pages (because of their <b>OWN SHORTCOMINGS</b>) is no reason to delete a page. Perhaps, Motor would not be in the best position to police that particular part of WP -- I don't verify whether the descriptions of various drugs have the reputed effects on their WP page; I'm just not qualified. Most of us are similarly not qualified, so should they be deleted? All of them? WP is not the lowest common denominator. For quick verification of nearly the entire page, we can always look to the interwiki links to many of the articles on the cities listed; I will assume that the editors of the Japanese wiki know what Berlin is called in Japanese better than I and if WP:ja has Berlin as ベルリン that's verification enough. For the rest, if one is doubtful, you can discuss the matter on the discussion page. But note: just because a source is not in English doesn't make it useless especially when it is the <b>name</b> by which one place is known in another language not some kernel of truth waiting for someone to translate it. The outright arrogance demonstrated by the <b>ENGLISH</b> only crowd never ceases to amaze and disappoint me. &lt;sigh&gt; <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:56, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a translating dictionary or an orthographic listing. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a> 21:22, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Strong <b>Keep</b>. Let me explain. Suppose you wanted to know the etymology of the English word <i>algebra</i>. What would you do? You would of course look it up in an etymological dictionary. That is precisely what an etymological dictionary is for: to answer that kind of question. You would find that it is a word of Arabic origin. However, suppose your question was not "What is the etymology of <i>algebra</i>?", but rather "What words are there in English that have an Arabic origin?", a very different question. At this point, an etymological dictionary would be of little use. What you need is a <b>list</b>. Sure enough, the Wikipedia does have precisely such a list: the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Arabic_origin_739f.html" title="List of English words of Arabic origin">List of English words of Arabic origin</a>. (There are also a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Sanskrit_origin_c3c8.html" title="List of English words of Sanskrit origin">List of English words of Sanskrit origin</a>, a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Portuguese_origin_7778.html" title="List of English words of Portuguese origin">List of English words of Portuguese origin</a>, and possibly others.) Why is it useful to have such lists as <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages_2346.html" title="Names of European cities in different languages">Names of European cities in different languages</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_rivers_with_alternative_names_3bd1.html" title="List of European rivers with alternative names">List of European rivers with alternative names</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_regions_with_alternative_names_7ff9.html" title="List of European regions with alternative names">List of European regions with alternative names</a>, and others? Precisely because it is extremely unusual, in the universe of all city names, river names, region names, etc., in the entire world, for these to have such multiple names (exactly in the same way as it is unusual for English words to be of Arabic origin). Consider the map of any country, Britain, for example. While <i>London</i> has a variety of names in foreign languages, there are thousands of place names such as <i>Acton</i>, <i>Brixton</i>, <i>Croydon</i>, <i>Kilburn</i>, <i>Luton</i>, <i>Paddington</i>, <i>Tottenham</i>, and so on, that don't. While <i>Cornwall</i> has a variety of interesting names in foreign languages, most English counties don't, e.g. <i>Essex</i>, <i>Middlesex</i>, <i>Sussex</i>, <i>Norfolk</i>, <i>Suffolk</i>, and so on. Ditto for river names. And it would be exactly the same if you considered the map of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, etc. In order to use a dictionary (such as the Wiktionary) to find the foreign-language forms, you would have to know <i>a priori</i> which forms to look for, i.e., you would have to know already which place names have foreign-language forms. But how can you know that in advance? In other words, the purpose of these lists is to answer questions such as: "What European cities have alternate forms in foreign languages?", "What European rivers have alternate forms in foreign languages?", "What European regions have alternate forms in foreign languages?", etc. These are all very different questions than "What names does Paddington have in foreign languages, if any?" (which you can look up in the Wiktionary), but those are precisely the questions that linguists, historians, toponymists ask. Why? Because the fact that a city has a multiplicity of foreign-language forms has great historical and linguistic implications, and it is the responsibility of the linguist, the historian, and the toponymist to study the reasons why that happened. To repeat, these lists answer a completely different type of questions than the ones that are answered by dictionaries, such as the Wiktionary. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 21:27, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
