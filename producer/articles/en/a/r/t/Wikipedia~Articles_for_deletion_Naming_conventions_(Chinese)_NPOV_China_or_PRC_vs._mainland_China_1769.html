<p>Since <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">User:Instantnood</a> joined Wikipedia, he has consistently tried to change articles relating to China to support his POV. There have been very many discussions, requested moves, requested categories, and a RfC on Instantnood as a result of this. So far he has been unable to establish a majority, let alone a consensus, in support of his proposals. This page is another 25!!!! votes. We don't need this.

<li><b>Delete</b> Instantnood cannot run the polls in a non-biased manner. He doesn't announce them, tries to control who votes, and inserts his bias into the announcement. This poll was run through March until the discussion ran out of steam and the talk page got so big it couldn't be edited. This is just an attempt by him to repeat the voting until everyone gets tired of it and he wins. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 14:24, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>:<cite id="response-to-stc">&#160;</cite>I did annouce it. I told participants (such as <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_NPOV_725c.html#case-by-case_Ran" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)/NPOV">Ran</a>) in the discussion that ran through March the moves would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. I announced <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_NPOV_725c.html#Case-by-case" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)/NPOV">5 days ago</a> that I was planning to create this page, and there was no objection. Upon its creation, I put up notices on many pages to notify people. Everybody can vote. Every vote counts, and will be counted. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 15:46, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If everyone can vote, I would question your habit of soliciting votes. I would even question you notifying anyone that a voting exercise exists, because you are indirectly influencing the voting result. It is up to potential voters to find this page, and it is your duty to ensure they know through <b>unbiased</b> means.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 15:59, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I try my best to notify as many people, for those who have joined any of the relevant discussions, as possible. Wikipedia is not an authoritarian or oppressive state. Nobody is in a position to have the power to influence the result. Every voters can think independently. By the way, should discussion over the this matter be brought to somewhere else? It's not quite relevant with the VfD. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 16:15, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When there is evidence that a vote was not properly conducted, there is every reason to point this out in support of its removal. Even the notification of one person is as good as introducing unfairness to the poll, and this does not get justified by notifying more persons. You claim that wikipedia is not an authoritarian or oppressive state, but this dosent mean it is not used by people with authoritarian or oppressive tendencies. Your claim that "nobody is in a position to have the power to influence the result." does not hold, because there is more then enough evidence to show how untrue this is, and all the more when I can show evidence of you doing it. Your past conduct in this site hardly qualifies you as someone who is "unbiased" and capable of conducting a fair poll, reason enough for this page's removal.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 20:35, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>In what way that the polls are not properly conducted? And am I the one <u>conducting</u> the polls? I created the page when there's no objection, and initiated the polls. And please kindly stop implying that wikipedians can be influenced and are not capable to think, decide and act independently. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 21:04, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have aleady mentioned in detail why it is not properly conducted, and all others who call for its deletion has given even more points to that. Perhaps you might spend some time reading them instead of asking me a well-answered question. Secondly, you started and worded this poll without contribution from anyone else. In that sence, you are the one who is conducting this poll, since you set it up. If it is not you, then who is it? The history page dont lie. You created the page with no objection, because the people who are objecting are not informed of your intentions, and neither do they know of the format of the poll and its wordings used. Your impatience shows. For someone who can make the effort to inform people that the vote is on in their talk pages, I am surprised he cannot do the same when contemplating the idea of coming up with the poll. Last but not least, your repeated discomfort shows when you repeatedly tells me to "stop implying that wikipedians can be influenced and are not capable to think, decide and act independently". Is this an excuse for your vote garnering habits? Is this to justify you dropping notices in people's talk pages when they vote against your favour? Do you feel you are entitled to <b>only</b> ask people who are likely to support your POV to vote because you think they wont be influenced anyway? If you think they wont be influenced, why bother? I said many times...action speaks louder then words, yeah?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 11:48, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The suggestion to have polls in this way was told (see <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_NPOV_725c.html#case-by-case_Ran" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)/NPOV">#1</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_NPOV_725c.html#Case-by-case" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)/NPOV">#2</a>). It is part of the discussion. I wonder if it is necessary to notify in everyone's personal talk page if I have said something at an article's talk page. And imho it is necessary to ensure the reliability and validity of any poll, and to make sure everyone knows what the matter is. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 16:23, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Neither of those two "annoucements" mentions that 25 polls will be conducted, and neither did they list out the pages to be voted on. Neither of them discusses the mode of conduct of the poll, and neither of them discusses the wordings and options to be presented. Worse, neither of them actually say in explicit terms that this poll will be conducted at all. I have seen one of them before, and I was still taken by surprise. I do hope you realise we cant always read your mind. Next, your statements above just shows how biased you are. You find it unnecesary to inform people that you have mentioned the likelihood of your conduct of a poll. The next moment, you expect no surprise amongst anyone who sees that poll when you think it neccesary to inform people that the poll is already up. You insist that the poll is "reliable" and "valid"...by informing some people about the poll? You think it neccesary that "everyone" knows what the matter is...what is you definition of "everyone"? If "everyone" is "aware" of the situation at hand, are they allowed to vote against your favour without you dropping messages in their talk pages demanding for a review on their part? Your talkpage is there for all to see. Anyone can see what you are up to.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 06:38, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Absolute delete</b>. This page came as a complete surprise, an obvious indication that he has certainly not gained consensus in adopting this method to resolve disputes. As I mentioned in the page, this begs questions over the sanctity of all previous rounds of votes, which has thrown up plenty of comments of which hardly any comes close to an agreement. It is the conventions which need a review, and not massive voting exercises like this to establish a political point!--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 15:30, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Proposals to modify the naming conventions should be done separately. If that is successful, the titles of the articles and categories will have to be renamed accordingly, to the revised set of naming conventions. Refer to my response to SchmuckyTheCat's remarks <a href="#response-to-stc" title="">above</a> for "complete surprise". — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 15:56, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And as I mentioned in the other page, you are also saying this voting should take place before the naming conventions becomes a more valid and respectable set of guidelines?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:02, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No I didn't say it. I said the titles should be changed according to the then latest set of conventions, if the conventions is revised. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 16:15, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, and if there is a change in the conventions tomorrow, we are going to have another round of votes of over 25 entries? Think about it. If the conventions are supposed to be respected, why do we need a process like this to enforce the conventions? If there are people protesting these moves despite having read and understood the conventions, do you not think the discussions should be centred over its contents, instead of having to go thru this over and over again, and yet paradoxically facing the possibilities of votes not going in favour of the stated convention? Is it more effective to cure the illness, or its symptoms?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 20:35, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It depends. If there's no disagreement on whether the naming conventions fit to be applied to an article or a category, what's the point of going on ballot? — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 21:04, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Erm...and so, you are saying the current conventions is fit to be applied?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 11:37, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are many articles and categories nominated to be retitled according to the naming conventions. But some people, while they agree retitling according to the naming conventions, do not agree with retitling one or two, or more, of the articles/categories. And that's why it's necessary to be considered on a case-by-case basis. If everyone agrees that the retitling can be done to all of the articles/categories, then case-by-case assessment won't be necessary. Is that clear? — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 16:23, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hence as I mentioned just now, the contradiction is getting obscenely obvious. You now justify this page by saying "some people disagree with some renamings despite conventions". Yet you insisted those who disagree with the conventions will not have their votes counted. Can I say, then, that I agree with the convention, but disagree with what it calls for?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 06:38, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. One of the dozen pages where "wiki policy" on China/Taiwan naming is being discussed/set/opposed/changed/protested.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The idea of a vote is a good one, and we will probably need a Gdansk-like vote. However, first of all there are not enough options (common usage is just "China", this should be offered as an option to "mainland China" and "PRC"), and probably a Taiwan/ROC vote should be held at the same time, for an overall solution. Second, there are also too many options, but the wrong kind: it doesn't seem to make sense to have case-by-case special cases for each of "museums", "transportation", "tourism", etc. and then have to memorize what applies where; there should be some overall universal principle with only a few exceptions (such as for "history", for example). Finally, any vote/survey should be announced well ahead of time, and the exact wording needs to be discussed and hammered out to be as neutral as possible (not just "mainland China, for or against"). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:17, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Incidentally, we've already had many, many votes - and each of those shows there is no majority in favour of changing from the <i>status quo</i>, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 06:23, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Here's the situation as I see it: The naming conventions article that this vote is a subpage of try to specify under what conditions "PRC" and/or "Mainland China" are more appropriate than "China". Some users believe that the naming conventions entail that a significant number of articles should be renamed in order to better conform to those conventions. Others disagree, either because they think the proposed moves do not satisfy the naming conventions, or because they see the results of the moves as violating other policies, or they disagree with the naming conventions. There's been considerable debate already, with no clear results. The naming conventions are arguably the "overall universal principle" you are looking for. In the past on a related topic, several moves were proposed en bloc on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, which met with opposition, because achieving consensus on a whole set of items is difficult. My own view is that a different approach is needed, one which separates policy making (coming up with naming conventions) from policy implementation (carrying out the requisite moves without any need for additional polls), but I have no idea if that would be feasible or how to go about it. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 07:30, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is already an <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_NPOV_Taiwan_vs._ROC_bd32.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)/NPOV/Taiwan vs. ROC">ongoing poll</a> to assess whether each of the Taiwan-/ROC-related articles and categories satisfy the naming conventions. That poll has already suggested that, to some users, although they agree with the moves, they don't think certain pages are satisfied.<br />
As this is an assessment on whether an item satisfy the conventions, the only option is to stick with the naming conventions, and therefore no alternative option was provided (say, "China") when I created the page.<br />
On announcement of the poll, please refer to my response to SchmuckyTheCat <a href="#response-to-stc" title="">above</a>. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 07:58, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)

<li>And there lies the root of the problem. Again we can clearly see you are insisting the convention as it is now must stand at all costs. It is no wonder no one could get any idea through your head, because it is the conention itself which needs a review.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 06:38, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I am not sure where you get this idea that your proposed vote on Taiwan-related articles revealed any consensus among any users agree with your proposals. Please also make sure that you change your voting standard back to <b>rough consensus</b> to protect the Wikipedia voting standard and not the current simple majority votes standard which favors passing your controversial proposal. Please note that even you claim no objection for your initiation for votes, there is utterly no support for you to initiate a vote like this one being vfd or the one targeting on Taiwan-related articles.--<a href="../../../m/a/b/User%7EMababa_77df.html" title="User:Mababa">Mababa</a> 03:43, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>As I have mentioned <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_NPOV_Taiwan_vs._ROC_bd32.html#rough_consensus" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)/NPOV/Taiwan vs. ROC">elsewhere</a>, I did not notice it wasn't &gt;50% majority, by counting number of "support"s and "oppose"s. Change it if it should be rough consensus. It'd be better if it goes through discussion. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 07:32, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)

<li>As a participant in this vote initiated by Instantnood, I am realy troubled by this answer. I believe that I deserve a more responsible reply from Instantnood. The rest of my response at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28Chinese%29/NPOV/Taiwan_vs._ROC#Rough_Consensus_or_.3E50.25.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28Chinese%29/NPOV/Taiwan_vs._ROC#Rough_Consensus_or_.3E50.25.3F" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You have yet respond to my comment on your lack of support for initiating votes and thus these moves are unwarranted, I'll take it as an acquiescence of acknowledging this fact.--<a href="../../../m/a/b/User%7EMababa_77df.html" title="User:Mababa">Mababa</a> 02:43, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Instanthood doesn't owe you anything and he's been nothing but forthcoming, honest, and polite with everyone including those who have disagreed with him (which is a lot more than I can say for some people involved in this). I'm going to recommend he not reply to your constant questioning because right now this isn't productive.
