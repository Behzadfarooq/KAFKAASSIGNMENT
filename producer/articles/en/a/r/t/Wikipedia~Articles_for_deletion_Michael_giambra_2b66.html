<li>Wait, Do not delete, please provide some input on how I could modify this to benefit this site. He has historical and biography material for numerous noteable popular rock musicians and he has been working directly with these artists for over 20 years. What about the people that have been interviewed here. He has over 20 years of exclusive interviews with musicians ranging from the Allman Brothers, Weezer, Billy Idol, etc.? Rockstarpix.TV is the next generation of music video television and V-logging (this has been said by artists he has worked with like Billy Idol, Steve Stevens, Jethro Tull).

<li><b>Comment</b>. I edited the article. first problem was that it appears the text was largely from <a href="http://www.mikeportnoy.com/articles/pdf/036.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mikeportnoy.com/articles/pdf/036.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Next problem was that the article was non-encyclopedic. Terms like "impressive" and "visual showcase" make good advertisment copy, but are not neutral terms and are not appropriate for an encylopedia. I also removed the link to Rockstarpix.TV. It may in your opinion be "the next generation of music video television and V-logging", but hopefully you can admit to being a bit biased as it is your site. Those claims cannot be independantly verified, unless you can cite some sources where someone reputable has made that claim in an article.</li>

<dd>I'm not sure this article will survive the AfD even with the changes because there is still the question of notability. I'm not trying to be snarky by any means, but there will be the issue of being able to verify some of your claims about being published. As it stands, I'm not sure being a photographer is any more notable (per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>)than being say, a bike messenger, even if you've had pictures of musicians published. <b>No Vote</b> because I did the rewrite.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:21, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What current policy? It's nearly useless to say "according to current policy" because there's so many of them; you need to explain how you feel particular policy <i>applies</i> to the current case. In this case, I think our policies on autobiography (we frown on them) and vanity (we frown on that too) apply, and as Barno points out, "Notability does not transfer through a camera to its user". It's true that this person has taken a <i>lot</i> of people over the years of some <i>very</i> famous people. But given that that is basically the definition of his profession, that <i>every</i> celebrity photographer is trying to get photos of celebrities, the question becomes: is <i>every</i> member of his profession automatically notable; or, is there evidence that he is notable <i>beyond</i> the standard for his profession? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:46, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>Hey Feldspar, what is up your ass buddy?</s> Michael Giambra is not a "celebrity photographer". He is a working journalist and producer. You should try to get your facts straight before you try to classify others. <s>Why don't you tell us what great acomplishments you have produced other than your snarky, anal comments here?</s> He does not "try" to get photographs of famous people. Michael Giambra is invited and encouraged to document them and treated as a friend and a peer by them. I try to remain humble here but I can back up everything I am stating here about Mr. Giambra with his photographic evidence and historical proof. What angers me is that someone with NO credibility (other than your affiliation to wikipedia) can try to berate and belittle his 20+ years of photography, journalism and video production work without ANY knowledge of the truth or facts. --<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstarpixtv_bafa.html" title="User:Rockstarpixtv">Rockstarpixtv</a> 02:11, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>*Comment: Feldspar, I disagree with you. I have done something for Wikipedia. I have uncovered a major flaw in Wikipedia. <s>It allows jealous users like yourself to display their hubris as they live inside a false ethos of self-created importance constrained by a fairly "neat-o" online information resource that will soon be replaced by "the next greatest Google".</s> You have no idea who you are conversing with here <s>and your sarcasm-speak is childish at best. Keep on assuming, you are defeating your argument and proving what fool you are.</s> What does it matter if this is my first contribution to Wikipedia? Again, you assume I will not contribute more. I just joined the site a few days ago! <s>Why do you choose to be a flea on the "ass of the internet"?</s> <i>-- comment by <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstarpixtv_bafa.html" title="User:Rockstarpixtv"><tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Rockstarpixtv</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockstarpixtv_ee2a.html" title="User talk:Rockstarpixtv">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rockstarpixtv_a35a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rockstarpixtv">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Rockstarpixtv_38f3.html" title="Special:Blockip/Rockstarpixtv">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>); personal attacks struck out</i></li>
