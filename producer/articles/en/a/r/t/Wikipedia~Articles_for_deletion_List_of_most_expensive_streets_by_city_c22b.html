<li><b>Keep</b> interesting list and certainly source-able. That it needs improvement isn't a reason for deletion. The number of streets seriously considered "most expensive" in a city is going to be relatively small, and limited to large cities anyway. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 17:04, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have added references to a half dozen of the retail districts, just as an example. Referencing the entire list will take a huge amount of effort, but it could still be done. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 17:22, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> you can't buy streets.

<ul>
<li>Well you <i>can</i> buy streets... but that's neither here nor there. Change the title to reflect that these are just lists someone has bothered to write an article calling the "most expensive" street in a given city, e.g. these are streets <i>considered</i> the most expensive. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 17:28, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But many of them are *not*. Stephen Avenue in Calgary is just an extremely busy pedestrian mall - half the storefronts on it are things like falafel stands, music stores, Winners, donair houses, etc., etc. There are a few high-class shops but they're in between the law offices and Vietnamese noodle shops. If that fact is wrong (and not attributed), how about the others? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 20:38, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If a source can't be found for an item on the list, the item can be removed... same as with any list or claim on Wikipedia in general. The fact that one item on a list was incorrect isn't a good reason to delete the whole thing. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 21:08, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's 106 items in the list (my rough count) and only 10 are referenced. If we start deleting the unreferenced ones the article starts to be a bit of nothing. —<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne"><i>Moondyne</i></a> 01:15, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Preferably people would only remove ones they think are incorrect, or try to find a source for and can't. Assume good faith and all. Again, the list could be improved. That it hasn't been yet isn't a good reason to delete. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 01:18, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>There are about 35 referenced now. Considering there were zero when the AfD started, I think this shows referencing can be done. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:16, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When this was nominated there were zero references. It has since improved and several mistakes have been fixed or removed. Changing to <b>very weak keep</b> as I still feel that its not particularly encyclopaedic. —<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne"><i>Moondyne</i></a> 07:15, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> nom says "No criteria for inclusion" although that must be clear from the title, and the fact that many of the streets have their own articles supports the implicit claim of notability, and "unverifiable"--much of this is fairly objective and well-published information. I have no problems with deleting any that isn't, but keep the article. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatchups_8acc.html" title="User:Matchups">Matchups</a> 01:54, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> People refer to expensive neighborhoods, and they mean neighborhoods with expensive houses; same with streets. There are true practical criteria--the real estate ad subculture, supported by the frequent articles in newspapers. If one really wanted to get exact, there is always property tax records, an unimpeachable RS. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per guy: "you cant buy streets" <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">SM</a><a href="../../../s/m/b/User_talk%7ESmbarnzy_6a65.html" title="User talk:Smbarnzy">BarnZy</a> 05:45, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> There is no way properly define inclusion on the list, making it totally subjective and unusable. How would it even be possible to calculate the value/price of a street? It wouldn't. Most of the sources don't even talk about streets, just about single houses. <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax%7EVobiscum_3a44.html" title="User:Pax:Vobiscum">Pax:Vobiscum</a> 08:59, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the Cushman &amp; Wakefield study actually <i>does</i> calculate the "most expensive" street in a mathematical way, by finding the average price per square foot of space on a street, and ranking streets based on that data. <a href="http://www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/jsp/newsDetail.jsp?repId=c7800055p&amp;LanId=EN&amp;LocId=GLOBAL" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/jsp/newsDetail.jsp?repId=c7800055p&amp;LanId=EN&amp;LocId=GLOBAL" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Saying a street is the most expensive because it has the most expensive house/restaurant in a town is an original conclusion, and that stuff needs to go. I was careful that the sources I added actually claim a given street is the most expensive in a city. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 14:00, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But using another method of counting you would get a different result. There is no accurate way to measure the expensiveness of a street. Do you count the average cost per square meter or do you just pick the street with the highest total? Are we measuring the cost of renting space or actucally buying the buildings? Do we use the total value of all the buildings on the street or take the street with the single most expensive building? Saying which street is the most expensive is subjective and totally dependent on definition and method. That is why the list should be deleted.<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax%7EVobiscum_3a44.html" title="User:Pax:Vobiscum">Pax:Vobiscum</a> 22:47, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not really Wikipedia's problem, publications and research groups have put these studies out under their name, Wikipedia is really just organizing that information. If their methodology is suspect, people will question them... if people wrote articles questioning the studies, we could cite that. I admit it's a fine line, but researching this I found that <i>a lot</i> of articles are written about "expensive streets" (I had no idea) so I think there is a great deal of interest in this, and I think the information is verifiable. It isn't our job to make sure a source is true (within reason), we aren't investigative reporters. Wikipedia just looks for verifiability. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 23:02, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh yeah, I think this stance makes more sense when you consider I'd like to figure out some way to communicate that items on this list are merely <i>considered</i> the most expensive by our sources. Another subtle line, but an important one. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 23:06, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Very weak delete</b>: I am convinced by the "keep" argument because it is reported on by sources, but I am leaning towards "delete" because there are not very strict requirements for inclusion on the list. I may live on the most expensive street in a city in central Illinois, but I certainly wouldn't put that street on the list. I may be swayed to keep if the phrasing of the article is improved upon. Is there a certain amount of money a street must stay above to be included on the list? Are cities of a certain size only included on the list? It needs to define its criteria. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 01:36, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: a lot of the entries don't look correct, and the fact that they're largely unsourced make it worse. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderbunny_ebbf.html" title="User:Thunderbunny">Thunderbunny</a> 01:57, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> There are just too many big cities to make an accurate list on this topic. Not encyclopediac.--<a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 02:43, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Doesn't and shouldn't "expense" refer to the cost of renting or buying on those streets? Sources are potentially available to make this a good long list, probably meaning it would need to be broken up eventually. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:45, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Going from 0 referenced to 35 referenced within 4 days shows that the article can be improved significantly (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_most_expensive_streets_by_city&amp;diff=114404023&amp;oldid=114072087" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_most_expensive_streets_by_city&amp;diff=114404023&amp;oldid=114072087" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). Also, the nominator has withdrawn the nomination (albeit weakly). Lastly, whether researchers use different techniques is not a problem we have to fix: that would be original research. We simply report what's published. If there are (published) disagreements about various methods, we can discuss them. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 07:30, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
