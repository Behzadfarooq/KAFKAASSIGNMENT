<li>Gwernol: Did you check the talk page? If you did, maybe Lorboy was too slow between removing prod and adding a comment.

<li><b>I really don't know.</b> I found myself wondering about school a capella groups after I ran across one or two. I'm sure they're more notable than some of these forgettable punk bands that squeak past <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Hey, at least they're probably not on Wikipedia to sell albums. Also, are they any less notable than <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dingoes_Ate_My_Baby_12fc.html" title="Dingoes Ate My Baby">Dingoes Ate My Baby</a>? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiffenpoofs_fb72.html" title="The Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoofs</a> are certainly notable, but this is a singing group at a private high school. Unless they've been in existence for many, many years, or are otherwise notable (e.g., mainstream media coverage; cd sales) they don't appear to be greatly more notable than a high school club. I don't think a yearly album meets the standards of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and a single "tour" (which sounds more like the trip my high school French class took) is not enough. Having a member who went on to be a Whiffenpoof doesn't sway me; the Whiffenpoofs are a <i>very</i> large group of people who are otherwise mostly non-notable. I could be convinced by media coverage, evidence of cultural notability (the 'poofs were on West Wing, for example), or by other references supporting a claim to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or more generally to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 02:49, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Roughly on the same level as a high-school student club or team as far as notability goes. I'd hate to set a very dangerous precedent by keeping this due to the very thin Whiffenpoofs connection... if Madonna played in her school marching band, does that make that band notable too? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 03:09, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Student organizations that exist at only a single school are generally non-notable. Although <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiffenpoofs_fb72.html" title="The Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoofs</a> <i>are</i> notable, citing the fact that a member of this group went on to join the Whiffenpoofs as a claim that this group is notable would be an overly literal mis-application of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The Whiffs must have had hundreds of members in their history and the Whiffs' notability does not carry over to their individual members, much less to other musical groups those members had previously been in. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:19, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you are wrong here. The Whiffenpoofs is not a band with a settled line-up, it is a university choral society with a history going back nearly 100 years. It's a bit like saying that every single person who ever performed with the BBC Singers or the Huddersfield Choral Society is inherently notable, and by extension every single musical enterprise in which they subsequently participate is also notable. Another analogy: the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Footlights_136e.html" title="Cambridge Footlights">Cambridge Footlights</a> is notable for certain sure, and many of its former members are notable, but being a former member of the Footlights does <i>not</i> make for notability - look at the list of past members and you get an average of around one or two a year who become famous, which is an incredibly high hit rate for a university club but still way below 100%. How many genuinely famous former Whiffenpoofs are there? The article lists one: Cole Porter. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:20, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This is a school club. While <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> does say that connection with a notable band is a criterion for inclusion the full text reads: "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; <i>note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</i>" (emphasis added). Furthermore, the connection with a notable band criterion was intended for the former bands of famous musicians rather than high school clubs of people who join a group, which over the years has had hundreds on members. If Ethan Heard had been a member of The Beatles, then it might make sense to simply change this article into a redirect, but in the subject of this article is not even worthy enough for that. Ethan Heard is not even notable enough to have his own page, let alone a page for a club he belonged to in high school. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoIdeaNick_49e4.html" title="User:NoIdeaNick">NoIdeaNick</a> 10:50, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> From what I see, this article must be ruled per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines, and the band does not meet any of the exceptions there. Thus, the article should be deleted. However, a section of the article (or a shortened version of this article) could be included in a notable article that is not going to be deleted. Thus, even if you delete the repertoire and the alumni, the fact that the band is not notable according to Wikipedia still exists, and the article would be deleted (always if people consider, as me, that it is failing <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. What some suggest is that you merge the information from this article in another. Basically, the lead paragraph, plus mention to the notable performances would become a section of the <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidwell_Friends_School_be15.html" title="Sidwell Friends School">Sidwell Friends School</a>, probably named <i>Consensual Sound</i>. There is no need to include past or present repertoire. As for past and current members, I wouldn't include the names or may appear vanity. Note that, while there are only a couple of editors that worked in the Consensual Sound article, there have been well over a dozen in <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidwell_Friends_School_be15.html" title="Sidwell Friends School">Sidwell Friends School</a>. This is my "friendly" solution where the AFD is related to a notable one, but does not hold notability by itself. By putting this information into the notable article, the people who edits that article can decide whether the band (in this case, <i>Consensual Sound</i>) is notable enough to be part of the school article. If the people who usually edit the school believes <i>Consensual Sound</i> isn't notable enough, the information will be deleted (thus disappearing completely from Wikipedia). However, there is a chance that they may consider this information to be important, thus letting at least part of the deleted article be kept in another article. Hope that makes everything clear. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 04:05, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
