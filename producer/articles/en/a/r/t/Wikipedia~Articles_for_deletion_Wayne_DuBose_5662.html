<p>He is a notable pastor. He was pastor of the LARGEST Southern Baptist Church in LOUISIANA for fifteen years. We have many teachers, lawyers, and professors on Wikipedia who certainly have records no more impressing that Reverend DuBose. There are only about 15 Baptist ministers on the site. Are we setting a "higher requirement" for ministers than teachers, lawyers, and professors? I removed the "awards" from high school, as that line did seem to trivialize his accomplishments.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of a lawyer on Wikipedia, and I just pulled this name from random:</p>
<p>Steven Dennis Bell (born 11 February 1953 in Akron, Ohio) is a lawyer and mediator.</p>
<p>[edit] Biography Bell's parents are Samuel H. Bell and Joyce (Shaw) Bell. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1975 and from the University of Akron School of Law in 1979. He was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1979. He served as an Assistant Director of Law for the City of Akron (1980 - 1983) and as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio (1984 - 1988). He also served as a Special Assistant Attorney General for the State of Ohio (1992). In 2002 he became the managing partner of The Simon Law Firm, LLP in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p>How does this lawyer qualify for inclusion but not the pastor of the largest Baptist church in Louisiana? -- Billy Hathorn</p>

<dd>Hi, Billy. Thanks for coming by. I see you're a relatively new editor; you might want to look at <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a> and check out some of the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_Log_Today_bdcc.html" title="WP:AFD/Log/Today">other recent AfD discussions</a> for the format we use here, plus <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEditing_dd53.html" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a> for formatting tips. You're right that Steven D. Bell appears not to meet the criteria under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and I have proposed its deletion. I don't think there's any systemic bias here, but it's an interesting question.

<p>Here's another lawyer who is listed: Albert Bates From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Albert Bates (born 1947-01-01) is an influential figure in the intentional community and ecovillage movements. A lawyer, author and teacher, he has been director of the Institute for Appropriate Technology since 1984 and of the Ecovillage Training Center at The Farm in Summertown, Tennessee since 1994.</p>
<p>Bates has been a resident of The Farm since 1972. A former attorney, he argued environmental and civil rights cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and drafted a number of legislative Acts during a 26-year legal career. The holder of a number of design patents, Bates invented the concentrating photovoltaic arrays and solar-powered automobile displayed at the 1982 World's Fair. He served on the steering committee of Plenty International for 18 years, focussing on relief and development work with indigenous peoples, human rights and the environment.</p>
<p>Bates has played a major role in the ecovillage movement as one of the start-up members of the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN), and GEN's president of the Ecovillage Network of the Americas (from 1996 to 2004). In 1994 he founded the Ecovillage Training Center, a "whole systems immersion experience of ecovillage living."[1] He has taught courses in sustainable design, natural building, permaculture and technologies of the future to students from more than 50 nations.</p>

So what does this article on another lawyer have to offer that the article on Pastor DuBose lacks?

<dd>Hello again, Billy. I'm disappointed that you appear to have missed my previous reply. If you think another Wikipedia article doesn't meet our standards, you should follow <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">one of the approaches for deletion</a>. If you believe this article should be kept, you should help us see how it meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, or explain how you plan to make it meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Note that this isn't any sort of judgement about Wayne DuBose; I'm sure he's a fine fellow. Here we just decide if an article meets the appropriate standards. If you think the standard should be changed, I'd start with the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">appropriate talk page</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 20:34, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it may have been missed that Pastor DuBose was the pastor of the largest Southern Baptist congregation in LOUISIANA for a period of some 15 years. That alone should make him worthy of coverage. The church had over 6,000 members while he was the pastor there. -- Billy Hathorn</p>

<dd>Hi, Billy. No, I did notice that, and should have mentioned that. There are two issues I have. First, we'd need to be able to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> that from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Second, I'm not sure that's really enough: it doesn't obviously meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Per <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, that's not a deal-breaker for me, but I'm having trouble extracting some principle that we could insert into <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to make it better. Running the largest X of type Y in place Z doesn't seem particularly encyclopedic to me. Have his accomplishments been noted elsewhere? For example, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Warren_a87e.html" title="Rick Warren">Rick Warren</a> was recognized in Time, Newsweek, and US News and World Report. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 17:56, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This kind of information can go at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>, I believe, where they have different inclusion criteria.
