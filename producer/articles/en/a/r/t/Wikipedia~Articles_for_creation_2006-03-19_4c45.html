<p>Brazilian multi-artist (musician, designer, photographer and painter). He used to play in a Teen-Punk-Rock-Band called Psicopatas, victim of envy until today even being a broken up band, but the former artists prefer to say it's in a state of coma. They played in Abril Pro Rock, the biggest independent music festival in Brazil. Their music sounded as punk rock mixed with brazilian roots music, which resulted in a sudden fame around the whole country.</p>
<p>Diogo is also known by his non-patterned mood swings. It's incredible the way he turns a beast after being so sweet with someone. Friends say he's the best person that somebody can meet in a lifetime.</p>

<p>The Taliesin Line is a collection of textiles and wallpaper designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1955 Wright collaborated with F. Schumacher and Company to design the collection. Though Wright was often overly critical of wallpaper, Schumacher managed to convince Wright to break his prejudice so that the average American could have the benefit of Wright's design work in their home.</p>
<p>In recent years, F. Schumacher and Company has worked with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to develop a series of wall art under the Taliesin name depicting some of Wright's works, among them the Dana House in Springfield, Illinois; the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo; the Robie House in Chicago; and the Storer House in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Thomas Shepherd is one of the young avengers that vision had programmed in his young avengers failsafe. The current vision, used this program to lead the young avengers to juvie, where they freed him. His appearance is based off the avenger <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quicksilver.html" title="Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>.</p>

<p>Thomas is a speedster. There is no indication of how fast he is but we do assume that he is at least sub-sonic.</p>
<p>Another ability demostrated is his ability to make matter blow up by accerelating and disrupting atomic structures. He does this apparently by waving his arms and hands at superspeeds at the intended target or targets.</p>

<p>From what has been shown, he is just like quicksilver, in the fact that his speed makes him cocky. His time in juvie has made him somewhat bitter and almost borderline murderous, almost akin to quicksilver, who also had his moments of insanity. However, unlike quicksilver, he seems to be able to listen to reason. Undoubtly he will end up being the rebel of the group, which tends to be one of two traits exhibited by speedsters, the other, being cocky.</p>

<p>There is two ways of viewing his appearance. The first is when he is freed by vision, wiccan, and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stature.html" title="Stature">Stature</a>. [[[Wiccan]]] says that he looks exactly like him, this has led to speculation of his Thomas' white hair and his young quicksilver appearance or that he looks like Wiccan. The others imply this as well when they meet him, however, as they go on to fight Superskrull, Thomas asked, does he really look like him, referring to quicksilver.</p>
<p>There is speculation that he and Wiccan are the lost sons of Scarlet Witch and Vision.</p>

<p>Snake Eyes is a member of the Arashikage ninja clan. Snake Eyes had a sword-brother namded Storm Shadow. You may know Storm Shadow as Cobra's ninja master. But he wasn't always like that. Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow had a strong bond between each other. But somehow the Arashikage clan split into. I belive that it was Arashikage ninja master Sato had something to do with the separation.</p>
<p>When the clan split Snake Eyes took a different side than Storm Shadow. Thus causing them to be enemies. After taking seperate paths Snake Eyes joined the G.I. Joe team. He was thier ninja master. But one day on a mission Snake Eyes was flying a helicopter when something went wrong. The copter crashed leaving Snake Eyes with a burnt face from the crash. That is why Snake Eyes weares a mask over his head so no one could look at his face. Snake Eyes also wears something over his eyes blocking all of his vision. But Snake Eyes healed and became a great ninja master. Snake Eyes's hearing is phanominal. Even though he can't see he is still a great ninja warrior. Sake Eyes is a graet roll-model because he shows that anything is possible.</p>

<p>Stab lok electrical service equipment (circuit breaker box) has been associated with electrical arcing and resultant home fires. There have been allegations of fraudulent motivations in the devices having ever been "listed" and are effectively "delisted" or not recognized as suitable for the purpose for which they were designed. Which is keeping people and property safe in overcurrent situations. These things are in a lot of houses, and panel replacement is recommended.</p>

<p>Born Carmen Dufour in Geneva, Switzerland, she was raised in Iran and is of Swiss and Persian heritage.</p>
<p>Carmen was married to one of Osama bin Laden's older brothers, Yeslam bin Ladin, until 1988. They were married in 1974 in Saudi Arabia. She has three daughters, Wafah Dufour, Najia, and Noor.</p>
<p>Published in 2004, Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia is a personal account of her life as a Saudi Arabian wife &amp; mother, in addition to insights on what life is like in the bin Laden family and her relationship with them and her former husband. She claims that no matter how Westernized her ex-husband or other bin Laden family members may be, they still feel strong familial and religious ties and would financially support and shelter Osama bin Laden if necessary.</p>
<p>She also admits that while she had a difficult period of adjustment living in the strict Saudi Arabian society, she was not an average citizen, as the bin Laden's provided an amount of wealth and lifestyle considered privileged in that, and any, society; including posh accomodations, and luxuries like tennis courts, expensive cars, and large sums of money to frivously spend. This describes the amount of power and influence the bin Laden clan has obtained with business and government connections throughout the years.</p>
<p>After she was divorced in 1988, she was able to move to Geneva with her children and continue raising them there. Their father is uninvolved and uninterested in their lives, being quoted in the book as stating he wished he had sons, not daughters. Yeslam obtained a Swiss Passport for the purpose of pursuing a relationship with his children, but as of yet has not done so.</p>
<p>She altered the spelling of her last name in recent years to distance herself from the infamous Osama. In her book she writes that she had only seen Osama on two occasions and that they did not really speak. She emphasizes that the bin Laden family is a large one, and not all family members are directly associated with Osama.</p>

<p><b>Pay Off Your Mortgage in Two Years</b> is a television programme first aired on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC2_b023.html" title="BBC2">BBC2</a> in Early 2006.</p>
<p>Presented by business expert <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%C3%A9_Carayol_6c30.html" title="René Carayol">René Carayol</a>, the programme is an experiment that aims to find out if ordinary people in the United Kingdom can pay off their mortgage in two years.</p>
<p>Each of the approximately ten episodes aired weekly in 2006 focused on one family or individual, who at the time of filming had already been followed for twelve months, i.e. they were halfway through the experiment. In the follow-up series, expected to be aired in 2007, their experiences in the second year will be shown. The participants are from all ages and from all walks of life, including a couple nearing retirement, families with young children, a lesbian couple and a male ballet dancer.</p>
<p>Success in the experiment requires minimizing expenses as well as maximizing income. To achieve the former, participants sold off possessions, rented out their house or grew their own food, for example. In pursuit of the latter, they tried to develop various business initiatives, such as creating works of art, giving yoga or exercise classes, becoming a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff_Richard_d0cb.html" title="Cliff Richard">Cliff Richard</a> impersonator or buy and renovate houses. In some cases, leaving the "comfort zone" and persevering required hard-nosed presenter Carayol to, in his own words, "push them to their limits". One of the participants, a single woman, gave up and was replaced.</p>

<p>From 1793, the uniforms of the half-brigades of the line infantry wore the blue "National Uniforn" that was to be worn by all soldiers. However, for a long time, line infantry were a mix of the new blue coats worn by the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Guard_00e8.html" title="Imperial Guard">Imperial Guard</a> and the white uniforms of seasoned veterans. The blue dress was named the "National Uniform" and was worn by line infantry by 1796. While headgear and details in cut changed, the uniform remained almost completely the same from the beginning of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>The uniform was made of a blue coat, red piped white collar and cuffs, white piped red lapels, blue piped red cuff flaps and shoulder straps, white turnbacks piped red, and brass buttons. Only the brass buttons had the units identification number stamped on it. The lapels were fasten at the upper chest but sloped away below. The hat, a black felt <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicorne.html" title="Bicorne">bicorne</a>, was the standard infantry headress at some of Napoleon's greatest battles. In 1807, the hat was replaced with the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shako.html" title="Shako">shako</a>, which was made of black felt, chevron on the side and visor, a brass <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamond</a> shaped plate stamped with the Imperial <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle.html" title="Eagle">eagle</a> over the unit's regimental number, white cords, and brass chin scales.</p>
<p>Some units added pompons to the shako as well as plumes. Many units had pompoms with a houpette and the center generally colored white with the company number printed in black or red. The diamond shaped plate with the regimemtal was most common, but some units had the shape of an eagle or the rising sun.</p>
<p>In 1812, the cut of the coat was changed into a coatee that included short tails, a blue crowned N on the turnbacks, and the lapels fastened down to the waist and cut square. The waistcoat was made higher and was therefore not visible. The black gaiters came up to below the knees. The plate on the shako was now a crowned eagle over a semi-circle with the regimental number inscribed on it.</p>
<p>Infantrymen carried the M 277 <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musket.html" title="Musket">musket</a> that had a <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonet.html" title="Bayonet">bayonet</a> with a 406 mm blade. The black leather M. 1801 cartidge box held 35 rounds of ammunition and was carried by a white buff shoulder belt, that for <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fusilier.html" title="Fusilier">fusiliers</a>, had a frog for the bayonet. The cartridge box flap generally had a white linen cover and the forage cap was rolled under the box with red tassel hanging out. The M. 1801 knapsack was made of cow hide with two straps (later three straps) to hold the rolled greatcoat on the top.</p>

<p>Morbid Martian refers to two things;</p>
<p>Firstly, Morbid Martian is an internet web site and blog that has no specific purpose. It does three things, firstly it is a blog about anything that it's creater (James) finds interesting or has strong views about, secondly it is a games web site and thirdly it is the host for videos filmed by James and his friends. Such videos include "Prudence the Exploding Yoghurt Pot" and "Balazs Goes Hungry". The latter was named after the creator of "the mini blog" and is a sort of rival to James.</p>
<p><br />
Morbid Martian is also the internet alias of the site's creater, James, who has become a very small internet star from Northamptonshire in the UK, thanks to his site. James (according to his myspace page) is about 16 years old, has a distinct lack of personnal hygiene (possibly a joke shared between him and his friends) and no sense of urgency (he reports his main weakness as being too laid back). It is his views and ideas that he writes in the blog that is on the main page. From past blog entries (which he sometimes has affectionatly called "rants") it has been made very clear that James is very disapproving of Conservatives, George Bush, "Chavs", Children acting like they are 20 and a lack of common sense in every day life.</p>

<p>Colonel Jacob Klock's Regiment Second Tryon County Militia in the Revolution</p>
<p>Colonel Klock was a man who was respected in his day and is still in this day. He was not the ignorant dolt depicted by some but was an educated man, able to read and write and a leader in his day. He fought in wars, first in the French and Indian Wars (1748-1760) on the British side and then in the Revolutionary War. During the French and Indian Wars, many of the men learned some semblance of military training for later usage in the Revolutionary War. General Herkimer served under Colonel Klock in this war. When the time of the Border Wars or Revolutionary War came, the Colonel was an exempt; meaning because of his age he was not expected to serve. By the information we have on him, he was born in the very early 1700s and he was not a young man when war once more came to him. But the Colonel bravely stepped forward as did many of the exempts and protected the home front and farms while the more able bodied men went to fight elsewhere. Klock's Regiment fought in many of the local battles and skirmishes. They had a huge territory to watch over. I have immense respect for the Colonel and all the exempts who stayed and bravely fought for what was theirs. It could not have been easy to traipse over the countryside exposed to the elements at his time in life. Like so many Mohawk Valley families, he also saw the heartbreak of a Tory son and son-in-law. The record tells us the following about him personally: JACOB KLOCK (father, HENDRICK) was born October 08, 1708 in Stone Arabia, New York, and died May 09, 1798 in Montgomery Co., New York. He married (1) ELIZABETH BELLINGER, daughter of FREDRICK BELLINGER and ANNA FOX. She was born Abt. 1712, and died Bef. 1766. He married (2) CATHARINA NELLIS July 27, 1781, daughter of CHRISTIAN NELLIS and BARVALIS KLOCK. She was born December 23, 1723, and died August 20, 1805 in Montgomery Co., New York. Tryon County was a huge county, it covered the area from Albany County up to the Indian Territory. It was named after William Tryon, the Colonial Governor, a friend of Sir William Johnson. The Colonial Governor was so hated, as soon as the Revolutionary War ended, the name was changed to Montgomery County after Richard Montgomery the hero of the siege on Quebec. Klock's Regiment was one of the five Militia Regiments in Tryon County. The Militia was not the only organization recruiting men to fight in the war. There was also the Continental Line, the Rangers, New York Line, and the Levies. In 1772 Sir William Johnson divided Tryon County into five districts. The districts were as follows: Mohawk, the eastern portion east of "The Noses"; the Palatine district on the south side and occupying the same breadth on the north side, then extending south to the Pennsylvania line; the Kingsland district, that portion on the north side of the river west of the Palatine district and the German Flatts district which was on the south side of the river extending from Little Falls to Fort Stanwix and south to the Pennsylvania line. Jacob Klock served as the Colonel of the Palatine District of Militia and is said to have been in command of Fort Plank on the south side of the river in Minden in 1779 and 1780. During the Revolutionary War he lived on Lot 13 of the Harrison Patent. The Tryon County Committee apparently followed this general division at first. After the death of General Herkimer, who was in the Canajoharie district, the Kingsland and German Flatts Regiments were consolidated. A fifth Regiment was created which embraced Cherry Valley and the section adjacent under Colonel Harper. Roberts &amp; Mather (1898) in New York in the Revolution gives the Regiment commanding officers as follows:</p>
<p>First Regiment--Col. Samuel Campbell, Colonel Ebenezer Cox, Lt. Colonel Samuel Clyde. Second Regiment--Col. Jacob Klock, Lt. Colonel Peter Wagner. Third Regiment--Col. Frederick Fisher, Colonel Frederick Visscher, Lt. Colonel Volkert Veeder. Fourth Regiment--Col. Peter Bellinger. Fifth Regiment--Col. John Harper, Major Joseph Harper.</p>
<p>There were also separate divisions as Battalion of Minute Men under Colonel Samuel Clyde; Associated Exempts, Capt. Jelles Fonda and three organizations of Rangers under Capts. John Wynn, Christian Getman and John Kassellmann. The list of names is from state pay rolls sent in by Colonel Jacob Klock. It shows those in the Regiment before 1780 when the state government first began to function. Prior to that and especially at the Battle of Oriskany when the entire man power of the valley was under arms, there were no records because the battle was fought before there was a state government. The records of those engaged in that battle are from pension papers, private papers and family tradition. There are many repetitions in the names, and this is unavoidable. The nature of the service called for many short time services and consequent duplicate pay rolls. A man might serve in the Militia one year and in the Levies the next year, or even both in the same year. The carelessness of army clerks in recording names with the inability of the men to spell their own names often led to duplication of one individual. But on the other hand, the Palatines repeated the same names every generation and this gave us many men with the same name. It is a nightmare for genealogists to find twenty Moses Johnsons for instance! During the war there were three Major Foxes, all bearing nearly the same Christian name, two of them being named Christopher and one Christian. Three distinct and separate George Nellises fought and there seems to have been at least five Jacob Klocks, all separate individuals. As for Timmerman and Zimmerman, Crouse and Krouse, Failing and Phelan, Dillenbeck and Tillebagh -- well you see the problem!</p>
<p>THIS LIST IS FAR FROM A COMPLETE LISTING OF THE REGIMENT.</p>

<p>Grazeley is a small rural village set in Berkshire countryside. The villages of Mortimer, Burghfield, Spencers Wood &amp; Three Mile Cross are a short distance away. Grazeley has a small parochial primary school ([<a href="http://www.grazeley.wokingham.sch.uk/about.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grazeley.wokingham.sch.uk/about.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>]) , as well as a village hall (www.grazeleyvillagehall.org.uk). The village hall is the perfect venue for celebrations, business meetings, club activities and barn dances. The hall is 1550 ft² (140 m²) with a woodblock floor, a ceiling height of over 16ft (4.9m) and a full-sized badminton court layout.(Contact 0870 383 1820.)</p>
<p>The Wheatsheaf is the village's local pub, and the traditonal church also located in grazeley closed its doors for the last time in January 2006. There are some picturesque walks around this area, with the 'brook' running along side the village, and eventually into the Thames. See it for yourself!</p>

<p>The term Viral Video refers to video content which gains widespread popularity through the process of Internet sharing, typically through email messages and media sharing websites.</p>
<p>Viral videos are usually humorous in nature and may range from network televised comedy sketches such as <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a>'s <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazy_Sunday_8fe2.html" title="Lazy Sunday">Lazy Sunday</a> to unintentionally released amateur video clips like <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Kid_6b75.html" title="Star Wars Kid">Star Wars Kid</a>.</p>
<p>While the viral video phenomenon has occurred in a largely unstructured manner, a number of organizations have attempted to adopt marketing strategies that rely on the distribution of viral video, often with mixed success.</p>

<p>Filth were a seminal hardcore band who were mainstays of the Berkeley/Gilman Street scene during the late 80's and early 90's. Coupling fiery, screamed old-school style vocals with more laid back, sensible, and downright pop-punkish compositions, they quickly made a name for themselves within the East Bay punk community and eventually became one of its most well known bands. The group's short, but extremely influential, career saw them perform with such well known acts as Operation Ivy, Green Day, The Offspring, Tribe 8 and Link 80, among others.</p>
<p>Though they failed to record a full length before their somewhat premature 1991 breakup, the band did manage to record enough compilation and EP material (13 in all) to put out a split LP with yet another local group of beer-swilling, miscreant screamers: the psychedelia-tinged, lyrically twisted, coed hardcore outfit known as Blatz, with whom Filth had played most of their shows. The album, which came to be dubbed "The Shit Split", was initially released by Lookout Records in 1992, though in the mid-90s former members of the two bands decided to transfer the record's publishing rights to another label. Copies of the Shit Split, along with Filth's most popular EP "Live the Chaos", can now be bought via the Life is Abuse record company. Former members of Filth currently play/have played in the following bands: - Isocracy - The Vagrants - Pot Valiant - The Wynona Riders - Creeps on Candy - Dead and Gone - Fields of Shit - Dogma Mundista - Strychnine</p>

<p>Blatz was a punk band that came out of the Berkely scene in the late 1980's, early 1990's with bands like Green Day and Operation Ivy They never went on tour, and mostly played shows at 924 Gilman. Their songs were unique and different than most punk bands at the time. They named their band after Blatz Beer, which is one of the worst, cheapest beers in the U.S. - their slogan is "Blatz: Cheaper than the beer!"</p>
<p>The band was founded by Joey and Eggplant when they played a show with their highschool drinking buddy John Santos. Their next gig would be battle of the bands with Kamala &amp; the Karnivores, Surrogate Brains, and the Vagrants.</p>
<p>The following text is taken from the inside cover of Bitches n' Brew: "Blatz is Punk rock!! Nobody knew what the fuck would happen next. When we'd play, we were to flaky to plan stuff out. Our chaos wasn't a presentation, it was an accident. Some people said we were good. Fuck them! The highst form for praise we ever got was from this guy who drank this poison stuff in preperation for a BLATZ party so he could puke on us.</p>
<p>You're playing a show with two boyfreaks-one a veteran graveyard shift working DJ, wanting to figure out some BLATZ bass lines (WHY?). And the other waving 25 cents rags of protests, local gossip, overused art and misspellings at you every gig you play for two years. Then this silly, silly protest waving anarchist convention dropout whines and withers. Somehow, he's naked, punished with a new suit of cat food, cheap beer, spagetti o's and rotten eggs. And all he can do is spit at his torturers and tell 'em they suck. Jeer Jeer. Two chicks invade, hellbent on turning the whole freakshow into a Frank Sinatra lounge act. One is a Hula-dancing maniac, and the other a farm town escapee, loudmouthed and sporting a lovely cliffage. No, they don't all get together in a freaky love-foursome: you're at a BLATZ show.</p>
<p>I'm sure this band set out with big dreams and accomplishments. In a lot of ways, we did accomplish them, and extra squirmish fantasies to boot. Somhow, being young and naive made it possible to shoot for an impossible goal and still have fun. Who knows what things might get done not doing the original intent? Jumping into this band lent plenty of room for the unexpected. I guess all things should.</p>
<p>The members of Blatz were Annie Lalania-vocals Anna Joy-vocals Jesse Luscious aka: Jesse Blatz or Jesse Dangerous-vocals Marshall Stax-bass Robert Eggplant-guitars Joey Perales-drums</p>

<p>Mandore: 9 kms from Jodhpur is this ancient capital of Marwar with its gardens and rock terraces. Places to visit include the shrine of 330 million Gods, the hall of Heroes where sixteen huge figures are carved out of a single rock, and the royal cenotaphs.</p>
<p><br />
Mandor is an ancient regional capital just 9km north of Jodhpur. Rao Jodha moved the capital to Jodhpur in the 15th century, and by the 17th century Mandor had become a royal park which was dedicated to funerary memorials (cenotaphs) of the Jodhpur rulers.</p>
<p>In particular, the "temples" of Mandor, including those seen in this photo, are not temples per se. Rather, they are highly elaborated cenotaphs in temple form. They are Hindu (the religion of most of Rajasthan), and date from the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
<p>In this photo, The right cenotaph (mostly hidden behind a tree) belongs to Jaswant Singh, 1638 - 1678. The left cenotaph belongs to Ajit Singh, who died in 1763.</p>

<p>Deeply held attitudes and motivations are often not verbalized by respondents when questioned directly. Indeed, respondents may not even be aware that they hold these particular attitudes, or may feel that their motivations reflect badly on them. Projective techniques allow respondents to project their subjective or true opinions and beliefs onto other people or even objects. The respondent’s real feelings are then inferred from what s/he says about others.</p>
<p>Projective techniques are normally used during individual or small group interviews. They incorporate a number of different research methods. Among the most commonly used are:</p>
<p>Word association test Sentence completion test Thematic apperception test (TAT) Third-person techniques</p>
<p>While deceptively simple, projective techniques often require the expertise of a trained psychologist to help devise the tests and interpret them correctly.</p>

<p>The technique is to reverse the track so it plays backwards, then apply echo to the reversed track. Then reverse it again so that it plays forwards, and now the echo will be heard before the sound that made it. Jimmy Page is credited with this idea as it was first used on The Yardbirds song Ten Little Indians. Later Jimmy used this effect for the song You Shook Me(Led Zeppelin).</p>

<p>An accidental viewpoint occurs when two or more objects occur at a very unlikely position at the same unlikely position of viewing them that makes them appear to have a reality that is not their actual reality. For instance, four seperate square blocks dropping with a person viewing them from a frontal viewpoint could create the unlikely appearance that they make up a single square connected together if paused in time at just the right time. The unlikeliness of catching such a moment with such objects and our tendency to not just view objects from a single viewpoint often corrects the effect of an accidental viewpoint.</p>

<p>Howard Davis Jr. is a former United States Olympian. Davis won a gold medal in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada. Davis was part of a team that included four other gold medalists, Sugar Ray Leonard, brothers Michael and Leon Spinks, and Leo Randolph.</p>
<p>Davis would challenge for a professional title at lightweight and junior welterweight but did not win them. His fellow gold medalist teammates would all win professional championships. After unsuccesfully challenging IBF junior welterweight champion James 'Buddy' McGirt in a 1 round KO loss, Davis retired in 1988. He briefly attempted a comeback in 1995, but retired for good after a second round knockout loss to Dana Rosenblatt.</p>
<p>During his career, Davis was often rated as a top contender. He faced several luminaries of his era such as Vilomar Fernandez, Jim Watt, Edwin Rosario, Hector Camacho, Meldrick Taylor, McGirt, and Rosenblatt. His final record stands at 36 wins, 6 losses, and 1 draw, with 14 of his wins coming by knockouts.</p>
