<p><s>*<b>Strong Delete</b> unreferenced substub which has no business having a table of contents.

<dd>I've heard the term, too, but that doesn't mean it needs a wiki article.

But while we're on the subject of notability, how notable can a subject be when the top google hit is a free AOL member page?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>If you ask any atheist, wich i believe most people today are, they would say that even <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">god</a> is nonsense. Should we delete the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">god</a> article because of that? And anyone who is interested in paranormal, (wich you would agree to calling nonsense) would be highly interested in this subject. Please read <a href="http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa062298.htm" class="external text" title="http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa062298.htm" rel="nofollow">this article from about.com</a>, and visit <a href="http://paraphysics-research-institute.org/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://paraphysics-research-institute.org/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Paraphysics Research Institute</a> before you make any judgements. - openforbusiness</li>
<li><s>Delete</s>. The existence of organisations with 'paraphysics' in their name does not mean that their organisations and this term should be covered in an encyclopaedia. That requires <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> independent of those who coin the phrase in the first place, and so far all we have is the <a href="http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa062298.htm" class="external text" title="http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa062298.htm" rel="nofollow">About.com</a> link which doesn't actually mention the word 'paraphysics' anywhere.

<li><b>Reliable sources</b> we could always rename the article to paranormal vs. physics if that would make you feel better? Its all the same, and after all this is a pretty big area of science. Paraphysics has 18,800 hits on google, and here's <a href="http://members.aol.com/jebco1st/Paraphysics/issue1.htm" class="external text" title="http://members.aol.com/jebco1st/Paraphysics/issue1.htm" rel="nofollow">another interesting link</a>. The deletion of this page would be a great loss for paranormal research of any kind.. And if you by any chance should be interested in books, they have a pretty wide range of choises at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-8757432-5416866?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=paraphysics" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-8757432-5416866?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=paraphysics" rel="nofollow">amazon.com</a>.. 84 books to be excact. thank you. user:openforbusiness</li>
<li>Changing to <b>abstain</b>. I can't support deletion after the work Uncle G's done, but there still seem to be varying coinages of the word 'paraphysics' (which is, in the end, just someone adding the word 'para' to 'physics') and after reading the article I don't know why I should care about any of them; they all seem to be expounding pseudoscientific justification for varying degrees of New Age nonsense. I can't tell from the article whether any have any more importance than the others, and I'm confident that no-one is going to be able to do a better job of clarifying this than Uncle G, so I don't see this improving. (Though I can see it getting worse as POV-pushers get back to work on the article.) --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 20:27, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. First, reliable sources are everywhere: Amazon, Google, etc. Second, just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean that that subject should not be written about. Lets say that you don't believe in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. Does that mean nothing should be written about it? --<a href="../../../e/x/i/User%7EExir_Kamalabadi_3bc7.html" title="User:Exir Kamalabadi"><font color="steelblue">¿¡Exir</font></a> <a href="../../../e/x/i/User_talk%7EExir_Kamalabadi_e045.html" title="User talk:Exir Kamalabadi"><font color="royalblue">Kamalabadi!?</font></a> <b>03:32, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</b></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This isn't about who believes in what. The 'nonsense' comment in the prod referred, I think, to the content of the article, not to the subject. If I wrote a three line nonsense article about the queen of england, it'd still be nonsense, even if the subject was not. But the point is not that some people believe it's hooey, it's that there have been no reliable sources provided proving notability and verifying the article's statements. As I said above, the top google hit for the subject is an AOL member page. That's not what I call a reliable source. So, as I said, if anyone can make this article meet wikipedia policies before the AFD is up, providing verifiable sources, cleaning up the nonsense and making it something more than a dictionary definition, I'd be willing to reconsider my position. But if it isn't done in five days, it's not likely to happen once the AFD closes, so better to delete it and let whoever comes along next looking to write a <i>real</i> article start fresh than to let this unverifiable glorified link farm stay on wikipedia on the off chance that someone might replace it with a useful article. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 04:01, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>well if the first result that pops up in not a "reliable source", i would say at least 1 out og 18800 are pretty good ods. but i think what we need is an expert who can actually write something intelligent about this matter, and not just deleting it. cause i dont think that's gonna make it any better. then at least the next person who seeks to write something, will have a little something to start with, or, until he comes along people can have a little something to read, withouth having to google around for hours. - ofb
<ul>
<li>If you can find a reliable source on google that supports the text in this article, please do provide one. But saying 'there must be one somewhere' doesn't count. And if you think you can find someone who can write a sourced, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article on the subject that proves its <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, then please do. But leaving this one in place hoping that someone will find some reliable sources for it won't make anything any better, either.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is completely irrelevant whether "paraphysics" is rubbish or not. This is a well known topic and deserves an article. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">McKay</a> 13:23, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This term has been in use for decades and I personally own several copies of the <i>Journal of Paraphysics</i>, the earliest of which dates back to the 70's. - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 15:46, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There's no reason to cover parapsychology and not one of its sub-categories. Surely Wikipedia doesn't have to be exactly the same as other encyclopedias, which might edit out an article like this merely on the grounds that they don't want the expense of printing it, or it's merely a branch of another field. It is informative. But put the definition first, not the non-definition. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinphi_62e0.html" title="User:Martinphi">Martinphi</a> 21:00, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I'm late to the party, I see, but the rewrite is a huge improvement. Only a 'weak' because I still can't sort out exactly how widely used the sense of the term described in the article is. And if the phrase 'quantum magick' finds its way back into the article, it had better bring a credible source with it.&#160;;) -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 05:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very weak keep</b>. Barely passing through for me. The article itself is a tad away from utter incohorence, and could do with a complete paraphrase/rewrite. However, despite the murkiness of the content, it presents to be a notable and verified topic. - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESpLoT_0684.html" title="User:SpLoT"><b><font color="orange">SpLoT</font></b></a> / <sup>(<a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESpLoT_ad35.html" title="User talk:SpLoT">talk</a>)</sup> 11:54, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
