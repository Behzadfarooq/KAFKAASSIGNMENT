<dd>Uniforms (costumes) in star trek universe developed over time along with rank insignias.</dd>
<dd>The change is visible on the show itself so original research is not an issue. There was significant change in uniforms with first two movies and later in tng. Even branch colors changed. The uniforms of the 29th century stafleet (as portrayed on voyager) were nothing like the ones used on the TNG enterprise.. yada yada yada...</dd>

<dd>Actually, original research <i>is</i> an issue. As things stand, the only sources cited by this article are simple galleries on a web site of pictures of Starfleet uniforms (not even actual screenshots from the shows, note), sans any descriptive text at all and sans anything that supports statements such as "Skirts were authorized for women, however, these were optional and uncommon." made by this article. This article should cite far better sources, to indicate that this isn't a novel synthesis and analysis of pictures of Starfleet uniforms.

<dd>Hmmm.... Uniforms' colors and shapes are visible on the show. Picard does wear red unlike Kirk who wore yellow. In TNG yellow is the engineering &amp; security divisions color. Skirts appeared very rarely on non TOS era series such as TNG or even on Voyager. Actual screenshots are visible throughout wikipedias character articles. I am not certain how to present screenshot info on the article since just in TNG there are like four different uniforms... (duty, dress, etc...)

<dd><b>Comment</b>, I think you misunderstand the concept of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a>. Yes the Uniforms' colors and shapes are visible on the show (and in the galleries you've linked)... but by creating an article describing these uniforms based on the pictures, you are performing an act of original research and is explicitly refered to in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy <i>"Pictures are generally used for illustration and do not propose unpublished ideas or arguments..."</i>). My deletion reasoning stands as this is still original research and still has no sources that describe these uniforms.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:35, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We could argue about this all day... but I again point you to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>; writing an article based on screen appearances of the uniforms is original research... It's not a primary source.

<dd>Article does need better citation (just like all articles), I am not arguing about that. But original research means that I and other contributor(s) are making it all up which isn't the case. Furhermore tha article has only been around for like a day so I do not think it is prudent to expect proper citation.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, Again, I think you misunderstand the concept of original research as it relates to Wikipedia. Original research does not mean "made up". It means that contributors have crafted an article that is not based on external sources... it is in fact based on their <i>own research</i> into a topic. If you can find an external website that describes these uniforms in detail, this would be a perfectly acceptible article, but as it stands, basing these descriptions off of images or viewing the show is expressly prohibited by the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> policy. Furthermore, I don't agree with your contention that we cannont expect proper citation because the article has only been around for a day. The article should have never been created <i>without</i> proper citation. I speak only for myself here, but I'm not a fan of the concept of letting an article sit out in the main space unsourced while we let the creators try to find sources that they should have been using to create the article. That is what we have sandboxes for.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:27, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> I didn't order anyone off Wikipedia, and "incivil" isn't a word; at least not in English. I suggested that you can take this information to a more appropriate venue - Memory Alpha. Don't take it personally, and don't act like this is some fight between you and me. Do you honestly not understand the difference between US military ranks and Starfleet Uniforms? Are you telling me they're equally encyclopedic? I don't even know what "the creators of the who have said that 'sex appeal' on TOS was an important factor" is supposed to mean.

<dd>I do not contribute to other wikis aside from wikipedia with the exeption of our sister sites such as wikimedia commons. I hence do not care what happens to memory alpha. Please do not suggest "move" to non-foundation operated sites in the future, at least to me.</dd>
<dd>Of course there are differences between starfleet ranks and US naval ranks however they are fundementaly simmilar. The starfleet ranks were derived from the US mil ranks which I believe were derived from british ranks. Notability is a binary concept on wikipedia. Something is either encyclopedic or it isnt. Suggesting that a topic is superior to another is a breach of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>..</dd>
<dd>The approach to costumes on TOS and TNG were significantly different. Picard was bald for instance. "sex apeal" returned with seven of nine and later t'pol. This is only one of the interesting issues that shaped star trek costumes on different serries which can be covered on this article.</dd>

There are equivalant volumes for other Star Treks: certainly for TNG and DS9, and apparently there is a "Making of Star Trek: the Motion Picture" thingy. A regular monthly Star Trek magazine has published in the United Kingdom since 1995, and features many many interviews.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, now we are getting somewhere. I'm not familiar with these books offhand, but if they contain an actual discription of the uniforms, that would be a source, they could be referenced in a bibliography (meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), and this article would no longer be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. I suggest adding these sources to the article (and any others you are aware of), using reference tags to show which uniform descriptions are based on sources as opposed to original research... when I get a chance this weekend I will look into those you've listed. I'm not concerned with the quality of the article (it can always be tagged for cleanup) just that it meets the big 2 policies of verification and no original research.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:42, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>morwen I am sorry but almost all of the books are considered semi-cannon including that one. Often certain "facts" about the series conflict in such books such as in rank insignias. They can be used as sources but the Screen appearances is the only accepeted cannon and is fundemenntaly superior to all sources. Its really obvious what color is picards uniform. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 17:19, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please spare me this 'canon' blithering. Where is the canon that "Chief Medical Officers typically wore a blue overcoat in addition?" If I remember correctly we have one datapoint here: Beverley Crusher. I can't remember if Pulaski wore one. In any case, that sentence is entirely speculation. "Skirts were authorized for women" is another speculative sentence&#160;: all we could fairly say from observation is that "skirts were seen worn by both men and women in season 1, but rarely appeared after this".

<dd>No it isn't. The TV show is the primary source. Not everything that appears on a show is avalible in written media as copyrights for one prohibit it.

<dd>You obviously have no experience in academia. Original research is the creation of a secondary source from primary sources. Primary sources include letters, journals, newspapers, and television shows. Orignial research is what forms the basis for the majority of mongraphs and journal articles and the like on a variety of topics. An encyclopedia article, on the other hand, is drawn primarily from secondary sources. There is nothing wrong, to be sure, with using primary sources to further inform an existing article, but the basis of that article should be information that has already been synthezised in a secondary source. This article comes entirely from watching the television show and reporting what the article creator observed. It is factual and verifiable, but it is still an original work of scholarship that therefore violates policy. When someone writes a book or journal article or research paper on Star Trek uniforms, then it will fulfill the requirement of no original research. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 18:08, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The uniforms of Star Trek characters do not meet Wikipedia's notability criteria. Star Trek does; that's not what I'm disputing. Sources showing the uniforms aren't sufficient to establish it. The question here is: "What is significantly notable about the costumes used in Star Trek?" Changing color and design over a period of decades is no big deal. What sets this apart from costuming in other productions? We need reliable sources commenting on this topic first. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 16:22, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I think you are still misunderstanding. An appropriate reference source for an article about the costumes in a television show is <i>an article about the costumes in the television show</i>.

<dd>Just watch the show and then dispute anything presented and I am cool with that. Currently you are requiring sources (for stuff that should be common knowlege for anyone watching the show) without disputing anything which is strange to say the least...

<dd>Please stop setting up <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw men</a>. If the article said "Captain Picard wore a red uniform", you're right; that would be allowed. But 1) the article does not say that—it generalizes to say that all command officers wore red; and 2) it's not encyclopedic without some kind of analysis of how the uniforms changed and why. Perhaps add some commentary on how the various uniforms were criticized or lauded -- but make sure someone else said it, and you reference <i>his</i> (or her) analysis. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 18:10, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes all command officers wore red. Engineering and security people wore gold. Science officers wore teal/gren/blue (whetever you want to call it). Are you disputing that? Just provide one instance of a command officer not wearing red (including admirals).</dd>
<dd>Why did uniforms changed? Now that will require some sort of citation, and for my delight bbcs interview with the uniform designer gives me that.</dd>
<dd>Division colors are common knowlege for anyone watching the show. If you are going to dispute anything, do so on the article talk page and argue your reasoning. Or else do not waiste my time. Lots of details can be aquired directly from the show. Also on the DS9 episode with tribbles division colors explicitly mentioned.</dd>
