<li><b>Comment</b>. I think an article with this title could exist, but it seems that this material is already covered in many other places. I don't think it should redirect to Homophobia, and I don't think Homophobia should redirect here. The current article is poorly written, very POV, and uncited. In its current form I see little worth keeping. If it were a well researched and cited article on opposition to homosexuality, it would not be found offensive by LGBT activists (or by fundamentalists). That is not the case now. As much as I personnally find the discussion about opposition to homosexuality to be offensive, I could imagine benefitting from reading a well written article that outlines the position in an NPOV way. This would require making statements that only cite the postions of others. Thus, there would be aritcles on both <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_homosexuality.html" title="Opposition to homosexuality">opposition to homosexuality</a> and they would reference each other as articles about two different points of view on the same or similar phenomena. This is similar to how there is the article <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> and an article on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supremacism.html" title="Supremacism">supremacism</a>. The point of Wikipedia is to educate, and not to settle debates. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 08:15, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> We are not editors of a dictionary, but editors of an encylopedia. It is not up to us to redefine words because some people find them more or less POV.

<li><b>Delete.</b> This article, as it stands now, is a soap-box piece, with an alterior motive (see <a href="../../../o/p/p/Talk%7EOpposition_to_homosexuality_8081.html#Offer" title="Talk:Opposition to homosexuality">the article's talk page</a>). If any of this information can be referenced and presented in a NPOV manner, then I'm sure some of it would be fitting to add to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">Homophobia</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a useless search term - who would ever look it up? - and is covered on other pages.

<dd>The entire article, not a passage of it, is tagged as POV: that's a clue. It's also tagged as unbalanced. Provide alternaitve views (for every quote given, most likely someone will have disputed it.) In all honesty, is it worth it? It's still going to contain a large chunk of original research and there seems a very good chance that it'll be wiped for many of the reasons listed by others above. If I were in your shoes, I'd probably be thinking 'stuff it, life is too short' - but I'm a lazy sod and happy to let our gay friends live in peace, so I guess we're unlikely to agree. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainGuy_eda5.html" title="User:BrainGuy">BrainGuy</a> 19:29, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This article needs a lot of work, but to call all opposition to homosexuality "homophobia" is overly simplistic. Since the root of homophobia is phobia or fear, it assumes that those who oppose homosexuality do it out of fear, as opposed to those who do it out of intellectual or religious argument, or out of a concern/love for those whom they feel are doing themselves a disservice or hurting themselves by continuing down that path. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidBailey_c503.html" title="User:DavidBailey">DavidBailey</a> 19:35, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> And this "concern/love" comes from you being <i>afraid</i> of what will happen to them if they "continue down that path", no? How is this any different? Being against someone who identifies as homosexual, or being against homosexuality in general, is <b>homophobia</b>. Sure, it's not a simple issue, and no one is trying to say that it should be. But adding an article that details a particular POV is not the answer. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin"><i>rom</i></a><font color="green"><i><b>a</b></i></font><a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin"><i>rin</i></a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/m/User_talk%7ERomarin_fbee.html" title="User talk:Romarin">[<i>talk</i> ]</a></small> 20:05, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your statement "being afraid" is inaccurate. It may be inconceivable to you that people oppose homosexuality on intellectual, moral, or ethical grounds, but it is true. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidBailey_c503.html" title="User:DavidBailey">DavidBailey</a> 20:06, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right, it is completely inconceivable to me that a human being can oppose another human being for something as personal as sexual orientation. But this isn't the subject at hand.

It can also mean hatred of and disparagement of homosexual people, their lifestyles, their sexual behaviors, or cultures, and is generally used to assert bigotry.</i> Given that definition, it's not the appropriate place to put opposition to homosexuality. The reverse, however, is workable; "homophobia" could be a section in "opposition to homosexuality". --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 20:14, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(edit conflict) It just seems by doing that we would be softening up the term Homophobia, also, I think a note in Homophobia about a person having a consious choice.
