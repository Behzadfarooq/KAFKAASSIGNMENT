<p>Eau de Quinine was a very popular gentlemen's hair tonic, either in pure form or mixed with oil and is still in use although to a limited market. It is believed to be good for the scalp, to give a gloss to hair and to prevent hair loss. It gives a fresh, clean feel to the scalp and has a pleasant perfume. It is still marketed, principally by suppliers to traditional genetlemen's hairdressers. The British Pharmaceutical Codex publishes a prescription for its preparation</p>

<p>Boris Cabrera, who played Marco on TV, likes to make people laugh too. He grew up big and strong in Inglewood, CA, and stayed healthy by playing lots of sports: soccer, football, baseball, wrestling, and even competitive ping pong! But unlike Marco, an only child being raised by his single dad, Boris had the whole Cabrera clan to keep him company - mom, dad, and brother Arturo. With Boris entertaining them, we think the Cabrera family definitely got their daily dose of laughter!</p>

<p>"If we take the magnitude of the injustice done to the Palestinians by the state of Israel, there is a basis for comparison with apartheid," said the former Israeli ambassador to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, Alon Liel. "If we take the magnitude of suffering, we are in the same league. Of course apartheid was a very different philosophy from what we do, most of which stems from security considerations. But from the point of view of outcome, we are in the same league." <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1703244,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1703244,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1703244,00.html</a></p>

<p>Websites such as Anti-war.com and Jews sans frontiers claim that Zionism, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians is discriminatory and a form of apartheid, and refer to it as an Apartheid state.<a href="http://www.antiwar.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antiwar.com/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="http://jewssansfrontieres.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://jewssansfrontieres.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Israel did not become an apartheid state with the occupation, it became an apartheid state when it was established as a state that grants superior rights to Jews from anywhere than it does for non-Jews who come from there. To take the view that Israel's system of legally enforced race discrination is not apartheid is to mistake apartheid for minority rule. A system of law that grants privileges to one ethno-religious group over others is an apartheid system. But to ignore the fact that the Palestinians are a minority under Israeli rule thanks to the zionist movement's ethnic cleansing of most Palestinians from their land is a working definition of chutzpah. I should point out here that Moshe Machover (www.kibush.org.il) has said that calling Israel an apartheid state is dangerous because it underestimates Israel's capacity and desire for ethnic cleansing. But anyway,</p>

<p>The Israeli West Bank barrier is often referred to by critics as the "Apartheid wall".</p>
<p>"The village of Mas'ha is adjacent to the Israeli settlement of Elkana, about 7km away from the green line. On April 2003, Israeli bulldozers started to separate Mas'ha by an 8m high concrete wall from its only remaining source of livelihood: agricultural land, mostly olive trees. 98% of the lands of Mas'ha will be placed on the Israeli side of the fence. The fence also disconnects the road from Jenin to Ramallah, a segment of which will now be in the Israeli side of the fence." <a href="http://antiwar.com/hacohen/?articleid=668" class="external free" title="http://antiwar.com/hacohen/?articleid=668" rel="nofollow">http://antiwar.com/hacohen/?articleid=668</a></p>
<p>The Israeli human rights organisation B'Tslem also criticises Israel for apartheid activities.</p>
<p>"Israel has established in the Occupied Territories a separation cum discrimination regime, in which it maintains two systems of laws, and a person’s rights are based on his or her national origin. This regime is the only of its kind in the world, and brings to mind dark regimes of the past, such as the Apartheid regime in South Africa." <a href="http://www.btselem.org/english/settlements/index.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.btselem.org/english/settlements/index.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch express concern over human rights within Israel. From Human Rights Watch: "Government-run Arab schools are a world apart from government-run Jewish schools. In virtually every respect, Palestinian Arab children get an education inferior to that of Jewish children, and their relatively poor performance in school reflects this." <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/12/05/isrlpa3399.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/12/05/isrlpa3399.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>From Amnesty International: "Certain abuses committed by the Israeli army constituted crimes against humanity and war crimes, including unlawful killings; extensive and wanton destruction of property; obstruction of medical assistance and targeting of medical personnel; torture; and the use of Palestinians as “human shields”" <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/isr-summary-eng" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/isr-summary-eng" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>"In August the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called for the revocation of the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, passed the previous year and extended for six months in July. The law institutionalized racial discrimination. It barred Israeli Arab citizens married to Palestinians from the Occupied Territories from living with their spouses in Israel, and forced families to either live apart or leave the country altogether." <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/isr-summary-eng" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/isr-summary-eng" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>"But South African apartheid was more than just separation. "Apartheid was all about land," says John Dugard, the South African lawyer and UN human rights monitor. "Apartheid was about keeping the best parts of the country for the whites and sending the blacks to the least habitable, least desirable parts of the country. And one sees that all the time here [in the occupied territories], particularly with the wall, now, which is really a land grab. One sees Palestinians dispossessed of their homes by bulldozers. One can draw certain parallels with respect to South Africa that, during the heyday of apartheid, population relocation did result in destruction of property, but not on the same scale as the devastation in Gaza in particular, [or in] the West Bank."" [<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1704036,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1704036,00.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>]</p>
<p>"Israel's Population Registry Act serves a similar purpose by distinguishing between nationality and citizenship. Arabs and Jews alike can be citizens, but each is assigned a separate "nationality" marked on identity cards (either spelled out or, more recently, in a numeric code), in effect determining where they are permitted to live, access to some government welfare programmes, and how they are likely to be treated by civil servants and policemen.</p>
<p>"Ask Israelis why it is necessary to identify a citizen as a Jew or Arab on the card and the question is generally met with incomprehension: how can it be a Jewish state if we don't know who the Jews are? The justification often follows that everyone in Israel is equal, so it does no harm. Arab Israelis will tell you differently." <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1703244,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1703244,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1703244,00.html</a></p>

<p>Action For Justice (AxJ) Accion por la Justicia (www.accionporlajusticia.com) is the world's first political party founded by divorced parents in Spain to protect children's rights. It's website has been recently criticized and Spanish Judges have attempted to close it down, thereby violating among other fundamental rights, free speech, freedom of the press, freedom to organise, etc. The political party AxJ is presently calling for elections in Spain to remove the present government which it considers biased, discriminatory against men, and corrupt and voting to reform the Spanish legal system and make Spanish Judges acountable to trial by Jury. Recent polls show that AxJ has very good possibilities of reaching power in the year 2006 due to social unrest in Spain. All documentation can be found on the party's website: www.accionporlajusticia.com</p>

<p>Unit factor analysis, also known as the “conversion system” among other identifiers, is a system of developing solutions to many elementary and complex problems in science and mathematics. It is based on the fact that from any algebraic statement of equality, such as 2.54cm = 1 inch can be obtained two multipliers, or factors, who’s value is one (1). For example:</p>
<p>Dividing each side of the above statement of equality by 2.54cm the expression</p>
<dl>
<dd>2.54 cm = 1 inch</dd>
<dd>2.54 cm 2.54 cm</dd>
</dl>
<p>From which we obtain the factor that equals one (1) (1 inch/2.54 cm). If we divide both sides of the equation by 1 inch, we obtain the unit factor (2.54 cm/1 inch). An example of the usefulness of the system is that it enables one to organize a problem in a consistent manner that is easy to compute with a calculator and each step is suggested by the previous step e.g. What is the price of gasoline in Euros per liter (excluding taxes), if the price is $2.50 per gallon? We probably know many of the, so called, conversion factors, and if we do not know them or if they have constantly changing value, as does Euros/Dollar, we can easily look them up. Start with what is given or known</p>
<p>($2.50/gallon) X (1 gallon/4 quarts) X (1.06 quart/ 1 liter) X ( 1 Euro/ $1.18) = 0.56 Euro per liter.</p>

<p>86.132.120.23 21:58, 9 February 2006 (UTC) Classic Black UK gospel albums: ‘Paradise’</p>
<p><br />
Group: Paradise Album: Paradise Year of production: 1980 Label: Pilgrim records (Ebony).</p>
<p><br />
This now very rare and collectable Paradise album with its amazing hand painted bird of paradise cover illustration was produced in 1980.The 9 song gospel LP was created under the record label Ebony records, a sub-label of Pilgrim records. Ebony was a project initially set up to incorporate select up and coming black UK gospel acts at the time and included a talented 16 year old Levine Hudson within its camp.</p>
<p>Paradise Band members consisted of Junior Edwards (Bass), Bobby Clarke (Drums), Raymond Dennis (Guitars/keyboards), Philip Edwards (Keyboards), Doug Williams (Lead Vocals), Devon Burke and Karl Edwards (Percussion).The album recordings also included a horn section and contribution from backing vocalists (Echoes of Joy).</p>
<p>Paradise, previously known as the Reapers included gifted musicians from a variety of black church backgrounds. The enthusiastic young men saw the band as an opportunity to develop their craft and express themselves which they did with extraordinary ability and determination.</p>
<p>The album was produced by manager of the group Mike Martin and all songs were written and arranged by the band members with major songwriting contributions from the lead vocalist Doug Williams. All the lyrics throughout contained a strong down to earth evangelical messages aimed mainly at the youth of the day. Reggae track, Light of the World, caused much controversy within the churches, mainly because of the music’s association with Rastafarianism.</p>
<p>The album contents were a skilful mix of contemporary reggae, funk and soulful ballads, all of which reflected the secular musical influences of the day such as Earth Wind and Fire, Bob Marley and the Wailers and a rapidly developing Brit-funk scene. Other songs were the very funky spread the word with a rock guitar rift opening and the very smooth ballad with you.</p>
<p>The recordings produced a divided response amongst the conservative black church establishment. Staunch traditionalists viewed the musical style as too secular and labelled it the ‘devils music’. Young listeners on the other hand saw the band as progressive, and exciting.</p>
<p>The album however had cross-over appeal and attracted the attention of both black and white Christian fans. On the road, Paradise played in a number of youth establishments around London, and attracted a huge army of fans who saw them play on TV, greenbelt and offer support for gospel music giant Andrae Crouch during his 1981 national UK tour.</p>
<p>Almost 3 decades later Paradise is now a rare classic gospel album and exchanges hands in both the UK and overseas for hundreds of pounds on the specialist collectors market. After a number of changes to the original line-up including a change of musical direction Paradise went on to produce two more albums and 4 singles before finally disbanding in 1986 ■</p>

<p>When the <a href="../../../t/a/y/Taylor_Grazing_Act_facf.html" title="Taylor Grazing Act">Taylor Grazing Act</a> was passed in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress.html" title="Congress">Congress</a>, they also created an office under the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_the_Interior_ecc0.html" title="Department of the Interior">Department of the Interior</a> to manage the act. It was first called the <b>Division of Grazing</b>, but later was renamed the U.S. Grazing Service in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>. Its responsibilities were to enforce the act, which leased public lands to farmers and ranchers for grazing.</p>
<p>The Grazing Service encountered multiple problems, such as very low fees to lease land, which could not be raised due to opposition from <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmer.html" title="Farmer">farmers</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budget.html" title="Budget">budget</a> reductions enacted by Congress, or unlawful use of the lands. Hoping to better control improper use of the lands, the Grazing Service moved its <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headquarter.html" title="Headquarter">headquarters</a> from <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_City_6042.html" title="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a>.</p>

<p>The BLM retained control of its laws until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>.

<p>The decisive moment is a philosophy in photography or "street photography" created by the father of photojournalism, Henri Cartier Bresson. He has written a book named after this theory.</p>
<p>The decisive moment is a moment at which elements for a great photograph come together, allowing for a photographer to capture that richness forever. It can also be described as a moment at which something rare happens in front of a camera, allowing that photographer to take a capture of it. For Bresson, the decisive moment required a spiritual connection with the world. He is considered the master of this technique.</p>

<p>Safat is the most curious brid of all in Greek mythology. She is supposed to spend all her time flying and never comes to rest. As she soars, usually high, she lays her eggs which hatch while they are falling through the air. Only the shells reach the ground, and if part of a shell is eaten by an animal, the animal will go mad.</p>

<p>Singapore four incineration plants - Ulu Pandan, Tuas, Senoko and Tuas South - burn most of the country's solid waste, the resultant ash of which is then shipped to <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semakau_Landfill_fdcb.html" title="Semakau Landfill">Semakau Landfill</a>, the country's offshore, last remaining landfill. All gases produced by the plant are passed through a series of filters before being released into the air. The process of incineration also creates energy, which is sold on the open market. The plants form a cornerstone of a waste disposal system created to save space in the island nation.</p>
<p>Construction by a private sector company will soon begin on a fifth plant, in the first Design, Build, Own and Operate tender awarded by the National Environment Agency, which manages the four incineration plants and Semakau Landfill.</p>

<p>Pooyan tabatabaei is a founder of New Vision Photo Company in Canada – 2003 He is a photojournalist.</p>
<p>Pooyan says: Like many photographers of my generation, I don't have any formal education in photography; Using the camera as an instrument that one can work with alone, I started to adopt photography as a way not only of keeping a journal of my life but as a companion in my travels. Most of the time I start my projects just as an excuse to visit places that I don't know and learn about things that I like.</p>
<p>My working style is deliberate and very disciplined. I push myself to the extreme and give everything I have, but I also let the project decide when it is enough, when it is time to stop. My first exposure to photojournalism was seeing Political essays in the daily newspapers in Iran during the political campaigns leading to the presidential election in early 1997. I guess that's where I got my love of the picture story format. My first interest has always been picture stories Travel and Politic -- being able to delve into people's lives has always fascinated me -- a license to be a voyeur, so to speak. I simply try to show how people live their lives while facing the challenges daily living brings -- and to leave people with their dignity in the finished piece. I continuously strive to mirror the reality of life in my work. I wouldn't say that my photography is going to change the world, make it a better place or is in pursuit of any lofty ideal. I don't take pictures because I have a "spiritual mission". I do it because it is what I love most in my life.</p>
<p>Time moves fast. Through the years, I have documented the lives of many incredible and unique people of different cultures, religions, beliefs and value systems. In reflecting the true image of the subjects, my photographs aim to capture the essence of the person in a way that I hope will impact the lives of the people who see my photographs as much as the subjects impacted mine. I am the kind of a photographer that travels all over the world to take images of cities, people, traditional lifestyles, ancient sites and tropical islands. My photographs are a documentary of my life and experiences. Seeing the world through the camera lens is a liberating experience for me that helps me catalogue and savour reality and share my experiences with others. When I am not traveling, I live in Markham , Ontario - a nice town just north of Toronto . Michael Treola says: Photojournalism has been a journey into the unknown, each day a different crusade with no two days ever the same. I consider myself part of a lucky few who's privileged to document your slice of life, with all the good, the bad and interesting it has to offer. Even with the long days, stress to make a good photo, and to deliver it on deadline, I still love my job and wouldn't change it for anything in the world. It is something I plan on doing for a very long time. Below is how I came to this part of my life.</p>

<p>PODZ is a game where the creatures can be upgraded. Each creature has two upgrades, one weapon, one armour (these come in the form of an overlay), when these are put over the collector cards they not only change the look of the creature but also its ratings around the outside, these ratings can go up as well as down. The website also gives further games (other than the basic one) that can be played with PODZ.

<p>The idea of Kleindeutch is the stems from the mid 19th ventury in which the German nationalists wanted to unify Germany into a nation of only the western and central German states, trying to include as few Cathoic States as possible to maintain a Protestant dominance. This is in contrast to the other idea for a greater Germany in which all Germans would be included called Grossdeutsch. Prussia a Protestant nation was a main supporter of the Kleindeutsch ideology.</p>

<p><b>Grahame Ginn</b> was born in Brisbane (September <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>). His significant professional contributions have been to Australian education, particularly the establishment of Fraser Coast Anglican College, in <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hervey_Bay%2C_Queensland_e82f.html" title="Hervey Bay, Queensland">Hervey Bay</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.</p>
<p>He was born into an Army family not long after the finish of the 2nd World War. Living the somewhat typical life of an Army child (moving every 12 – 24 months) he completed his school education at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newington_College_17c1.html" title="Newington College">Newington College</a> in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>. He then attended the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Sydney_fa65.html" title="University of Sydney">University of Sydney</a> to graduate in a Science degree majoring in Physics and Chemistry.</p>
<p>After a brief time working in industry he decided to try teaching and gained his Diploma in Education at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_New_England_c127.html" title="University of New England">University of New England</a>, followed by a Master’s Degree of Education at the same University.</p>
<p>His first school appointment was at the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cranbrook_School_fc4e.html" title="Cranbrook School">Cranbrook School</a> (<a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> boys school) where he taught his major subjects, was an Assistant Boarding House Master, became an Army Officer of Cadets and coached <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby.html" title="Rugby">Rugby</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">Cricket</a>.</p>
<p>Two years later he moved to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scots_College_3a1f.html" title="The Scots College">The Scots College</a> also in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, taught his major subjects, coached his <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> and rugby teams, became more involved with the military life of the Army cadets (became a <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a>) and was invited to co-lead a party of Army navy and Air Force Cadets across the <a href="../../../k/o/k/Kokoda_Track_e80f.html" title="Kokoda Track">Kokoda Track</a>. He was also permitted to indulge his motor-racing passion, by becoming accredited as a driver trainer and then an advanced driver trainer that thereby allowed the school to train young men in advanced driving skills at Amaroo Park Raceway, west of <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Ginn was, by then, married, with two children. He then moved to The Scots School, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albury%2C_New_South_Wales_a918.html" title="Albury, New South Wales">Albury</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> to become Head of Science, sports coach, Boarding House tutor, Officer in Charge of Cadets and, subsequently, Computer Coordinator (he initiated computers into that school’s curriculum and administration) and then Curriculum Coordinator. He was the Chairman of the Staff Room and served externally as Independent school representative on the Riverina Murray Board of Teacher In-service. A third daughter, Pennie, arrived. He was in Albury for 14 years and much of life developed at that time. He played cricket at reserve grade level and tennis at A grade level for most of his years in Albury. It was in Albury that, sadly, his first marriage finished, but also, some years later, that he married Kathryn and their children Cameron and Claire arrived.</p>
<p>He was then successful in gaining the position of Director of Studies at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Southport_School_93e5.html" title="The Southport School">The Southport School</a> (boys, P – 12) on the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast%2C_Queensland_ffa7.html" title="Gold Coast, Queensland">Gold Coast</a>, commencing there in January <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>. Whilst at the School he was appointed as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commanding_Officer_6386.html" title="Commanding Officer">Commanding Officer</a> (Lt.Col.) of what was then Australia’s largest Army Cadet Unit, he was appointed as independent school representative to the Queensland Board of Senior Secondary School Studies Curriculum Committee, he was part of the Queensland Government’s Committee to Review Assessment and Moderation procedures and he completely re-established the curriculum at TSS and subsequently set in place a major ($1.5 million) <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Technology_9235.html" title="Information Technology">Information Technology</a> re-structuring of the school. Also. whilst at the School he also coached rugby, soccer, tennis and karate. He taught Chemistry and Information Processing and Technology to senior students. Mr Ginn has always enjoyed sport and devoted his fitness training, at that time, to the study of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">karate</a>, in which he became an instructor.</p>
<p>In early 1994 he was appointed as Foundation Principal to Fraser Coast Anglican College. It is partly due to his unusually wide range of experiences in all manner of things (from building to computer programming, to financial management, to timetable development, to project management, to curriculum construction, to selecting staff, to managing military units and understanding so many aspects of schooling that the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese.html" title="Diocese">Diocese</a> had confidence to appoint such a person to found a school in an area somewhat remote from mainstream interest. During his time at the College he has generally held the roles of Principal, Business Manager (or that role shared with Mrs Anne Patterson and Mr Russell Green) and teacher of Information Processing and Technology. He has also coached cricket. His major task, of course, was the strategic development of the school from nothing and to ensure its successful and viable future as one of the region’s (and Australia’s) finer schools. He purposefully introduced International education to broaden the students' horizons (he travelled to other countries to set up sister school links and to market our school overseas), enabled the school to have a leading edge Information Technology position, enabled an excellent Outdoor Education and leadership challenge program, ensured a strong sporting and cultural climate and made sure of strong academic results – all this in an environment of strong pastoral care and Anglican ethos. He and Kathryn devoted themselves completely to the development of the College.</p>
<p>Mr Ginn is currently Chairman of the Queensland Anglican Schools System – both Board and Council, Chairman of the [Queensland Anglican Schools Commission]] Marketing Committee.</p>
<p>Mr Ginn is also the Founding President of Education Hervey Bay (Inc.), which is an organisation developed to enable links between all educational bodies, Council and Commerce bodies for the overall development of education as an industry in <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hervey_Bay_41a9.html" title="Hervey Bay">Hervey Bay</a>. Its major focuses, to date, have been the development of International Education for <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hervey_Bay_41a9.html" title="Hervey Bay">Hervey Bay</a>, the implementation of the State Government’s Education and Training Reforms, the setting up of interschool activities (sport and debating as starters), the support of funding applications for local educational groups and the support of teachers in their roles as educators and carers. This latter body has enormous potential for the development of this region.</p>

<p>A self-loading locked breech semiautomatic recoil-operated pistol manufactured in Argentina. It fired the standard .45 ACP (11.43x23mm) cartridge.</p>
<p>The standard Argentine military handgun were two versions of the Colt M1911 (see) used by the U.S. armed forces, the Modelo 1916 (comparable to the Colt M1911) and Modelo 1927 (comparable to the Colat M1911A1).</p>
<p>The Direccion General del Material del Ejercito (DGME), or General Directorate for Army Materiel, in 1936 commissioned Hispano Argentina Fabrica de Automoviles Sociedad Anonima (HAFDASA) to produce a pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge to serve as an indigenous replacement for these Colt handguns, with a requirement that barrels and magazines be interchangeable with the existing pistols.</p>
<p>HAFDASA dated back to 1929 when two Spaniards, Arturo Ballester and Eugenio Molina, established a company in Buenos Aires to produce Hispano-Suiza automotive products.</p>
<p>HAFDASA began to design and manufacture small arms, adapting existing designs to satisfy the requirements of the Argentine military and police forces using indigenous materials within HAFDASA's production capabilities.</p>
<p>The original Browning design for the M1911 was simplified to facilitate and economize production. The main changes were the elimination of the grip safety, replaced by a backstrap integral to the frame, and a pivoting trigger with a side mounted sear bar and disconnector. These changes were influenced by the Spanish Star Model B pistol made by the Spanish company Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A. and the Llama pistol made by Gabilondo y Cia, S.A.</p>
<p>While the completed HAFDASA design strongly resembled the Colt M1911A1, only the barrel and magazine are interchangeable with the Colt pistol.</p>
<p>By 1942 HAFDASA had changed the trademark name of the pistol from "Ballester-Rigaud" to "Ballester-Molina." HAFDASA continued to produce pistols for Argentine government and commercial usage until 1953, with a total production of between 80,000 and 90,000 .45 caliber pistols of all models.</p>

<p>The aim of the College Award is to recognise students who achieve at a high level in several aspects of school life. These awards are significant incidents in the life of the school and the wearing of the badge is the mark of the school's respect for that achievement.</p>
<p>The College Award is presented on the accumulation on the appropriate number of Principal's Gold Awards. Principal's Gold Awards are awarded across a spectrum of academic, sporting, cultural, service, leadership and spiritual components of College life. In the case of minor achievements, a Principal's Silver Award may instead be granted (three of which may be redeemed for a Principal's Gold Award).</p>
<p>The levels of the award, and their respective tally of Gold Awards, are:</p>
<p>White (9); Blue (16); Burgundy (25); Gold (36); Honours 2 (50); Honours 1 (75).</p>
<p>Many students are able to achieve the number of Gold Awards required for White, Blue and Burgundy awards. High achieving students may attain the higher levels, and the record stands at exactly 100 Principal's Gold Awards.</p>

<p>The aim of the College Colours is to recognise students who achieve excellence in one particular activity. It is expected that the recipient of Colours would be an individual who is respected by other students for their achievements in a particular activity. The standards set are such that only a small number of students are eligible each year.</p>
<p>Colours are awarded at Half, Full and Honours levels. Although this is not the criteria, individual excellence on a regional level is typically awarded at Half Colours, excellence on a State level at Full Colours, and a small number of students have been awarded Honours Colours - achievements typically on a national level.</p>

<p>Each academic year is culminated by the Celebration of Achievement (often known in other schools as a Speech Day/Night).</p>
<p>Many awards are presented on this occasion, recognising achievements spanning the whole year.</p>
<p>In the Secondary School, awards presented to students in each year level include Endeavour Certificates, Subject Prizes, Academic Medallions and a Dux.</p>
<p>Special awards are also presented, many reserved for the graduating class. These include cultural and leadership awards, and the House Cup. The night's pre-eminent award is The Principal's Award.</p>
<p>The College also holds a Celebration of Arts evening and a Sports Awards Evening, which serve a similar purpose but in their respective fields.</p>
<p>A recent addition to the "Celebration" theme is the biannual Celebration of Effort, reflecting the students' marks for effort on the preceding Semester Report Card.</p>
