<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I see no use in deleting this as a branch off of "Cleft palate". While it's probably someone's research paper, it is academic in nature and therefore gets a free pass by me. The page was prod'd with the editor citing it as "nonsense". With all due respect, I suppose I would call a physics textbook nonsense if I read it, also. Also keep in mind that <i><b>deletion is not a substitute for cleanup.</b></i> <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 05:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. What is the point of the article? That the incidence of "Cleft palate" might vary by population origin? Well that should be dealt with in <i>that</i> article. That the medical field may not be ready to respond to the needs of different cultures or native languages that are present within the US? Well, deal with that topic within some article about <i>providing medical services</i>. This article is a mash-up of data and mis-directed good intentions. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 05:33, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>In other words you are saying 'merge and clean-up', but why 'delete'?--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 22:21, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> delete because it's abstruse? delete because it can be merged? It simply cannot--look at its size and look at the amount of references. Admittedly this is an obscure branch of human knowledge, but that is certainly not a grounds for deletion, especially for something of such an intellectual merit. What we need here is a paragraph dealing with this on the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleft.html" title="Cleft">Cleft</a> page and then a <i>Main article: Clefting Prevalence in Different Cultures</i>. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 05:37, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup per Adam. Sourced research and probably too long to keep in the main article. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 05:45, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Per Adambiswanger1, but I do agree that it needs a cleanup. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 05:45, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleft.html" title="Cleft">Cleft</a>. If cleaned up and verbiage removed, this would add only a few paragraphs, and they would fit in very well in the larger article. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 13:36, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yes but that's assuming that everything outside of those "few paragraphs" is useless or unnecessary. It's a very good article, and to remove any information would be, well, removing information. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 15:43, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I suggested removing verbiage, not information! The article is quite short, and I think it could be converted into a couple of paragraphs and a table or two without losing any information at all. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 15:50, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps, but I really <i>don't</i> think that it has so much verbiage, and much of it is references which would be cumbersome to merge over. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 15:52, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In our advance towards a larger and more comprehensive encyclopedia, what can we hope becomes of the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clefting.html" title="Clefting">Clefting</a> article? We can hope that each section expands, ideally to the point where it requires its own article. That has happened already, so why retard the advance of this article because there is too much information? Can anyone actually look through the article and say in truth that what is being purged in the merger is "verbiage"? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 18:17, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment.</b> IMHO, what is being purged is useless statistics. I see a bunch of statistics about cleft palate without any <i>context</i> about what the statistics mean. Of course, that would require summarising other authors' articles about cleft palate and how the statistics can be interpreted. Also, the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clefting.html" title="Clefting">clefting</a> article is another matter entirely, very properly split out because it is a separate subject (linguistics v. anatomy). —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 22:33, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you read the article, and put on your thinking cap and try to understand, you can make out the underlying theory. Some sentences are clear as day, though. "African Americans have a lower prevalence rate of CL +/- P when compared to Caucasians." Is there some clarification that could be done here? certainly. But what is needed is <i>more</i> content to show the said underlying theory. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 23:12, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and clean-up</b> well-sourced, specific and informative. I don't find the info all that fascinating, but this is still useful and encyclopedic. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JChap2007_84c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/JChap2007">contribs</a>)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Cleftcruft. The subject would be a suitable review article for <i>The Journal of Stuff To Do With Cleft Palates</i>, but not for a general encyclopedia. A sentence or two could go in the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleft_palate.html" title="Cleft palate">Cleft palate</a> page.-- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Adam. Possible merge. The nominator quotes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a> as a reason for this deletion, but I fail to see which of the listed subsections are applicable to the article. This is a well reference, if poory wikified, detailed expantion of the cleft article. While currently it may look more detailed then the cleft entry, in time I expect the articles will evolve into this level of detail - and beyond.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 22:21, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Adam. This article does need wikifying, however, that is no merit for deletion. The statistics are important and help to clarify the underlying need for more research in prevalence rates of <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleft_palate.html" title="Cleft palate">cleft palate</a>. As the first author of this article, I appreciate suggestions for change and not deletion. I am new to wikipedia and am trying to revise and clean up the page as best as I can as a new user. Please contact me with suggestions. This article should no way be deleted --Chm33 23:21, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. "The statistics are important and help to clarify the underlying need for more research." That's part of the underlying problem with the article. The purpose of Wikipedia is to inform rather than persuade; persuasive writing starts to enter the realm of <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">point of view</a>. Further, the information presented in articles is supposed to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> from published sources; a shortage of sources creates the problem of either a small article with minimal content (which winds up in AfD) or an article with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> (which, if not cleaned up, also brings it back to AfD). —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 00:56, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with Fred that the article needs some <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOVing</a>, some parts of it indeed read more like an essay (consider the first sentence, which states, without any citation, that the topic "...is an area in a need for rigorous research"). Similar problem applies to the last sentence in third para ("Research on clefting in different countries will help in the health care professional’s pursuit to understand different cultures." - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball</a>). I suspect it is setences like those that Fred finds objectionable. But the article is not an essay, and after some style adjustments it will be quite encyclopedic - the two examples I quote above are exceptions rather then the rule in this article, and I mention them per Chm33 request for suggestions as to what should be improved. Again, the need to NPOV and adjust the style is not a reason to delete an article. As for statistics, Fred, I don't see your point: they are referenced with academic sources (Harvard style) (thus fullfilling both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) and I have never heard an argument that statistics are unencyclopedic or go against WP:NPOV.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 01:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article may indeed need to be revised and edited of possible essay format per Piotrus comment. I appreciate the response to my need for suggestions of improvement. After improvements and style adjustments are made, there appears to be no justifiable reason for deletion. Information is backed by published sources and there is no persuasion involved. I still appreciate all suggestions for improvement during this process. --Chm33 01:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Adam. I think this article has a lot of information and value to Wikipedia. It's not the most common of topics but that only enhances the need for articles like this. The clean up has already started. Let's give the article time to grow. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 05:56, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
