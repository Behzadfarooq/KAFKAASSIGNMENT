<li><b>Delete</b> — what, just because it has a fucking ISBN number it should be kept?!? That is one of the most stupefyingly specious arguments I have ever encountered in my life. Between arguments of that calibre (and I lump the denigration of MONGO's character into the same category) and the idea that just because Griffin is a famous person (in certain highly dubious circles) we must help him promote his book, there is absolutely no good reason offered here as to why this trash should be kept. We need articles on the <i>classics</i>, on books which have made an impact on culture over the centuries and will probably continue to do so in centuries to come. That's what an encyclopaedia is for, not elevating the status of the scribblings of a fringe-confined hack, which, in two year's time, will only be dispersed upon the tides of entropy.

In any case, the book has already sold 100,000+ copies in the US and has been discussed in a lengthy Washington Post Sept 2006 article<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/07/AR2006090701669_pf.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/07/AR2006090701669_pf.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which identifies the book's author as a leading figure in the 9/11 conspiracy theory movement. The same article cites a poll which suggests that over a third of the US public suspect US government involvement in the attacks.
