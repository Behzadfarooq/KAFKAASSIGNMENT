<p>Intrigued to read about G Toye's rewritten Pirates Overture. I have not seen this mentioned anywhere else. Interested to know chapter and verse. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_riley_791a.html" title="User:Tim riley">Tim riley</a> 23 April 2006.</p>

<dd>Toye himself wrote a letter to <i>The Gramophone</i> (February 1932 issue):</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When we revived Ruddigore an Overture of mine was substituted for the existing one, which incidentally contained a tune which was being omitted in our production of the opera.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This Overture is the one now played before the opera, and is recorded on H.M.V. DB4005. I also substituted a new Overture for Pirates, which seemed to require it. Whether these Overtures have more merit than the old ones is a matter which posterity can judge for itself.</dd>

<p>There is quite a bit of duplication between this article and the <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_and_Sullivan_23b8.html" title="Gilbert and Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> article. It would probably be appropriate if material related to the <i>collaboration</i> were on the latter page. This page would focus on Sullivan's background and accomplishments as an <i>individual</i>. Their collaboration would be described only briefly here, making reference to the 'G&amp;S' article where the details would reside. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 20:12, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is the basis for the story of the score of <i>Thespis</i> turning up and then getting burnt? All the books on Sullivan I've read agree that the score has been missing since Sullivan's day. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilus_9e68.html" title="User:Wilus">Wilus</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a rumor that a copy of the <i>Thespis</i> vocal score was in the Chappell warehouse that was destroyed by fire in the early 1960s. But as it is only an unverifiable rumor, it does not belong here. (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 22:15, 3 April 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>The paragraph about size of the pit orchestra lists "2 trombones". I seem to recall that the joke of Nanki-Poo being a second trombone was a barb by Gilbert at Sullivan for wanting or needing a bigger orchestra. Would that not indicate that there was but a single trombone in the Savoy pit?</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's an old story, but untrue. All of the Savoy Operas from <i>The Sorcerer</i> onwards were written for two trombones (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 22:15, 3 April 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>"Sullivan used horns crooked in many different pitches" - Surely that's impossible? This was well after the use of Valve Horns. To be using crooks would be a ridiculous throwback. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> 06:35, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, this needs corrected. Sullivan <i>wrote</i> in the old style, for horns crooked in many pitches, but the actual players would have had valved horns. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 22:11, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The current edit says:
<dl>
<dd>Sullivan used horns crooked in many different pitches, and treated them rather like Brahms, with little chromatic language and economically. Sullivan's orchestration was delicate and concise (though never boring). Iolanthe has some interesting quotes of a Bach fugue (played by clarinets and bassoon) in one of the Lord Chancellor's patter songs.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The statement that Sullivan used horns crooked in many different pitches is definitely wrong. And who said that Sullivan treated the horns "rather like Brahms"?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm also not aware of any source that describes Sullivan's orchetration as "delicate and concise (though never boring)." Much as I love Sullivan, to say that he is <i>never</i> boring is an exaggeration. That's the trouble with sentences containing the word "never." All you have to do is point out one counter-example, and the statement is disproved.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And are there "quote<u>s</u>" (plural) of a Bach fugue in <i>Iolanthe'</i>s patter songs? In whose opinion are they "interesting"?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've finally removed the statements in the "Orchestration" section that were unsourced. They were there with "cite needed" for quite a while, and no one was able to substantiate them. Sam added an {{expand}} tag, but I think this is quite unnecessary. As it is, this article is over-long by Wikipedia's standards. Every section of the article <i>could be</i> expanded, but I don't think any of it <i>needs to be</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Anyhow, in my view all three sentences should be deleted, or appropriately supported. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 13:06, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've revised the section on the collaboration with Gilbert. There's a stub section for "other works," which needs to be filled in. I think it's open whether it should be topical (by type of work) or chronological. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 22:44, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I added some info on Martyr of Antioch into the G&amp;S collaboration section, and I thought that the best place for The Zoo was to discuss it in the G&amp;S section--see if you like how I did it. Then, since the "Beginnings" section has info on Sullivan's major non-Gilbert works up to about 1873, I added an brief overview of his non-G&amp;S works *thereafter* up to the mid-1990s, which segues nicely into the morbidly-titled "Decline and Death" section. But the "other works" section could still certainly stand to be beefed up a lot.

<p>As now organized, I think the article gives a <i>reasonably</i> complete account of Sullivan's career as composer. The major gap is that it says nothing at all about his personal life. His activities as a music educator and conductor should also be given a bit more focus, since these had a lot to do with his knighthood.</p>
<p>It may make sense to put no more than a couple of paragraphs on the collaboration in the individual bio articles, leaving those articles to talk about what each man did alone. The Gilbert and Sullivan article, then, could give the high level history of the collaboration <u>once</u>, and the pages for the individual operas could talk about those operas in detail. A very prominent <i>"See also"</i> could direct the reader in the Gilbert or Sullivan biography to the joint Gilbert &amp; Sullivan page.</p>
<p>In discussing Sullivan's other works, I don't think it's helpful to mention everything he wrote in a "kitchen sink" fashion. As there is already a complete list of all the major works at the bottom of the article, I would suggest that a work should be mentioned in the narrative only if there is something more to say about it than its mere existence. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 14:58, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, it looks better and more accurate now. Is there more that should be said re: Sullivan's "Orchestration"? That section seems a bit spare. <a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 01:42, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The right way would be to look up what various sources have said about Sullivan's use of the orchestra. The section, by the way, isn't about Sullivan's orchestration in general, but only in the Savoy Operas. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 13:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Under Personal Life, the discussion is all about Sullivan's amorous side. I think a section needs to be added about Sullivan's relationship with money. He was frequently in need of money. Also, apparently, just before Iolanthe, his bankers went belly-up, and Sullivan lost everything.

<dd>I also think that his relationship with Fred Sullivan's children needs to be included. After Fred's death, he left a large family behind, and the composer considered them his personal responsibility. He became practically a foster-father to Fred's eldest son, Herbert, who did not accompany the rest of the family to California. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 22:07, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did Sullivan request that he be buried in Bromley cemetery or Brompton cemetery? Both are listed in different parts of the article. Is one simply another name for (or subsection of) the other? A couple of quick Google searches for the phrase "Arthur Sullivan" coupled with "Bromley cemetery" and "Brompton cemetery" produce more results for the latter, so I am assuming that Brompton is correct. This is supported by the fact that the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brompton_Cemetery_29b0.html" title="Brompton Cemetery">Brompton Cemetery article</a> lists one of Sullivan's relations as being one of its occupants. All the same, I'm not going to remove either cemetery reference from this article until someone more knowledgeable than I can look into the matter. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanDahlin_d26b.html" title="User:NathanDahlin">NathanDahlin</a> 21:39, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just checking this over: there's really nothing to add in terms of cites to "Reputation and Criticism" - all the quotes are so darn thorough! HOWEVER, "Musical quotation" is basically a list of unverified assertions that needs first trimming and then citing, or else GA reviewers will freak out. "Life and Career" is less urgent, but "Personal life" needs one or two cites, and surely that should be moved in with "Life and Career" anyway? What's the difference between your "Life", and your "Personal life", pray? Obviously, the "works" section needs to be shunted off to a child article, as was done with Gilbert.Oh, and lastly, the lead is too short for an article of this length - exapnd the lead and trim the rest.

<p>Iâ€™m having some difficulty in confirming that <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugen_d%27Albert_88c0.html" title="Eugen d'Albert">Eugene dâ€™Albert</a> wrote the overture for Patience. The only Google citation I can find is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gilbert-Sullivan-Overtures-Arthur/dp/B00000AEL8" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Gilbert-Sullivan-Overtures-Arthur/dp/B00000AEL8" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which is merely a customer review of a CD: <i>"The overtures Sullivan DID write himself (especially the "Yoemen"</i> [sic] <i>overture) are fine pieces - as is the overture to "Patience" (written by a very young Eugene d'Albert) ..."</i></p>
<p>We do know that dâ€™Albert was a pupil of Sullivan, and we do know that dâ€™Albert arranged the piano reduction for the Vocal Score of â€˜â€™The Martyr of Antiochâ€™â€™, to accompany the chorus <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/martyr/conductor.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/martyr/conductor.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>However we also know <a href="http://www.arbiterrecords.com/notes/147notes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arbiterrecords.com/notes/147notes.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> that <i>"although in his youth he studied in London with Ernst Pauer, Ebenezer Prout, John Stainer, and Arthur Sullivan at what is now the Royal College of Music, <b>he considered his work during this period more or less worthless</b>. ... It appears that when Sullivan heard that the Philharmonic had engaged d'Albert, he threatened not only to remove his own name from the membership, but to do all he could to induce the Queen and the Prince of Wales to withdraw their patronage. However, he was persuaded to alter his plans. Sullivan helped d'Albert in every possible way when he was a student; obtained engagements for him at the Popular Concerts, the Crystal Palace, etc; and when d'Albert went to the Continent gave him introductions to all the Courts. Yet on his return, a year afterwards, <b>d'Albert not only refused to call on Sullivan but threw contempt on him and all Englishmen</b>."</i></p>
<p>In light of this opinion of the English, it seems unlikely Eugene dâ€™Albert would have written the overture.</p>
<p>But the plot thickens. Eugeneâ€™s father Charles Louis Napoleon dâ€™Albert (1809-1886) made many piano and other arrangements of songs from the G&amp;S operas - <a href="http://www.gilbertandsullivanonline.com/pianarr.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gilbertandsullivanonline.com/pianarr.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://negass.org/bray/pdf/June02Bray.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://negass.org/bray/pdf/June02Bray.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I think this makes Charles a much more likely candidate for the Patience overture than Eugene.</p>
<p>Patience was premiered in April 1881, when Eugene was 17 and Charles was 72. Eugene was indeed very precocious, writing an overture of his own which was premiered on 23 June 1879, when he was only 15. So it's far from impossible he could have done some arranging for his teacher Sullivan a couple of years later. But none of the reference books I have access to say anything about it, and neither does Google. Similar lack of results for Charles d'Albert.</p>
<p>I suggest we remove the Eugene reference until we can find out something more definite. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 02:35, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks. As you noted, Eugene did the piano reduction for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Martyr_of_Antioch_d02c.html" title="The Martyr of Antioch">The Martyr of Antioch</a> in 1880, shortly before <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patience_%28opera%29.html" title="Patience (opera)">Patience (opera)</a> was written. Sullivan often had his students compile the overtures to the G&amp;S operas, so it would follow his usual form for Eugene to have arranged the Patience overture (this would not be inconsistent with his later counting this work as "...worthless"). However, SavoyNet has a number of active scholars reading, and so I hope to get a good citation one way or another within the 36 hours.

<dd>In his 2002 book, <i>Gilbert and Sullivan: A Dual Biography</i> (which is considered to be one of the best biographical research pieces on G&amp;S) Michael Ainger says that Eugene did the <i>Patience</i> overture (p. 195). I added the cite to the article, with a short quote in the footnote. I have also now been assured that (1) Charles was a dance master/actor/pianist who had little or no experience with orchestration, and that his arrangements of Sullivan music are dance quadrilles; (2) Eugen, a child prodigy, had been studying with Sullivan since the age of 15; and (3) Dr. David Russel Hulme, a noted Sullivan expert, was certain that it was in Eugen's handwriting, as reported in his doctoral thesis at U. of Wales (which I do not have a copy of yet).
