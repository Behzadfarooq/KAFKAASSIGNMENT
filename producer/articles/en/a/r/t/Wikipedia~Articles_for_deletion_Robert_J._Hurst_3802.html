<li><b>Keep</b> WP:BIO, aside from being merely a guideline rather than policy, is not all inclusive. Really, the real question when discussing whether or not an article should be deleted is: Does its presence actually <i>hurt</i> anything? <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 13:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, that is <i>not</i> the question, because "Keep my article. It's not hurting Wikipedia to have articles on me, my friends, and the things that we just made up in school today!" is the perennial argument of people who want to keep bad articles. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> is, in contrast, the simple elaboration of our <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> policy that Wikipedia doesn't have biographical articles for every person that exists or ever existed, and has been consistently employed for several years, now. So I suggest that rather than making the same bad arguments that the defenders of bad articles make, you make <i>good</i> arguments, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">citing sources</a>, to demonstrate that the WP:BIO criteria are satisfied by thiIt is interesting to wonder whethers person. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't need to, because those criteria are wrong and excessively megalomaniacal. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 14:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You do need to. You're wrong, not the criteria. Perpetual stubs without scope for expansion have always been deletable, per our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> all the way back to 2003, and as I said, the WP:BIO criteria are simple elaborations of what WP:NOT has said for several years, too. Citing substantial non-autobiographical sources to demonstrate that there is scope for expansion will satisfy the primary WP:BIO criterion as well as the Deletion policy and What Wikipedia is not. But a lack of sources yields a 2 sentence perpetual stub, with no scope for expansion, whose information is already contained in the article on the town, and which is deletable per all three of WP:DP, WP:NOT, and WP:BIO.
<p>Only people can suffer from <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalomania.html" title="Megalomania">megalomania</a>, by the way, not sets of criteria. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Just because something is written as policy does not make it <i>ipso facto</i> correct. But, anyway, the article is not destined to be a perpetual stub. I have several non-autobiographical sources of information; my plan was (and still is) to keep fleshing it out over the next week or so. Would everyone involved be amenable to closing this discussion until I (and others) get it written, and revisiting the matter later if some deem it necessary? <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 17:25, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I'm usually in favor of keeping elected officials, but a small-town mayor seems a bit too obscure. It seems a close call to me, but I think it fails WP:Bio. (I could see it merged into an article on the town, though.) I totally disagree with the "it's not hurting anything" argument. If WP was turned into a pile of non-notable articles, I'd consider that a harm. On WilyD's point, if we think this will never be anything more than a stub, I would argue that it may as well be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 16:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just curious--WHY would you consider that harm? Some argue that it will bring disrepute to the encyclopedia; I fail to see how having more information than other encyclopedias can be a bad thing. The only reasonable argument I've heard is namespace pollution--and even that is easily resolved. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 17:25, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sure - just briefly, I see two harms. One is technological / financial (i.e. it must cost something to store extraneous data without slowing down access to the non-extraneous stuff). If there aren't some limits, then the infrastructure does eventually break down. The second is that an encyclopedia clogged with anything and everything is less useful and harder to manage. I'll stop there, though - because I think this is a debate better suited to the discussion pages of WP:Notability. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 17:32, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I normally lean towards keeping elected officials.

<li>I remind you that notability is not policy and that, therefore, perceived non-notability is not a valid reason for deletion. Furthermore, I am reluctant to expand the article if it's likely to just get deleted. Perhaps people should give an article a chance before listing it on AfD. If it's not a blatant speedy, leave it alone for a bit and see what happens with it. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 21:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

What's more, improving an article cannot increase notibility of the subject. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 22:08, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The consensus on one particular debate does NOT trump policy. Furthermore, while improving an article does not increase the notability of a subject, it can add a claim to such (although it is not needed, as notability is not a valid reason for deletion) if it does not yet exist. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 22:35, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I know that consensus cannot trump policy, I am not aware that any policy exists saying notability is an invalid reason for deletion. And yes, you are correct in that providing proof can help demonstrate the notability of the person. The duration of the AfD should make that feasible. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 22:39, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not really...I only have a limited amount of time to spend on Wikipedia each day, and that time comes in small chunks (2-3 minutes). Furthermore, most people don't revisit these, so changing the article will do absolutely nothing to affect their suggestion in this discussion. All I can do is try to convince future participants that this should be left alone, and the time spent doing that is time I cannot spend working on the article itself. And if I can't keep the article from being deleted because certain individuals (including, quite possibly, whoever the closing admin is) choose to ignore policy or are too lazy to see if the arguments being posted are actually valid with regards to this particular article (admins have quite a bit of leeway when closing AfDs, but most of them choose not to use it and instead just lazily tally up the "Keeps" and "Deletes" rather than weighing the strength of the arguments and their relevance to the article as it actually is), then there's no point in working on the article any further, is there? See my essay, <a href="../../../g/i/v/Wikipedia%7EGive_an_article_a_chance_3c56.html" title="Wikipedia:Give an article a chance">Wikipedia: Give an article a chance</a>. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 23:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think your confusion is in thinking that this is a vote. If a person voiced an opinion to delete on the basis of a claim, then that claim is later disproven, and that person never comes back, then the following should happen:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>An admin will see that the AfD is old enough to close</li>
<li>This admin will look at all the claims</li>
<li>This admin will weigh the claim based on if arguement is valid or not(considering available evidence)</li>
<li>If the closing admin sees that an opinion is based on an idea that has been proven to be inaccurate then that opinion will be given little or no weight.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What I am saying in a rather longwinded sort of manner is that these sorts of discussions are dealth with using common sense, and beyond common sense a sense of fairness and objectivity limited only by the personality of the closing admin. There is no simple vote count at the end, but a consideration of the ideas and opinions brought forth aswell as their justification.</dd>

<dd>Mistakes that are not corrected in time are accounted for.

<dd>No, I'm quite aware that it is not a vote. If you had bothered to read what I had actually written above, you would have seen that my point is that, while admins are supposed to do what you said, they generally are too lazy to bother. So an article that clearly shouldn't get deleted gets deleted.</dd>
