<p>Okay folks, revisiting this AfD I have decided to reset it. Bare with me here. There were procedural concerns with the initial drafting of this AfD, namely that an Anon initiated it. However, the anon and or anons that started it have valid points, but such points have been lost by the fact that there has been use of proxies, and actual discussion about the merits of the article has been lost amongst folks disagreeing with the legitimacy of the AfD. So I am restarting the AfD, period. I have no opinion on the article, but here are the issues addressed by the anons, and I feel that they are valid reasons to <i>initiate an AfD</i>...</p>

<li>There are serious concerns with the veracity of the references used in the article.</li>

<p>With that out of the way, the discussion in this AfD will remain limited to the whether or not the article's claims meet our standards set up for proper references, and whether or not the subject of the article meets our criteria for inclusion.

<li>Notablility: 'Notable here means "worthy of being noted" or "attracting notice". It is not synonymous with "fame" or "importance". It is not measured by Wikipedia editors' own subjective judgements. Notability is generally permanent.'-Wikipedia. Already Ebony has attracted a lot of Notice in the week he has been on Wiki. Everything against him has been character assasination with no validity. The proof of his notability is found in all AfD records.

<li><b>delete unless sourced</b> but that means two separate things: (I expand on my comment in the earlier AfD:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>the first is whether there is any reliable evidence that the person existed. We usually do have data that supports the bare existence so it rarely enters into the discussions here--the private imaginary worlds and non-existent musicians almost always get filtered out quickly in speedy or Prod. When a hoax gets discussed, it can usually be eliminated on the grounds of contradictions, as well as sources. (There may still be some more clever flights of the imagination in WP undetected) But in this case there is zero out-of-cult documentation that there ever was such a person. Given the general nature of AC's writings, I think we are justified in asking for at least one source from someone not involved with the groups who has actually seen the person.</dd>
<dd>I have examined <i>all</i> the external links. The page at <a href="http://www.93current.de/groups.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.93current.de/groups.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.93current.de/groups.shtml</a> lists 33 related groups, with varing amounts of documentation, and uses language implying hat the compiler has some doubts about some of them. Our guy is "no.27 Hawk &amp; Jackal the sun and the moon conjoined: Thelemic Witchcraft. Founded by Charles Reese a.k.a. Ebony Anpu, who died far to soon, so you can't contact them anymore. Check out his work." (with a link to <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~charlesreese/HawkJackal.html" class="external free" title="http://home.earthlink.net/~charlesreese/HawkJackal.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.earthlink.net/~charlesreese/HawkJackal.html</a>, which gives a "page not found" error. ) The oregon site is "cannot find server," The Arkansas one does have a real page, but "2/10/2007 Hotmail/MSN NOTE: Hotmail/msn are NOT accepting email from the Witchvox server at this time - we are working with them on this issue." The site on geocities lists some SF address he is said to have inhabited, and has a photograph. But a testimonial there reports "At the age of 18, Ebony was forced to leave Texas due to legal difficulties. At this point one begins to run into the problem which faces any attempt at biography of Ebony Anpu: his extreme penchant for tall tales concerning his own life." <a href="http://www.leapinglaughter.org/archive/charlesreese/ebonylog.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.leapinglaughter.org/archive/charlesreese/ebonylog.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.leapinglaughter.org/archive/charlesreese/ebonylog.htm</a> has a saved chat session. So we have that and the photographs and the memoirs.</dd>
<dd>the other part of sourced is sourcing the information given in the article. For documentation of what he thought and wrote, in-universe sources are i think acceptable, since they seem to consistently identify the body of materials. The article (wisely) avoids any biographical discussion, and considers him only as a teacher and writer. If I understand correctly from a very brief reading, this religious movement does not believe in reincarnation. Pity, for that might have been some better evidence than now available.</dd>
<dd>I will support the article if there are two truly RS mainstream sources to base it on--not about the religion, for that is well-documented. About the man, which is the subject of this article. I write this hoping that someone will find something, not hoping they will not. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 20:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I note that a resource mentioned in another discussion, <a href="http://www.egnu.org/thelema/" class="external free" title="http://www.egnu.org/thelema/" rel="nofollow">http://www.egnu.org/thelema/</a> , does not mention him. It would take considerable OR to decide if this is because of relative unimportance , or religious differences. I have mentioned in that other discussion (Sam Webster) that ministers of conventional religions have well known and stable structures and offices and distinctions, which can be used for assessing N. They also acquire their knowledge through established divinity schools of some sort, and they sometimes publish in peer-reviewed journals. This makes establishing N much easier and much more objective.</dd>
<dd>I consider <i>all religions to be notable</i> provided there is some V way of finding out about them--I think this is the only possible standard, as WP is not a judge of theological truth. Individuals are another matter--any group with more than one religious leader has some who are more notable than others in that group. It's that which can be judged objectively if there are objectively visible criteria. If not, they can still be established as N through 3rd party mention. If this fails as well, it is beyond human ability to judge. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To reiterate: Ebony had an "Official" Office, as published by the OTO. Here is the problem, as DGG pointed out on Sam Webster, with individual-oriented religions. They are prone to massive ego-battles and no standard set of rules. You cannot fault the religion for not imposing more strict rules, but if you are an honest researcher you need to take into consideration personal infighting. Any researcher of Thelema can tell you that everyone disagree's with everyone else. The point here is Notability, not popularity. Sam Webster is popular. Ebony is Notorious. So notorious that we are inlvolved in this here word-sling. Although Ebony is not listed on Sam's page (as sam is not listed on any of Ebony's), the same editors who edited sams page also edited Ebony's (see history). From that is it _obvious_ that Ebony is known buy the same people who knew Sam. This is an issue that will not go away. If you truly wish to have a comprehensive encyclopedia of Reality, rather than bias, you will need to find some way to deal with individuals who are very notable, but otherwise do not conform to your standards of "religion", or who have enemies who wish to not see them on wikipedia for personal reasons. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainbarrett_48a2.html" title="User:Captainbarrett">Captain Barrett</a> 01:45, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. There are many interesting things about Ebony not yet verified, I will not mention them here because I do not have the proof (that you need), yet. These things made him avoid publicity and especially the Law, for many years. I have given many verifiable sources for him. Notability is not only about "your name in a paper" - that would be stupid. What if the unibomber had never been linked to a real person? Would the Unibomber be not notable because there are no articles with his name in it? Yet he is well known.

<dd><b>comment</b> In the context of this discussion, i interpret 3rd party to mean sources outside of Thelma. As Captain Barrett pointed out, it is very obvious that the different groups don't acknowledge each others existence, but--as he also said--this has no bearing on this AfD. However, I find it incredible that none of the Bay Area papers ever mentioned him--he is just the sort of person they would have talked about. We are asked to consider Reality, but the standards of evidence presented are those of in-universe role-playing games.

<li><b>No vote</b>. I do not feel qualified to vote on this one, one way or the other. However I do want to interject from reading the discussion above. It seems like people are having a very hard time attempting to find hard fact on this person and I even saw some mention of contacting people for facts. I would take a moment to say to anyone interested in keeping this article to avoid <a href="../../../o/r/_/OR_1d00.html" title="OR">OR</a> in your attempts to bring the article up to snuff. If you simply cannot find admissible sources, then you will have to wait and attempt to recreate this page in a more thorough form somewhere down the line. If Ebony Anpu is truly N then as time goes on, sources should become more readily available. If time goes on and less and less information become available, then I hate to say it, in the long run he wasn't really that N and he didn't deserve a page on Wikipedia. Either way, here's hoping this all get straightened out, because this seems like a sticky one. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarhorus_8a29.html" title="User:Warhorus">Warhorus</a> 18:48, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>. I don't think the page (which I just created) should be deleted, but, because the topic is controversial, to show good faith and avoid COI, I wanted to be the first to raise the issue. The topic is notable, has been discussed in law review articles, in newspaper and magazine articles, in litigation, in books, and in a Senate report, and may arise in the 2008 presidential election because of the ties of one of the parties to the John Edwards campaign. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=baron+budd+script+memo" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=baron+budd+script+memo" rel="nofollow">Google: 821 results</a>. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 00:59, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a branch of another article, on a lawyer, which the nom editor wrote to do an end run around the complaint that the criticism of a lawyer was overweighted. He also said that the AtLA was a "pack of lies". I understand he does not like lawyers, and is evidently willing to destroy anyone who disagrees with him (see my AN/I), but Wikipedia does not seem like an appropriate vehicle for furthering his political agenda.Jance 06:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps you didn't look quite closely enough at WP:COI, which states that "there is no list of criteria to help editors determine what counts as a conflict of interest." Just because you didn't find a box to tick doesn't exonerate you. I find it very curious that when attempting to defend yourself, you take this very literalist approach, yet when presented with the solid proof that Caton's <i>The Politics of Progress</i> has been "the subject of multiple, independent, non-trivial reviews or studies in works meeting our standards for reliable sources", and that in 1982-83 he "received a notable award or honor" (two boxes to tick against WP:PROF) you somehow appeal to a manufactured notion of "independent sources demonstrating notability", when WP:PROF calls for evidence of quite a different kind. Why the double standard? WP:PROF asks to be read literally, WP:COI specifically asks <i>not</i> to be read literally. Simply put, you've got it backwards.</dd>
<dd>Just as "if you are involved in a court case...you would find it very hard to demonstrate that what you wrote about another party to the case...was entirely objective" (WP:COI), so too <i>some</i> physicians would no doubt find it difficult to demonstrate that their motivation in calling for the deletion of an article about a man who's spent a sizable chunk of his professional career attacking their trade were entirely objective either. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.45.172.124 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.45.172.124.html" title="User talk:203.45.172.124">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.45.172.124_871c.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.45.172.124">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's incredibly disingenous of you to make assertions that there's no evidence for Caton's notability, citing WP:PROF, and then as soon as you're presented with <i>exactly</i> the evidence that you yourself have demanded, (a) you attempt to shift the goalposts of the discussion and (b) you're now going to take home your bat and ball rather than deal with the observation that that's what you've done. You've thrown around insinuations about others' COI based on "evidence" as flimsy as geography, yet cannot stomach the suggestion that you may have COI issues of your own here. Likewise, while at the same time as you're willing to put words into others' mouths, you attempt a lame linguistic slight-of-hand to avoid addressing the accusation of double-standards.</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> He is a full professor at Griffith, a major university. Full professors at universities are generally N, because they have survived several rounds of faculty peer review,. But it its not a major re3search university we don't necessarily assume they have published much, but in his case he has written several academic books.The book was reviewed in more than 20 professional journals.so even if there were doubt, the books and the reviews would be enough by all possible standards of N. PROF is just a guideline, but he meets it. He is N among other fields than AIDS dissidence, such as Mead/Derrick.&#160;::As the article says, he has written over 175 articles, mostly peer reviewed, and we accept official web sites for that.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>All of the above are referenced in the article, sourced much more fully and competently than academic bios usually are. I cannot help wondering if it were not his positions of issues that was affecting the discussion here. Absurd positions do not make an academic less N--it could even be argued that they make him more so. I am not an australian, and I consider his position of AIDS not merely absurd, but dangerous. Doesn't make him less N, and the documentation holds up. Article does need to be trimmed a bit--it should quote his views instead of presenting them.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:04, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

As for "independent sources demonstrating notability", you now have no fewer than 9 reviews of <i>The Politics of Progress</i> in peer-reviewed academic journals (you can verify all but one of these in JSTOR, if you care to). So, how does this still fail to meet WP:PROF 3.1 "The work must be the subject[1] of multiple, independent, non-trivial[2] reviews or studies in works meeting our standards for reliable sources. "? Secondly, you now have independent verification (from the NHC itself) that Caton was indeed the receipient of a Fellowship there. WP:PROF 6 states "The person has received a notable award or honor".

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that being a full Professor does not in general make you notable. However I think being a full Professor in Australia or UK does as it is a more restricted position than in the US and is more like the named or distinguished Professor in the US. Being a foundation Professor in a new university in Australia adds more to notability. BTW, Griffith University has a strong research focus although perhaps less so than the larger and older University of Queensland in Queensland. An earned D Litt requires extensive publications. It is awarded entirely on the basis of publications. He is quite clearly a notable professor.

<p>Fails <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a>. This condition has never been described in any medical journal or textbook and is unrecognized by the medical community. It is a neologism invented by a person who happens to sell products to "cleanse" the "mucoid plaque". Google returns only promotional websites selling "plaque cleansing" products. Per <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a>, there are no independent sources establishing notability of this fringe topic.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The problem with this kind of article is there is no reliable source refuting it. There are only reliable sources not naming it, which is not the same! Stating the concept is not accepted within the medical community is correct, but proving it by showing it is not mentioned in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_literature.html" title="Medical literature">medical literature</a> borders on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>. Believe you me I have looked but can't find an article or medical organisation speaking out against this and calling it a fraud. Seems like a major problem. Second, the last AfD had editors promising to keep an eye on this article. Nevertheless they are not around. Our little friend promoting this stuff is, which is evidenced by the fact that I had a recent encounter with him resulting in his block. Not sure what will happen 4 months from now when everybody has forgotten this and Mr PR steps in to remove the caveats from the page. <font color="green"><a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a></font><sup><i><font color="blue"><small><a href="../../../n/e/s/User_talk%7ENescio_071f.html" title="User talk:Nescio">Gnothi seauton</a></small></font></i></sup> 00:17, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Agreed - it's like writing an article about how lemon juice is the cause of cancer. There are no reliable sources refuting such a claim, because it's just not notable enough.

<li><b>Comment.</b> All contributors please keep in mind that the point of this AFD discussion is <i>not</i> whether or not mucoid plaque is a scam or pseudoscience, but rather whether or not it is a <i>notable</i> and <i>verifiable</i> scam. Wikipedia has plenty of articles on scams and pseudoscience. All we have to determine is if the subject is verifiable via reliable sources and is reasonably well-known. ●<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> • <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanMS_16c9.html" title="User talk:DanMS">Talk</a> 02:14, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since it looks at least somewhat likely the article will be kept, I've gone through and edited it pretty comprehensively, along the lines discussed here. It's on my watchlist. But I'm only human and not on Wikipedia all the time - so if you feel the article should be kept and watched closely to prevent it from becoming an advertising vehicle, then could I ask that you-all add the article to your watchlist as well? It doesn't get edited very often, and it would be worth having a few sets of eyes on it, since it slipped under the radar this past time.

<li><b>Comment</b> Generally, you should not add new articles to an AfD after discussion has already begun. I personally agree that the four other articles should also be deleted, however, you'd be much better off to reverse the addition and start a separate AfD for the four others. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 10:49, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If anything, it should <b>not</b> be renamed to "List of notable American Idol contestants." I don't remember the exact policy, but I have seen arguments that a list of anything should imply notability; thus adding "notable" would be unnecessary. If you are willing to do it, you can add the additional sentences to as many of the names as possible and we'll see how it looks. I would not remove the red links until <i>after</i> that is done in order to see how non-notable those people are. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 04:10, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, that's not quite true. It's possible for a list <i>as a whole</i> to be notable, but not have every single member of the list be individually notable. For example, a prolific actor might appear in hundreds of television shows and films, not all of which are notable enough for their own article. But the "list of works" for that notable actor would probably be notable <i>as a whole</i> and worth including in some form in his article. Likewise, not everyone on the cast of a notable film is always notable, but the cast list as a whole for a notable film would probably be worth including. So basically the premise that every entry in a notable list must be notable isn't correct. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I started by creating a mirror article as a subpage to my userspace which wasn't looking too bad: <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_List_of_notable_American_Idol_contestants_4e60.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/List of notable American Idol contestants">User:PageantUpdater/List of notable American Idol contestants</a> (although I do get what you're saying about the title). Anyway this was all well and good but then i started clicking on some of the blue links to see what the people were notable for and I found that many of them are simply redirects! So I'm taking a breather until I decide whether it's worth checking the rest. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 04:12, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here's another consideration: Could each season of American Idol handle the names of notable contestants in their respective season? In other words, if the people are mentioned in each season, would the master list be redundant? <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 04:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I definitely wouldn't want a <i>category</i> like this, as this is basically a list of combined guest spots and full contestents who appeared on television competing on the show, and we don't categorize by guest spots. However, list articles go by a different, easier to meet standard compared to categories, and a list article to handle guest stars on a show is probably ok. I also do see the potential use of having a list article index of existing Wikipedia articles about Idol contestants, since the show presumably has a fair number of readers interested in looking at articles about various singers on the show. So overall I'd say no to a category, but I generally don't have a problem in principle with a list of contestents who had the opportunity to sing on the televised show. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am a regular contributor to the Idol articles, but frankly, this list just isn't needed. The American Idol Participants category is sufficient.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>Political opponents of the National Socialist Movement obviously wish to deny their party and their message any legitimacy whatsoever. Mr. Bowles is a presidential candidate registered with the National Election Commission. He has a campaign committee and his party has held numerous political rallies in various states around the U.S. in the last several years. He has been interviewed by newspapers, and portions of his speeches have been broadcast over national cable news networks. Perhaps his chances of actually gaining the Presidency are small, but he is a legitimate candidate with a legitimate political platform from a legal political party. His Wikipedia entry should remain, if for no other reason, in order that Wikipedia should be an exhaustive source of information on who is running for President.

<li><b>Comment</b> Aside from the fact that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is a proposal, not a guideline, how can it be said that most high schools pass it? I think the converse is true. "A school may be best handled in a separate article if it is the principal subject of multiple reliable independent non-trivial published works."

Lack of notability is an argument to avoid in deletion discussions <a href="../../../a/a/d/WP%7EAADD_43fd.html" title="WP:AADD">WP:AADD</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> You just claimed that the relevant issue is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, and insist that this article is a directory of schools. Let's quote #3 in its entirety "<b>Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guides, or a resource for conducting business. For example, an article on a radio station generally should not list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules, programme lists, etc., although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable. Furthermore, the Talk pages associated with an article are for talking about the article, not for conducting the business of the topic of the article. Wikipedia is not the yellow pages.</b>" Clearly, it is an article about a school, not a list of them. I don't see anything that looks like "upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules, [or] programme lists" in this article. "Directory fodder" is just a rewording of "I can't come up with an actual Wikipedia policy that this article violates so I'm resorting to excuses." Any other suggestions of a relevant Wikipedia policy? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:29, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I guess it's a lot easier to prove me wrong when you misconstrue policy and put words into my mouth. The policy does not merely prohibit 'articles' which are themselves directories. Rather, it declares that 'Wikipedia' itself is not a directory. (Look above the subsection you quoted and you will see the following text: "Wikipedia is not a directory. Wikipedia is not a directory of everything that exists or has existed.") Similarly, I did not insist that the 'article' is a directory of schools. I argued that if every non-notable school is the proper subject of a Wikipedia article, then 'Wikipedia' would become a directory of schools. As you can see, this is touching on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> as well. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 05:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

The problem with your quote that "Wikipedia is not a directory.

<li><b>Comment</b> (Indent reset) You are misconstruing the policy by ignoring the two sentences I quoted in my last post here. You are putting words in my mouth by stating that I am insisting that the article is a directory of schools. You say you can only rebut the claims I make, but you are doing a much better job of rebutting claims I haven't made. Are you saying that WP policies are to be read literally as exhaustive lists and that if another category of item fits the definition but is not within the letter of the law, users are free to disregard the spirit of the law? <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 06:15, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

If <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> really does mean something here, convince us that it does apply by referencing and quoting actual policy, not merely based on what you're sure it must mean by the "spirit of the law" (use of which term would seem to be a rather clear acknowledgment that it does NOT fit the claimed policy). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 06:25, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm getting frustrated. You probably are too. I explained my reasoning above. You obviously disagree. I did quote actual policy (with quotation marks and everything!) but I don't see any utility in repeating my argument that WP is not a directory (of high schools), because you'll just repeat your argument to the contrary and we'll continue gainsaying each other indefinitely like some real-life version of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Argument_Sketch_4850.html" title="The Argument Sketch">a comedic sketch</a>.

<li>I believe the only <i><b>"single school"</b></i> SAU (School Administrative Unit) in the state to be the argument of notabilty. If in your opinion this is not notable, based on cockeyed, crazy, loony, and loopy comparisons than your opinion is right. Here is another comparison for you; Every guy has one dick, but this one guy has a double dick. His claim to double dickness is verifiable and has regional interest in San Francisco, however every guy could have a double dick if he went <i>Dan's House of Double Dick Installations</i>, would no longer make the article notable.

<li><b>Delete as speedy as allowed</b> - I could not find any information connecting Superbowl and/or Owen Wilson and/or Casey Wurzbach and/or John Effchrane and/or Ed Asner, each mentioned in the article. This appears to be a hoax created essentially by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RonaldPeters_2001.html" title="Special:Contributions/RonaldPeters">a single purpose account</a> that provides apparently false information about living persons. The explanation given by the article's creator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Discospinster&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108365871" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Discospinster&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108365871" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> is implausible - the idea that Dreamworks' first mention anywhere of this purported $140,000,000 movie would be through an intern's post on Wikipedia to "gauge the publics reaction" is far fetched. The article's creator admits to creating the movie poster image used in the article (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Effchraneposter_copy.jpg#Licensing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Effchraneposter_copy.jpg#Licensing" rel="nofollow">poster licensing</a>), further supporting the idea that this article is a hoax. The article states that filming is now going on in Los Angeles, but <a href="http://www.filmlainc.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.filmlainc.com/" rel="nofollow">Film LA</a> has no record of it. Also, the fact that the article image includes the name "Effchrane", which could mean <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html#Common_alternatives" title="Fuck">fuck</a> John Chrane does not help this article. By asserting these actors are in this movie, others in the entertainment industry may be less willing to approach them for their own projects. Thus, keeping this article on Wikipedia may go directly to the livelihood of many of these living people, raising <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> concerns. However, speedy delete of <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_create_hoaxes_fecb.html#Dealing_with_hoaxes" title="Wikipedia:Don't create hoaxes">hoaxes</a> may require a similar opinion of several editors. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 16:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've been trying hard to keep pages in check and I've been going after most of the non-Top 5 finishers, unfortunately, some have done minor things, ie. news anchor, winning minor awards, being on low-rated cable shows and it is not that easy.

<li>Comment. A vanity publisher is a company that charges authors to publish their book. The books in question appear to be published by the author and her husband, rather than a vanity publisher. If multiple reviews or articles about the author from reliable sources can be found, then she would be notable. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 02:30, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Believe it or not, a few standard books have been published what is called vanity publishers, the question is not what type of publisher put out a book but how many have actually been sold and how does that figure relate to comparable books published by standard publishers <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 22:22, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I'm afraid I don't know what is meant by "standard books", I believe my comment concerning Rock of Ages Publishing has been misconstrued. In no way do I believe that self-published and vanity press books should be disregarded, rather I argue that they should be recognized for what they are: publications paid for by the author. I think this fact is relevant to any AfD consideration... as are sales, influence and profile. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 23:05, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article lists a number of interviews and articles about the person in the references section at the end. The minimal criteria for notability is to have multiple independent articles written about the person by reliable publications. So <i>if</i> the references in the article are reliable and independent of the person, then he would be considered notable. If not, he isn't. Since I'm not in a position to verify the references, though, I'll have to defer to other editors to check them out. Note that whether or not he won Survivor or placed third has nothing to do with his potential Wikipedia notability or verifiability for the article. It's solely a question of how much published information there is about him. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:30, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Quantity does not mean quality - or notability. We are not blindly bound to a guideline that sets forth criteria that are used as a tool to determine notability. Numerous puff-pieces, human interest stories, or page-fillers do not necessarily make one notable. Notability is more than counting the number of published pieces on any given subject. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sounds like you're trying to make a subjective call on what is a "puff piece" versus what is "an article about the person". The fact is that notability is a reflection of whether or not there is sufficient, independent published material about the person to support an article. I'm pretty sure you won't find terms like "puff piece" or "page filler" in policy or guidelines. The only question is whether these articles are 1) non-trivially about the person (ie they don't just mention the person in passing), 2) independent of the subject (ie they're not just written by the subject or their agents), and 3) independent of each other (eg they're not recopied versions of the same wire story). If the references meet those criteria, the person is notable. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I forgot to add 4) references must be from reliable sources. Blogs and forum posts aren't considered reliable. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:47, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suggest that a puff-piece, etc. (words I never said were expressly incorporated into the guideline) would not constitute "non-trivial" coverage. I refuse to believe that we must be automatons that slavishly adhere to a <i>guideline</i>. If we are, I'm notable for the bowling trophy I won in elementary school. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually you wouldn't be notable for winning a bowling trophy unless there were multiple independent articles written about you because of it.

<li><b>Provisional delete</b>. 'Twas ever my understanding that crime and criminals form a partial exception to notability guidelines, one that is moreover hard to capture in a formula. Though local crimes are often subject to non-trivial coverage by independent, citable sources, reliable in the context of daily journalism, most of them are of purely local interest and fade quickly when the next one occurs. In order to merit encyclopedia coverage, there needs to be some measure of long-lasting or national interest. I am not sure that this incident qualifies. If kept, it certainly wants a more descriptive and neutral title and heavy editing to remove journalese and editorializing. Not sure that this should be broken up or moved into articles about the alleged perpetrators if this is a single incident. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but needs to be renamed <i>Bixby standoff</i> or <i>Abbeville standoff</i> for POV and neologism reasons.

<li><b>Keep</b> since it clearly has multiple coverage in reliable sources independent of the subjects. For a group of U.S. citizens to gun down multiple law enforcement personnel in defense of their libertarian beliefs is highly unusual and seems encyclopedic as well as newsworthy. This is no common crime of passion or in the course of a robbery. Renaming the article seems appropriate because it sounds like a Steven King novel. The article is too "chatty" in tone.

<dd>I should probably clarify my position a bit. I'm not arguing that this incident shouldn't be covered in Wikipedia. I'm arguing that this article has so many problems (BLP foremost among them) that it should be deleted, with a new article or articles created to cover the subject under more appropriate article titles. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 15:43, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Rename</b> - Abbeville Horror - where does this name come from? Abbeville Standoff is a more NPOV name. The incident is arguably notable enough for inclusion.

<li>Don't know if it is appropriate, but I vote <b>keep</b>, subject to some work, hopefully by myself and others. There has been much more information come to light in the media regarding the entire Bixby family, and their side of the story, and basic facts of the case are now readily available from neutral sites around the Web (not just SPLC or Patriot sites). This should help clear up the NPOV problems. 95% of the BLP issues seem to be gone as of Sunday evening, when Steven Bixby was found guilty on all 17 counts (murder, kidnapping, conspiracy, &amp;c.) I believe that verdict actually qualifies him as a murderer (&amp;c). As I write this, the jury is hearing testimony in Abbeville in the penalty phase of the trial: the only two options under SC law are life without parole or death - judging from the pace of the whole trial thus far, we might know the penalty by this evening. Rita and Arthur, the parents, have yet to be tried (and there is no trial date for either of them, as far as I know). Arthur is reported to have increasingly severe Alzheimer's, and many believe he will die in jail without a trial. If we can gather enough info on Steven's life, it alone probably merits an article (especially considering the length of, say, the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mark_Karr_8053.html" title="John Mark Karr">John Mark Karr</a> article!)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I suggest that we work on fixing up the article (maybe this indeed will involve dumping this one and starting anew) and moving it to something like "2003 Bixby standoff" or "2003 Abbeville standoff", &amp;c. (This appears to be in line with Wikipedia naming conventions for similar events, cf. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Boston_Mooninite_Scare_d371.html" title="2007 Boston Mooninite Scare">2007 Boston Mooninite Scare</a> for a recent example.) <a href="../../../w/y/f/WYFF_6595.html" title="WYFF">WYFF</a>, the local NBC affiliate, has been referring to the event as the "Abbeville standoff". I agree "Abbeville Horror" sounds a little edgy and needlessly dramatic, but at the time I first wrote the article, I was just learning about the event myself and found that most places around the Web had given it the "Horror" nickname.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The question isn't what the church is now but what it was then, and where his office then fit into their organization--if he was the head of the denomination he would be N. Its founder were two famous evangelists, who were entitled Bishops by the group, &amp; the denomination is very much a N part of US history. But since they did not actually have a formal organization until 1841, it is not easy to tell. If he was considered the equal of Otterbein and Boehm, he was unquestionably notable, &amp; the article needs expansion. (The question I had whether this was one of the denominations where every congregation has its own Bishop, but according to the article there were 6 bishops at a time when the church had 500,000 members.) Other denominators aren't part of the qy, so we don't have to consider their N qualifications right now. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:32, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It could be argued that the police chief of a city such as <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kielce.html" title="Kielce">Kielce</a> (population 202,609) is automatically notable. There is another person by the same name, a sociology professor from the Polish Academy of Science, who generates a a fair number of Ghits, who may also be notable.

<p>"Wilhelm Sasnal (born December 29, 1972 in Tarnów, Poland) is a painter who lives in Poland. He studied art at the Krakow academy of fine art and graduated in 1999." That's the content of the article. Graduating does not make one notable. <sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 04:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> That's all the article said, and I agree graduation isn't enough! But there was a Saatchi Gallery link that gave a clue, and there's plenty on Google so I've added a bit to the article. He's won a major European award, worth 50,000 euros (though we haven't got an article on the Vincent Award yet) and his works have bought by major museums, like <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A28788&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=6&amp;sort_order=1" class="external text" title="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A28788&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=6&amp;sort_order=1" rel="nofollow">MOMA</a> and <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=7553&amp;page=1" class="external text" title="http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=7553&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">the Tate</a>. So, on the evidence now, it's a keep.

<li><b>question</b> A number of Polish artists of perhaps borderline N have been nominated for AfD lately, and I'd like to ask Piotrus whether he thinks there has been a concerted effort to insert articles about them, or whether he is being exceptionally vigilant, and we might perhaps want to watch those from elsewhere with as critical an eye? <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 21:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My vigilance is a result of the immensly helpful <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexNewArtBot_e482.html" title="User:AlexNewArtBot">User:AlexNewArtBot</a> which vastly improved the functioning of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_new_articles_8ee7.html" title="Category:Wikipedia new articles">Category:Wikipedia new articles</a> (particulary the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Portal%7EPoland_New_article_announcements_34b7.html" title="Portal:Poland/New article announcements">Portal:Poland/New article announcements</a> which I take care of). Over the ~3 weeks of its operation I have noticed that a significant number of artists seem to fail criteria for notability. Further, recently a discussion about artistcruft on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Polish_artists_5131.html" title="List of Polish artists">List of Polish artists</a> has been started on <a href="../../../p/w/n/WP%7EPWNB_2e6e.html" title="WP:PWNB">WP:PWNB</a>. So I decided to test some of them 'by fire', and to start a discussion about <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28artists%29_5bdc.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (artists)">Wikipedia:Notability (artists)</a>. In conclusion, I strongly recommend going through non-Polish artists categories - I expect they may contain quite a few cases that we should discuss at the very least. I don't think we are dealing with anybody inserting 'borderline WP:N Polish artists', but rather with many someones aall around the world - little knowjn artists and their fans - thinking that they are notable enough to be on Wiki. Some may be, some may not, but quite a few even if notable seem to confuse encyclopedia with a phone book...--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 18:02, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems at least weakly notable. I figure we can probably manage to write at least a decent-length article on it; one guy managed to write a 23-page paper on it and get it published in an academic journal, for example. <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0148-2076(198821)11%3A3%3C238%3ATROGCN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-I" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0148-2076(198821)11%3A3%3C238%3ATROGCN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-I" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 07:17, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Deleting this article would also be a ground for deleting other articles about other notable musicians' equally notable keyboard pieces. (Examples: <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._S._Bach_769d.html" title="J. S. Bach">J. S. Bach</a>'s the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Well-tempered_Clavier_f581.html" title="Well-tempered Clavier">Well-tempered Clavier</a>; some of <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozart.html" title="Mozart">Mozart</a>'s and <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s sonatas; <a href="../../../l/i/s/Liszt.html" title="Liszt">Liszt</a>'s <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcendental_Etudes_b328.html" title="Transcendental Etudes">Transcendental Etudes</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungarian_Rhapsodies_97b0.html" title="Hungarian Rhapsodies">Hungarian Rhapsodies</a>; and, for the sake of discussion (although it isn't a keyboard piece), maybe even <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Barber_c6ec.html" title="Samuel Barber">Samuel Barber</a>'s <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adagio_for_Strings_3d81.html" title="Adagio for Strings">Adagio for Strings</a>). These pieces, as well as others, have been the subject of numerous musicological treatises and studies, and have received much scholarly attention that they are in itself considered encyclopedic. On a performer's point of view, information about these articles would also provide valuable information about the history of the piece, notable performances (which may be used as points of comparison), and maybe even a discussion of the music itself. However, in this nocturne's case, it needs more sourced information to make it at par with the other articles, if ever. So I would also say, <b>expand.</b>--- <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitopao_212a.html" title="User:Titopao">Tito Pao</a> 08:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>In fact, all of Beethoven's sonatas have articles. I see no reason we can't do the same for Chopin. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 20:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Pretty much any of Chopin's compositions could support an article, I'd say; if we don't have articles on each, it's because nobody's gotten around to writing them yet. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:24, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> of course. How could anything by Chopin FAIL to be notable? <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 21:26, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep pending proper references</b> I don't have a problem with Chopin works being notable in principle. However, this particular article appears to have no actual references to establish notability or to verify any of the biographical background information about the piece. It also has some unverified/unverifiable "weasel phrases" like "The piece is one of Chopin's most famous noctures, and its playability has made it a favourite amongst students and masters alike. Both Anton Rubinstein and Arthur Rubenstein are acclaimed performers of this piece." There are no citations here, so the article hasn't verified that the piece is, indeed, "one of the most famous" or "accliamed by Rubinstein and Rubinstein".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Thus my recommendation would be to keep, but that is contingent on the article providing proper referencing. If the references never improve, I would eventually have to recommend deletion and redirect to an appropriate Chopin related article. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>FYI, I went ahead and added an unreferenced tag, since the only reference is the sheet music itself. The article needs references for the biographical information and opinions in its text. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:35, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a frequent concert pianist piece and there's too much subject-specific information here to be merged to the Frederic Chopin article. If there was an article entitled Nocturnes Op. 15 (Chopin) (he wrote 3 in this series), I'd consider a merge there. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 03:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps you or I could create that article.

<dl>
<dd>I just wanted to clarify that my current concern is that the subject specific information in the article isn't referenced. The lack of references really does need to be ultimately corrected or it might eventually lead to the article being merged (if it turned out a lot of the article is either editorial opinion or unverifiable). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Delete an article on a staple of the piano repertoire for going on 200 years? No. Rewrite it, source it, and merge or re-name it. It would probably work best as one section in an article on Chopin's Nocturnes, or just the Opus 15, as Oakshade says above. But if it's kept as a separate article, shouldn't the title be something like "Chopin's nocturne in g minor?" The composer's name to differentiate it from nocturnes in g-minor by any other composer, and lower-case <i>g</i> for the minor key. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:35, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Jeopardy analogy, though, isn't quite right because most of them don't have independent articles published about them. The main question is whether this person has multiple, reliable independently published articles about themselves.

<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the releases, El Trabadedos, is identified as Sony/Independent (released both by Sony and by an independent label - the source shows two different album covers) and El Cruzao is identified as Independent/Dorian. Dorian was a "classical audiophile" record label in Albany, New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005. <a href="http://www.audaud.com/audaud/JAN-FEB05/news/newsjan19.html" class="external free" title="http://www.audaud.com/audaud/JAN-FEB05/news/newsjan19.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.audaud.com/audaud/JAN-FEB05/news/newsjan19.html</a> So I think it passes the two albums on real labels rule.

Whoever (<a href="../../../n/i/u/User%7ENIu_461e.html" title="User:NIu">User:NIu</a>) nominated this article for deletion is basing such proposition on just an assumption, not on actual experience. I quote: <i>"Doesn't <b>seem</b> to be sufficiently notable"</i>. In contrast, I have watched <a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensamble_Gurruf%C3%ADo_4100.html" title="Ensamble Gurrufío">Gurrufío</a> in actual performance, several times. I wrote the article (which is still <b>incomplete</b>) on the basis of the extraordinary brilliance and quality of the ensemble in question (and I've been to concerts worldwide, I assure you), and as a musician I know what I'm talking about. But don't believe me. Ask a celebrated musician, such as <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Brouwer_2f7c.html" title="Leo Brouwer">Leo Brouwer</a>, or Carlos Barbosa-Lima, or <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alirio_D%C3%ADaz_614c.html" title="Alirio Díaz">Alirio Díaz</a>, what do they think of the <a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensamble_Gurruf%C3%ADo_4100.html" title="Ensamble Gurrufío">Ensamble Gurrufío</a>. You would be surprised. I don't see the point in your reasoning about <i>"their releases were independent releases"</i>: so what? Moreover, I hope to have news soon, as I am in contact with the group, and plan to add a wealth of additional information, and will ask their persmission to upload sound clippings to Wikimedia Commons. After you have liestened to them, I guess you'll change your mind about this article's deletion. <b>The same goes for the article on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheo_Hurtado_99cf.html" title="Cheo Hurtado">Cheo Hurtado</a>.</b> Regards, --<a href="../../../a/v/m/User%7EAVM_5bf2.html" title="User:AVM">AVM</a> 01:16, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether their releases are independent releases is highly relevant under the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> notability criteria. Using information from the group itself to establish notability contravenes the requirement that the information be independently verified. In any case, whether the group is notable or not, the article itself, when I nominated it, did not establish the notability. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 19:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The purpose for procuring information from the group itself is not "to establish notability", but to enrich the article with additional information, practically unavailable elsewhere; and, as already mentioned, to obtain permission to use recorded materials. Thank you for the reference to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">notability criteria</a>. I'll study it and abide by its postulates. --<a href="../../../a/v/m/User%7EAVM_5bf2.html" title="User:AVM">AVM</a> 20:51, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, seminal work that needs an article. The summary, though, is ... pretty nerdy. As far as I can tell from Google Books (which blanks large chunks) this really is a conceptual summary, section by section. I'm pretty sure that isn't the best way to write an encyclopedia article about a book (it's more like a Cliff's Notes approach). I suggest excising it and rewriting it all in a handful of paragraphs. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - OMG - How many assumptions can be cast without any knowledge!? I am actively writing the article. The book is 1. VERY noteworthy, 2. Difficult to decipher, as it is written in a very polemical style. I am summarizing the book, section by section, as a prelude to any better work that can be done later. If anyone thinks they can just sum up the work in one swoop, let them go ahead! I have read the book several times, and without first summarizing it <i>diligently</i> and systematically, it would be impossible to glean the actual argument from the forest of polemical debates which seem to permeate the book.</li>

<dd>Samfreed, please take the questions about the article in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>, as this is not personal. You obviously have access to the book, others do not. The sheer volume of text in the article, and the way it is structured like a table of contents, should make any editor want to take a second look. In part this is because few articles about books in Wikipedia look anything like this -- that is, they are <i>articles about the book</i>, not articles summarizing the book. I would like you to consider that writing how the book was received and what sorts of criticism and influence it has had are more encyclopedic things to include than a blow-by-blow analysis of the arguments, particularly since that comes perilously close to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> (and thereby jeopardizes the existence of the article itself). --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 18:57, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Of the four sources used here, the first two are blogs- one where the term is defined in a blog, and another where it is used without being clearly defined. Neither blog appears to be particularly notable or significant. The third source again uses the term without definition- it's an editorial on a gun ownership site by the same guy who wrote <a href="http://www.sierratimes.com/members/lankford.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sierratimes.com/members/lankford.htm" rel="nofollow">this piece</a>- his bio is at the bottom. The final "citation" is actually just a link to a Google search result page for the related term 'agendistic', which returns a Urban Dictionary page and a few other uses in blogs and web editorials. None of which, in my opinion, constitutes adequate sourcing for an article on this term that wouldn't constitute original research or, at best, a dictionary definition. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 09:11, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Also, you seem to be mistaken with the notability criteria of video games. For Tiny Kong, it is not the sheer number of appearances, but the importance of these appearances. The only games in which Tiny Kong is of any importance are Diddy Kong Racing DS and Donkey Kong 64.

Please keep in mind that the central criterion for <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> is that "An erotic actor or actress may be demonstrated as notable" if he or she has been "the subject has been covered by multiple sources which are independent of the article subject and are reliable."

<li><b>Comment:</b> Nominated for two AVN awards isn't really enough. Not bad, but not enough. However, Rog Review's Critic's Choice award isn't, from my point of view, equal to an AVN award.

The earliest version of this article had the case in an unidentified state but being appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (which covers the western part of the U.S.) whereas the current version has the case originating in Massachusetts.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, a lot of it is crap. If I remember correctly (and anyone interested can check the diffs), I contributed a lot of the crap to it. Any crap that I did contribute came straight out of the article on the novel or that on the character (amazingly, the latter exists as a separate article). My reasoning: a large and vociferous contingent WP editors stand on their rights to insert trivia, whoops I mean contemporary cultural references, to WP. Without this article, the article on the novel or character or both would be stiff with it, as (it seems) every tenth popster who's gazed in the mirror, contemplated his own (real? imagined?) beauty and vaguely remembered what his sister told him about <i>PFG</i> as her A-level text has made a "reference" to the novel or the dude. Well, I thought, let them have their own little playpen. But maybe I was wrong. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> is first choice, based on how WP is not for indiscriminate lists or directories of every appearance of a fictional character in pop culture ever.

<li>I agree with Celithemis. While most of it is absurdly trivial, this page appears to be the only account of the film adaptations of the novel, which are encyclopedic (or at least as encyclopedic as any film, and we have thousands of such articles). That being said, feel free to treat this as a delete, I suppose, for consensus building purposes (I hate it when articles are kept due to a lack consensus from vote-spilitting, especially when there is a strong consensus to not keep the article).

<li><b>Keep</b> - wow I am really amazed at this vote. How many "in popular culture" articles do we have on Wikipedia? It is a well known fact you can't stop editors from adding this stuff it is a veritable daily flood - <a href="../../../22/i/n/Wikipedia%7E_In_popular_culture__articles_a4c6.html" title="Wikipedia:&quot;In popular culture&quot; articles">Wikipedia:"In popular culture" articles</a> is an essay, not a guideline - it represents one opinion and IMO an idealistic and impractical one. No one is going to actively engage in edit disputes on a daily basis trying to keep popular culture junk out of articles, it is not worth the time or effort - in reality, no one does it and so the popular culture sections just keep growing like weeds. The only solution is to segment this stuff out and keep it out of the main articles. IMO the real problem here is people trying to delete the "in popular culture" articles over some idealistic notion of what Wikipedia should be, without taking into account pragmatic realities. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 14:56, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am amazed every time that someone wants to keep one of these articles giving a variation on "people are gonna do it anyway" as a rationale. People are going to put up hoax articles anyway, so let's keep those. People are going to unwitingly enter false information, so let's keep it because we can't stop it. People are going to vandalize articles and put up articles on non-notable topics and do all sorts of things and there's nothing that can stop them, so why try? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hoax articles and false information are clearly against policy. If something is notable or not is a much more difficult challenge - what is trivia to you is notable to someone else, otherwise they wouldn't have added it! The guidelines about trivia and notability are <i>guidelines</i>, not policy, and much more difficult and have to be judged on a per-case basis. Surely you must recognize this reality of Wikipedia, notability and trivia are subjective. Yes, people will add it anyway, that is a fact. I've been here 4 years and I've tried every method possible to discourage people from adding junk and the only method that works is to isolate it out of the main article space. Attempts to delete in popular culture articles are well meaning and understandable but will not work in the long term. It just creates cycles of add/delete, either in article sections, or in AfDs. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 16:08, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>other thoughts</b> RoH do not do Pay-Per-Views as per WWE/TNA. A DVD article is very akin to an article on the actual show itself. Would it perhaps be more palatable to alter the articles from "RoH DVD" to "RoH Show"? I do not personally agree with this however.</p>

<li>Shira, we all know how to use Google, but let's try applying our brains also. While Tova Hartman may be a lovely lady, she is just one of millions of professors and tens of thousands of Hebraica and Judaica academics in the world with nice articles about them and with books they may have had published by universities, BUT that would in no way qualify them to become icons or guides for new ways of re-inventing Judaism. What you are saying Shira, is that this lady Tova Hartman, because she is a professor and has had her words printed can now come forth and change Judaism and as you argue in the article that that is her "claim to fame" -- nowhere in Jewish history have academics had ANY standing in the world of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah_study.html" title="Torah study">Torah study</a> and they have zero significance as innovators of Jewish customs and certainly their opinions mean nothing in Jewish law. So in that regard she is totally <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">not notable</a>. By way of example: The <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews_for_Jesus_eb46.html" title="Jews for Jesus">Jews for Jesus</a> can also claim to have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> but that still gives them less than ZERO credibility in the world of Judaism.

<dd>Reviewing the current state of the references I still feel that my delete commentary was correct; although I feel the same way about the nom as per RGTraynor's comments. None of the references or news articles are <b>about</b> her, just mentioning her work as part of a larger article. It does seem that if she was a Professor of Education involved in feminist issues in say England with the same level of news commentary there would be a lot more deletion feeling. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 01:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If she was in England, and there was more feeling for deletion, someone would need to justify deletion using <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> to override the fact that the person meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> but expand. From this discussion its clear that she is notable in several ways that are not properly brought out by the article. But even if she werent, full professors at major universities are notable, and Hebrew Univ is the principal national univ. There's a major book by Harvard UP,and media mentions--and I gather there are more to be added. (It would help to add them now)</li>

<dd>It was argued in the discussion that Jewish women have never been traditionally Torah scholars, and therefore she, as a woman scholar, could not be notable-- that comment is of course the most extraordinary POV pushing. It was also argued that she represents only one possible group of Jewish feminist scholars is equally POV, for it can be remedied in the obvious way, by including the others. I urge those who did not say keep to go a few paragraphs back and re-read those 2 arguments. I hadn't known her work before, but now I want to see what accounts for these extraordinary feelings. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:50, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The above "30 links" is not correct.

<li><b>Comment:</b> <tt>num=100</tt> does not restrict the search to just 100 results. It tells Google to show 100 results per page instead of 10 so I can see more hits on the same page.

<li>My bad. I was reading the Google API ("Maximum number of results to include in the search results.") and understood it to mean to limit the search depth.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. CMSimple was awarded "Empfehlung Der Redaktion" in Internet Professionell 7/2004. CMSimple got 4 out of 5 stars in .net issue 118! So it is regarded by the Computing press. It is supported by a forum with 1062 registered users who have posted 25893 articles in the four support languages EN, FR, DE, DK. A Google on <i>cmsimple phpbb</i> gets 61,300. It is customisable to work in any language. A book has been published in Danish to support it, ISBN: 87-7843-711-3. There are 93 licensed resellers in 18 countries, though itself id AGPL Open Source..

<li>Google hits are interesting -wikipedia distorts the results. All sites that are running open source are obliged to leave a tag in the template source code that says <i>Powered by CMSimple&lt;/a&gt;</i> this can be searched for. A standard search for CMSimple will mainly bring up the developers sites and discussion on the package- as all CMSimple sites contain significantly similar Template code around the unique content, I surmise that Google takes all 930000 pages it found as being 'too similar to report'. Users who have bought a commercial licence have bought the right to remove 'CMSimple' from the Template so it will not show up in Google search.<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClemRutter_c625.html" title="User:ClemRutter">ClemRutter</a> 00:53, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Shira we all know how to use Google, but let's try using our brains as well. While Mendel Shapiro may be a fine man, he is just one of tens of millions of lawyers and hundreds of thousands of minor rabbis over the ages in the world with nice articles about them and with books they may have had published here and there, BUT that would in no way qualify them to become icons or guides for new ways of re-inventing Judaism. What you are saying Shira, is that this pesron, because he is a lawyer with a "semichah" yet and has had his words printed can now come forth and change Judaism and as you argue in the article that that is his "claim to fame" -- nowhere in Jewish history have lawyers had ANY standing in the world of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah_study.html" title="Torah study">Torah study</a> and they have zero significance as innovators of Jewish customs and certainly their opinions mean nothing in Jewish law. So in that regard he is totally <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">not notable</a>. By way of example: The <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews_for_Jesus_eb46.html" title="Jews for Jesus">Jews for Jesus</a> can also claim to have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> but that still gives them less than ZERO credibility in the world of Judaism.

<li><b>Delete</b> - while not agreeing with much of the above, the article does not assert notability.

The external links show only two independent sources, both fairly obscure outside the world of Jewish study, and this person doesn't have the same claim to notability as Sperber. However, I would like to reprimand the nominator again for clearly promoting a POV, and would like to clarify that whether or not something has "credibility in the world of Judaism" is not a criterion for deletion on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - long list of references is provided (although more independent third-party sources are needed) and I feel the nominator is acting in bad faith. IMHO you should <i>always</i> avoid attacking the article's author in an AfD - judge the article, not the person. Although I accept that the author is probably trying to promote a POV, the nominator clearly has their own views on this issue as well, and there doesn't seem to be much evidence of neutrality in any of the arguments above, on either side.

<li>Winning the Israel Prize is not worth a hill of beans in JUDAISM. All sorts of characters get nominated by the SECULAR state of Israel and none of it has any bearing on Judaism.

<li>IZAK, you have completely missed the point here. This person doesnt need to be notable in the field of Judaism as defined by people within Judaism or by any other group of people. He is considered notable for the purposes of this discussion because he meets Wikipedia's general criteria for "<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>".

<li>John: I get the point very well. To use a <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushism.html" title="Bushism">Bushism</a>, don't "misunderestimate" me. It's pretty obvious for those who have tracked this subject for a while now that the <i>only</i> reason that User:Shirahadasha created the article about this guy in the first place is because she wanted to stick in the following paragraph in the article: "His studies include examination of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakhic.html" title="Halakhic">halakhic</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minhag.html" title="Minhag">minhagic</a> foundations of the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_women_in_Judaism_2edd.html" title="Role of women in Judaism">role of women in Judaism</a>.

To point out this man's worthless credentials in the world of serious Torah scholarship is key to understanding that neither he, nor User:Shirahadasha should bend Wikipedia to their POV agenda of furthering Jewish feminism alone. Let them do it on its own merits, if it has any, but to create such artificial "props" flies in the face of the very subject it puports to revolve around, mainly Judaism, and in the world of Judaism this man is entirely not notable and thus should not have his own Wikipedia article, speaking objectively. Wikipedia is not a medium to spread <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologisms</a> and this guy is only on Wikipedia in order to spread the neologism known as "Jewish feminism" which is neither "Jewish" nor connected to classical Judaism -- it's just a late twentieth century invention that some now wish to foist on Judaism, similar to a zillion other social issues and phenomena that have zilch to do with Jews, Judaism, or what being Jewish truly means. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:16, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, no, he is not an ignoramus (about Judaism), it's the majority of people reading and commenting on the article about him, to be quite blunt. I was encouraging Shira to do a public service on Wikipedia by <i>not</i> constantly leading people on who do not have the required backround to fathom who and what does and does not count in the world of Judaism. By way of analogy, if you had a bunch of shoemakers who knew nothing about serious music vote on the merits of a whether someone should be called a notable musician, and then you told the shoemakers that the musician in question was also a professor, and then the shoemakers go ahead and nod their heads and go kluk kluk and mutter that presumably the musician must be notable because he is a professor and got a prize from some banana republic and that <i>ergo</i> he must be a notable musician -- would be pathetic, ludicrous, and comical, and that is exactly what is happening here, if you see what I mean. P.S. Your comment about "begats" only proves my point, so watch how you phrase things, 'cause your slip is showing... <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your insinuation that only people with the "proper" background ought to comment on AfDs is what is ludicrous. Wikipedia is a public encyclopedia, not an in-depth scholarly tome only permitted to the properly screened cognoscenti. As such, the verification standards are readily grasped by all. If you cannot defend (or refute) the notability of a subject to the satisfaction of the laymen who use this encyclopedia, perhaps it should be left to someone more qualified or articulate than yourself. (Come to that, I rather doubt that you were required to prove your Judaic knowledge to a board of Torah scholars before you were permitted to make related Wikipedia edits.) <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:41, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>RGTraynor, you are also missing my point. One can only judge an editor by his or her proven track record on Wikipedia. Noone has to go in front of any boards for anything to write in Wikipedia. But, if say, one was to pop into subjects on Wikipedia one knew little or nothing about and then on the basis of one's ignorance of the subject make misinformed statements or edits, as evidenced by what one writes and the way that one writes it, and if one then adds insult to injury by sitting in judgment deciding on the validity and notability of that subject (when it may be totally bogus and useless as understood by experts in that field -- not just on Wikipedia) then one would surely make a laughing stock out of oneself, or worse. Now, back to this subject of Daniel Sperber. He was only dredged up and written up by User:Shirahadasha to promote a POV "Jewish feminist" agenda because on his own merits Daniel Sperber, while being a very learned man, is in no way shape size or form recognized or regarded as an authority in Jewish law and is therefore totally not notable as a rabbi. Many rabbis have taught at universities over the years, and that does not make them notable. The question about the Israel Prize is a side point and misses the mark of what is happening here, it's a decoy if you will to avoid facing the real tough questions here, and it has no bearing on his standing as a rabbi since rabbis are not "measured" by the "prizes" they receive from secular governments or from anyone. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:26, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not "missing" your point; your points are quite obvious and easy to grasp. Where you are going wrong is in indulging in the most common error of any debater: presuming that failure to agree with you can only stem from a lack of understanding. As it stands, you are now stridently maintaining your POV against unanimous opposition. Whether or not you believe yourself to be the ultimate arbiter of Judaism on Wikipedia, you've failed to convince a single other editor of the merits of your position. You've certainly convinced <b>me</b> that your opposition is founded far more in attacking <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> than in the actual merits of this article. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:18, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Waxing lyrical about the injustices of this man being considered notable DOES NOT HELP. Read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">"notability"</a> and find an argument to delete on that basis. No other basis for deletion is appropriate here. AFAICS nobody here has an agenda except yourself, as everyone else has been determining whether the person meets the appropriate and simple criteria in "<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>". Go read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>!

The consensus by the comments on this Afd is that he meets those criteria due to multiple media references; thems the breaks. As far as I can see, the only reasonable logic that can be used to promote this articles deletion (based on <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>) is if the sources that have been provided to date do not provide sufficient evidence that he received the Israel Prize in 1997. i.e. you dont believe the article is factual. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 21:50, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

Wikipedia'd be a pretty empty encyclopedia if articles needed to be vetted under <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> for their specific importance to the Jewish faith.

<p>WP is not a crystal ball. This agreement does not exist and may never exist. Time enough to have an article on it when it does. The article contains an old statement by Australia's justice minister which is now outdated on negotiations.

<li>Not true. There's one other voice that's been raised arguing for a deletion or a merger. Additionally, unless there are very unusual circumstances (such as an AfD on the "Indonesia" article, for example), AfDs tend to run to the full term. It doesn't appear that this particular one will result in the article being deleted, but a pre-emptive removal of the tag is bad form. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:40, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was unaware that 'being silly' is something other than an opinion, and that a request for a list of requirements needed to fulfill the obligations for being notable was worthy of being ignored. I do not contest that this *may* be a non-notable subject, which would then be worthy of deletion, but rather all I want is just to be given a list of specific things which would satisfy the requirement for notability and more than a few hours to go over it, as not all of us can sit around at 5am on wikipedia preventing ban-happy editors from going roughshod over their work. In other words, I've stayed up far later than I should have to try and work this out with all of you, and I really would just like for you to ease up, relax, be slow and let this be worked out over a period of days, rather than minutes or hours. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante-kun_403a.html" title="User:Dante-kun">Dante-kun</a> 11:17, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Book is already mentioned on the author's page; nothing verifiable to merge. Also please note the article is being used as a soapbox: the "summary" is a mini-version of the book. The book purports to disprove the bestselling book <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a>; the "summary" section in this article for the <i>Is religion evil?</i> section, for example, is 5979 characters (for a book with no reviews at all) compared to <i>The God Delusion</i> summary of 530 characters for the corresponding section in that article. As such this article is also a POV fork of <i>The God Delusion</i>, as it is being used to soapbox against the controversial content of that book. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 13:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comments</b> a 75pp book by <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alister_McGrath_3c9d.html" title="Alister McGrath">a major author</a> is not a "pamphlet"; the source for the summary is the book itself (obviously - just as it is in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">TGD</a>), it was published last week so reviews and British Library catalogue will follow shortly. The length of the section complained of has almost halved (and could be shorter were it not for complaints about OR!) but seems irrelevant to whether the article should be deleted - there is no policy which says delete long articles but not short ones!

Only 2<s>/18</s> of his books have Dawkins in the title, <s>the same fraction of</s> Dawkins's books with "God" in the title (and another 1/9 has "The Devil").

<li><b>Comment</b>. Interesting ... If McGrath has indeed "authored" (whatever that means) over 100 books before his 55th birthday, that is perhaps very telling. Assuming he didn't start until he was (say) 20, that's a rate of three a year. Which (IMHO) suggests that on the whole a book by McGrath is not notable, and probably not worth a WP article. Just a thought. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 09:21, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> for the moment. It's a bit early to delete it. I think the book/pamphlet hasn't yet come out in the USA, and maybe we should wait until it has, and see if it gets reviewed, before getting rid of the article (it is on amazon.co.uk, BTW). But it needs to be kept down to a <b>reasonable length</b>, and not used as the basis for bloggish soapboxery about how Dawkins is evil and incompetent (even if that is what McGrath says in the book - and as far as I can gather from a quick skim, that's about all of any substance that he does say). I share Merzul's concern that only these two books by McGrath are deemed worthy of WP articles. If he is such a notable theological thinker, why are none of his other books worthy of note in their own right? In summary - leave it a month, and then <b>delete</b> if it doesn't meet the criteria. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 14:07, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> It's notable primarily because McGrath is notable. From the look of it, it's only been published in the U.K. thus far, but, once it's landed on the other side of the Pacific, I'm sure it will generate a lot more publicity. It's also less than a month old, so, a lot of reviewers simply might not have gotten around to it yet. I'm taking an eventualist approach to this article; let's reduce the book summary to a <b>reasonable length</b>, as KillerChihuahua suggested, primarily cutting down on the current polemic, essay-like tone. If it doesn't meet notability, size, NPOV, BLP, etc. standards after a month or two, then renominate for AfD. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 15:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> About 20 editors have worked on this article (which is surely strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence of notability!), there are 23 references and 16 books are cited in the summary (out of the c 48 that are cited in the book).

It might be that this article is a bit ahead of its time; maybe it might be good idea to move this article to user space for now and put it back once the notability issues are resolved. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 16:38, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>If the book has only just been published, there seems not to have been any time for things to be written <i>about the book itself</i>. An encyclopaedia article by this title is about the book itself. McGrath's arguments <i>from the book</i> should be presented in articles on the topics that McGrath is arguing about, giving them weight in proportion to their acceptance by the world at large. In other words: That the book is a <i>source</i> does not automatically mean that it warrants an article. Encyclopaedia articles about books are for commentary on the books themselves. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> because the book will almost certainly become N, because of the popular desire to read this viewpoint.The length is absurd, however, and indicates that the article was not written from an objective POV. Once the article is down to the appropriate 2 or 3 paragraph size, a suitably sized section --not a 5% size paragraph--can then be added of quotation of the views of this author's opponents, as they appear, which they surely will, and then there will be a NPOV.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The <i>book</i> has a strong POV and since the summary is a summary of the book, this POV is made clear. But I think the summary always uses terms like "suggests..." for anything remotely controversial and takes no position on whether the suggestions are valid. I don't think that extensive quotations, thus sanitised, make it a POV article. And to be fair to McGrath, the proportion of his books that have "Dawkins" in the title is exactly the same as the proprtion of Dawkins's books that have "God" in the title (2/18 vs 1/9). <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 16:43, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Agent86. Mention in game show article is sufficient. I'm ambivalent about a redirect as it is a pretty common name.

<dd>The general notability criterion says that "A topic is notable if it has sufficient, independent works that are reliable and can act as the basis for an encyclopedic article." The USA Today "article" isn't much more than a passing mention and provides little context. Three of the other articles are, seemingly, local news stories that don't affirm encyclopedic notability. As far as the Rocky Mountain News article is concerned, that article is all about the move and provides no encyclopedic context for us to use, as indeed are quite a few of the others. Indeed, I would say that as far as we have any notability asserted the <i>move</i> of the object is more notable than the object itself. As far as I can see the TV programme made only passing mention of this. Furthermore, three of the articles cited are by the same person. I do not think the primary notability criterion is satisfied. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 15:58, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It is an oddball, but it is very similar to the earlier Tale o the Pup in spirit, albeit not identical. The notability guidelines stress the uniqueness of design, not how interesting the object can be. If just being interesting was a primary notability guideline, we'd have articles on all the funny Paul Bunyons and such which are better suited for a website like Roadside America. <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> Moreschi discusses the media coverage better than I could above. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 16:12, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Done: "In a few rare cases, an individual location will also have architectural peculiarities that makes it unique and notable." The first giant hot dog, unique.

<dd>This line of argument seems to be going off-track from the primary notability standards. Regardless if it is of "unique design" or not, there is now an abundant amount of published works about the subject. Just because it doesn't satisfy the single "unique design" criterion doesn't mean it doesn't pass others like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Deleting this becuae it's not a unique design would be like deleting <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawking_e11c.html" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> because he didn't pose in Playboy. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 07:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Unique design is a key portion of WP:CORP when dealing with gimmicky restaurants like this. The primary reason this hot dog stand has a wikipedia article is due to its unusual design.... Moreschi's statements about the news articles being cited not providing encyclopedic context for this hot dog stand continue to be unaddressed, and add to the question of the stand meeting WP:NOTE. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 07:55, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Published works about the subject is the primary criterion of WP:CORP. Whether any editor's POV is that the design is not unique is completely irrelevent. All the references cited support the encyclopedic content in the article. Some my not think it's "encyclopedic", but WP guildlines dissagrees with that. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 08:05, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Once again, I refer you to Moreschi's question about whether the primary notability guideline is met. Is the object notable or is the movement of the object notable? Are there multiple, non-trivial independent sources? As Moreschi showed, the answer is "no". <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 08:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The answer is "yes". And it's the subject that's notable. There would be no story about the move without the notable subject. That's why multiple non-trivial independent sources are written about it. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 08:27, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please address the concerns as to why the movement of a fast food restaurant makes it notable and encyclopedic raised by Moreschi. Hundreds of other buildings are moved, why are they not notable for the same rationale? The article for Tail o the Pup claims it was built in 1946(although the claim is unsourced, but I'll AGF on the part of whoever added that date since it was prior to this AfD), which would make it the first "giant hotdog shaped" hot dog stand and this an imperfect copy. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 23:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please restrict your opinion to this article Kyaa, not the Tail O The Pup article. This article does not claim notability by being the first of anything, it claims notability for appearance in a movie and being the subject of some media attention.

Right from the article: "He is best-known for being mentioned in an emotional vice-presidential nomination acceptance speech by his father during the 1992 Democratic National Convention." He was also arrested for a misdemeanor, committed a traffic violation, and worked for a non-notable magazine.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: You <b>are</b> aware that the section you quote refers to the merits of a subject changing with new information or wider prominence. That policy, come to that, addresses the situation more pertinent here, that of persistent hammering at existing consensus by dissidents who just plain don't like it: "At times, a group of editors may be able to, through persistence, numbers, and organization, overwhelm well-meaning editors ... Enlarging the pool will prevent the railroading of articles by a dedicated few. In the case of a small group of editors who find that their facts and point of view are being excluded by a larger group of editors, it is worth considering that they may be mistaken."

<li>Why do people keep talking about continuous nominations? There have only been two AFDs on this topic that went full-term, it's been almost six months since the last one, and I wasn't the nominator for either one of 'em. If you think he's notable for whatever reason and that it should be kept, that's great. I disagree with you, but this is Wikipedia, where disagreement falls somewhere between food and oxygen. Just make sure you're basing your argument on something real instead of on some bizarre abstract point about the number of past nominations.

<dd>As I noted in an earlier comment, an AFD is a discussion, not a vote. What kind of a discussion doesn't include responses to other people's comments? If we're all just going to sit here and keep our opinions in little boxes, why even bother to post in the first place? If anything, discussion is needed more on this article than on the average one, since there's so little past consensus on the subject. The ancient VFD was deadlocked 5-4 in favor of deletion, the most exhaustive AFD closed without consensus, and there are reams and reams of discussion on the article's talk page since the last AFD, with people voicing basically every opinion under the sun (keep it as it is, keep the article but remove the arrests, add the arrests to Gore's article and convert this one to a redirect, delete it outright, etc.).

<li><b>Comment</b> Re: the Jeb Bush Jr. analogy. It's not a valid comparison, since Gore's son has been mentioned in numerous media outlets and referenced, albeit in a peripheral way, in notable published books over the course of a decade or longer. Merely being in the media spotlight for a brief period of time isn't equivalent to being the subject of numerous articles, news broadcasts, etc., over the course of a number of years. Granted, all of these citations reflect mostly upon the national prominence enjoyed by his father, but I don't think that necessarily makes him less notable as an individual. <a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 05:39, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hahaha. Harold Stassen reference. I like that. In all seriousness though, this is getting a bit absurd. In terms of the children of well-known politicians Gore's son is certainly notable. Perhaps not as notable as <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_Clinton_376a.html" title="Chelsea Clinton">Chelsea Clinton</a> or <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Carter_51da.html" title="Amy Carter">Amy Carter</a>, but notable nevertheless. A better comparison-rather than Jeb Bush Jr.-would be to <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Bush_d980.html" title="Neil Bush">Neil Bush</a>. I don't think anyone has challenged the notability of the subject of that article. <a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 06:07, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, instead of comparing to children of U.S. Presidents, you should compare to children of failed presidential candidates or of vice presidents. There is a great deal more notability in being the child of an actual president (and thus part of the "first family") than there is associated with simply being the child of a well-known politician. Maybe William H. Mondale should get an article if Al Gore III has one. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 16:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Nom</b> - This is another one of those Internet driven made up holidays.

Will this "holiday" be around in another ten years? Not likely. Another editor suggested this article be merged, but there's little to actually merge, so I've nominated it for deletion. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 16:36, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect and merge</b> any other critical information into <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja_Burger_ef3e.html" title="Ninja Burger">Ninja Burger</a> that isn't already there. <font color="#00688B"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 16:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect and merge</b> if necessary. The material was already on the Ninja Burger page to begin with and was split out this year when the holiday got popular. It is still mentioned on the Ninja Burger website and thus deserves to be part of that article. It is worth pointing out, however, that people here also considered wiping [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day&amp;oldid=79049203|International" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day&amp;oldid=79049203|International" rel="nofollow">Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>] from Wikipedia, which is also "another one of those Internet driven made up holidays". Everything will be non-notable if you delete it the year after it begins to gain traction. If this article fails WP:N or WP:RS then a long hard look needs to be given to the Talk Like a Pirate Day article because it fails on many of the same criteria. Will that "holiday" be around in another ten years? In particular, it is worth noting that the pirate article's intro is almost identical in size and function to the Day of the Ninja one, yet for some reason it is considered adequate while the Ninja one is considered lacking. Also worth questioning is the assertion that there is no WP:RS, which is patently false; the Picsou Magazine coverage is at the very least the equivalent of Talk Like a Pirate Day's Dave Barry article, if not superseding it since it includes an international audience. However, all that said, I still think it belongs with the Ninja Burger article, which is where it was originally. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeonite_09dc.html" title="User:Aeonite">aeonite</a> 17:12, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> the "if we have 'X' then we should keep 'Y'" line of argument has long been discredited. We need to evaluate this article on its own merits (or lack thereof). As a "holiday" - this day simply doesn't exist. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 17:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> My previous comment here did somewhat fail to separate my main point from my tangential commentary. My main reasoning for Redirect and merge is that the content was originally on the Ninja Burger page, and was split out. The content was considered adequate when it was just a subtopic of that page. Thus, it would seem that deleting it would be unwarranted - carve and purge seems less palatable to me than simply restoring an earlier, acceptable state of affairs. I agree that as far as most of the world is concerned, the holiday does not exist, but then neither does Ninja Burger. It seems a fictional holiday might merit a discussion on a page about a fictional company, even if it does not warrant its own page. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeonite_09dc.html" title="User:Aeonite">aeonite</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think so; although the company is fictional, the two published RPGs, best-selling card game, and published book (from the same line as the Real Ultimate Power book and Maddox's Alphabet of Manliness), are quite real and notable. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeonite_09dc.html" title="User:Aeonite">aeonite</a></li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - yes, thanks. I just looked at the website, and it doesn't look particularly notable on its own, either. A lot of subjects are covered by RPGs, books, or movies, but I'm not sure that makes them notable either. That's a topic, though, for a different talk page. This all does help reenforce the idea that a made up holiday within a possibly non-notable website probably isn't worth its own article. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 20:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Very sad person to come accross, but this person I don't think is that notable. Would he be famous if he never died in this horrendous accident? No. Also, I can't see the marshall that died at <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_Italian_Grand_Prix_df69.html" title="2000 Italian Grand Prix">2000 Italian Grand Prix</a> (Paolo Ghislimberti) and the other that died at <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_Australian_Grand_Prix_1596.html" title="2001 Australian Grand Prix">2001 Australian Grand Prix</a> (Graham Beveridge) get their own article.

<li><s><b>Oppose</b> - Flawed logic IMO. Would Michael Schumacher be famous if he hadn't become 7times World Champion? Would Tony Blair be famous if he never became an MP? Would anyone be famous if the event that made them famous/notable not occured. No. The two other marshalls you bring up were hit by debris of race cars, and not seen on TV. They are usually mentioned in passing in the race reports. Van Vurren on the other hand is the only man (AFAIK) to have been hit by a Formula One car, and which was shown on television. In addition many sources are available on his background and the event itself in great detail. I'd say he was notable. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexj2002_245b.html" title="User:Alexj2002">Alexj2002</a> 17:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> per nom. The "flawed logic" argument is completely specious. Tony Blair did things that made him world-famous. Michel Schumacher did things that made him world-famous. Van Vuuren was an otherwise-unremarkable teenager whose sole and tenuous claim to notoriety is that he was killed in an auto race thirty years ago. For all the (alleged) millions who've supposedly seen the clip of his death, a directed Google search turns up only 77 unique hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Grand+Prix&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Jansen+Van+Vuuren&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Grand+Prix&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Jansen+Van+Vuuren&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>, the first several and many of the others of which are this Wikipedia article and its mirrors.

<p>I'm likely to get a huge amount of backlash for this, but this is not a really notable article. Half of this article looks like (or rather is) <b>rumours</b>. This supposed championship is not real, I've never seen this championship. Also, WWE, TNA or ECW wrestlers are not referred to as Triple Crown Champions, I've never heard JR say <b>He's a triple crown Champion.</b> Pure fancruft, and speculation. Nobody even refers to this. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavnel03_a2a9.html" title="User:Davnel03">Davnel03</a> 17:19, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While I appreciate that a great deal of work has gone into this article, it has largely served as a battleground for opinionated claims about what constitutes the accolade in question. Many of the combinations listed on the page are "unofficial" or "arguable" and are thus non-notable. The Triple Crown undoubtedly did exist in as much as it was referred to by commentators and wrestlers for a brief period of time over a decade ago, but the commitment to maintaing an up-to-date list of "Triple Crown Champions", the vast majority of whom have never been formally acknowledged as bearing that title, is clearly fancruft. <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 18:10, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article is not based on rumours, it's based on fact. Shawn Michaels is an acknowledged Triple Crown champion, as are Kurt Angle (whose achievement was recognised when he was released by WWE, not a decade ago) and Triple H. The Merits of the US title claim is a seperate matter and has been the most controversial, however those who have World, Tag and IC titles are well known as Triple Crown champions. It is a case of cutting off the nose to spite the face. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenhusted_5fa7.html" title="User:Darrenhusted">Darrenhusted</a> 23:59, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am torn. I think it should be kept, but clean-up.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Much of it is original research and unsourced information. Move it to a wrestling wiki. Alot of the so called "triple crown champions" for some promotions: have never even been mentioned by the company itself. WWE has made some references to triple crown I believe, but other than that: it's internet/fan speculation on if or what makes a triple crown champion for a certain promotion. In response to TJ's suggestion for a vote to determine if the US title should be included: voting to determine something is a form of original research, and that wouldn't help the article much. Articles on Wikipedia are sourced reliable information, not information voted on by the editors. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 01:09, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Any sources shown are mentions in passing from WWE's website and the term is not widely used. I've never heard the term used on a broadcast and it has plenty of OR and is lacking multiple/independent RS. Just because a term is mentioned in passing does not mean that it deserves a page here. The page also causes a lot of edit wars since the term is not clearly defined, which wastes time. Wrestling titles are fixed/planned anyway, and there are too many pages on titles (like #s and length of reigns) that are notable and sourced, WP doesn't need a cruft page like this about something that is suspect in its own existence. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 02:26, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The problem here isn't that we can't prove if a Triple Crown exists, because it does. It is mentioned both on WWE.com and in TNA with A.J. Styles. The problem is determining what constitutes the Triple Crown. In TNA it's cut and dry (NWA World Title, X Title, NWA Tag Team Titles), in WWE is where we find the slippery slope. There is no disputing what makes up the "Classic Triple Crown" (WWF--now WWE--Title, I-C Title, WWF--now World--Tag Team Titles), it's the brand extension belts that are gumming up the works. The World Title and the WWE Tag Titles have been accepted, but the problems start with the U.S. and ECW Titles. While WWE never officially said they <i>were</i> a part of the TC, they also never said they <i>weren't</i>. Their status has been left murky. Some hints have been dropped as to how they see the titles:</li>
</ul>
<p>--As far as the U.S. Title goes, WWE's Title history page has all of the Titles listed and drawn up on a chart where the Raw belts and Smackdown belts are lined up opposite their corresponding belt, giving the visual impression that I-C on Raw = U.S. on Smackdown. And with the ECW Title now being an option for the Royal Rumble winner (and most likely the Money in the Bank winner) to choose from, that also indicates that they see the WWE, World, and ECW titles as equals.</p>
<p>--However the whole fight is due to the fact that the words "WWE considers the U.S./ECW Titles as part of the Triple Crown/Grand Slam" have never appeared on WWE.com, and all of the hint dropping in the world--even by WWE itself--can be deducted 10 different ways by 10 different people.</p>
<p>--But for the article itself, by all means keep it, as the items in question do exist, it's just a matter of what needs added/subtracted. <a href="../../../o/h/g/User%7EOhgltxg_9ec9.html" title="User:Ohgltxg">Ohgltxg</a> 12:37 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Don't agree with this reasoning at all. Again, just because something exsists does not automatically entitle it to a page. It's not a widely used term, barely used, actually.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - the TCC is real and notable, but it is not verifiable.

<dd>Although I agree with you that it's proper to have notablity and verifiability, if they aren't the latter, thats why they are tagged and placed in a category of articles that need to be verified; thus meaning we shouldn't delete everything we can't explicity find proof to. — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 22:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Although I strongly dislike the amount of arguing that the article has recieved, the subject itself is notable. It's not clearly verifiable because the term is so unclearly defiable anymore. But there is sufficent grounds to keep this as an article. How is this fancruft? These <i>are</i> terms used by WWE! Fancruft is something created by fans to parody, in this case, wrestling, which it's clearly not fancruft since WWE made the terms Triple Crown Championship and Grand Slam Championship.

<li><b>Keep</b> The issue here isn't if it ever existed, but if it's worth mentioning, and I believe it is. It's notifiable and verifiable as pointed out by Moe.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm assuming that the removal of TCC means that all wrestlers listed must have all Triple Crown information removed as well, and that regardless of how the Grand Slam vote goes that the removal of the TCC page means the removal of the Grand Slam page even if there is a vote to keep that particular page. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenhusted_5fa7.html" title="User:Darrenhusted">Darrenhusted</a> 00:02, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I recognize that it's probably a stupid position but yes, I do think that a school district, even if it's completely composed of non-notable schools, is still itself notable. I guess I reach that conclusion because a school district is also a governmental division.

<li><b>Abstain</b>. I accept <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a>'s general comment that school districts, as a governmental division, may have notability even when the schools in the district are not themselves notable. Unfortunately, I don't find adequate references/sources provided by this article, which I think rather messes up this particular case. I'll brood on this and come back to this discussion if I have more coherent thoughts. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:51, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Adequate sources are only pertinent to deletion debate when notability is at issue. There seems to be consensus that even if individual schools are not always notable, that information about them should be merged into an article on the school district or community. Therefore the way to address poor sourcing here is to find better sources and improve the article, not to delete it. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 19:03, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

As it stands, the article fails to make much of case of Mackay's notability. He's mentioned in passing in Peter Narvaez's <i>The Good People</i>, and it appears from this that he did rather more than just write letters to the local paper. Some of his papers given to to the School of Scottish Studies at Edinburgh Uni. What was written about them when they were gifted? I expect something was. There are some signs on google scholar of him being quoted as an expert on Sanday. If I wanted this article to be kept, I'd be toddling over to Stromness, or more likely Kirkwall, to the library to look through their archives for stuff on John D. Mackay. The link Wafulz found states "He delighted in the ensuing publicity, with journalists from several countries coming to Sanday to photograph him with his Siamese cat, Ho Chi Minh." That rather suggests that there are, if someone can find them, non-Orcadian sources on the subject. On the whole, he seems likely to meet our <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guideline. Of course, if after a decent interval there are still no sources <i>in the article</i>, then I'd have to change my mind. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 21:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hopelessly biased toward the subject of the article. I know AFD isn't clean-up, but unlike most articles with POV problems, there's nothing salvageable here. I am tempted to paraphrase <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_McCarthy_%28author%29_6490.html" title="Mary McCarthy (author)">Mary McCarthy</a> and say "Every word in this article is non-neutral, including <i>and</i> and <i>the</i>". The <i>only</i> way to get a neutral article on Korff is to delete this one and have someone else start over from scratch. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 18:41, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This just in: the majority of the article (all except the Criticism and Controversy section) is a copyvio from <a href="http://www.kalkorff.com/?page_id=5" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kalkorff.com/?page_id=5" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>, so I'm removing it. But even the Criticism and Controversy section is unrepentantly pro-Korff in its bias. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 19:00, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Angr, WHY don't you contact Kal Korff and check things out firsthand. You claim "bias" but cannot know the full story unless you check first.</p>
<p>I'm one of the individuals that was mentioned on this problematic Wiki article, in a defamatory fashion. Mr. Korff is creating his own reality via Wikipedia, and publicly attacking specific individuals who have questioned his credibility. In my case, my comments to Mr. Korff have all occurred in semi-private emails (the other folks being defamed were all CC'd), but he has chosen to attack me in the public arena, and on Wikipedia. His entry here on Wikipedia goes against ALL of the community standards, and is as close to a puff promo piece as one can get - witness that the majority of the entry here is directly copied from his "credibility" page on his personal site. I do not really care about what Korff posts on his own web site, but I will NOT stand by while he takes advantage of the public and open nature of Wikipedia. He claims he is working on a "TV show" that is going after "self-proclaimed UFO experts", which is interesting, given that I've never made any such claims about my background or profession. To go into the details of his negativity towards me, Paul Kimball and Royce Myers III is to lower myself to his level, which I will not do. Freedom of personal speech on personal sites does not give Mr. Korff the right to express his opinions on Wikipedia - he is obviously welcome to do that on his own personal page. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Wikipedia is a factual information reference? It's certainly not a blog or self-promotional vehicle. There are clearly posted editorial policies, few of which have been respected in the creation of this article. When Mr. Korff states that he invented a plutonium-based nuclear weapon as a teenager, is he not obliged to provide some sort of material proof or third-party substantiation of this claim? Or can anyone make any claim on Wikipedia, without any proof or backing data? The articles linked at the end of the article all make the situation painfully clear, it all makes for a funny - but sad - read.</p>
<p>Angr, thanks for your attention &amp; diligence in dealing with this situation.</p>

<p>Contested prod.

<p>Qxz, I apologize for reverting your attempt, I did not know what the correct thing to do was, and did not see your message to me on my talk page until after attempting to fix the article. It is OK with me if the Buna Lawrie article is merged with the Coloured Stone article, with a redirect so people looking for Buna Lawrie will at least get some info. I have very little info on Buna himself, and rather more info on the band, so this does seem appropriate. <a href="../../../s/2E/_/User%7ES._M._Sullivan_601f.html" title="User:S. M. Sullivan">S. M.

<li>To whom it may concern: My name is Jeshua De Horta, and as this may seem as self-advertising, I am indeed trying to link my role in expanding the article "Alfred the Great", a note worthy figure, and my contribution in producing a film on his life. This film did several TV runs as well across the US all of which can be verified by imdb.com which I find to be a reliable website. I am not to familiar with how else to verify this but I think in 100 years if someone is searching for information on Alfred the Great and would like to see a film based on his life, they will be able to find information on the film and the person who created it.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is not the case that "anyone can edit" IMDb in the same way they can edit Wikipedia. IMDb should be considered a reasonably reliable source because submissions of the main content of the database (cast and crew lists, etc.) are reviewed by the editorial staff of IMDb before going live on the web site; the database is not 100% accurate, but then neither are newspapers and magazines which we would consider reliable sources. (Of course, the message boards and user comments on IMDb are not subject to editorial control and thus are not included in the content I would consider a reliable source.) --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 22:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Obviously articles often use IMDB as a source for cast lists and the like, but its trivia or biography sections are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, and IMDB will accept reasonable submissions of e.g. obscure independent films, thus it is not evidence of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>.

<p>Located under "Other evidence of Notabilitly" it discusses: "The film represents a unique accomplishment, is a milestone in the development of film art, or contributes significantly to the development of a national cinema, with such verifiable claims as "The only cel-animated feature film ever made in Thailand" " end of quote... The story of Alfred the Great has only been told one other time, inacurately if I may add, almost a half-century ago, and this film can no longer be found in any country in any form. Thus that film no longer exisits as a reliable resource for people today. I would consider this a "milestone" for film as it represents the only viewable, attainable and present-day made tale of 'Alfred the Great'. You will not find a his tale in celluloid anywhere else, for it has not been done. I think the people who know who Alfred the Great is, and his contribution to the world will be shocked that his story has not been cinematized. 'Alfred the Great' is the equvilant of George Washington in England. And if not a single film exisited that depicted the tale of George Washington, and finally one came along, despite it's success, I think it would be important to say that it existed. I'm not trying to sell anything, I am merely trying to inform the world that this film does exist. But I appreciate everyones points thus far, it shows that you take this site seriously Jeshuadehora 01:01, 21 February 2007 (UTC)JeshuaDehorta</p>

<li>The above is user's sole contribution to Wikipedia. One wonders how she came upon the de Horta article, considering that there are nearly 400,000 Google hits for "Alfred the Great" and the first five of them referencing an IMDB film aren't this one, the first several dozen Wikipedia entries returned from a search don't mention it, and de Horta only edited the main Alfred the Great article to include his magnum opus <b>yesterday.</b> I'm really not liking the looks of this. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 03:55, 21 February 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 03:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

When I did research for this project wiki was the first place I went. I think it's ironic that we are having a discussion about posting things that have a significant amount of proof and your accusing me of something that cannot be proved.

<li><b>Comment</b> You may not be too familiary with Wikipedia, Jeshua, but it is unusual that a brand new user would first stumble across an articles for deletion discussion. Not unheard of, but unusual. But it is really beside the point, since <b>AfD is not a vote</b>. The article still fails to meet policy, no matter how many school kids find it useful as a visual aid. As it stands now, this person and this movie do not meet the primary notability criterion: being the subject of <i>multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works</i>, whose sources are independent of the subject itself. That is the Holy Grail of notability for Wikipedia, and this article simply does not make it. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 04:47, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Natalie I appreciate your opinion and if you've taken the time to read my posts you will see that I have actually agreed with everyones arguement regarding the deletion of this post. I understand that "AfD is not a vote" as you said, but I did think it was a safe place to bring up arguements and discuss them. I have only merely brought up my side of it, and listened respectfully to everyone elses. Wikipedia is a marvelous website, and I would not want my opinion of the site be warped by the condensending nature of a few of it's commentators. I never defended my point using ShellyJ comment. The nature of my points, whether right or wrong, was not supported in any way by her comments. I would've expected however someone in the clean-up task force like you would have not wasted her time saying things that are "besides the point" as you mentioned, and stuck to things that are the point. I have taken the time to read the policies that everyone has suggested I read and I have agreed with them. I appreciate everyone who brought up valid points, in a respectful way, and I feel more enlightened now on what goes in wikipedia and what doesen't. And that I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, is what these discussion are all about. Not to put someone down who add their name, but to enlighten them in the reasons why in respectful manner. But if you think my opinion of what a discussion board should be after reading this is still warped than I will take pleasure in the deletion of my name from this site. Jeshuadehora 05:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)Jeshuadehorta Additionally I have to say, that apart from making films and trying to post them on encyclepedia websites to promote my own personal gain&#160;:) I also volunteer much with the INTERFAITH counsel, which is a group of people who gather together from different religions and different races and discuss their differences in a peaceful dialogue. I must say that in my experiance with INTERFAITH that it is very easy for two people to disagree to "put down" the other person. And I think that is the biggest error in our world. I know this has nothing to do with the deletion of my profile, but figured it was worth bringing up while we were bringing up things that are "besides the point"...I do hope however that though you disagree with me on this article's relavence that you can at least disagree with me agreeably.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thanks for understanding. Almost all of the editors who participate regularly in AfDs do so with the intention of improving the integrity of Wikipedia. Please do not take offense when someone points out a single purpose account like ShellyJohnson. I have no idea whether you posted this or not but I will assume good faith, just keep in mind that other users and I who regularly participate in these sort of discussions see this sort of thing pretty often. Many people will try very hard to keep there articles on Wikipedia even to the point of creating <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sock puppet accounts</a> to back up their case when it looks like deletion is imenent. That is generally why single purpose accounts are treated with this sort of suspicion, so please do not take it personally.

<li>OK, getting back to the discussion. I am of the opinion that this article should be <b>Delete</b>d if adequate independent references to its subject cannot be found by the end of this debate. We need reliable independent sources for our articles, and the current references - a corporate website and IMdB - do not seem adequate to me, particularly because they largely reference the film, not the person who is the subject of this article. No objection to re-creation if better references arise later, of course. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:09, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you again Daniel J. for your comment, and in response to WMMartin, I agree whole-heartedly with your opinion that unless my article has more information to support than it should be deleted. My question however, looking to the future is if all my support needs to be found online, or if I can submit different resources... I have a non-local radio interview that I did, I have 2 magazine articles, I have a letter of intent from a distribution company stating where the film played and how many times. And I have several United Kingdom resources (reviews, festival playings, ...etc) that I just can't find online but have or could get in hard copy. Is this a wasted effort? Is there a way I can submit this to wikipedia for further review? I trust and respect the opinion of everyone and I am not here to fight this but merely learn the this process. (This is my first time doing this, so please bare with me) Thank you again Daniel and thank you WMMartin I agree with your points208.64.90.150 19:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC)Jeshua Additionally, would it be better to make an article describing the contents of the film, since all my resources are retaining to the film, rather than having my name? 208.64.90.150 19:49, 21 February 2007 (UTC)Jeshuadehorta</p>

<dd>I agree that we may be getting a little off-topic, but I'm making the following comment here as it has some bearing on this debate:</dd>
<dd>Jeshua, one of the things you need to understand about Wikipedia is that it is not here to act as a publicity vehicle for you or your various endeavours. In my earlier comment I wasn't explicit enough about this, largely to avoid hurting your feelings, but I feel that I need to make this clear. I am very uncomfortable with the potential "conflict of interest" that you are creating. By this I mean that I think that people should almost never be involved in the creation or editing of articles about themselves or their works. Our job as an encyclopedia is to provide reliable and unbiased information. You may well be able to provide us with reliable information about yourself and your projects, but it is very difficult for me ( and I suspect, for others ) to take the information as unbiased, largely because of the source. Suppose there were an article about me or my work ( which heaven forbid&#160;! ): if I made contributions to the article I'd naturally want to pick the nice references that reflect well on me, but I wouldn't mention the things that made me look bad. This would be great for my ego, but wouldn't make for a good ( unbiased ) encyclopedia article. The same is always going to be true when you make contributions to Wikipedia about yourself and your projects.</dd>
<dd>The best advice I can give you is really this: remember <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Welles_8fe7.html" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a>. For him the equivalent of Wikipedia was the old Encyclopedia Britannica, but when he made <a href="../../../t/o/o/Too_Much_Johnson_041e.html" title="Too Much Johnson">Too Much Johnson</a> he didn't bother about his encyclopedia entry, he just started work on <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a>. One of the marks of great artists is that they let their works stand on their merits. People recognise quality, and react well to it. Focus on doing the best you can in your work, and the success and fame, and the Wikipedia entries, will come along when you've forgotten all about this debate. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 11:18, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While 'I know the original author and he wants this article gone' isn't all that valid a reason; Mr. Phillips could get on Wikipedia himself and make his own case if he were so determined (and assuming this is taken responsibly, like it should, he just might eventually). So instead, consider this: this article contributes nothing toward Wikipedia in terms of actual encyclopedic material. I am of the mind that this article will NEVER be edited or expanded to the extent that it WOULD deserve recognition as a worthwhile article for Wiki. Given the topic of the article outright, deletion should be obvious - it's an eight-year-old internet comic with no notable history in the past five years, and the article does less to describe the comic than to describe what Josh Phillips hasn't done with it, which can just as easily go on a personal page for him (assuming THAT would even be relevant to Wikipedia). Larger and more notable webcomics, ones that have actually been popular in the here and now, aren't even being allowed to remain on Wiki, and an argument that Avalon has won WCCA awards in the past should be groundless, given that the WCAA article itself is up for deletion. At the very least, I am requesting that some consistency be shown across the board for webcomic deletion, especially given that this article deserves it more; this should not remain as a testament to nostalgia. I understand that this sort of thing isn't smiled upon here. True.mcdohl 19:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment regarding the books:</b> If anyone still has the book they purchased, I'd be surprised if it was still in one piece -- the binding was terrible, never mind the print quality. I have to admit the real evidence of this publication attempt is the stack of two dozen books on my shelf that I couldn't successfully repair. The initial sales run was cut short when the publishing quality was revealed, and I recall there was a significant number of customers who tried and failed to obtain refunds (it also says a lot that I, the book's author, could not get reliable info on sales and distribution). No ISBN was ever registered for the book, and it was only sold directly from the publisher, Maverick Camel, so I doubt any official record of the publication could ever be found -- hence my original comment that no evidence of the publication existed. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaedtler_f122.html" title="User:Staedtler">Staedtler</a> 04:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Puffed-up biography, sounds moderately impressive but no verification is given; notable verification was not found by my searches. Part of a series of spam articles that included Everest Rescue Trust, The Sagarmatha Limb Centre, The Sagarmatha Sherpa Shed, and Alpine Wasp. This one sort-of asserts notability so I didn't go for speedy delete. Other editors are of course welcome to tag it with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-a7_53d5.html" title="Template:Db-a7">db-a7</a>}} if they feel that's warranted. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span>acan</a></span> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant: small-caps">lk</span></a> — 20:42, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article appears to be a legitimate article copy-pasted-then-modified to become a nonsense entry; searching for the phrase "Het Smut" turns up, understandably, more sex-related hits than motorcycle hits.

<p>As mentioned on the discussion page, Het Smut is a character who was recently featured in an issue of The New Fake and Dumb News. It seems as if a fan has taken it upon his/herself to create this article for said character.

<p>WWE DVD's are not-notable enough to have their own article on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a website what lists DVD's; it is an information source that is meant to given people information. This article does give people info; but it is pure-fancruft. Films are all sorts of different things, WWE DVD's (of this type) go through the same format of reviewing somebody's career.</p>

<li><b>Various</b> I'm not sure if a mass nomination is the right thing here. I don't think most of these need their own pages, violating WP:NOT (directory, indiscriminate info). It's very hard for me to give a clear vote, but I would <b>Weak Keep</b> the Warrior DVD due to its nature and various lawsuits/etc., <b>Merge/Redirect</b> most of the biographical ones, which basically are just a match listing and borderline spam. The biographical ones are just rehashes of amazon.com listings. <b>Delete</b> the Diva DVDs, WWE Championship, ECW (Violent matches) and Steel Cage. <b>Merge</b> "Rise and Fall of ECW", since their history is well documented on the main pages. That should cover them all, but I think portions of this should be relisted.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> most of these are biographical in nature dealing with the careers/history of the subjects who all meet the notability requirement, they are produced by the number one wrestling company in the world sold through some of the biggest US &amp; International DVD retail chains so they're not "insignificant" either, I agree that some of them could be expanded but that's a different matter <a href="../../../m/p/j/User%7EMPJ-DK_0cbc.html" title="User:MPJ-DK">MPJ-DK</a> 06:50, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. In response to MPJ-DK: Playboy and other entertainment is also sold in major retail: there isn't mass articles of Playboy DVDs listed here. Same goes for all the sports DVDs (for major events, bloopers and so on). Being sold in major retailers isn't enough to support keeping them. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 17:37, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> do the playboy DVDs have bios on the people in them? are there documentaries? The fact that they're produced by the biggest wrestling company in the world, mainly about people who qualify as "Notable" and sold world wide in major retail stores certain adds to the "notabilty" of the product, considering that the decission to delete a lot of RoH DVDs was "well they're a fringe wrestling product". Add to the fact that some have been shown in the UK and elsewhere and I'd say that most of these DVDs do in fact warrant an entry - one big collective list or individual pages, whichever. And in closing, what there is or isn't for Playboy isn't really relevant in this conversation at all that's like saying "Well they don't close the schools because of snow in the Bahamas" <a href="../../../m/p/j/User%7EMPJ-DK_0cbc.html" title="User:MPJ-DK">MPJ-DK</a> 20:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Playboy: like WWE, is a well known company with lots of DVDs out. Wikipedia shouldn't be turned into a DVD guide. Also to expand about Playboy a little: yes they do have some bio DVDs, as well as normal ones. WWE has bio DVDs and regular DVDs and so on. That's how it's relevant. Some airing on UK: fine, keep those. But ones that haven't: probably should be deleted. As for "elsewhere", some of the DVDs have aired on PPV: that doesn't add much, considering Playboy has PPV specials, as does many things. Not everything on PPV should have an article here. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 22:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to let you all know, Sky Sports have got the UK rights to play all biographical wrestler DVDs. So all those that are biographical in nature could be played on Sky sports. btw the one's already played in the UK are Andre the Giant, Bret Hart and The Undertaker: This Is My Yard. The other Undertaker one is going to be aired and Roddy Piper's is going to be aired also.

Still, part of the reason I created the list was that I had never seen any comprehensive list of all the end credits themes.

<li><b>Delete</b> - While it is true that the music of the Sopranos has been written about, none of the articles' sources mention the end credits musical selection. Two of the sources pick the "top ten musical moments," none of which are from the end credits, and the third is a gripe about the song selection on the soundtrack album with, again, no mention of the end credits. Thus no sources are offered for which the end credits music is the subject. The article does not explain why the music of the end credits specifically has any significance either within the fiction or in the real world. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:26, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Although you're correct that none of the articles focus specifically on the ending music, at least half of the songs cited in both the <i>Star-Ledger</i> and MSNBC were played over the end credits. Also, the Salon article mentions several ending songs. Really, the majority of pop music on the show that's of thematic significance is played at the end credits, though there are plenty of clear exceptions. I do need to find a citation that notes this. I guess the reason I made the article was that the ending music is something of a constant on the show; the viewer comes to expect a song as the screen fades to black. Attempting to catalog every song that's played on the show seems much less feasible, and also less useful, I think. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebogusman_6391.html" title="User:Thebogusman">Thebogusman</a> 03:54, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> a lot of times, thank you very much. Now I don't think you're ever going to agree with me, but maybe you can at least see my reasoning. I think we've established that music in the Sopranos on the whole is notable - it is indeed been the subject of works in several independent reliable sources. Would we want a list with <i>all</i> songs that are played during the show? No, I don't think so. (correct me if I am wrong here). Hence, let's take the most notable part of it. What is it? Well, the same sources assert that it is probably the music played over the ending credits of each episode. Henceforth, I do believe that the subject for the article is notable enough such that it merits existence. Hope you can see my line of reasoning. I'd love to get more third party input into this discussion though, that would make things more clear. --<a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimlei_9818.html" title="User:Gimlei">Gi<font color="green">m</font>lei</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimlei_6df7.html" title="User talk:Gimlei"><i>(talk to me)</i></a></sup></small> 18:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Though the article is actually a review of a Sopranos Soundtrack album, it devotes its first of six paragraphs to highlighting the effectiveness of the show's closing music, and spends much of the rest of it referring to songs that end the show. I don't know if that's sufficient or not. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebogusman_6391.html" title="User:Thebogusman">Thebogusman</a> 18:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Perhaps just a Music used in The Sopranos would be the best solution. Copy the end credit info, and add more info about the rest of the music.

<li>I think that's a good idea. I had considered it, but was unsure how to include stuff about other songs while keeping NPOV. Actually I noticed there's already an article titled <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_played_at_the_Bada_Bing_club_f550.html" title="List of songs played at the Bada Bing club">List of songs played at the Bada Bing club</a> that probably has less justification for existence than this one, since it provides minimal citation and justification. Perhaps these could all be merged into one article, where distinctions are drawn between what gets played at the Bada Bing, what Tony listens to in the car, what the kids listen to in their rooms, etc. as well as the significant thematic importance of other, non-incidental music, particularly those songs used in the closing credits. The only problem would be finding outside citations that support all this. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebogusman_6391.html" title="User:Thebogusman">Thebogusman</a> 22:14, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps a rewording of the title, something suggesting only significant or important music is in the article.

<dd>I hesitated before forming this view, because the article has only just been created, and a case could be made for waiting for the article to develop. What swayed me was the observation that the article's creator is busily engaged in adding a whole slew of new school articles, and once he's created them he doesn't spend time establishing notability - he just moves on to the next article. I feel this isn't appropriate: by all means add an article about a school, and take a week or two to build it up to our usual high quality, but the wholesale creation of articles that don't meet our basic criteria for notability ( which, remember, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enotability.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wp:notability">is not subjective</a> ) looks to me like an abuse of the system: if someone creates an article they should at least try to show why the subject is worthy of attention. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:35, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Notability neither asserted nor demonstrated, and references are inadequate. ( Note, for non-English readers, that the previous head teacher's OBE is not particularly notable: hundreds , and sometimes thousands, of such honours are awarded each year. Where the honour reaches the level of KBE/DBE we should sit up and take notice - see, for example, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Hollows_aa4c.html" title="Sharon Hollows">Sharon Hollows</a> - but OBEs and MBEs are largely for time-servers and minor achievements. ) <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This is an exceptional school. In the latest Ofsted inspection an 'Outstanding' assessment was made of three curriculum areas, an unusual occurrence. Despite what is said above, OBEs are seldomly awarded to primary school heads and are given only for significant achievements; when an OBE is given to a long standing head then notability is inevitably shared with the school since the head achieves good results through the team they lead. Further, the School was the subject of a significant published report.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 23:52, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A useful analogy might be an excellent but obscure fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm, such as Der Gevatter Tod. There would no question of the notability of an article on such a story, even if no external source could be found that discussed that story specifically, right? Here we have an ongoing story told in fairy-tale form, a story that has engrossed the loyalty and affections of many people across the Internet. This comic has been nominated repeatedly for awards, and was selected as a "presenter" of an award in 2005; hence, it is clearly one of the most notable web-comics and there are reliable external sources citing it. Indeed, more people probably know of Andrea Peterson's story than know of Der Gevatter Tod, although that too is an excellent and engrossing tale. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillowW_a94c.html" title="User:WillowW">Willow</a> 22:36, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, the Grimms are very notable, but the author of this comic is rather less so. The artistic merits of the comic are irrelevant for the purposes of its inclusion in Wikipedia.

<li>Hi, you seem to have missed my point, so I'll clarify. I did not claim that Andrea Peterson is more notable than the Grimm brothers, nor did I claim that her story was "art". Rather, I argued that <i>her story</i> was better known and, hence, more notable than many analogous stories that would reasonably be considered notable, such as Der Gevatter Tod. Two external sites that reference her work are <a href="http://www.ccawards.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ccawards.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.comixpedia.com/node/1784" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.com/node/1784" rel="nofollow">here</a>. She has been interviewed several times, which were published externally, such as <a href="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/llperks/vpost?id=1436737" class="external text" title="http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/llperks/vpost?id=1436737" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://studio.paperfox.org/candy/index_2.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1128643001&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=12&amp;content=articles.php" class="external text" title="http://studio.paperfox.org/candy/index_2.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1128643001&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=12&amp;content=articles.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The story has been favorably reviewed by several external sites as well, such as <a href="http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=3081&amp;issue=2004-04-01" class="external text" title="http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=3081&amp;issue=2004-04-01" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.enterthedream.net/webcomicbookclub/full.php?cid=223" class="external text" title="http://www.enterthedream.net/webcomicbookclub/full.php?cid=223" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li>Thanks for providing the sources. It's not unusual for a webcomic to be well covered online, but the sources you cite do not appear to be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> - i.e., sources with a reputation for fact-checking and serious research. Although Sequential Tart, which looks to be fairly professional, <i>might</i> qualify, the others appear to be blogs, forums and other enthusiast-run projects. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 23:13, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmm. From what I've learned in the recent flurry of AfDs, Comixpedia is an online magazine. The site readily agrees, and has such things as monthly articles, issue archives and cover art, with the more modern blog, forum and wiki elements on top of that base. (Sure, it looks rather ugly, but so do I and the site at least works.) Apparently it actually pays writers, and while the amounts are symbolic that sets it well apart from the usual enthusiast work. I think it should count. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 06:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ah, now that I actually read what my mind, assuming it to be an advertising banner at the bottom of an empty page, was filtering out... yes, I see. Lousy layout, this. Anyway, while I'd not have nominated this article under these circumstances, I'm not withdrawing the nomination, because I'm not convinced of all this underground-flavoured notability. Marginal coverage by subculture publications and receiving a marginally notable subculture award (itself still up for AfD) is less than impressive in my view – and I am a regular reader of webcomics! – but I'm aware that many other editors may feel differently. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 18:28, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a music almanac, and we shouldn't be in the business of keeping track of every top-n-songs list ever published. All the articles I've nominated are nothing but the list, no commentary, no explanation of the importance of the particular list, and as far as I can tell, none of these lists are linked from anywhere else. There's a copyvio issue here too: although the articles may not be cut &amp; paste from the published list, the assembly of the list constitutes a creative act, and republishing the list in full is violating the copyright of the lists themselves. With no commentary or other use of the lists at all, there is no reason to think it's fair to use those lists in this way. Also, there is a direct precedent: see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_New_Zealand_Top_Fifty_Singles_of_2003_31b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/New Zealand Top Fifty Singles of 2003">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/New Zealand Top Fifty Singles of 2003</a>.

<li>A better rebuttal is <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a>. Just because information is useful doesn't mean it belongs in an encyclopedia. In fact, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a> is full of that kind of information. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 00:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Then a better tag would have been to request that the articles be MOVED to wikisource. If these pages are deleted, we've lost a very good resource. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 01:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If that's what you prefer, say so. Personally, I prefer deletion because of the copyright issue. Also, I'm not actually sure this kind of thing really belongs on Wikisource -- are there similar entries over there? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 01:19, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I couldn't say so at the time - I'd never heard of wikisource! Having looked over there, I still can't work out what the hell it's supposed to be anyway. It looks like a collection of notebook scraps. There are a few websites dedicated to these sorts of lists for UK / US statistics and copyright does not appear to be an issue for these (for example see polyhex.com and everyhit.com) so it's unlikely that there would be copyright issues for the NZ ones. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 01:27, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>RESPONSE BY AUTHOR:&gt;&gt;&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia is full of articles of people who make significant contributions to society. This article is similar in content and grammatically superior to many of these. There is no attempt at vanity here; this is purely informative and demonstrative of the background faith journey and commitment of a highly popular Catholic Lay Theologian and speaker whose work reaches out to thousands of faithful across three continents. The proposed reasons for deletion here appear based on notability and vanity, neither apply as the subject's website clearly shows (has the proposer read this??). Is it because this is a religious topic? Religious person? Please advise. As for the spam claim, this may be a stylistic issue based on the content. If the deletion is based on style, please advise. This is a first time posting and can be improved if advice rather than criticisim is offered. - John Rae-Kelly (article author)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Please don't try to claim that articles are accepted or rejected because of people's tastes on religion or anything else. The reason the article has been proposed for deletion is because it doesn't meet the standards that Wikipedia articles require. Here they are for you.
<ul>
<li>Verifiability - Read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - no verifiable sources about the subject are quoted, bar her own website, which can't count.</li>
<li>Notability - Read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>- why is the subject notable enough? And again, independent sources are required.</li>
<li>Spam - Read <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> - the plug for ARK Ministries, obviously the subjects own, violates this.</li>
<li>"This article is similar in content...." No, it isn't because pages that remain must assert verifiability and notability. Please also read <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a></li>
<li>"...and gramatically superior" Really.</li>
<li>Finally, try also <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a></li>
<li>And of course, if most or all of these guidelines can be met, then the article stands a good chance of remaining.</li>

<p>Thank you for the excellent advice and even the occasional terse editorial comment (ergo "really"). It is extremely beneficial to a first time wiki user to learn from more practiced users such as yourself. I assure you that the grammatical standard of the sample sites I have visited has been varied indeed. In terms fo your main points, I will revise the article accordingly and hopefully meet your editorial standard.</p>

<li><b><s>Speedy</s> delete as copyvio</b> I was going through the article trying to clean it up and see where the various links pointed and if they were relevant as sources to indicate notability when I found <a href="http://www.annaprae.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.annaprae.com/" rel="nofollow">Anna Rae-Kelly's webpage</a>. About half-way down the page is her bio. Most of the article is a word for word copy of that bio. There is a clear copyright notice at the bottom of the webpage.

A google search on the name of the team yields more results than one for the league, but a lot of those hits are Wikipedia and its mirrors. Many of the rest are on the website cited as being the source (under "External link"). <a href="http://www.tuskegee.edu/Global/story.asp?S=1251664" class="external text" title="http://www.tuskegee.edu/Global/story.asp?S=1251664" rel="nofollow">This link</a> is some college listing all alums who became pro football players, including several who played for this team. The team seems to get some chatter in blogs and forums, but those aren't <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. I imagine though that sources could be found if someone had a book about the history of pro football or something. The amount of forum and blog mentions leads me to think it might be notable, but one would have to dig to find sources and flesh the article out. Try back issues of sports magazines and Alabama newspapers from 1979 and 1980, books about American Football, etc. I'm inclined to say it's one of those borderline articles where notability is probably present but will take work to find.

<dd>Yes, and several of those 30 unique hits are mentions in forums and blogs. Not reliable sources, and usually just mentions in passing, but interesting nonetheless. <a href="http://www.satelliteguys.us/archive/index.php/t-3191.html" class="external text" title="http://www.satelliteguys.us/archive/index.php/t-3191.html" rel="nofollow">This</a>, for example, is a forum thread discussion the possible demise of NFL Europe. Someone's suggesting that if NFL Europe folds they should bring the teams to the U.S. and suggests cities that could house the teams, including Birmingham. Someone responds with, "Man, that is all Birmingham needs, another pro-football team to fail," and mentions the Vulcans in that context. <a href="http://www.wfl1974.com/THE_WFL_FOLDS.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.wfl1974.com/THE_WFL_FOLDS.htm" rel="nofollow">This</a> is about a different minor league, the WFL folding, and the reaction to Birmingham loosing a pro football team. Again, in passing, it mentions the Vulcans, saying, "The Alabama Vulcans came about in the late '70's as a member of the American Football Association, but this league was not on the scale or caliber of the USFL, WFL, etc. This incarnation of the Vulcans lasted only the 1979 season." Like I said, notability is weak, but I think a case could be made for it. If someone could dig up these books (mentioned on <a href="http://www.birminghamprosports.com/alabamavulcansmain.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.birminghamprosports.com/alabamavulcansmain.htm" rel="nofollow">This website</a>, which has some statistics) they might be good sources for expanding the article:</dd>

The sources ONUnicorn came up with are problematic because we (1) don't know what's in them, and (2) chances are good it's nothing but some ordinary statistics, which wouldn't make for encyclopedic material. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 01:28, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The fact is, Wikipedia has a lot of chronological information on it, from membership in Congress to dates of various sporting events. This is yet another such presentation. Certainly daily schedules or individual channels would be a bit much, but the nationwide broadcasts are another matter. TV Guide, newspapers, other magazines have articles on what the major networks will be showing each year. This may not interest you, but that's not grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. American culture is very TV-centric, and in the days before cable was so ubiquitous, extremely network-TV-centric. I'd be inclined to think that the basic network schedules for any season, at least through the 80s (and probably up until now), are necessary references to provide any kind of encyclopedic view of U.S. cultural history for those years. And the influence of Saturday morning TV on kids of the 60s-80s is probably even greater than the average influence of TV on people... just look at any of the popular shows now that are written by people who were kids then, like <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot_Chicken_07e1.html" title="Robot Chicken">Robot Chicken</a> -- knowing about the shows on this schedule is almost a requirement to fully enjoy those shows, and this page gathers them together in a logical manner. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 21:49, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is not original research, there is no theory here, no cause advanced, merely facts that could easily be sourced. That they aren't now doesn't mean they can't be.
