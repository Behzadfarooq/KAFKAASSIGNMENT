<p>This sourceless article has no encyclopedic value, for this topic is fundamentally unencyclopedic. Wikipedians have no right to label certain persons as being polymaths or not; We can't have this article for the same reason we can't have list of <i>smart</i> people. I have taken the liberty of adding a few names of what I thought to be quintessential polymaths to the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a> article. Let us see if we can find a few indisputable polymaths, list them there and delete this mess. <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a> 18:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry to be picky, as I'd prefer to see the article deleted, but, unlike many "list of X" articles in this case there <b>is</b> an article on X. Since <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a> is an encyclopedic topic, it seems to me that a list of polymaths is encyclopedic. More correctly, a list of people who have been referred to as "polymaths" by sources meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is encyclopedic. I agree that the list should be in the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a> article and should not be broken out until it becomes unreasonably long. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:41, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're absolutely right: it's not the topic itself that is unencyclopedic, but the format in which the topic was presented. <i>See my response to you below.</i>-- <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a> 01:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. No sources are cited on this page. Inclusion on this list seems far too subjective and open to interpretation. I have no objections to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">veriably</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sourced</a> material being merged to the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a> article, though. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpiondollprincess_f1a6.html" title="User:Scorpiondollprincess">Scorpiondollprincess</a> 18:43, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. Can we get rid of List of Virgins and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_believed_to_have_been_affected_by_bipolar_disorder.html" title="List of people believed to have been affected by bipolar disorder">List of people believed to have been affected by bipolar disorder</a> for the same reasons while we're at it? <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrabapplecove_aff7.html" title="User:Crabapplecove">Crabapplecove</a> 21:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for want of criteria. Many of these entries are horribly exaggerated, as if Vladimir Putin being a politician, spy, and judo wrestler qualified him as a polymath. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 22:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. If kept, move the unsourced items—that is to say, <b>all of them</b>—to Talk, effectively blanking the article, then monitor list to make sure that they are not reinserted without sources. To avoid utter subjectivity, the cited source must of course actually use the word "polymath." Experience has shown that the argument that "the linked article will have the sources" doesn't hold up in practice. For example, literally picking one at random, the article on <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Gell-Mann_e5d9.html" title="Murray Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a> does not describe him as a polymath, let alone cite a source. We can have a list of people described as "polymaths" by reliable sources. We can't have a list of people who, in the opinion of Wikipedia editors, ought to be called "polymaths" based on a list of their fields of accomplishment. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for redundancy, amongst other things. I originally suggested a merge but the more I read, the more I'm in agreement with this instead - the Category:Polymaths does equally well, and this list has become little more than a populistic exercise for anyone who thinks their heroes deserving of additional recognition. A handful of names as polymathic examples in the Polymath article more than suffices. Gravelrash 14:44, 1 August 2006 (EST)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Discussion above applies to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_polymaths&amp;oldid=66894615" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_polymaths&amp;oldid=66894615" rel="nofollow">this version</a> I've now moved the unsourced items to Talk, and reinserted a couple of them in the article with references.<a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:10, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So is the question is whether those few names that can be verified deserve their own list... My inclination is to say, "no, at least for now"; let's just put those verifiable names in the main <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a> article and keep them there until it starts to get too large. -- <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a> 01:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Certainly works for me. I put the two referenced names in the current article. I'll personally put them into the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a> article, and I'll personally move the huge unsourced list to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolymath_61df.html" title="Talk:Polymath">Talk:Polymath</a> to avoid any comments about "merge and delete" being invalid. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 09:37, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> the two verified names into <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a>. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 14:29, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>, redundant, and for being based on what strikes me as largely arbitrary and POV-based criteria. <a href="../../../t/g/i/User%7ETgies_36e1.html" title="User:Tgies">Tgies</a> 05:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Participants in this discussion may also wish to take part in the discussion now taking place at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolymath_61df.html#List_of_Polymaths_or_Noted_Polymaths_or_Quintessential" title="Talk:Polymath">Talk:Polymath#List of_Polymaths or Noted Polymaths or Quintessential</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:58, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I would have said <i>Merge</i> per RJHall, but the two are already listed in the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">polymath</a> article (along with other cited examples). <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 19:00, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I ask participants in this discussion to put <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a> on their watchlist... last night a non-logged-in user made a wholesale insertion of entries into the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html#Polymaths" title="Polymath">polymaths section</a> of the article, in the same unsourced format as the version of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_polymaths.html" title="List of polymaths">List of polymaths</a> which was nominated for deletion, without edit comments, and without discussion at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolymath_61df.html" title="Talk:Polymath">Talk:Polymath</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 09:58, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
