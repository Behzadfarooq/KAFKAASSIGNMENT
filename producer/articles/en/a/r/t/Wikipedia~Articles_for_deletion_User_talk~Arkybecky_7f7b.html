<b>Penny Jay, award winning country music singer/songwriter and former Grand Ole Orpy star, passed away in local hospital on March 29 at age 80</b></p>
<p>'<b>Nashville, Arkansas - April 9, 2006'</b>-- Every patient diagnosed with cancer has a different reaction when hearing the dreaded word or words from their physician. Helen Moyers (known as Penny Jay in her professional world) held her head high when she heard those words directed toward her and she proceeded to make the best of her two months time she had left. Penny followed the example of her only child, Mrs. Bobby (Sherry) Chambers, who during the past four years has survived two bouts of lung cancer and one of breast cancer. Sherry demonstrated an unfailing faith and courage and now remains cancer free, and with God's help had the strength to tend to her mother's needs in her last days.</p>
<p>Up until three weeks before her death, Penny spent time each day in her music room at her home on Peachtree Street in Nashville (which she fondly called Penny Ridge). She enjoyed copying selections from her vast music library to share with family and friends. However, the retired entertainer no longer dressed in her shiny, usually gold colored, stylish outfits, for which she was named "Golden Girl" because she was as shiny as a penny (or as gold) when performing. The songwriter was comfortable in her bathrobe and with a cup of coffee on her desk the past few weeks. Decreased vision and diminished hearing did not affect the writer's ability to continue with ideas for a song. Daily the artist wrote down her thoughts and visions and would even get out of bed to do so when the words came to her for a song. To date there are several hundred of her songs waiting to be reviewed and published which are kept in neat boxes in her office. Her family intends to honor her wishes and keep the writer's work available for others to enjoy.</p>
<p>"Penny Jay" was born Helen Florence Jeanette Adams on June 12, 1925 in the town of Monteagle located in the SE part of Tennessee. She moved from Nashville, TN to Nashville, AR in 1996. She is survived by her daughter and devoted son-in-law, Sherry &amp; Bobby Chambers of Nashville, Arkansas, with whom the deceased had lived for the past 10 years.</p>
<p><i>MeMaw</i> was the cherished name she was called by her grandchildren: Sunny and Billy Murphy - Nashville, AR and Bobby Chambers, II and Kim Chambers - Nashville, AR</p>
<p>Great grandchildren all from Nashville, AR - Christine Murphy, Bobby(BJ) Chambers, III, and Michael Murphy.</p>
<p>Helen is survived by a beloved brother, Barney Adams, Jr., and caring nephew, Jerry Adams, both from Knoxville, TN., two nieces, Kristi Dawdy. from Atlanta, GA and Kim Grove from Hollywood, CA.</p>
<p>Helen was preceded in death by her loving husband, William T Moyers, her parents, Barney Adams, Sr. And Edna Louise Tobbit Adams, a brother Harold Adams and nephew Michael Adams.</p>
<p>A grave side service was held for the late Helen Moyers (Penny Jay) in Knoxville, TN on April 1, 2006, and arrangements were handled by Highland Memorial Funeral Home.</p>
<p>The late artist will be remembered for many accomplishments. Her daughter said her mother had a good life. "She got to go and do more than others could have dreamed," said Sherry Chambers. She noted Penny Jay started her music career singing in church with her mother at age 10 and then at age 12 performed in the Blue Ridge Mountain Cowgirls Band where she sang and played bass fiddle. The artist played with the Cas Walker Band, a group which also gave many other country and bluegrass music performers their start. The performer traveled and sang high tenor several years with Jimmy Martin and his bluegrass band. Over the years the late artist was under contract with several record companies. She signed with Decca Records when a slot opened due to the unfortunate death of the late, great Patsy Cline.</p>
<p>For seven years Helen (Penny Jay) held the world title of "champion doghouse fiddle player." In 1963 the writer received a country music award for Female Song Writer of the Year for her gold record, Don't Let Me Cross Over, which has been recorded by over 100 singers. Skeeter Davis, a friend of Penny's, got her start in country music with a number one hit when she recorded Set Him Free, written by the late Penny Jay.</p>
<p>A compassionate person, Penny Jay befriended a convict and was instrumental in getting him released from prison. Knowing he was a good musician and song writer she gave the parolee an opportunity to work with her. Together, they wrote the number one 1964 hit song entitled Widow Maker which was sung by Jimmy Martin.</p>
<p>When reviewing the Broadcast Music (BMI) files you'll find Helen Moyers (Penny Jay) credited as the author of many, many songs a number of which are still being selected for recording today. Dolly Parton chose the author's song Don't Let Me Cross Over for her country Treasures album. Adam Wade recorded the same song with a pop flair. This gold record winning song proved to a hit no matter the genre.</p>
<p>"My mother was loyal and patriotic and wrote a wonderful song entitled I'd Rather Have America which was recorded by Wynn Stewart", Chambers said. This song was one used during her many USO tours with the 7-piece Al Runyon Band in the 1950-60's to Okinawa, Korea, Formosa, Greenland, Iceland, Labrador and Goose Bay. Sherry added, "Mother went to places behind the lines where other performers felt it wasn't safe to travel." This act of patriotism was remembered and the late singer was honored with the American flag draped on her coffin during recent funeral services in Knoxville.</p>
<p>Sherry Chambers noted her favorite songs sung by her mother were: My Gravy Train (a song written by Penny Jay for her husband, Bill Moyers, Sherry;s father) and Convict's Angel (written by Penny Jay). "Mother sounded like an angel when she sang that song," said Sherry.</p>
<p>Although she missed her mother during the times Penny was on tour, she and her father, "Daddy Bill" Moyers, kept the home fires burning awaiting the traveler's return. Sherry said her memories of playing backstage at the opry with Loretta Lynn's older children, the young Everly Brothers and Pam Tillis will be remembered and was a way of staying close to her mother.</p>
<p>Sherry joined her mother's band Penny Jay and the SonJays as soon as she graduated from high school and began touring with the group. The drums became this young lady's love and she has been noted as the first woman drummer in country music, debuting in 1965. We hear her singing and dancing abilities were appreciated as well. Although the drums were her love in the performing world, she soon found true love when she became acquainted and married one of the band's key guitar pickers and singer named Bobby Chambers.</p>
<p>In browsing the many scrapbooks covering Helen Moyers' (Penny Jay's) life, the family came upon a piece printed in one of the 1960's Penny Jay Fan Club Newsletter and written by dear friend Ruth Charon.</p>

<hr />
<p><i>The Dynamic Presence of Penny Jay</i></p>
<p>The masterminds of the ages and even the depth defying mind of Albert Einstein have been unable to decipher the mysterious wonders of the galaxies and eons of time far beyond. These strange nomadic mysteries have been brought to earth in all their beauty and glory through the golden songs of Penny Jay, the reigning Queen of space and earth.</p>

<p><br />
Helen Moyers (Penny Jay), known as the Golden Girl, has now gone home.</p>
<p>Shalom</p>
