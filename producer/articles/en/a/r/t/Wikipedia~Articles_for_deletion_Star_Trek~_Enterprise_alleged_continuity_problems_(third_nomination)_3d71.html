<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. I confess, however, that in the past I've read this article myself and enjoyed it, although this temporal cold war business serves as an object lesson to any writer who thinks time travel is a substitute for creativity. Memory Alpha has made it clear that they don't want it, as has Wikipedia. I suspect, however, that this article, or one very much like it, could have a long and fruitful history on someone's personal website or wiki. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:04, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Please visit it for more indepth discussion of various issues regarding this AFD.</p>
<p>This article is severe fancruft and full of opinion. While the fact that there were continuity problems with the series may be encyclopedic, the nature and discussion of those problems on wikipedia are not necessary. During the last AFD it was proposed that the article be moved to the Star Trek wiki <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Main_Page" class="external autonumber" title="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It would be prudent to do so and simply mention in the original Enterprise article there were continuity issues and let people goto the Star Trek wiki and read about it if they so wish. This article contains a lot of original research, referencing many alleged fan opinions that would be impossible to source properly here. Not to mention the title of the article is "alleged" problems, which conveys a clear message that this article is opinion. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:59, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This is now the third time this has been AfDed, and it survived both previous times. No convincing reason given to overturn those results. "Cruft" is always a weak reason for deletion, and an oft-misunderstood one at that. Isn't original research either, as it does cite sources. Slap a cleanup tag on it if there are problems, but I see no reason to overturn two previous AfDs. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:55, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is original research when just about every paragraph contains sentences like "Some fans..." There is no citing for that. The last AFD wasn't a keep either, it was a no concensus. Cruft isn't weak when you consider that no one outside trek fans care about continuity issues in enterprise like vulcan eating habits, and even then not every fan cares about it. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:09, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: As has been noted, this is the third time someone tried to have it deleted, and both previous times the VfD failed. This is starting to look less and less like a serious request, and more like a "Star Trek doesn't belong in an encyclopedia" campaign.<br />
The article is not original research. People keep saying that it is nothing but fan stuff, hoping perhaps that people won't read the article itself to check? Because, in reality, the article cites no less that 49 different Star Trek episodes and 3 books. This article has more sources than roughly half the articles on Wikipedia -- if this gets deleted for being unverifiable, then so should most of Wikipedia.<br />
The article belongs on Wikipedia. "Star Trek" deserves more than a single page saying "TV series aired from 1966 to 2005, see MemoryAlpha for more details", which is what it will be reduced to if some people had their way. But more than that, this page provides useful and relevant information on the last Star Trek series, and how it fits (or doesn't fit) into the huge and rich Star Trek universe. It is necessary to understand the public reaction to Enterprise, which led to the first cancellation of a Star Trek series since TOS in 1969. Not exactly an event that will go down in History, I'll grant that, but then again, Wikipedia is not Britannica. There are less relevant articles allowed to stay on Wikipedia -- one need only think of <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketchup_on_hot_dogs.html" title="Ketchup on hot dogs">Ketchup on hot dogs</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_neologisms_on_The_Simpsons_2683.html" title="List of neologisms on The Simpsons">List of neologisms on The Simpsons</a>, for example. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 20:08, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>comment</b> If its okay with you two (Ritchy and David) I'm going to move the discussion stemming from Ritchy's point to the talk page where specific examples can be discussed and I'll leave this comment and put a note at the top mentioning that additional information can be found on the talk page?

<li><b>Delete</b> I acknowledge and commend the hard work that went into this article, but, alas, the content is not suitable for an encyclopaedia, even though Wikipedia is not paper.

The fact that it is reasonably well-written and is formatted properly, and has obviously had a lot of work put into it, does not change the fact that it is clearly unsuitable for Wikipedia. This won't stop mass voting by Trekkers stalemating it into a no consensus... as usual. (oops, no-one's supposed to admit that AFD is actually still a vote tally done by the closing admin are they?

<li><b>Delete</b> It's OR. It's as simple as that. The nature of the article invites OR. There have been cleanup tags present for over six months and they haven't helped. This doesn't belong on Wikipedia, and for what it's worth it doesn't belong on Memory Alpha either because they don't endorse OR. It belongs on fan forums. I tried to clean this up months ago when I was fairly new to Wikipedia, but even my edit left opinions in (partially my own). This article can't exist without them, and verification of lines such as "many fans suspect..." cannot occur without linking to biased forum discussions. Star Trek should be on Wikipedia.

If it has been through two prior AFDs and remains in this shabby state, there is no reason to believe that it will be cleaned up. Finally, this is about fiction, and at least in my opinion the only portion of the article that has any hope of being encyclopedic is the introduction, but without the body the intro isn't article worthy.

<li>That's one way of looking at it. Another explanation might be that no consensus = no consensus.

<li>No..its the nature of AFDs. When opened, they're left open for 5 days, but the AFD is so busy people often do not go back 3 or 4 days to see what was nominated then. After the first day or two the only people who generally see the AFD are people going to the article who may have a biased opinion and not represent wikipedia as a whole. Renominating the AFD, especially on a controversial subject ensures that you get a more general concensues of what wikipedians feel on the issue rather than it being lopsided. Not relisting the AFD leads to situations where you have fan groups muddle the process and hurt wikipedia because they're able to just show up in a force of a few and muddle the discussion. If admins closed properly and actually considered the arguments on both sides like they were supposed to instead of just tallying it up like a vote (which they'll claim its not) this wouldn't be a problem for many controversial issues. If you read the talk page you'll see that the artcle can't be edited. Its been tried and the nature of this article is that its opinion. There is no cleaning it up. Once you take out all the unsourced opinion, conclusions, etc. you don't really have anything worth being an article. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:04, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for your opinion and the informative lesson on AfD history and procedure. Incidentally, I see nothing particularly controversial about this article, nor do I think there is any potential to "hurt" wikipedia, whether it is kept or deleted. I don't think those type of scare tactics are necessary, nor do I think you score any points by attacking admins. The article has been here far longer than you have, and during that time wikimedia has gotten much stronger. I also think your logic is badly flawed concerning relisting, since if everyone relisted on a daily basis, following your lead, it would make a total mess of the process. You further claim you want participation in the discussion, but not from "fan groups" (whatever that means). People interested in a given topic, if that's what you mean by "fan groups", are responsible for contributing almost every article on the site. They should be allowed to speak. Their contribution shoulld not be belittled. In fact, you only want participation from people who agree with your opinion, and you feel entitled to argue with everyone who disagrees. Returning to the article, the talk page gave me no indication at all that this "can't be edited". If the topic is viable (and in this case "important"), the article can be edited. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:09, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article as it is and has been for the last year consists mainly of original research and unsourced opinion. That hurts wikipedia, which is why there is a policy against it. My logic isn't flawed. If the article is listed once and forgotten about, on the first day you may get a general idea of what wikipedians feel. I never said I didn't want input from the fan groups, I said that if you leave the AFD that is all you get and it becomes lopsided. Relisting helps balance the AFD and ensure a proper concensus on a controversial issue. It doesn't allow a fan group to stack the discussion by posting to their project page or any other method they may use to keep inappropriate articles on the site. They're free to speak, but this IS a discussion. Any point they make I'm free to counter as that is how a discussion works. To this point as myself and others have poitned out, there hasn't been a single comment made to counter the claim of original research and unsourced opinion. The bulk of the responses have been "keep it because its been worked on hard" or "I like it". These are not valid reasons to ignore <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. As to the talk page, not the talk page of the article, the talk page of this project page. I'm not the only one who has expressed the feeling that this article is beyond saving.

<li>There is no need to repeat your views on the "controversial" nature of the article, or how fan groups are distorting the process, or "hurting" wikipedia. Essentially, it looks to me like you are trying to engage in some type of vote stacking deal by flagging an article you nominated on a daily basis on the AfD page. It is unfortunate that noms feel they have to seek new ways to game the system. Other than that, regarding this article, your opinion has been quite clear. I thank you for restating it.

<dd>I'm free to continue the discussion with whoever I choose. If I have nothing to say about someone's opinion I won't and if I do, I will. When you are dealing with groups who can sometimes contain over zealous members, sometimes you have to be diligent to ensure a process is fair. For even mentioning that I felt the article wasn't encyclopedic I was attacked on the talk page. I'm also not gaming the system, I'm ensuring a balance to prevent gaming from the other side. I'm also not the only one who feels that fan groups will post in force to muddle debates. I might be gaming the system if I was out actively posting on people's talk pages and speaking with people outside wikipedia encouraging them to come here and vote against this article but I am not. I'm simply using the system laid out to ensure a proper concensus. Maybe you look down on that because with a proper concensus the article will be removed? If you think it has merit, I might suggest you go about editing the article to remove all of the original research, conclusions and unsourced opinion. However at that point the article would likely be too small to be an article on its own and would likely be required to be merged with the Enterprise article. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:46, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My arguments and those of the others who have argued for deletion have stood on their own. And not one single person has managed to address the issue of unsourced opinion and original research in the article. Countering a person's irrelevant argument isn't a personal attack. That is called discussion. There hasn't been a single good reason to ignore the WP:OR and WP:V issues in this article. What happened at memory alpha only illustrates that this article isn't the important piece of information to the Trek community that some claim it is. Even though its completely irrelevant to the discussion if the people insisting on keep feel the need to bring it up, then something equally irrelevant can be brought up to counter that point. In 5 days all we've gotten from the keep side is "Just because" and "I like its" and "I worked really hard on it". These points thrown against WP:OR and WP:V are as relevant as saying "We should keep this article because I'm wearing blue shorts today". So if you want to continue to put forth irrelevant points and pretend they have some meaning in this context, well I don't think you get to have a monopoly on that. You were given an opportunity on the talk page to continue the discussion on the points of OR and V, and when the picture was drawn very clearly for you, you stopped talking. So I commend you for at least making the effort to actually try and defend the article and the point you tried to make, but no one has come up with a good reason for keep in the face of that, nor have they gone ahead and improved the article by removing that content even though a couple have claimed its salvageable. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:04, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It looks this article is going to go the way of the dodo. I would advise anyone who is <i>seriously</i> interested in cleaning it up (ie finding verifiable citations to all the original claims it makes) to <b>save it to their userspace</b> before it disappears. Whether someone does that and makes the necessary (drastic) changes will be the true test of whether those who have argued it should stay and merely be cleaned up are really serious about bringing it up to Wiki standards. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_L_Rattigan_f48b.html" title="User:David L Rattigan">David L Rattigan</a> 17:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: So is it OR or copyvio? If it's copyvio, then the article needs to be deleted/rebooted regardless, but I haven't seen the proof of such as claimed on Star Trek Wiki and (lately) here. If it's OR, then perhaps elements of it can be re-integrated into the Enterprise article. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 17:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The copyvio was only pertaining to the discussion on memory-alpha. He was just pointing out that they weren't interested in it even before it was discovered that it was a copy of the work from here, and considered a copyvio by them. The problem here is just the OR. If someone wanted to make a very basic and sourced list of the opposing items and include it as a section of the enterprise article (As it shouldn't be very long) that would be fine as long as it didn't turn into another bit of justifications and opinions, etc. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:59, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that is the way forward. So we would have: TOS Episode says A, notably Enterprise episode says B, without further comment. I do believe that this neutral approach can be more than a stub. As an example I will do a rewrite here of the Cloaking section:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cloaking In the episode "Balance of Terror" (TOS) Spock states that such technology had been, until then, only a theoretical possibility: "Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain — selectively bending light. But the power cost is enormous. They may have solved that. " Yet previous to this, the NX-01 encountered several races with cloaking technology, and even took possession of and used a cloaking pod from the Suliban. In the episode "Minefield" (ENT), the crew of the NX-01 encounters a Romulan ship with cloaking abilities as well as a cloaked Romulan mine field.</p>
<p>-Would we agree that there is no OR in the above passage? If so can we not do a similar job on the other sections? Thanks <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 18:30, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>clean up the usage of "several" its ambiguous it could be 3 it could be 10. The quote doesn't add anything to the paragraph it just serves to lengthen it, its already been stated what Spock said and it what episode. I'm also not sure I like the "Yet previous to this" transition. It gives the wrong tone to me. I'll think about that. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:32, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have added the new-cut down version of Cloaking (above) to the article. I respectfully submit that it contains no OR, and that if the rest of the sections were rewritten in a similar way, they would be more than a stub. If no-one else volunteers I guess I could do it - but I would need a few days. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 19:51, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You probably do have that time. THere is currently a major backlog on the AFDs, and the relisting I did actually extends the AFD. It isn't scheduled to close for another 24 hours or so, but there is a 3 or 4 day backlog beyond that. We should also consider a new name for the article, because alleged is a loaded word, and like someone mentioned perhaps this could be made into a broader article to cite all Canon contradictions between all series. Continuity Contradictions is a neutral term, it could be spiced up a little if needed as long as the tone and meaning aren't changed. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:00, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cool. Here's another attempt which I will add to the article. If others want to revert they can.</dd>

<p>Weapon technology According to "Balance of Terror" (TOS), the Earth-Romulan War which took place around the time of ENT was fought using atomic weapons. However, the NX-01 is armed with futuristic 'phase cannons' and 'photonic torpedoes', and the Romulan ships seen in ENT have a similar armament.</p>
<p>-No OR in that, I think... (I hope) <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 20:14, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I might take out "According to" it makes it sound authoritative or correct. When writing try to make it so that you could transpose the two contradictions in the paragraph without changing how one might interpret it. Using "In" there or some derivative of that would be more appropriate. Its also unneccessary to put attention on phase cannons or photonic torpedos like that. Perhaps refer to them as energy-based weapons, everything about the series is futuristic. Something like this:</dd>

<p>Weapon Technology In "Balance of Terror" (TOS), reference is made to an Earth-Romulan War which took place around the time of ENT, it was reported to have been fought using atomic weapons. Through-out the series the NX-01 is armed with phase cannons and photonic torpedos both energy-based weapons. The romulan vessels are also similarly armed. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:27, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
