<p>This concept does not exist in a form well-enough defined or widely-enough used to justify an article. The article's creation looks like an exercise in POV-pushing (see <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">main user</a>'s involvement with <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercion.html" title="Coercion">coercion</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_monopoly.html" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a> for that user's point of view) - which seems to have been rather successful. Almost every single usage of the term in the sense described the article is traceable either to wikipedia's article or to people who use it informally (blogs etc) and have probably picked it up from there.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Coercive+monopoly%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Coercive+monopoly%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> A single-figure number of more serious uses (usually with actual or implied inverted commas) do not justify the article. An encylopedia is supposed to reflect existing knowledge, and the very existence of the article makes a claim to an existence of an established concept, which claim is simply untrue. The actual meaning of the phrase "coercive monopoly" is "a monopoly on the use of coercion", in discussions of the state. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 17:02, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Addition. I've only just bothered to read the article - I'd nominated on the conceptual issue alone. Frankly, regardless of the conceptual issue, the article is even more transparently a POV fork of <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government-granted_monopoly.html" title="Government-granted monopoly">government-granted monopoly</a> and/or <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_monopoly.html" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a> than I'd expected.

<dd>And what I've come to expect from you. As I said, <i>"I'd nominated on the conceptual issue alone"</i>. The article content being bad merely reinforces the nomination, but doesn't make much difference. Or is there some level above "deletion" I don't know about? Votes for hyperdeletion perhaps, deleting nonsense from parallel universes? <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 10:29, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't ordinarly deride the nominator, but he took a swipe at me in his comment above and accused me of POV pushing. He's lost all credibility in my eyes. See some of the external links in the article for general usage. This paper by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Greenspan_c1c0.html" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a> is interesting: <a href="http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/06-12-98.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/06-12-98.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:14, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>In view of my experience with RJII in the past, merely noting articles I've seen him involved with was quite restrained. As for the Greenspan link, this is another (occasional) usage of "coercive monopoly" which does not support the existence of an independent article, because it is used synonymously with <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government-granted_monopoly.html" title="Government-granted monopoly">government-granted monopoly</a>. Funnily enough, for a year <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercive_monopoly.html" title="Coercive monopoly">coercive monopoly</a> was a redirect to that - before RJII came along and started defining it as something there is little evidence for. And as RJII brings up credibility; this sort of thing is (in my experience) typical of him - using isolated examples that don't prove his case to support sweeping generalisations. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 22:20, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In my experience with R2d2, he has fought allowing any mention of pro-capitalist laissez-faire arguments in articles he edits. For example, in <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_monopoly.html" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a> I had to fight tooth and nail to even mention that not everyone agrees that natural monopoly is a legitimate argument. Finally there is a paragraph in that article presenting the laissez-faire position. Obviously, here he thinks that an article identifying the term "coercive monopoly" is a threat to his POV as well. He wants it deleted as if the concept and term does not even exist. What is he afraid of? Maybe he works as an economic regulator? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:35, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>No need - RJII's behaviour has caused me to cease editing all articles in which he has an interest (with the recent exception of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_monopoly.html" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a> because this is one of the first articles I was involved with and harboured ambitions to make Featured, until RJII's involvement made me give up on that - as an alternative to giving up on Wikipedia altogether). <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 09:26, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is coming from a guy who can't stand to let anyone else contribute to an article. He seems to have ambitions of being the sole editor of any article he edits and not allowing any contributions from others. He is not an editor consistent with the spirit of Wikipedia at all. Hopefully, he'll eventually get a glimpse of what Wikipedia is about. His attempt to delete this perfectly legitimate article is just another attempt at trying to use any means possible to '<i>monopolize</i> Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 13:05, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Keep. While I had not heard of the term prior to the article, it did not read to me as POV-push or fabrication, and I felt I learned something from it. I don't see how the Google link proves that the Wiki entry creates the term, rather than documenting an existing one. That is speculation. A search on my part showed that this term was used by Ayn Rand in an article on antitrust <a href="http://www.capitalism.org/faq/antitrust.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.capitalism.org/faq/antitrust.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. While she used it in conjunction with government-regulated monopolies, the term certainly predates Wikipedia. Perhaps this is an politically sensitive &amp; economically debateable term. But it exists independent of this site and I think it deserves entry, not deletion. (My first post here ever, so please forgive errors.)
<ul>
<li>It exists, but not as a well-established or well-defined concept - see my remarks above. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 09:26, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is a false remark from from the nominator. The term is very well defined and conceived. It's a monopoly that is maintained by the use of coercion, rather than by any other method, such as competitiveness. Very simple. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 13:09, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>religious monopoly - a monopoly based on religious faith in a product or company; deistic monopoly - a monopoly maintained by <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_god.html" title="Act of god">acts of god</a>; and so on and so forth. All well definable, yet not well-established and therefore non-encyclopedic. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 14:15, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I should point out that I do see a <b>potential</b> use for the term "coercive monopoly", in relation to things like the mafia. But the creation of an article which lumps together mafia and government is so jawdroppingly POV I'm disappointed people don't seem to recognise it. And regardless of whether a mafia-related usage <b>would</b> be useful, <i>such usage is not established, and it is not up to Wikipedia to establish it.</i> <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 14:28, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I find it "jawdropping" that you can't stomach the fact that governments engage in coercion. "Coercive monopoly" is a well-established term thas has been in use in political and economic philosophy for a least 50 years. And, if I'm not mistaken it was in use even over 100 years ago in political-economic philosophy of some liberals --I'll have to make sure on that. Admittedly, if your education is limited to that supplied by a university, you might not have been exposed to it. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:44, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Vague claims are cheap. Demonstrate. That's the Wikipedia way; that's how articles get improved. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 18:31, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No need. There is enough information and links in the article to show that it's a real word and concept. I'm not fooled into thinking you have the slighest interest in improving Wikipedia --in the sense of exposing all knowledge. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:38, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I haven't heard of the term either and a search on few economic glossaries &amp; text books didn't return a result either. Rewriting to reflect only coercive practices of a monopolist or renaming the article to <i>coercive practices of monopolies</i> would address also the concern, the term is not invented. <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pamri" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pamri" rel="nofollow">Pamri</a> â€¢ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pamri" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pamri" rel="nofollow">Talk</a></small> 10:17, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It is an established concept. For example, Nathaniel Branden wrote about it in the The Objectivist Newsletter. <a href="http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/articles_essays/question_of_monopolies.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/articles_essays/question_of_monopolies.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This article seems to talk about it in much the same ways as Nathaniel Branden did back in 1962. Not everyone buys what he's selling but he's a respected author and political philosopher. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 00:10, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Rd232 is correct in that the term is not used in mainstream economics, however there is a small but politicaly active group associated with Rand and the objectivist/laissez-faire camp that champion the concept. He is also correct that the term was created largely to advance a political agenda. However, I don't no if that is enough to warrant deletion. I would say <b>keep</b> only if the article explains who uses the term and why, otherwize <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/y/d/User%7EMydogategodshat_753f.html" title="User:Mydogategodshat">mydogategodshat</a> 03:00, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Fair enough. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 08:20, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't know how much more "mainstream" you can get than the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 13:26, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now there's a shock - RJII missing the point. To recap what I said above on the Greenspan link: "this is another (occasional) usage of "coercive monopoly" which does not support the existence of an independent article, because it is used synonymously with government-granted monopoly." <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 22:03, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A government-granted monopoly is just one form of coercive monopoly. Not all coercive monopolies are necessarily government-granted monopolies. A coercive monopoly is one that coercively prohibits competition. It can include government-granted monopolies, government-monopolies, or firms not connected with government at all that are engaging in coercion to prevent competition. It would help if you would read an article before you nominate it for deletion. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:03, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Apparently you are well-trained in the art of politics (ever read that book by Schopenhauer, or just picked it up off the TV?).

<li>A neologism is "a new word, usage, or expression" (Merriam-Webster).
