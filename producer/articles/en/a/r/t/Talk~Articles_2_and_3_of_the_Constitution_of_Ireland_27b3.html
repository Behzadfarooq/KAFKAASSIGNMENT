	    <p>I have temporarily removed some text refering to the citizenship amendment. This is because the text talks as if the amendment to the constitution has already been made, however, although it is only a formality, the amendment wont be made until it is signed into law by the President. It is possible this has happened already but as far as i'm aware it hasnt.</p>
<p>There are currently a series of Wikipedia articles on each Irish constitutional amendment. To add to this list ive created a draft on the most recent amendment which is <a href="../../../i/o/t/User%7EIota_Twenty-seventh_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland_ceea.html" title="User:Iota/Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">here</a>. However im not going to add the article to Wikipedia until i'm sure that the amendment has actually become law.</p>
<p>Once the article is ready to go perhaps people would consider merging detailed information on the citizenship amendment with this article rather than adding it to the "Articles 2 and 3" article which should only really contain a short summary.</p>

<p>Please provide evidence to back up your assertion that the Irish government has a policy of referring to "Northern Ireland" as "the six counties". Also, the only media outlets that use the term "six counties" are minority nationalist papers such as <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Phoblacht_70a1.html" title="An Phoblacht">An Phoblacht</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Ireland_f1b7.html" title="Daily Ireland">Daily Ireland</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 14:49, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

"Northern Ireland" is a dreadful abuse of geographic nomenclature. I don't believe Wikipedia should perpetuate the strictures that have been self-imposed by newspapers when referring to the six counties.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is the term used almost universally except for minorities on both sides. It's used by many nationalists and unionists alike, by the British and Irish governments alike, by the BBC and RTÉ alike, by the <i><a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_News_a152.html" title="Irish News">Irish News</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast_Telegraph_07e3.html" title="Belfast Telegraph">Belfast Telegraph</a></i> alike, even by the United Nations <a href="http://www.un.org/works/goingon/ireland/ireland.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/works/goingon/ireland/ireland.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It may be aesthetically offensive to you, but it's the closest to a NPOV name available. "Six Counties" is most definitely nowhere near NPOV. (plus "six counties" is geographically inaccurate as well since 1973, but I suppose "twenty-six local council areas" doesn't have quite the same ring to it&#160;:) ) <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 15:13, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Irish government uses the term sporadically, and never to <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_nationalism.html" title="Irish nationalism">nationalist</a> audiences. RTÉ avoids its use, as does the Irish News and many Irish papers, not just the two previously mentioned. I believe the term is far from NPOV, but I have not edited it in places I believed it apt. The counties have remained exactly where they were, even after 1973. I hope this has assuaged some of your concerns.</p>

I am surprised. (By the way, one of your <a href="../../../r/t/%C3%A9/RT%C3%89_e38d.html" title="RTÉ">RTÉ</a> links is incorrect.) The term "Northern Ireland" is still misleading, and I believe it should be avoided when possible.</p>

<p>RTÉ link is fixed now. But you agree that "Northern Ireland" (even though it is arguably geographically incorrect by a few miles) is the closest thing we have to an NPOV name, being the most widely used across all sides (Irish government, British government, RoI media, British media, nationalist media in NI, unionist media in NI, United Nations)? And it's <b>definitely</b> more NPOV than "six counties" (which is only used by supporters of Sinn Féin and related groups, and which has its own problems with geographical accuracy)?</p>

<p>Except the six counties were broken up and replaced by twenty-six "local council areas" in 1973. Yes, it's a small insignificant nitpick, but so is the few miles of the Republic that is north of "Northern" Ireland.</p>

<p>Politically, the six counties ceased to be individual administrative areas as part of a British shake-up of local government. Anyone familiar with Irish articles (start with the county articles themselves) will know that this did not affect the counties themselves, nor the array of organisations that use their boundaries for internal administration, nor the tens of thousands of people who support their county teams.</p>

<p>You two have done a lot of talking here - but I think it goes without saying that the official term is always the preferred option to make up or agenda driven terms. The "six counties" of Northern Ireland have long ceased to have administrative effect and are only ceremonial. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 18:17, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>So, LP, are we agreed that "Northern Ireland" is a less POV/more neutral name than "Six Counties"? Can I get your agreement to revert the changes you made?</p>

<p>It is not my intention to move the article. I still contend that "Northern Ireland" is a POV and inaccurate term for the region being discussed. The issue is not whether or not each of the individual six counties are administrative divisions, which no-one has tried to argue. Nor is it my intention to change every mention of "Northern Ireland" to the Six Counties. I have often used other terms. My contention was that it should be avoided when possible. Obviously there are many cases where it would be confusing not to use the term "Northern Ireland", especially to readers not familiar with Irish politics (the best example being the name of the article). The "official name" argument carries very little water.</p>

<dd>And "six counties" isn't a POV term? Why should we replace one widely accepted and internationally/legally recognized term which is used widely by both sides (as I've demonstrated above) with another heavily loaded term which is used almost exclusively by republicans? Just because you say the official name argument "carries little water" doesn't make it so, you're going to have to explain why we shouldn't call the place the same thing as the Irish government, the British government, the European Union, the United Nations, and even the Northern Ireland Executive (were it around) call it.<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 19:41, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My tuppence worth is that the term "six counties" is a non NPOV as using "Ulster" to describe the same area. Northern Ireland seems to me to be the best term to use. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 19:34, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Most of Ulster" would have the same accuracy as the Six Counties. Feel free. The "official name" argument is weak because of the nature of the political dispute. Again, I believe Wikipedia should not be constrained by ritual.</p>

<dl>
<dd>"the nature of the political dispute" has nothing to do with it when the majorities on both sides agree that Northern Ireland is the correct name. Again, only a specific group of people (mostly associated with one particular political party) uses your preferred phrase of "six counties". Everyone else, nationalist and unionist, British, Irish and international, calls it Northern Ireland. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 21:58, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed, quite frankly this need to change links is strange to say the least (i am trying to restrain my language here). With respect, LP, your arguement that the "official name" is pov or inappropriate does not hold much water either. You just need to accept that Northern Ireland is the official name, very widely recognised, and that many other terms cited are pov, by default. If you are still not convinced I suggest that in the first instance that you lobby the respective national and international bodies for a name change and in the second instance you submit a request for moving the article to the new name rather than painstaking transfers which will only in due course be reverted by people who care little of what has been discussed here. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 22:13, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will not support a name change as it will cause unnecessary confusion. I'm not disputing what the region's "official" name is, I am questioning the need to use it slavishly. I am not insisting that the six counties should be used in every instance. I'm not convinced that all of the groups you refer to "agree" that "Northern Ireland" is the "correct" name.

I distinctly recall the anger of many <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionists_%28Ireland%29_90f2.html" title="Unionists (Ireland)">unionists</a> and unionist politicians when their Deputy First Minister Séamus Mallon refused point-blank to use the term "Northern Ireland" during his tenure. I believe his opposition was more about granting any form of legitimacy (implicit or explicit) to an entity he felt did not deserve it, rather than one based on geographical accuracy. It should be obvious that to remove all references to "Northern Ireland" in Wikipedia would be self-defeating. I have already stated this.</p>

<p>No, many unionist politicians were angered that he would not always use the term "Northern Ireland", believing his attitude showed disrespect for unionists. I don't contend he never used it (he certainly used it in speeches when members of the international community were present), but he definitely avoided it at other times.

<dd>Actually, that's <i>exactly</i> what you contended: <i>"refused point-blank to use the term "Northern Ireland" during his tenure"</i>. In any case, he didn't prefer the term "six counties" instead, so even if Seamus Mallon had never uttered the phrase "Northern Ireland" in his life, it still wouldn't support your unilateral decision to replace "Northern Ireland" with "six counties".

I did'nt suggest using Ulster when referring to the Six Counties, I said Ulster was more applicable in some instances, e.g. when discussing something that applies to all nine counties.

<p>Stop trying to make out that the term "Northern Ireland" is only considered NPOV by the unionists and the British. It is perceived as such by most other people in the world excluding Irish nationalists. It is the official name and the name recognised around the world. And why is "Six Counties" far more accurate? It implies that these six counties are merely part of the island of Ireland and not an entity in their own right, which is obviously the line taken by Irish nationalists, but is for that reason pure POV. And since any six counties in any country that has counties can be called "the six counties" it hardly distinguishes anything. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 15:19, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

I certainly don't agree that all the groups you mention are "happy" to use the term "Northern Ireland". Rather I would contend they use it, when they do use it, by default. If you don't wish to make "many of them...unhappy", feel free to use terms you believe would be more appropriate. I know the term <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_counties.html" title="Six counties">six counties</a> is associated with <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_F%C3%A9in_5dd5.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a> and even more militant republicans; what no-one here has sought to address is why is the most accurate name for the region in question considered the sole property of this section of the Irish body politic. Again, given its history and the undeniably partial history of its parent state, "Northern Ireland" being the "official name" is a less than robust argument. I agree that there is an inherent implication in the term <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_counties.html" title="Six counties">six counties</a>, just as there is a similar implication in the term "Northern Ireland" which implies a far greater (and homogenous) difference from the rest of Ireland than actually exists and perpetuates a geographical absurdity. Lastly, Demiurge. Early in this discussion you requested I refrain from making any more of the changes we have been discussing until we were finished, and I agreed. I am surprised you did not consider yourself similarly bound.</p>

<dd>Northern Ireland is no more a geographical absurdity than is Austria being distinct from Germany. Both are fact, however much you argue.

Austria does not claim a geographical position it does not hold. I don't know what the word Austria means, but I would hazard a guess it's not misleading in any way. "Northern Ireland" is certainly a fact, there's no arguing with that. It's right there. Whether or not the editors of an encyclopedia should slavishly follow the preferred phraseology of the entity's authors and supporters is a different kettle of fish.</p>

<dd>Encyclopedias are there to present fact. The name "Northern Ireland" and its recognition around the world is a fact. Ergo, we should use it. When I mentioned Austria I was responding to your claim that Northern Ireland was a geographical absurdity.

<dd>To be very honest I think you are making a very big fuss about nothing. By instisting on "Six Counties" you might as well propose a title such as "That part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland consisting of 13,843 km², as founded by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, generally known as Northern Ireland" - it really is that bizzar. Their is simply nothing inappropriate about using "Northern Ireland" with a capital N - you can spin it how you want, Irish or otherwise, this is the accepted name of a political entity on the island of Ireland - a name is a name. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 18:43, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Your contempt is misplaced. To insist that use of the term "Northern Ireland" <i>only</i> be applied to the north of your imaginary line would, I believe, be going too far.

<hr />
<p>Here, for the record (since nobody else seems to have stated it explicitly) is the problem with saying "the six counties": the term has no meaning outside the dispute over Irish reunification. There's no inherent <i>prima facie</i> reason why somebody saying "the six counties" shouldn't be referring to any group of six counties— let's say {Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford, Westmeath, Galway, and Fermanagh}. Historically speaking, Ireland was divided into <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counties_of_Ireland_391f.html" title="Counties of Ireland">32 counties</a>; nothing grouped these six counties together any more than any other six counties.</p>
<p>Then came partition, and nationalists began to use "the six counties" as shorthand for "the six counties which should, in my opinion, be part of the Free State / Republic but aren't right now." That is the <i>inherent subtext</i> of the phrase — it has no meaning otherwise — and that's why it can't be used in an encyclopedia interchangably with "Northern Ireland," which, although unlovable, uneuphonious, and somewhat ill-defined, is at least its official name. (A stronger case, by the way, could be made for "Ulster" since it's a real historical name, not an invented one; but as it's not quite accurate (a good deal of the historic Ulster is in the ROI) and is moreover used mostly by those with a unionist POV, it's unacceptable too.)</p>
<p>In short: while other editors above have provided good statistical evidence for why "Northern Ireland" is the most NPOV term, I just thought some background should be spelled-out explicitly. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> 03:47, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have already acknowledged the inherent implication in calling the region the Six Counties. My contention is that this is less POV (as well as being far more accurate) than the term "Northern Ireland", which carries its own (very strong) implication. As for using "Ulster", I've found that very often the term "Northern Ireland" is used when Ulster would be more appropriate, e.g. when discussing the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation_of_Ulster_cd7f.html" title="Plantation of Ulster">Plantation of Ulster</a> or the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Order_4694.html" title="Orange Order">Orange Order</a>. Again, using the term "Northern Ireland" just because its the "official name" should be considered against the backdrop of the political situation. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapsed_Pacifist_8b06.html" title="User:Lapsed Pacifist">Lapsed Pacifist</a> 08:09, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes but everyone else is contending that Northern Ireland is not POV as it is simply the name of the territory in question. POV has very little to do with using the official name of something. For instance we can happily called the Republic of Ireland 'Eire' as that is it's official name and as a result does no necessarily carry a POV, though the name is not something that is commonly used. Northern Ireland is the name, that is a fact just as much as Coca Cola is called Coca Cola and not 'vegetable extract flavoured soft drink'. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 09:23, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hate to admit this (and everyone's going to hate me for saying it), but I think LP might actually have a point - a very small one at that! This is that political correctness has gone a little bit mad (my pet hate!). I don't actually hate the usage or have a big problem with "six counties", "Ulster", "the province" (actually, I don't think this one is POV at all), "the north" or any other name for Northern Ireland that much when used in a narrative piece of writing about Northern Ireland, as I think they're all used by most people in Northen Ireland (of both community backgrounds - just certain communities use some of them a lot more frequently than than others). I actually think that using different names adds a bit of flavour and variety to a long piece of writing, and that arguing over the usage of the terms is fairly petty.</p>
<p><i>However</i>, what I don't like is people who insist on a campaign of replacing every instance of "Northern Ireland" with "six counties" etc (e.g. LP) and attempting to <i>exclusively</i> use that non-official name. If this was a normal encyclopaedia of a closed nature (i.e. one that couldn't be edited by anyone) then I wouldn't have a problem with the variety that these terms provide, providing that "Northern Ireland" was the primary and officially used term. The problem is that people will come on POV-pushing campaigns to replace the usage of one word with another. For this very reason, Northern Ireland should be the only term that is used, unless in exceptional circumstances. Using "Northern Ireland" also gives clarity in situations where it is not clear from the text the context in which the phrase is being applied.</p>
<p>There may be certain exceptional circumstances why you needed "six counties" but you could replace <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_counties.html" title="Six counties">six counties</a> (LP's normal way) with "the six counties of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>" for clarity. Ulster is a bit different as is an ancient name and has a bit of a blurry 6/9 county definition, often referring to Northern Ireland in contexts after 1922 and to nine counties in historical and all-Ireland contexts - where possible here <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> should be used for the sake of clarity when referring to the six counties (&#160;;) )</p>
<p>I guess that's enough non-sensical rambling from me - in summary just use "Northern Ireland" for God's sake, and save everyone the hassle of arguing!! <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonto_238a.html" title="User:Jonto">Jonto</a> 22:47, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
