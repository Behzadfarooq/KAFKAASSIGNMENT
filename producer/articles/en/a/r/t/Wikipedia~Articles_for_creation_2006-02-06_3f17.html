<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-06_3f17.html" title="Edit section: New labels in the &quot;abortion wars&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New labels in the "abortion wars"</span></h2>
<p>The traditional lables used for the opposing sides in the "abortion wars" are "Prolife" and "Prochoice". For several reasons, these labels are problematic.</p>
<p>In debating abortion, the term "Prolife" often lends itself to confusion about it's meaning, due to the tendency of opposition debaters to claim that it's meaning includes such things as euthenasia, capital punishment, war, and other "life-related" subjects. A quick check with any reputable dictionary will show that this is not the case, but dictionaries are highly underused in abortion debates:</p>
<p>pro-life adjective against open access to abortion: in favor of bringing the human fetus to full term, especially by campaigning against open access to abortion and against experimentation on embryos <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861736610" class="external free" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861736610" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861736610</a></p>
<p>The term "Prochoice" is a rather confusing label, which mainly depends on the fine art of understanding euphemisms to convey it's meaning. It doesn't distinguish between the two sides, because it represents only one "choice" more than the other side supports. It's proponents often make complicated, long winded claims about "freedom of choice" which have no bearing on the actual meaning of the term, as evidenced by the common dictionary:</p>
<p>pro-choice adjective advocating access to legal abortion: advocating open legal access to voluntary abortion <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/pro-choice.html" class="external free" title="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/pro-choice.html" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/pro-choice.html</a></p>
<p>The term "Proabortion" has precisely the same meaning as "Prochoice", but is always rejected by those calling themselves "Prochoice", with an erreroneous claim about it's meaning:</p>
<p>pro-a·bor·tion adjective - favoring legal access to abortion: in favor of open legal access to voluntary abortion <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861736813" class="external free" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861736813" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861736813</a></p>
<p>The term "Antiabortion" might be useful, but is problematic also because natural miscarriages are also called "abortions", and because what is actually objected to is not the termination of the pregnancy, but the intentional death of the unborn baby that results.</p>
<p>Thus my proposal that a "truth in advertising" approach be taken, and that new labels be adopted for both sides which more accurately reflect what each side stands for.</p>
<p>For those who support the legal status of abortion, I propose the label "Probabykilling", and for their opponents I propose "Antibabykilling". No other labels more clearly pinpoint the positions of the two sides, or do it without any of the usual confusion about what other meanings the term have.

Robert Blohm (born May 27, 1948, Trenton, New Jersey) is an American and Canadian investment banker, economist and statistician. He helped expand the Japanese capital market in the 1980s to Canadian governments, corporations, utilities and banks. In the early 1990s he argued widely in the US and Canadian press against the economic feasibility of Quebec's separation from Canada, particularly in a series of opinion articles in The Wall Street Journal. He coined the term "the internet economy" in a Wall Street Journal opinion article by that title in 1996. In the later 1990s he published articles in the general and trade press against restructuring the wholesale electric industry into a centralized spot market, and this led to collapse of the California electricity market in 2001 and abandonment of that policy by US, Canadian and Japanese regulators. Blohm has since helped the North American Electric Reliability Council develop risk-based standards for reliably operating and planning the electric system in a competitive market.</p>

<p>Watermark, a CCM singing duo comprised of husband and wife Nathan and Christy Nockels, is an artist on Michael W. Smith's record label, Rocketown Records. They got their start recording under the name Sons and Daughters, with longtime friends Charlie and Kimber Hall (Charlie Hall is a known worship leader with the Passion conferences). They released their first record, Holy Roar, with this lineup, in 1995. In 1997, they released Open Me Up under the same name. That same year, Nathan and Christy began leading worship at Metro Bible Study at Houston's First Baptist Church. This is when Watermark began.</p>
<p>Rocketown heard about Watermark around 1998, and soon signed them to the label. That same year, they released their first project as a part of Rocketown, an album called Watermark. This disc is almost a complete re-record of the Sons and Daughters disc Open Me Up, with only a few song changes. Their second album, All Things New, which is probably their best-known project, released in 2000. Constant, their 3rd studio project with Rocketown, was released in 2002. Their final all-studio album, The Purest Place, was released in August of 2004. This project yielded the couple a GMA Music Award nomination for Inspirational Album of the Year, and also helped to earn Christy a nod for Female Vocalist, though neither award was won.</p>
<p>On March 14, 2006, Watermark will see the release of their final album as a part of Rocketown. A Grateful People was recorded live at the couple's church in Brentwood, TN in August of 2005. It includes 12 tracks from the 3-hour-long concert and 2 brand new studio tracks. Friends of the couple who have played roles in their ministry that are special guests on the album include Point of Grace, Chris Tomlin, Ed Cash, and Shane and Shane.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, Nathan and Christy have played a part in the Passion conferences, which were started by Louie Giglio. Most recently, Nathan has produced live recordings of the past 2 conferences in Nashville, TN (2005 and 2006).</p>
<p>Nathan is an avid producer, having produced not only the Passion CDs, but also Watermark's The Purest Place, and Rita Springer's I Have To Believe, among others.</p>
<p>The couple has two young children, Noah Luke, born July 21, 2000, and Elliana Noelle, born December 18, 2002.</p>
<p>Watermark has toured extensively throughout their career, doing both solo shows and also with such notable groups as Point of Grace and Michael W. Smith</p>

<p>Shaun Groves is a CCM recording artist on the Rocketown Records roster. He was born on December 27, 1974 in Lawton, Oklahoma on the Fort Sill Army Base. Shaun attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he received a degree in music composition.</p>
<p>In 2000, Shaun was signed by Rocketown Records, and released his critically-acclaimed freshman album, Invitation to Eavesdrop, in 2001. The album produced 2 #1 singles on Christian charts, Welcome Home and Should I Tell Them. The success of the album and singles helped pave the way for Shaun to earn a GMA Music Award nomination for new artist of the year. Shaun's sophomore effort, Twilight, released in August of 2003, and unfortunately did not do very well in retail. His sound was very toned down compared to Invitation to Eavesdrop.</p>
<p>In 2004, Shaun accepted a position as a teaching pastor at his home church in Franklin, TN. He began leading a post-high school/young adult Bible study, called IKON. One of the series that was taught was on the Beatitudes, from Matthew 5, a part of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. The verses contained in this passage inspired Groves while writing for his most recent album, White Flag.</p>
<p>White Flag, released July 12, 2005, is a theme album, with all of the songs centering around the Beatitudes. Each song is placed on the CD according to verse inspiration, in the same order the Beatitudes are presented in the Bible. The CD released at number 1 on Christian retail charts, selling more than 4000 units in its first week in stores. Despite the high sales amount (one of, if not the highest street-week sales numbers for a Rocketown Artist to date), the album failed to produce a high-charting single, though Bless The Lord (the only song on the disc that Groves did not pen) did get a good amount of airplay.</p>
<p>Groves lives in Franklin, TN with his wife Becky, and their three children, Gabriella (born 2001), Gresham (born 2003), and Penelope (born 2005).</p>

<p>Schrodinger's Date: Schrodinger's Date is based on the theory of Schrodinger's Cat. The idea is that one person engages in social interaction with another person. It is unclear to the first person as to whether the second person's intentions are romantic in nature or purely amicable. Many Nice Guy's are subject to Schrodinger's Date theory.</p>
<p>Schrodinger's cat:</p>
<p>Schrödinger's cat is a famous illustration of the principle in quantum theory of superposition, proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. Schrödinger's cat serves to demonstrate the apparent conflict between what quantum theory tells us is true about the nature and behavior of matter on the microscopic level and what we observe to be true about the nature and behavior of matter on the macroscopic level. Here's Schrödinger's (theoretical) experiment: We place a living cat into a steel chamber, along with a device containing a vial of hydrocyanic acid. There is, in the chamber, a very small amount of a radioactive substance. If even a single atom of the substance decays during the test period, a relay mechanism will trip a hammer, which will, in turn, break the vial and kill the cat. The observer cannot know whether or not an atom of the substance has decayed, and consequently, cannot know whether the vial has been broken, the hydrocyanic acid released, and the cat killed. Since we cannot know, the cat is both dead and alive according to quantum law, in a superposition of states. It is only when we break open the box and learn the condition of the cat that the superposition is lost, and the cat becomes one or the other (dead or alive). This situation is sometimes called quantum indeterminacy or the observer's paradox: the observation or measurement itself affects an outcome, so that it can never be known what the outcome would have been if it were not observed.</p>
<p>We know that superposition actually occurs at the subatomic level, because there are observable effects of interference, in which a single particle is demonstrated to be in multiple locations simultaneously. What that fact implies about the nature of reality on the observable level (cats, for example, as opposed to electrons) is one of the stickiest areas of quantum physics. Schrödinger himself is rumored to have said, later in life, that he wished he had never met that cat.</p>

<p>In order to graduate, grade 12 students, taking national programme, are required to have final average grades in all subjects studied over the two final years. In addition, they have to pass at least 4 but no more than 6 graduation exams consisting of national external exams and internal but centrally prepared exams. To enter a college or university students are required to pass at least two external national exams. IB students have to meet the requirements set by the IBO and have to sit the final IB exams, however, some of them choose to take national exams as well.</p>

<p>All course offerings are university-preparatory and marking standards are strict. No weighting is used. Both national and IB students are graded on a 10 grade scale: 10 (excellent), 9 (very good), 8 (good), 7 (above average), 6 (average), 5 (above mediocre), 4 (mediocre), 3 (poor), 2- 1 (very poor). Students are awarded grades for oral and written activities, projects, experimental work, etc. in the course of a semester. At the end of each semester they are given the grade average (or semester grade) in each subject. At the end of a school year students are given final grades which are averages of semester and internal examination grades. In physical education, arts, drama, music, ethics a credit is awarded. Grading system in national external exams is from 100 (maximum) to 1 (minimum). IB students are graded on the IB 7 grade scale only for their final IB exams. The same scale is used for their predicted grades.</p>

<p>A boot disk is a removable media, normally read-only, that can boot an operating system or utility.</p>
<p>Boot disks normally store any temporary files in a RAM disk (floppy), to prevent changes in the fixed media of the computer where the Boot disk is used.</p>
<p>Boot disks are used for:</p>
<pre>
   * Operating system installation.
   * Data recovery.
   * Troubleshooting.
   * Customizing an environment.
   * Software demonstration.
</pre>
<p>Floppy disks and CD-ROMs are the most common forms of media used, but other media, such as tape drives, zip drives and more recently, USB keys can be used. What can be booted depends on whether a computer's BIOS supports booting from that device. For example, not all BIOSes support booting from a CD-ROM and require a boot floppy to run the software on the CD-ROM.</p>

<p>Metro Eireann is Ireland's only multicultural newspaper, founded in 2000 by two Dublin-based Nigerian journalists, Chinedu Onyejelem and Abel Ugba. The paper is based at North Circular Road in Dublin 7 - on the city's northside - and has a print-run of 15,000. It publishes news for and about Ireland's increasing ethnic communities. Contributors to the publication, which is currently monthly, include Booker-prize winning author Roddy Doyle and Irish Times columnist Fintan O'Toole. Metro Eireann also runs the annual MAMA (Metro Eireann Media and Multicultural Awards) which awards people in Ireland - both Irish and non-Irish - who are engaged in fighting racism and breaking down cultural barriers between people from different backgrounds. Legendary Irish musician Christy Moore, among others, is a supporter of the awards. Metro Eireann is online at www.metroeireann.com.</p>

<p>Duret hemorrhages are small areas of bleeding in the ventral and paramedian parts of the upper brainstem (midbrain and pons). They are secondary to raised intracranial pressure with formation of a transtentorial pressure cone in which the cerebellar tonsils are impacted in the foramen magnum by the high pressure. Kernohan’s notch is a groove in the cerebral peduncle caused by this displacement of the brainstem against the incisura of the tentorium in some cases. The resulting ipsilateral hemiparesis, is a false localising sign (Collier 1904), known as the Kernohan-Woltman syndrome. This may succeed or accompany temporal lobe (uncal) herniation and subfalcial herniation secondary to a supratentorial mass. The common causes are an acute haematoma, oedema following trauma, abscess, or tumour. The Duret haemorrhage is demonstrated at CT or MR imaging. It is usually indicates a fatal outcome. The mechanism is uncertain but is probably caused by the displacement of the brainstem stretching and lacerating pontine perforating branches of the basilar artery; venous infarction may play a role.</p>

<p>WWE Screw The Rules is an MSN Fed which was created by somebody called Woody, Then Muzz and Alex where also along for the ride and they turned WWE Screw The Rules into one of the best feds ever on MSN, One day someone new called Matt was able to turn his attention to this fed and he worked his way up through the ranks and in the end became the 50% Co Owner of the fed, Indeed he was probably one of the people who turned WWE Screw The Rules into the best fed going, But in January 2006 there was jealousy as Woody returned to take back WWE Screw The Rules, How ever Matt wouldn't let him but in the end he was treated so badly that he was forced to leave WWE Screw The Rules, How ever because he had been there for a year and a half he wasn't alone and so immediately there was many people that left, Famous names such as Vanisha and Billy left immediately with Matt as they went off to join Xtreme Wrestling League, Now they will be competing there and everyone will be hoping that they can get even better because we all no that they will be treated with respect here which is something they didn't get at WWE Screw The Rules.</p>
<p>The fed now is just surviving but many feders exspect the fed to go quiet and it will eventual die or will be shut down, Everyone knows that Woody is just back for a while and that usually when he comes he stays for a while and then goes, But this time Alex and Matt will not be there to pick up the pieces because with Alex now being an inactive superstar and Matt having already left, It is exspected that STR is going to die very shortly.</p>

<p>On querying for information about this geographical feature lying in the lower reaches of the Indus valley in present day Sindh province of Pakistan &amp; in close proximity of the Raan of Kutch,it was disappointing to find no entryon the subject. It is generally believed that as a result of an earthquake in the past this ridge like feature was formed which not only altered the course of the Indus(pushing it Westward from its old course) but also altered the drainage pattern in the Raan Area. It is requested that persons having something to contribute on the subject please post it on the site.</p>

<p>Situated in the extreme west of Surrey, within a short distance of the Hampshire border, the parish of Normandy includes Wyke, Christmaspie, Willey Green, Pinewood and Flexford. In spite of increasing residential development, this district still remains largely rural in character with agriculture and its associated undertakings as the principal local industry. There are an increasing number of residents finding their employment in Aldershot and Guildford, for which a regular bus service takes about 20 minutes to either town. Some residents commute to London either by rail or road, this taking about 50 minutes. Trains from Wanborough Station (located within the village) connect to Ash and Guildford</p>
<p>Modern development is strictly controlled by the local authority in order to maintain the very attractive natural amenities and to ensure the protection of the Metropolitan Green Belt.</p>
<p>The southern part of the parish lies within a mile of the Hogs Back on the North Downs. The northern part undulates amidst woodlands and commons with its natural charm.</p>
