<dd><b>Response:</b> None of those have any cultural significance, except perhaps the latter.

<li>Shouldn't there be an article on Scottish egalitarian sentiment, rather than on a phrase describing it?

<dd>If you want to write such an article, then feel free to do so and then request a merge. I personally feel that an article on the phrase itself, and its background, performs the same or similar function in a much more elegant manner and crucially provides a greater degree of verifiability. As for notability- there are numerous websites discussing the etymology, e.g .<a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/23/messages/222.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/23/messages/222.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=69809&amp;messages=17" class="external autonumber" title="http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=69809&amp;messages=17" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://www.greatclanross.org/icons5.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greatclanross.org/icons5.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://daily.presbycan.ca/devotions/2006/06-03-07.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://daily.presbycan.ca/devotions/2006/06-03-07.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, and many others. Searching for alternative spellings and phraseology may also be rewarding. This aphorism will be found in ANY worthwhile Scots phrasebook. From the look of your user page it sounds like you may be a Scot- if so, I'm surprised that you are not familiar with this phrase. It is very widely used, and notability is not an issue. Whether of not the phrase is culturally significant <i>is</i>; I do believe however believe that JTB satisfies those requirements. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 14:37, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He sounds more than notable enough to be worth a biography. His landscape paintings are worth thousands and he's in the Tate Collection. But, the article as it stands contains nothing whatsoever about him (in fact, it's somewhat misleading). There's no way this article is going to be deleted, but I would strongly suggest that it be rewritten as a biography (including the phrase) rather than a culturally significant dicdef. He certainly merits it, and it's much more in the style of an encyclopedia to do so.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 17:27, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure why you've discounted them, although I would agree that they are probably not of sufficient merit to be included as sources in the actual article- they were not intended as such. I agree that hopefully the article will be retained- an additional Jock Thomson article sounds like a fine idea; if and when it's created there may be scope to discuss a merge and redirect. As for the notability of the phrase- I don't mean to press the point if you don't wish to say, but are you Scottish? I make no claims that the aphorism is widely-used internationally, but it certainly is in Scotland. I do accept that a foreigner or one who has not spent a reasonable amount of time in the country or around Scots is unlikely to have come across the phrase. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 18:37, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Keep</i>- Could have sworn a large part of Wikipedia's purpose was to collect things that may, on the surface, appear to be meaningless bits of trivia or uncommon expression, but the mere fact that their origin can be determined easily through a search on the site is part of the usefulness of the Wikipedia over inprint dictionaries and encyclopedias.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I know and use this phrase, and I'm 19! so not that archaic surely. Appreciate the comment about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> but I think the quality of the stub and the particular relevance of this adage allow an exception. <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendor_eb4d.html" title="User:Mendor">Mendor</a> 09:11, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> a well known phrase - even if not well known to the person proposing deletion. If Wikipedia was restricted to things I knew about it would be a barren place!--<a href="../../../s/j/h/User%7ESjharte_73ba.html" title="User:Sjharte">Sjharte</a> 10:58, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please keep this entry in Wikipedia. It's important historically as so many Scottish people use this phrase and we must keep it in regular usage to prevent it from disappearing altogether.

<p><br />
This is a well-known phrase among Scots above 40 years old (my 83-year-old Scottish mother uses it quite frequently in the context of realizing that we all have "issues" and that we are all basically "good" nonetheless. (Never recommend deletion of something you don't recognise; it is most likely that you are ignorant on the subject.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.7.147.110 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.7.147.110_cd8f.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.7.147.110">contribs</a>).</small></p>
