<p>A copyrighted term about a test you send for in the mail to learn about, and then they send you a certification. It's some pseudoscience that says you can tell a person's characteristics by their handwriting.

<li><b>Speedy keep.</b> Well-known pseudoscience with a venerable history. The term is a perfectly good dictionary word: AHD says "NOUN: The study of handwriting, especially when employed as a means of analyzing character."<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/40/G0234000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/40/G0234000.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Heck, there <i>could</i> even be something in it, although I vaguely seem to recall studies showing that different graphologists' analysis of the same handwriting samples didn't yield consistent results. All articles of this kind need constant watching for the insertion of promotional material and links and for point-of-view pushing; this one could probably benefit from some careful attention, but it doesn't even look particularly bad. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC) P.

<li>Actually, I was asking the nominator why he stated the term being copyrighted in the first sentence if that was not being used as a reason to delete the article. I also believe that the correct artilce was nominated because bith the nominator and one of the people voting keep stated that it was about studying handwriting.</li>

<p>It is a vanity page, quite possibly unverifiable, and an advertisement (since it prominently links to sites that earn money from ads and from the sale of the "energy-related" articles they promote). Looks like a non-notable forum for fringe technologies, and also like someone's trying to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">make a point</a>. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D. Flores</a> <span style="font-size: 80%">(<a href="../../../p/a/b/User_talk%7EPablo-flores_ff76.html" title="User talk:Pablo-flores">Talk</a>)</span> 00:54, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Response from PESWiki Founder</b> The page was posted by the suggestion of <a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">User:Meco</a> who posted the invitation to create such a page on <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESterlingda_e7bd.html" title="User talk:Sterlingda">User_talk:sterlingda</a>'s talk page on 25 May 2006.</p>
<p>The argument that the site earns money from ads and therefore is unworthy of a link is not balanced inasmuch as most sites on the internet (and which are linked from Wikipedia) are supported at least in part by ads.</p>
<p>The argument of "unverifiable" is also irrelevant inasmuch as many of the technology feature pages most often include documentation of just what is or is not validated on a given technology. Indeed, the New Energy Congress, which is hosted at PESWiki.com was founded with the purpose of documenting technologies and rating them based on a set of criteria, one of the ten criteria being "credibility of evidence."</p>
<p>The site has been built over two years, through the collaborative effort of many people, and contains many well-developed articles akin to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The argument that the site is merely a "non-notable forum", that is likewise groundless, inasmuch as the ratio of viewers to posters is highly disproportionate. Most of the traffic comes from viewers, and most of the changes are made by a few individuals who are careful about accuracy and credibility. Very little dialogue, or "forum" activity takes place on the site.</p>
<p>As for "fringe technologies," we prefer to use the terminology of "cutting-edge," and yes, that is our specialty -- to push the envelope. We spend most of our effort outside of the mainstream box. That is why the site was created, rather than just populating energy-related content at WikiPedia. Such content was not welcome here, so we created that site, and it has been a tremendous success. Many professionals from a wide berth of disciplines visit the site and refer to it often.</p>
<p>Of course we're trying to <b>make a point</b>. Isn't that the point of any written document? Maybe I'm missing some nuance of some Wikipedia jargon. Whatever.</p>
<p>Finally, let me say that one thing I do not miss at all about Wikipedia (rarely visiting here for the purpose of posting), which is nearly completely absent at PESWiki, is this sort of mindless quibbling about content that is obviously meritorious to most observers -- especially those who know what they are talking about on the subject. Mr. Pablo-flores is able to post a notice of putting the page up for deletion, and he has obviously spent just a minute or two looking at the site, while there are several individuals contributing to PESWiki many hours a day, day after day, week after week, and now two years total, making it a very significant work -- a point completely lost on Mr. Pablo-flores. I don't mean disrespect to him in staying that, I'm just criticizing the culture here at Wikipedia which is so knee-jerk busy-bodyish, that productivity of serious contributors is wasted on responding to such silly nonsense.</p>
<p>I'm so glad I have a place mostly absent of such mindlessness over at PESWiki, where we can post unfettered, for the most part, limited only by a quest for truth, and hardly ever having to be bogged down by politics of groundless and unnecessary interactions such as this.</p>
<p>I'm the "Jimbo Wales" of PESWiki, and am treated with respect there, and I try to treat others who contribute with the same respect. Yet here at Wikipedia, I'm treated like an imbecile. Do you think that that is inviting to good content contributions? Hardly. I spend every waking hour, nearly, focused on cutting-edge energy technology, surveying the field, reporting, writing, compiling, etc. Yet Mr. Pablo-flores treats my posting with about as much respect as if it had come from some punk just flinging some information on the site for a kick. Man I don't miss Wikipedia!</p>
<p>If the inventor of a technology comes to PESWiki and posts content, we rejoice. We don't call it "self-promotion." Sheesh, if Tesla were alive, and dared post something about himself at Wikipedia, you would ban the page because of "self-promotion." Who better to compose an article than the subject of the article? Come on folks. When are you going to get a clue? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESterlingda_ef47.html" title="User:Sterlingda">Sterlingda</a> 06:30, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>Many of the topics are on <u>subjects that Allan was not able to post at Wikipedia</u> when he attempted to do so back in 2003. At the time, such content was considered too controversial, or not sufficiently established scientifically. <u>Several of these topics now have significant Wikipedia entries as well.</u></i> (emphasis mine)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The article has other problems, already outlined above, which cannot be solved by removing those sentences.</dd>
<dd>Yes, Mr. Allan, Wikipedia <i>is</i> picky and yes, some of us do quibble about content. Our content (I speak of us as part of the community, which you aren't and don't want to be, as per your own admission) is subject to policies. You're free to have other policies in your site.</dd>
<dd>I won't discuss the quality or scientific validation of the content, or the work put into it by its contributors. That's not the point of this AfD. The point is that the website is not notable (see above), and the article makes claims that are not verified outside of it. Wikipedia is not a source of information; ideally, it's a repository of already reviewed, verified information.</dd>
<dd>Of course many sites employ advertising. But your site has a "Top 10", for example, that is a directory of commercial websites selling controversial technologies (cold fusion for home theaters, energy extraction from the vacuum, etc.). The Wikipedia article doesn't add to our knowledge of these, it merely increases your visibility. You have to be visible (notable) <i>before</i> you have an article in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Your response only reinforces the idea that you're trying to make a point. Wikipedia is not "on the quest for truth". There are other places for that. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<p><b>Non-notable?</b></p>
<p>In Response to those who say the article should be deleted because PESWiki is non-notable. . .</p>
<p>According to Google, which has a very strong algorithm for page ranking, PESWiki consistently pull up high, often coming in the top three for specific companies, inventors, and technologies for which PESWiki has a feature page; often coming up even higher than Wikipedia for certain topics. This indicates that according to Google, which bases its algorithm largely on incoming links and traffic, PESWiki is a highly significant site, on a par with or even surpassing Wikipedia when it comes to PESWiki's coverage of cutting-edge energy technologies. If that is not significant, then neither is Wikipedia significant.</p>

<li>Google is not helpful in establishing notability of a website. People here are sometimes impressed by high Alexa Rankings, which Peswiki is rated at 59,969 - because that measures the traffic - i.e. how much the website is used, not just how good it is at scamming google. Mayhaps you should take a gander at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> to see what Wikipedia is really looking for. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:43, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>As documented at <a href="http://googlehigh.com" class="external free" title="http://googlehigh.com" rel="nofollow">http://googlehigh.com</a>, PESWiki's page rankings are not due to short-term tricks or gimmicks, but are due to quality and presentation of content. These high ratings are a consistent feature of PES Network sites, and do not come and go with the latest trick. An Alexa rating in the region of 59,000 is quite respectable for a niche-topic site as PESWiki is. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESterlingda_ef47.html" title="User:Sterlingda">Sterlingda</a> 14:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>An Alexa ranking of 60 000 is not atrocious, but it's hardly a criterion for inclusion - it just means a site may be able to establish itself as encyclopaedic (which this has not). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 17:11, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>PESWiki Has a few references also (in a few articles). And there has been a systematic push to keep the site out (defenders of "truth" not fact). Sad to see the Wikipediblog do this. AfD use to be alot better a few years ago (when it was VfD), but the bias is rampant now in Wikpediblog ... 134.193.168.251 14:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>On this point you would be mistaken - the article does <i>not</i> cite any reliable sources. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:17, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This AfD is not a competition to see if PESWiki is better than Wikipedia or any other site. Please read the policies that have been pointed out to you and try to understand what this is about. And please move long replies to the talk page (AfD main pages are for votes and short comments only).

<li><a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_bomb.html" title="Google bomb">Google bombing</a> is what wikipedia does.

<dd>A site having revenue income outside of just donations does not constitute grounds for it not being addressed or linked from Wikipedia. Not everyone has to beg, though PES Network would not have survived without generous contributions in the beginning. It is now self-funded.

<dd>I have documented here (which someone removed) that many of PESWiki's energy listings come up higher in Google searches for key terms than Wikipedia for those same terms, often coming within the top five, and even in the first position in some cases, such as "Open Source Energy". We are ahead of CNN, CNET, and even the U.S. Government and all other institutions on the planet for many search terms. If that is not notable, I don't know what is. And it isn't because we trick the search engines. The <a href="http://googlehigh.com" class="external free" title="http://googlehigh.com" rel="nofollow">http://googlehigh.com</a> site I posted documents the opposite -- our high ranking comes from a principle of "honesty really is the best policy.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Sterling replies&#160;</dt>
<dd>The volume of back-and-forth commentary taking place on the site is maybe around 2 - 5% (a guess). It is very low. Most pages are objective presentations of their subject matter, and include links to skeptical input. That is as it should be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Pablo says&#160;</dt>
<dd>"fringe technologies"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Sterling says&#160;</dt>
<dd>Today's truth was yesterday's blasphemy. Indeed, we push the envelope. That is our mission -- something Wikipedia is unwilling to do, hence the void that needed to be filled. Someone needs to be willing to think outside the box and explore new possibilities, or no advancement will be made. Wikipedia specializes in well-established science. PESWiki specializes in cutting-edge science, often bleeding-edge. Few are courageous enough to risk their reputations in such uncharted territory, but for those who are, we provide a venue for their exploration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Pablo said&#160;</dt>
<dd>"trying to make a point"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Sterling replies&#160;</dt>
<dd>According to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, this apparently has to do with a Wikipedia user posting something not for its merits, but to create controversy in order to illustrate an argument through an extreme example. I assure you that I had no such agenda in posting the page. As stated in the memo at the time I posted the page, I was posting the page based on another user suggesting a couple of months earlier that I do so. The page was posted with all sincerity, and is an accurate, if not inadequate synopsis of a very in-depth and substantial site, whose contents has been created through the collaborative efforts of many.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>In summary</b>, I have replied to each of Pablo's criticism, showing them to be overwhelmingly groundless. I must say that when he first posted the "delete" suggestion on the page, I was tempted to post a "delete" suggestion on his user page. I didn't know how to do so, or I would have. Perhaps someone else, who is more Wikipedia conversant can do so. Let the Wikipedia community decide if Pablo should continue as a contributor in good standing. I would certainly vote "delete." With people like him making such ridiculous suggestions with absolutely no substantial merit, only personal bias and knee-jerk observations, the caliber and meaningful future of Wikipedia is jeopardized.</p>
<p>As a sampling of PESWiki merit, please review our most recent page: <a href="http://peswiki.com/index.php/Review:The_Corporation_(Documentary)" class="external text" title="http://peswiki.com/index.php/Review:The_Corporation_(Documentary)" rel="nofollow">Review:The Corporation</a>. See also the <a href="http://www.peswiki.com/energy/Latest" class="external text" title="http://www.peswiki.com/energy/Latest" rel="nofollow">listing</a> of the most recent major page postings at PESWiki to get a feel for the frequency and caliber of new PESWiki content, which has been mostly consistent from the beginning, two years ago, when the site commenced.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_PESWiki_b490.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PESWiki">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pablo spent 12 mins max before posting AfD</span></h4>
<p>I gave the following response to Pablo who posted a message to my talk page requesting that I remove my comments about him, as well as the <a href="#Where_PESWiki.com_Surpasses_Wikipedia_in_Google_Searches" title="">Where PESWiki.com Surpasses Wikipedia in Google Searches</a> section.</p>
<p>Hi Pablo. Don't put words in my mouth. I did not say "PESWiki is better than Wikipedia". I pointed out that PESWiki excels for some search terms. I didn't say so explicitly, but those search terms are not inconsequential. The point was to document that your assertion that PESWiki is "not notable" is not true.</p>
<p>Your arguments for deletion were shown by me to be groundless in each particular. Why don't you acknowledge as much? Likewise, I could show that each of the other arguments are without merit. I honed in on you because you were the one who commenced to AfD, and you had the gall to respond to one of the supporters for non-deletion by asking how I had rebuffed your arguments, so I elaborated, point by point. I wouldn't repeat myself if you would make such ridiculous statements as "Such as?" in response to the user comment "PESWiki Founder makes some very valid points, which don't appear to have been taken into consideration".</p>
<p>I stand by my assertion that Wikipedia would be better served without knee-jerk reactionaries such as yourself who make accusations that are groundless. Let me ask you. How much time did you take looking at PESWiki.com before posting the AfD? The answer to that question is found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PESWiki&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PESWiki&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> of the page. Twelve minutes max. That is absolutely asinine that you would be able to render any kind good judgment in such a short period of time. Yet you carry yourself in your wording as if you are some big hot shot at Wikipedia. You should lose your privileges at Wikipedia, which is not well-served by the likes of you being free to throw your weight around.</p>

<p>Several critics above said that the PESWiki article fails for reasons of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The updated External articles and references section documents some relevant mainstream press citations, satisfying the first condition: "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself."</p>
<p>'<b>Ramifications for Wikipidia</b></p>
<p>Should laziness on the part of those voting for deletion -- because they do not roll up their sleeves to see if significant citations exist -- constitute grounds for deletion of a page? Except for one reference, I populated this list of links by doing a simple Google search on PESWiki and "New Energy Congress". The list is not comprehensive.</p>
<p>I thought one of the functioning principles of Wikipedia was that one person doesn't have to do all the work, but posts what he/she can, and others clean it up, expand it, post documentation, etc. That was not the case here. Rather, a few users responded in a knee-jerk manner, without doing any research, and assumed a certain thing (the article topic, PESWiki.com, is "not notable" based on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>), and rendered a decision based on that assumption. That assumption was wrong, they were wrong to vote for deletion. Their conclusion was groundless.</p>
<p>Do they continue in good standing at Wikipedia, and continue propagating such sloppy work? The first response to a new page should not be skepticism and persecution, but should be honest inquiry into the possibilities of legitimacy. I received no such queries in my talk page. Twelve minutes after PESWiki was posted, it was labeled AfD.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESterlingda_ef47.html" title="User:Sterlingda">Sterlingda</a> 18:40, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>p.s.</b></p>
<p>When <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">User:Pablo-flores</a> first came to the PESWiki page, and wondered about notability, rather than assume that non existed, without doing a check (which we can safely assume is what he did given the mere 12 minutes that transpired from the time the page was posted to the time he posted AfD), he should have either 1) done nothing; or 2) he should have done a web search to discover some significant links, and add them to the page for the benefit of subsequent users. Only after doing such a search, and coming up empty-handed, would he then be justified in posting a AfD based in part on the "non-notable" criteria. In this case, he would have found significant references.</p>
<p>Speaking of <i>making a point</i>, it seems that he was trying to be a hero for Wikipedia, keeping unworthy content out, at the expense of actually determining whether or not the content had merit. Again, I say an AfD should be posted on his user page, and he, and others like him, should not be allowed to continue in good standing at Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I think I have addressed all of the major concerns mentioned above. If there is still a concern that is not addressed, which constitutes grounds for page deletion, please bring it to my attention so I can either address it, or agree that the page does not belong at Wikipedia per that reason. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESterlingda_ef47.html" title="User:Sterlingda">Sterlingda</a> 18:45, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Sure, this is exciting (as in "wow, an actually <i>working</i> Ruby on Rails-based generic CMS!") and seems to net quite a few google hits (89,900 for "radiant cms"), especially on blogs. Yet, I have a tiny bit of worry that this might not be <i>that</i> widely used or widely discussed yet, and as the nom says, this is a rather new application. Since this is such a short stub right now, I don't see the harm of deleting this now and recreating it when (I'm saying "when" instead of "when or if", because all built-with-even-half-brain Rails-based things seem to get ridiculous amounts of hype =) the thing gets more mature and there's absolutely no question about it's notability. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:49, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've tried it and it's a very solid CMS, and extremely extensible. However, the article is very short because I've asked the author's permission to use some content from the project's webpage on the article and haven't heard from him yet. And:
<ul>
<li>It's not a Drupal competitor. It's supposed to be (and it is) a simpler CMS. The use of the Rails framework allows it to be easily extended to your own needs.</li>
<li>I don't think version-number can ever possibily be an issue regarding deletion. Reason/example? Look at <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment_%28window_manager%29.html" title="Enlightenment (window manager)">enlightenment</a>.</li>
<li>119.000 google hits, not 89.900.&#160;:P</li>
<li>I don't know how the notability policy has been used regarding blogs, but as mentioned before, it's beeing talked about quite a lot. Anyway, I doubt that small OSS aplications will ever match the criteria in <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> (at least in the way I'm interpreting it).</li>

<li>Meltzer has a bias against WWE(and WCW before it went out of business) and this is nothing more than his opinions.

<li><b>Merge</b> into Dave Meltzer's or the WO main article. Not really worth a full page, but reference-worthy. Drjayphd 00:01, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> since both Dave Meltzer and the Wretling Observer Newsletter are considered to be one of the most respected true news sources in pro wrestling I can't see how this is not notable. I would prefer my vote to be <b>Merge</b> but since the choice right now seems to be between Delete and Keep I have to vote for keep.

<li>Roger Ebert is just as respected in the movie industry but you don't see a page devoted to movies he's given high ratings(or thumbs-up ratings) to, do you?

<dd>If somebody created such a page my reaction would be the same, it does have its place, but its as a part of the Dave Meltzer (or Roger Ebert in case of the example) page.

<dl>
<dd>Just one more point I thought should be added for clarifacation. Its not really accurate to compare this list to a list of movies Roger Ebert has given thumbs up to. Meltzer so rarely gives five stars to matches that In a great many circles this list is considered to be an equilivent to a list of the greatest pro wrestling matches ever. Keeping that in mind only increases my thought that this information has its place here. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Day_d3f3.html" title="User:Stephen Day">Stephen Day</a> 19:23, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> or Merge. Either way, don't delete. Meltzer isn't just a respected critic, he is THE respected critic of wrestling. His accolades mean quite a lot to the industry and its fans. <a href="../../../b/m/2/User%7EBM2_95b0.html" title="User:BM2">BM2</a> 04:58, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It sounds like TJSpyke is very biased against someone he finds so biased. Get over. Any kind of list like this will be subjective, but this is probably one of the most respected lists of the best matches in wrestling history from 1980 to now that covers ALL wrestling, not just mainstream. Pages like this expose people to other promotions, other wrestlers, and matches they'd never watch otherwise. TJ Spyke is just upset because Dave Meltzer didn't go hog wild for Shelton Benjamin and Shawn Michaels. Well, Meltzer doesn't get upset when you don't go hog wild for the matches he lists as *****. Seriously, TJ Spyke just hates Meltzer and his opinion in this subject matter is not valid because of it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.97.6.148 (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.97.6.148.html" title="User talk:65.97.6.148">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.97.6.148_daa1.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.97.6.148">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>You've been moaning about this thing just because it's not in line with your opinion on what's a 5 Star Match. Look at it like this. Wikipedia should have a list of the greatest wrestling matches.

<li><b>Keep</b> WP is not censored. If people are concerned about unverified entries, why not place a {fact} tag next to them instead of nominating it for deletion? The information in the article is, I believe, mostly genuine, it simply needs to be verified. --Tess Tickle 13:29, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Who said that WP should be censored? "it simply needs to be verified." True, I guess, but the verify tag has been there for a while and no one seems interested in adding sources. AND I brought this issue up on the discussion page, and no one seems interested in adding sources. Adding individual fact tags to every entry would be redundant. And besides, who gets to define what the criteria is for being a stock film role? There's no way this can be defined, really. This list is a breeding ground for original research, and it always will be.--Derco 04:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Ya see, the problem is, that not everyone is one wikipeadia eery spare minute of every day. Some people don't sign in for months at a time.

<li>First, I have not attacked your character, and never have, despite you attacking mine on a number of occassions. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_July_30#Category:Gangster_Wikipedians" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_July_30#Category:Gangster_Wikipedians" rel="nofollow">your closing comment here</a> for an example.) <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is not precisely what I should've linked to, admittedly, rather my point is that you are listing this article on AfD to antagonize me because I have threatened to report your actions. If this isn't the case, then I'm sorry. At any rate, this is notable irreguardless of your nomination because it recieved over 1,000 diggs in a matter of days, which is exceptional. I'd have listed more detailed information about the extraordinary rate of signups for the game, however that is original research. The article passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which is a horribly broken guideline anyhow. (See <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_The_fundamentally_broken_nature_of_WP%7EWEB_1b0e.html" title="User:Syphonbyte/The fundamentally broken nature of WP:WEB">my essay on the subject</a>.) <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 04:55, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Do you visit Digg that often? Every day more than a dozen different articles receive over one thousand Diggs.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The "Digg article" is not an article but appears to be some sort of blog or forum post. WP:WEB is a guideline and authoritative as such.

<li>If you'll read my nomination statement you'll see that I say up to two dozen different links are featured on Digg <i>every day</i>. Merely being featured on Digg doesn't automatically make something so notable that it gets its own article. We're writing an encyclopedia of general knowledge, not an encyclopedia of everything mentioned on a popular internet site. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></a> 05:00, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I must agree with these statements about the Digg article, and it was my intent to list this at AfD if I couldn't find any other articles to establish its notability, especially due to the severe decline in the popularity of the game. It appears to have been a one hit wonder, and certainly doesn't merit a place in Wikipedia. However, the nomination was obviously made in bad faith, and being a big fan of process, I'd rather this nomination be discarded so that I can nominate it under my own name. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 05:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Its only "sources" are the game's website itself and a Digg mention ... Digg mentions, by the way, are very small capsule summaries of no more than 300 characters and are written by Joe Q.

<li><b>Comment</b> I thought I'd proven it rather clearly; I'm involved in a dispute with Cyde and told him that I'm going to report his actions (such as blocking me in a manner and for reasons wholly against blocking policy), and not 20 minutes later he listed this article, which I created, for deletion. If that's not a bad faith nomination, I don't know what is. Sure, the article should be deleted, however the inital nomination shouldn't be a bad faith one, in my opinion, as it could easily open the door for a DRV if a rabid Slave Hack player were to find this deletion discussion and notify the entire game community about it. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 05:26, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm uninvolved, and I see no indication of bad faith in this AfD. If Cyde is in a dispute with you, it is reasonable for him to review your contributions, and to nominate for AfD any deletion-worthy article he happens to notice in this course. This is standard operating procedure. Construing it as a personal attack on you would seem to imply that you <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> the article, which, well, you don't. In any case, this is entirely immaterial to whether this AfD should be relisted, which would serve no purpose at all. I fail to see how even a bad faith, but valid AfD would be a violation of process overturnable via DRV. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:23, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>This term appears to have originated as a joke on the <i>Simpsons</i> reflecting an obscure urban legend. There's no evidence that it is in widespread use or indeed in any use at all outside Wikipedia, so it should be deleted as a non-notable neologism (<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>). In the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_California_Hamburger_9338.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/California Hamburger">first AfD discussion</a>, the principal argument for keeping it was that it in fact was a verifiable Simpsons joke, but that does not make it encyclopedic in and of itself, in my opinion. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 04:46, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> As a matter of fact, this episode will be coming out on DVD today. Someone might want to check out the commentary track to see if the term was invented by a Simpsons writer or if it actually existed before the Simpsons. Based on what I know, though, I'd say <b>redirect</b> to "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Secret_War_of_Lisa_Simpson_b886.html" title="The Secret War of Lisa Simpson">The Secret War of Lisa Simpson</a>".

<li>If "it's all people talk about here", there should be magazine feature articles, major news coverage, books, and reviews that you can cite to demonstrate that the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria are satisfied.

<li>Because it's been open for 56 years I'm having a hard time finding recent articles about it, it hasn't done anything recently(in the past year or so) that required media attention, although I have seen newspaper stories a while back, I havent been able to find any online. Also custard stands don't get "major news coverage"...it's not major news when a business is selling custard so that's why it's been quite hard to find, but I do know that it's a landmark in Duncansville and I'm doing my best to find credible sources.</li>

Please get used to the subject in discussion (<a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake_3.html" title="Quake 3">Quake 3</a>) before stating the value of an article. (i.e. you don't expect a "poet" to evaluate/write about "engineering", right?). Please read: <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> .

Please note that the Wikipedia's <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake3.html" title="Quake3">Quake3</a> main page reffers to Planetquake and Quake3world as sources of daily information about the game. Remember that Wikipedia is all about COLLABORATION. Please try to help find what you call sources instead of judging a subject that you're not familiar with. I'd like to remember that this article is only 2 or 3 days old. To show the value of the article for those who are not familiar with, I've posted links from the most famous sites about games showing the different games in which this mod is present and played. More than that, this article adds more information about this mod on the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake3.html" title="Quake3">Quake3</a> page since almost all mods have their own page and information and open doors for future modifications. Next time just try to define 'non-notable' or try to vote on topics that you are familiar enough to state what is 'notable' or not. Not to be rude, but I was reading your user talk and noticed that this is not the first time you act this way. BUT if you're really willing to delete this topic, I aknowledge your attitude and will be satisfied with that as stated below. Hope you don't take it personal since I'm just tryind to expose my point of view and also I believe that you're mature enough to move ahead with this.

<dd>If your position is so obviously solid, you should be able to state it concisely without spending so much time talking about <i>me</i>. I'll ignore the rest of your condescending flame-bait. I am not the nominator of the article, so take your attitude to him, not me. And nowhere in your rant did you explain why, if you've just now sourced the article (and I see that you have), why did you insist that it was sourced <i>before</i>, when it wasn't? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:19, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I concur with Wikipediatrix here even though I take a different position on the notability. The onus is on the article and it's editors to show why an article should be included. The false analogy of not expecting a poet to comment on engineering is very unhelpful for the purpose of wikipedia as a closer one would be expecting an encyclopedia contributor to comment on the validity of an encyclopedia article. By all means challenge views but you should do so not by trying to undermine another editor's legitimate perspective through what could easily be construed as personal attacks but to instead show why your own view should be accepted. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 13:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think you misunderstand - the sources you need to save this from deletion aren't just the ones that prove the mod exists (the links to download pages in the current article), but rather you need <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to prove the mod is notable and not just one of countless other mods out there. For instance, a print magazine review or an established highly reputable website. If that kind of coverage doesn't exist, then the mod should stay as an entry in the Q3 article's Mod section (or the mod sections of the other respective games). --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 13:44, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep this page. While the term is not as widely in use as Boomers or Gen X, it turns up plenty of results in a lexis-nexis search. The term to be used to describe the generation born between 1954-1964 is still being debated, but this is one of the more frequently referenced. It has as much of a reason to be on this site as many other entries.</p>

<p>Not notable; advertising. This guy coins this term, he writes a book, and I don't actually see that it has caught on - about 1850 ghits for "generation jones", 1660 for "Jonathan Pontell". For comparison, 'generation x' gets well over 2 million. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:18, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Update</b> - Redoing my search, I think my statistics above came from Yahoo search, not Google. "Generation Jones" actually gets about 13000 Google hits, "Jonathan Pontell" about 26000 - so this is a bit more notable than I thought. I still think it is kind of lame - "generation x" gets almost 4 million on Google. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 09:09, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> I didn't claim that this was a hoax, I said that it didn't seem to be notable. The article seems to be rather inaccurate in that it claims that the term has become popular and is increasing in use, when in fact it seems to be rarely used. <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1260568/posts" class="external text" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1260568/posts" rel="nofollow">One representative page I saw</a> (from 2004) was a posting of an article using the term prominently - and a large number of the comments underneath were from people saying, "Generation Jones? I've never heard that term. Where did it come from?"

<li>I agree that the concept was certainly in the public eye, for a brief period of time in association with the release of the book. All of the examples you give are stories about the book.

<li><b>Comment</b> <b>Martinp23</b>: this book has an ISBN: 0759627738 <a href="http://www.textbooksrus.com/search/BookDetail/?isbn=0759627738&amp;kbid=1029" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.textbooksrus.com/search/BookDetail/?isbn=0759627738&amp;kbid=1029" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> therefore it is a keep. EDIT: Also the precedence has been set mayn times before, breaking precedence is very harmful to Wikipedia in the long run.

<li><b>Delete</b>, since it appears to be a vanity publication, no citable published reviews or significant library presence (I couldn't even find a copy in the LOC).

<li><b>Delete,</b> AuthorHouse is indeed a vanity press which will publish anything for a fee, and not a very high fee. One AuthorHouse title which I personally know to have sold less than fifty copies has an Amazon sales rank of 1,417,018, so this book has probably sold far fewer. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:09, 16 August 2006 (UTC) P.

<p>Software to generate web pages from SQL databases (I think). My concern is notability/importance: Sourceforge shows less than 5000 downloads for all versions and about 400 downloads for the current version. Also, the text is directly copied from the developers web site and nearly every other site in google's first ten, Since the author was user:TheBuns, it's probably an authorized (self) use, but the repetition of the description on so many pages suggests no one at any of these software and developers sites cares enough to write an expanded description.

That article seems to claim that the book inspired a reality show of the same name, but the <a href="http://www.imdb.com" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com" rel="nofollow">IMDB</a> lists no TV show by that name. <a href="../../../n/a/n/Talk%7ENancy_Weber_d802.html" title="Talk:Nancy Weber">Talk:Nancy Weber</a> also indicates that she edited the article herself, strengthening the case for it being a vanity article. I am also nominating the one of her books which has an article:</p>

(R.

<li>Qwghlm - That is a selective synopsis of my argument and you lower youself by its use. You are a typical premier league team fan - You have no concept of grassroots football.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The question we have to ask here is whether the information presented in this article is verifiable. It is. The official website for this club is <a href="http://www.uppermillafc.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.uppermillafc.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Secondly, the subject in question has achieved sufficient external notice to ensure that it can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research as well. I view that this article should remain. Its relative obscurity does not make it unencyclopedic. Moreover, the lack of "notability" is not a criterion for deletion, because this isn't specifically stated in the deletion policy. If we began to delate this article, i am afraid that this would set a presedence in the way no-league football clubs are being delt with on Wikipedia. On top of this, this article in question is part of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Non-league_football_7395.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Non-league football">WikiProject Non-league football</a>! --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 18:47, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am intending to offer a compromise. Those clubs which can be verified within the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> should be included. That means those clubs which have their own websites should be included here. The reason is clear. All clubs within the English football league system in the lower divisions <b>have</b> the potential to be promoted to step 1 of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_System_6444.html" title="National League System">National League System</a>.
<dl>
<dd>No, sorry I don't think you're right here. The fact they have a website is neither here nor there, and in fact we should be looking at third-party sources for verifiability, not ones published by the organisation itself. I think the level 10 minimum as a standard of notability is fairly generous myself, wouldn't have argued if the bar had been set a bit higher, and I'm a BIG fan of non-league. Consequently, <b>Delete</b>. As for setting a precedent - Yes. That's what happens when a consensus of notability is taken into account. Clubs who don't, or who haven't in the past, played at Level 10 or higher are going to get votes here to Delete. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 20:10, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I initially prodded a few of these, but when I discovered how many more there were, I decided more community input from AfD would be a good idea.

<p><br /></p>
<p>The issue at hand raised by Kchase is whether the diplomatic mission articles are simply lists. I referred to the Wikipedia is not a Directory for further clarification.</p>
<p>The first no-no mentioned is that Wikipedia should not be a list or repository of loosely associated topics. A list of aphorisms or quotes is definitely out, but reference tables and tabular information can be included. If the essence of the prohibition can be explained by is different between the examples, then it would be that what is listed should be reasonably focussed and the list in itself be <i>reasonably integral</i>. You would accept <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ten_Commandments_ca3b.html" title="The Ten Commandments">The Ten Commandments</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">the Periodic Table</a> or <a href="../../../n/i/x/Nixon%27s_Enemies_List_21b8.html" title="Nixon's Enemies List">Nixon's Enemies List</a>, but not Chinese proverbs, since there is no direct relationship between the parts to one whole (though The Thoughts of Chairman Mao is okay).</p>
<p>I am not just listing a country's embassies, but I am also showing its diplomatic network. That is the whole that merits its inclusion. Where a country chooses to fly its flag gives an indication where a country chooses to rationalise and focus its diplomatic activities. Only by looking at the matricies of who's-represented-where in the form of a list can you discern some interesting choices - Why has <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland.html" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> got an embassy in <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dar_es_Salaam_5a1c.html" title="Dar es Salaam">Dar es Salaam</a>? and <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senegal.html" title="Senegal">Senegal</a> has a consulate in <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siena.html" title="Siena">Siena</a>? How come <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> has an embassy in <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tel_Aviv_6d0d.html" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> but <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> doesn't? Who has a wider network in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> - <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>? Which countries choose to send an ambassador to <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyongyang.html" title="Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a>&#160;?</p>
<p>None of these articles can be considered to be in violation of the second point - they are neither genealogical or phonebook entries, nor do they violate the third point - they are not resources for conducting business.</p>
<p>I do not consider <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a> to be an appropriate solution, as the intention of the lists is to chart the constellation of diplomatic relations of countries around the world today, and not to help tourists who have lost their <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passport.html" title="Passport">passports</a>.</p>
<p>I foresee three solutions:</p>
<p>(a) the motion to delete the articles is defeated (b) additional content is added to the entries each article, such per <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_locations_in_Spira_e311.html" title="List of locations in Spira">List of locations in Spira</a> which is cited as an example of <i>merged groups of small articles based on a core topic</i>. There is a limit to how much extra information can be given, and we could be just repeating details in other articles. (c) The pages are deleted and the contents are appended to a relevant article, like <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Japan_8ae4.html" title="Foreign relations of Japan">foreign relations of Japan</a>. This would however make the other articles considerably large and I predict people will end up wondering why aren't they given their own space.</p>

<dd>I should have been more specific. I meant subsection three, about directories and yellow pages. I acknowledge that it is weakly covered by that section and, frankly, I don't think these pages ought to be deleted based upon my weak argument to WP:NOT. As I alluded to above, the reason I've nominated them is because I don't think this content is appropriate for an encyclopedia, though I also don't want to see it deleted outright (but taken to wikitravel). To describe foreign policy or a diplomatic network in the way Kransky would like, prose seems more appropriate ("America has poor relations with the Middle East and doesn't even have an embassy in X country... etc."). I am reconsidering this nom, but I would like more input.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 22:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The intention of the list is not so much to say "America has poor relations with the Middle East and doesn't even have an embassy in X", but rather to let the readers themselves work out the connections.

<dd>Easy to solve your first issue - just add an external link to the website where I obtained this information (the foreign affairs ministeries). Otherwise I am happy to reinsert the lists into articles dedicated to each other's foreign relations, but I am not sure if other people would like this. Please go <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Vietnam_77de.html" title="Foreign relations of Vietnam">here</a> and see as an example of what it might look like.

<dd>Rather than giving each country its own heading, try just making a simple list using asterisks (*) at the start of each line. This will conserve a lot of space.

<dd>I just reformatted the list Kransky had merged (linked above). It took a while, and still takes up a lot of space. I'm still not sure how useful this information is. I say give Kransky a chance to link the source, consoldiate the information into the relevant articles and without using the cumbersome and unnecessary headings, then delete the list of diplomatic missions articles. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 18:23, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Please visit <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Albania_325e.html" title="Foreign relations of Albania">Foreign relations of Albania</a> for an example based on <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a>'s suggestions. I think grouping missions by region and then country is the most logical taxonomy, and therefore it makes sense to use headings. Also I think it is still better to list one mission per line, otherwise it will look messy when a country has many consulates in another country. "Multilateral organisations" will be the heading for missions to such. And a link to the source where I picked up the information is included. Tell me if you are happy, let me migrate and modify the lists, and then <b>delete</b> to your hearts content. Just be aware that Wikipedia has similar lists for airline routes (e.g: <a href="../../../k/l/m/KLM_destinations_dc42.html" title="KLM destinations">KLM destinations</a>) - on the basis of this precedence I did not expect something similar for diplomatic networks would violate the not-a-directory rule. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKransky_b5d8.html" title="User:Kransky">Kransky</a> 10:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I still think a list without headings is better, as shown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Vietnam#Vietnamese_diplomatic_missions" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Vietnam#Vietnamese_diplomatic_missions" rel="nofollow">here</a>, since it compresses the information and doesn't clutter up the heading directory at the top of the page with links to sections that don't have a lot of information. With a multi-tiered list, the hierarchy is retained, but the space is much better used, and it's "easier on the eyes." Countries with only one embassy really ought to be listed in the same line as the city where the embasssy is hosted, since the great majority of the countries only have one embassy in them. As an exception, countries hosting more than one mission could have another embedded list so that each mission can be listed on its own line. Again, this is a space issue. I still don't see any links to Kransky's source. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 17:33, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My example <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Albania_325e.html" title="Foreign relations of Albania">Foreign relations of Albania</a> has a link to the website where it is sourced. Look at the top. I stand by the one-mission-one-line rule because (a) it will be messy to list multiple missions in one country and (b) <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a>'s suggestion means the formatting will become inconsistent and unnecessarily complicated (do I embed if there are two or three or what number consulates? what if the names of the towns are short?). If you are still worried that this is not "easy on the eyes" look at the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline_destinations.html" title="Airline destinations">airline destinations</a> categories where not only a one-destination-one-line format is used, but there are *five* levels of categorisation (continents, regions, countries, cities and individual airports). This format is used for 132 separate articles, and nobody is complaining about the formatting. On the strength of the precedence can we agree that my listing of missions in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Albania_325e.html" title="Foreign relations of Albania">Foreign relations of Albania</a> be used as a model for other countries. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKransky_b5d8.html" title="User:Kransky">Kransky</a> 09:29, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm withdrawing the nomination (which doesn't necessarily close the AFD). It looks like consensus is going for merge, with disagreement about the TOC and sectioning. I suspect that the articles will be broken out again anyway, but this will be even more likely if they have individual sectioning for each country, so we may as well keep them where they are now.

<li>A quick google for "Scrum Whiteboard Markup Language" gets two hits. Both are Wikipedia, so no hits count. SWML returns SignWriting Markup Language as closest (yet still completely different), and refining with the term Scrum included brings it back to the same two hits. This makes the notability of this article <i>very</i> questionable and subject to deletion merely by Wikipedia's notability guidelines - this is not a recognised software development tool. A similar search for the word "Microsoft" returns 1.9 <i>billion</i> hits; even by removing all the hits with microsoft in the url we still end up with 1.3 billion. Microsoft's scale and fame, whether good or bad, is notable and is therefore suitable for a Wikipedia article. Even if it was started commercially there's enough editors here that that commercial tie would soon be shredded; what we end up with is an article that is fairly near to objective, not counting occasional vandalism to the page. If we relax your example to look at other, smaller companies, the general pattern is that it'll only be included if it's notable enough to be well-known on the web; googling is a handy depth tester for that. However I tend to assume good faith and so nominated this for deletion discussion rather than <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">speedy</a> admin deletion. I believe the article was written in good faith; so long as commercial ties can be left out that belief will remain. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">Firi</a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_Esperanza_4dd7.html" title="User:Firien/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">n</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirien_191d.html" title="User talk:Firien">§</a> 23:21, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I find your assertion that Google is the font of all knowledge and that wikipedia should merely be a subset of google results not only incorrect but also rather insulting. If Wikipedia is merely a subset of google results then this surely raised questions on the validity or necessity of wikipedia itself. Further your claim that this is not a recognised development tool is correct. Nothing is developed by the use of SWML, merely SWML enables it easier to understand what people are stating on white boards. I think what you mean is "I don't recognise this as a development tool". If this is the case would it not be possible that you do not know ALL the development tools currently in use, or are you claiming that between google and yourself you can form a full set of development tools. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.166.11.126 (<a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.166.11.126.html" title="User talk:213.166.11.126">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.166.11.126_771e.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.166.11.126">contribs</a>).</small> (Article creator)

<li>Don't twist my words. I stated clearly that google is used as a test of notability, not as a fount of knowledge. Wikipedia cannot and will not rely on it, because it is not a source of reliable facts; but it <i>can</i> be used to measure if a topic <b>exists</b>. Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia and so strives to keep its information true and verifiable. And your granting that this is not a recognised development tool makes it subject to deletion purely for its lack of notability - Wikipedia is not a place for original ideas, not for "spreading the word". Of course I don't know all the development tools in use; I'm not superhuman. No-one does. Neither did I claim that I can with or without google form a full set of development tools. I'm actually swayed by your arguments to change my vote from Merge to Delete; the information simply doesn't meet Wikipedia's requirements for inclusion. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">Firi</a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_Esperanza_4dd7.html" title="User:Firien/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">n</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirien_191d.html" title="User talk:Firien">§</a> 10:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Again you state that Google can be used to see if a topic exists. I question whether google has all possible topics in existence. Does it know for example about every tribe in the rainforest - probably not. Further google is only testable for notability for the population of the world who can access the internet AND are able to create web pages. It's a poor test or existence, as someone who tests things for a living I suggest that you revise your testing strategy. I have not twisted your words, perhaps they are just ambiguous. Which was my point on Development tools and the term development. It depends on ones definition of the term development. Under your definition then yes it probably is a development tool, under other definitions then possibly not. It's a shame you feel the need to state that wikipedia is not a place for original ideas, quite clearly this is true and it doesn't need to be spelt out. I do however think that it is exactly the place for "spreading the word", why else would one use an encyclopedia if not to find things out and spead knowledge. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Scrummaster (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scrummaster_3be6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scrummaster">contribs</a>).</small> (Article creator)

<li>It is one of Wikipedia's rules that it is NOT a place for that. You told me to understand the topic; I'm telling you to understand the rules.

<p>My understanding is that this page is a stub for a more complete article about SWML (a language that I know and use) and I think that it should be kept for a while for the original author to have the opportunity to complete it. The language, as far as I know is not commercial nor linked to any particular company. Although it has been developed and mostly used in conjunction with the SCRUM methodology, it can be easily applied elsewhere as it only defines the whiteboard syntax, therefore it should have an article of its own. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.166.11.126 (<a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.166.11.126.html" title="User talk:213.166.11.126">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.166.11.126_771e.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.166.11.126">contribs</a>).</small> (Article creator) 16:43, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Again my point is that in the creation of the article it <i>was</i> linked to a particular company; as seen in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SWML_-_Scrum_Whiteboard_Markup_Language&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=68631023" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SWML_-_Scrum_Whiteboard_Markup_Language&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=68631023" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit, the second edit to the article just after the article was created by the same person. That site doesn't even have a single result when you search it for the word 'markup', but it was tied to the article nonetheless. Perhaps it's just that link that needs removing, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>; while there are admittedly a large number of guidelines on Wikipedia I'm sure as an IT professional you'll recognise the acronym RTFM. While anyone can edit, this isn't freeform; it's still an encyclopedia. Having now looked into the notability of SWLM and found it lacking, I personally feel that this article should either be deleted entirely for lack of notability, or merged back into the main scrum article; if it ever matures/develops (as perMartinp23's comment below) into something widely recognised and used in software development methodology then the section will become large enough to split off into a separate article. Your argument about being developed and used in conjunction with Scrum is weak since the title of the article is "<b>Scrum</b> Whiteboard Markup Language". Again if it does ever become used, whether under a name not linked to scrum or not, it should be notable outside Wikipedia before an article is written here. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">Firi</a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_Esperanza_4dd7.html" title="User:Firien/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">n</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirien_191d.html" title="User talk:Firien">§</a> 23:21, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep but agreed - merge</b></s> amended below; FYI ControlChaos is Ken Schuaber's company for Scrum consulting and cirtification. It was included as an external reference for Scrum and not as part of SWML. As far as I'm aware Ken does not support SWML at this stage, and therefore SWML has no links to ControlChaos. I suggest that you understand the domain about which you are writing before raising further objections. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Scrummaster (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scrummaster_3be6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scrummaster">contribs</a>).</small> (Article creator)
<ul>
<li>If it's an external reference for Scrum, it should be in the article for Scrum, not in this one. Even there it would be questionable, because it's an external commercial link that doesn't improve the article. There are <i>hundreds</i> of companies that perform similar work, and I fully understand the domain even though I don't and don't need to know every single twist introduced by every single software company and IT consultancy and PM-training house in existence; I suggest both that you note what my objections were (originally "Commercial, possibly non-notable, badly written"; now without the commercial consideration since that's been clarified, but definitely non-notable. It doesn't matter at all whether Ken supports SWML, or who wrote it, or whether I know about it. It matters how many people know about it. Google was used as a test for this; no, it's not exhaustive, but with 0 hits outside wikipedia, unless the only place it's hosted is in some sites with a disallowing robots.txt, the concept remains marginal and unsuitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. Can you see this getting into Encyclopedia Brittanica? Perhaps in the future, when it becomes more widespread, but not now. I'll also paraphrase you and suggest that you understand the domain in which you are writing before raising further objections. As mentioned before, Wikipedia is not a freeform source for information. It is not intended to be the sum of all human knowledge, nor to document every single variation that will ever exist. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">Firi</a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_Esperanza_4dd7.html" title="User:Firien/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">n</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirien_191d.html" title="User talk:Firien">§</a> 10:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm happy for it to be merged with the main scrum article. You state that because SWML is <b>Scrum</b> Whiteboard Markup Language it is part of a development process. This is dependent on your interpretation of the term development within the software arena. Does it mean cutting code, or does it mean anything to do with the delivery of software products. I draw your attention to the existence of development teams, management teams, testing teams within a software project. Clearly here development mean cutting code. --<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Scrummaster (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scrummaster_3be6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scrummaster">contribs</a>).</small> (Article creator)
<ul>
<li>I draw your attention to the level of the articles around software development currently in Wikipedia. Terms are at the level of <a href="../../../a/g/i/Agile.html" title="Agile">Agile</a>, <a href="../../../s/s/a/SSADM_3a5e.html" title="SSADM">SSADM</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feature_Driven_Development_cdbe.html" title="Feature Driven Development">Feature Driven Development</a>, <a href="../../../d/s/d/DSDM_7da7.html" title="DSDM">DSDM</a>, RUP, PRINCE2, Scrum, Critical Chain, RAD, SEI's CMM, XP. I'm sure that because of your familiarity with the field you'll recognise those; hopefully you'll also recognise their <i>scale</i>. Those are working at the level of lifecycle planning, team structure and management, project management, estimation, requirements specification, testing, collaboration tools, and modelling methods. A new method for clarifying how things are set out on a whiteboard? You think that compares? I understand software development, methodologies, development of those methodologies, best practises. I've read Brookes, Yourdon, Avison, Fitzgerald, Demarco, Lister; they set out software development pretty well. Sure, there's newer stuff; it's IT, everything's obsolete the next day. But until it becomes <b>noteworthy</b> it is <b>not</b> suitable here. That noteworthiness comes from the scale of recognition, or it comes from excelling in its field and being noted at this from a reputable source. It does not stretch to something invented by 4 people that is still in its infancy, however well developed the language itself might be. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">Firi</a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_Esperanza_4dd7.html" title="User:Firien/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">n</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirien_191d.html" title="User talk:Firien">§</a> 10:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please state the specific required scale of recognition for wikipedia. Given that you clearly are not knowledgable on SWML I don't think you should make such harsh and unfair derogatory comments about it. Incidentally you state best practices, perhaps you should read further what many in the field deem to be best practice. I follow the school of thought that there are no best practices, merely a set of good ones that one should choose from. Reading and citing a range of authors does not make you the authority of software development. Brookes - which one, who cares how many books you've read. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Scrummaster (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scrummaster_3be6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scrummaster">contribs</a>).</small> (Article creator)
<ul>
<li>Again, RTFM. Because you don't seem to want to bother going through it, I'll point you at the right <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">place</a>. "A topic has notability if it is known outside a narrow interest group or constituency". This is not. I'll also point you again at the page which you failed to read when I posted before: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I'll draw out the main points in case you're still too lazy: "Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought." Yes, this fits. It's structured - but it's still original. "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information." What harsh and derogatory comments? You think calling it small and unknown is derogatory? I'm calling it not notable in the context of Wikipedia within Wikipedia. And again, I didn't claim I was the authority of software development. You questioned that I had any knowledge of software development, so I replied. You can't argue that I don't know anything and then moan about it when I show I do. Neither did I claim that I knew anything on SWML; I suggest you read back on my comments and compare them to Wikipedia's rules and guidelines. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">Firi</a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_Esperanza_4dd7.html" title="User:Firien/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">n</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirien_191d.html" title="User talk:Firien">§</a> 12:22, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's because you're doing it wrong. "Beentje" is a Dutch word, and will be found in combination with the name 'Peter' a lot.

The article has managed to attract serious editors (who are keeping the vandals well under control).

<li><b>Comment:</b> Urg, I didn't even know that (the published book thing). I guess the point I'm trying to make is that internet sources aren't automatically non-factual, and given that many of the articles here currently only contain internet sources, only using internet sources shouldn't be an automatic deletion criteria. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> also notes that "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" and I think the inverse should be true: ordinary claims don't need peer reviewed papers for proof. There's nothing in the Meathead article that isn't believed by that articles editors, with reasonable although not indisputable evidence, to be true. There was an April Fools joke in the article previously, but it was removed and I think that shows that the articles editors are happy to remove non-factual material. Also, the main point of the article is that someone calling themself Meathead is writing a popular series of essays (etc). The actual site itself should be good enough for that reference surely? I guess my arguments are:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The article is referenced above the standard of the majority of the articles here, and while those references are internet references, they are reliable for the fairly ordinary claims that they're covering.</li>
<li>The number of fanboys / fangirls spamming the last AfD is regrettable, but the admin who reviewed that AfD discounted their opinion anyway, and popularity is hardly grounds for deletion. The nominations argument that the "only reason this page survived deletion last time is that his friends [...] posted here to vouch for his continued relevance" is thus irrelevant.</li>
<li>The vandalism on the page is also regrettable, but it's being dealt with (the majority of it coming from one persistent IP vandal, on a one week ban last I saw), and frequent vandalism is also not a reason for deletion (or we'd be deleting <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falun_Dafa_3572.html" title="Falun Dafa">Falun Dafa</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Bush_724d.html" title="President Bush">President Bush</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, etc).</li>
<li>Some of the arguments for deletion of NN articles clearly don't apply here: that they don't attract editors, that they clutter cats, that the article tends to be overly biased (the article makes no PoV judgements as far as I can see, but I'll go over it again to try and make sure).</li>
<li>Wiki isn't paper, and so as far as I'm concerned, non-verifiability is the main argument for deleting NN pages. The article doesn't reference any scientific journals, but for some subjects, subjects which a reasonably large minority group of people are going to find interesting and informative, that isn't going to happen. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeBills_5132.html" title="User:GeorgeBills">GeorgeBills</a> 16:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Alright, what do we have here. Lets look at the reasons shall we: "Meathead is not known outside the Nine Inch Nails online fan community. The only reason this page survived deletion last time is that his friends at the Nine Inch Nails fan forum <a href="http://www.echoingthesound.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.echoingthesound.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.echoingthesound.org/</a> posted here to vouch for his continued relevance. Outside that limited sphere of online NIN fans, Meathead is unknown and irrelevant." Alright, here are the facts. Except for Trent Reznor, EVERY other MEMBER of NIN is UNKNOWN and IRRELEVANT outside that limited sphere. Please tell me mr. reporter, do you know ANYONE who is a part of NIN except for Trent Reznor? Oh please, go on. Do you wiki search and reply. Meathead is not only a fan, but a mutual friend of Trent Reznor. No, i dont mean to say that they are dating or some sort, but that Meathead is been an important part of NIN. If you were a fan, you would know that. The first "excuse" you guys had was that there are no links when you search for "Meathead Perspective" in google. We'll... let me show you: <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=Meathead+Perspective" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=Meathead+Perspective" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?q=Meathead+Perspective</a> Oh look, what do we have here? More than 1000 pages including www.nin.com itself! Second of all, Trent himself has bookmarked Meathead's page in www.nin.com under the resources section. <a href="http://www.nin.com/resources/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nin.com/resources/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nin.com/resources/index.html</a> Hell, i even have a feeling that if you guys keep putting up this article for deletion, Trent himself will comment on his blog and will say "Stop deleting this page!" cause no matter how much fun meathead makes of NIN, it really brings fans closer. NIN has one of the most loyal fans out there, and pages like Meathead's Perspective and theninhotline are bringing fans more closer. It would be a shame to see articles deleted for lame excuses. You know what, why don't you delete the important articles instead of this. Here.

<dd>This whole “controversy” deserves just a brief mention in the article about the country of Azerbaijan, but it does not need a whole section in every Azerbaijan related article, and it definitely does not need such a POV article. As a matter of fact, the country exists under that name since 1918, and it was recognized by Iran back then and now.

But what does that have to do with the fact that the name change happened back in 1918? It is a historical fact and should be mentioned and it is detailed enough to require its own section if not its own page.

I dont know what you have been taught in Azerbaijan or what you want to believe, but this is the reality, something that apparently you didnt know about till i created this article. I have come to a compromise with you before regarding the Azerbaijani people article, and now I'm asking you to come to a compromise with me. Everything in this article is factual and necessary.

<dd>Yes, my mistake, I left out two, but seriously, do only 5 articles make up all of the articles about Azerbaijan? Honestly, be realistic, 5 articles doesnt even make a dent, and thats as far as the "list" will grow. No other articles need the context. No where in the article does it suggest that this is an international dispute, although it is, and you know as well as I do that there are a lot of problems in the region today because of this name change. The article is in no way blown out of proportion, if you think it is, please provide the lines of text that you believe are "blowing it out of proportion".<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 04:38, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think it is enough to mention the "controversy" in the article about Azerbaijan, that's the way it's been before and I never tried to remove it. If some folks in Iran have problems with the name, let's mention it, but no need to present it as some international confrontation.

<dd>Why shouldnt those 5 need attention? Two of them are about the state of Azerbaijan (the present and the one in 1918 and later), one is concerning the people (the name change affected the name of the people, which causes much confusion about the ethnic origin, because its really two different ethnic groups with the same name now), the other is about one of the names of the region before it was changed to something else, and the last one is about the history of Azerbaijan, and correct me if I'm wrong, but changing the name to Azerbaijan is a big part of AZERBAIJAN's history. Again, you are just repeating yourself, without getting to the actual problem, you just want this article gone, its that simple.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 04:47, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who are those 2 different ethnic groups with the same name? If you talk about Azerbaijanis, they are the same people both in Iran and Azerbaijan. Some nationalistic circles in Iran feel very insecure, because they afraid that one day the Azeri minority in Iran may wish to claim independence, following the suit of their ethnic brethren on the other side of Araks. That’s the real reason for the “controversy” that some Iranian nationalists try to present as something indeed real. But somehow you failed to mention this aspect in your article. I see no reason for spamming many articles about Azerbaijan with the same repetitive information. This issue should be merged into the article about Azerbaijan and presented in a neutral fashion. All other articles should be cleaned from the POV “controversy” sections, which consume the space that could be dedicated to indeed useful info. The only other exception could be the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Azerbaijan_7da2.html" title="History of Azerbaijan">History of Azerbaijan</a> article, where we can also mention this "controversy". <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 05:17, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"North" Azari's are most likely a Caucasian people, while "South" Azari's are most likely an Iranic people. Infact, the name of the region, Arran, is a version of the name Albania, and the people were referred to as Arrani's by Iranians and Arabs, this alone shows that Azari's and Arrani's are not the same people. Our discussion here has just shown how controversial this topic really is, so now the title will stay the way it is hopefully.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 13:37, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are not of the same ethnic group. Genetic testing has shown this. Genetic testing has put "north Azeri's" with Caucasians, and has put "south Azeri's" with Iranics. They are only linguistically Turkic, not ethnically. And for your information, Canada and the USA share a common language, but that doesn't mean that Canada can change its name to the USA and join America. Also, using the same example, the present-day Azeri langauge is also not that drastically different from Turkish (Turkey), so are you also going to say that Turks and Azeri's are the same people too, because ethnically, Turks from Turkey are descendents of Anatolians people (Greeks, Armenians, Romans, Iranics, other Indo-Europeans). This article is detailed, sourced, and necessary, and it seems as the majority of the consensus is for a keep. You are the one with the POV. And that Britannica article is a direct consequence of the unjustifiable name change of the Caucasus region to Azerbaijan, and currently, me and Ali are thinking about creating another detailed article about the consequences of that name change and the confusion it has caused the scholarly community.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 14:14, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Genetics don’t mean a thing. They only prove origins of people, but they don’t define who they are. Language does. Azeris speak the same language and share the same culture and are the same people. Open any authoritative encyclopedia and you’ll see that. Check the quote from Britannica above, for instance. It is one of the most authoritative sources, and is written by the best specialists. You are just promoting Iranian official propaganda here, which did not change much since the times of Iranian shah regime. In order to suppress ethnic identity of Azeri people in Iran and assimilate them with Persians the official propaganda tries to persuade Iranian Azeris that they are nothing but turkified Persians. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 06:28, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This article is necessary, especially to put the <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijani_people.html" title="Azerbaijani people">azerbaijani people</a> articles in context. Everyone has a right to know that the name Azerbaijan in regards to the region north of Iran is historical revisionism started by a Pan Turk party in 1918, and that historically, Azeri's, and Azerbaijan only have to do with Iran, not the Caucasus. This article should not be merged because it provides a lot of information.

<dd>No the reason for deletion is that the article tries to create a vision that the Azerbaijan Republic came to be called as such in an overnight political decision. It is not that way. Almost all the countries in the world cover an area that is different than the original core of the country. Russia or Canada for example. The word Canada originally applied to a settlement in mondern Quebec City. Today, Canada covers almost 10 million sq. km. area. The same thing here. Azerbaijan originally referred to the area that is only the <b>part of</b> todays Iranian Azerbaijan. Eventually, it spread to refer to the whole Azerbaijani speaking areas. The most important thing is that it did <b>not</b> happen overnight in 1918. What happened in 1918 is that the name Azerbaijan was used as a name of a country for the first time. Now, this so-called controversy is a modern attempt, especially by those encouraged by the Macedonia affair. But, unfortunately for them it's not the identical situation here. Here is ethnical, lingustic and cultural uniformity between the Republic and the Iranian Azerbaijan. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBits_9563.html" title="User:TimBits">TimBits</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 16:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>TimBits, you are completely mistake. Never did the term Azerbaijan grow to ecompass the regions north of Iran's Caucasus border. You will not be able to find one single map before the 1900's that shows the region called Azerbaijan. The only region ever called Azerbaijan is Iranian Azerbaijan. And yes, the name change did happen overnight. In 1918, the pan-Turkish Musavat Party met in Tiblisi and decided on the name change. It literally was an over night name change.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 17:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see no ground for coming to an understanding with you in this matter. I have explained the situatin and there is nothing I can do when someone plainly says 'no it's not that way'. If there is any use, then I too will repeat that the name Azerbaijan came to be applied to a larger area gradually. It never heppened overnight.

There was actually a big controversy in Iran at that time(and now alittle bit less after 90 years), which is documented in Dr. Touraj Atabaki's book. Even Rasulzadeh (the founder of the republic) in the end in one his letter to Taqizadeh (one of the great Iranian Azerbaijani intellectuals) discussed this issue and says it was a mistake and Albania was separate from Azerbaijan. Also Shaykh Mahmud Khiyabani renamed Iranian Azerbaijan to Azadistan to protest this change. So the information is not definitely a POV.

<dd>You wish it was POV and propaganda, but its not. We have sourced infromation from pre-1918, and from the 1940's down. HOW DOES THAT MAKE IT CONTEMPORARY IRANIAN PROPAGANDA? Was the Russian Encyclopaedia written by Iranians? Was the 1911 Encyclopaedia written by Iranians? Was Barthold an Iranian? I dont know what you have been taught in your schools that makes you believe this is all propaganda, but this is reality, its the reality that they dont teach in Turkey and the R. of Azerbaijan. We have sourced information from even sourced R. of Azerbaijani news papers of the 1940/50's. Have you even read the article, maybe you should, you'll learn something.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article touches upon major issues of Azerbaijani identity and should be kept, if possible expanded. Furthermore, although I cannot claim that it does not contain POV or incaccuracies, many facts stated are perfectly correct. e.g. use of the name of Azerbaijan to denote northern Iran. Some issues, however, such as failure to mention the naming of the territory in the Safavid empire or claims that the people of northern Iran (so called South Azerbaijan) and modern-day Azerbaijan are different ethnicities is clearly POV and should be removed. Thus, the article should be cleaned up a bit and supplied with more citations, but not deleted.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikakasumov_f7cc.html" title="User:Mikakasumov">mikakasumov</a> 16:58, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dear Khosrow, I definitely support the content of the article since it is factual and there is no greater name in the early 20th century when it comes to Turkic studies than Barthold. Historically Caucasian Albania and Atoorpaatekaan were two different entities and the name Azerbaijan and ethnic name Azerbaijani are both recent for the caucasian republic of Azerbaijan. But I think perhaps in order not to insult anyone we can get rid of the word <i>republic</i> and change it to <i>name of Azerbaijan for Azerbaijan republic controversy</i> or <i>Name of Azerbaijani republic controversy</i>. This way maybe others will be satisfied as well. Also other materials related to pan-turkist plagarism must be investigated (both in Turkey) and Azerbaijani republic and history books need to be read to make sure these are state historian policies and not normal revionists which are found in every country. Unfortunately I was disheartened by the following link:<a href="http://www.azembassy.it/browse.php?lang=eng&amp;page=0002" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azembassy.it/browse.php?lang=eng&amp;page=0002" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> and I am wondering if this is the material thought as history in the textbooks of the Azerbaijani republic and what is the use in claiming that Zoroastrianism and Sumerians and Akkadians were Turkish??

<dd>Well even assuming he does find such a map with blurred boundaries (since old maps have made lots of errors as well) (so far I have not seen any old map not distinguishing Azerbaijan from Caucasia), it doesn't change the fact that virtually the majority of old maps clearly distinguish the historical Azerbaijan from Caucasian Albania.. Caucasian Albania though was often conquered. For example, to view Azerbaijan and Caucasian Albania as historically the same is as absurd as saying that since some of the maps we found show Caucasian Albania as part of Georgia(which you found quite a few and I found some too) or because some ancient historians consider Caucasian Albania as part of greater Armenia, then Caucasian Albania is part of Georgia/Armenia and should have the name Souther Georgia or Eastern Armenia (Ibn Wazih Ya'qubi and Baladhuri have mentioned this as part of Armenia, but this again does not correspond to majority of classical sources). Some sources have called all of caucus as Georgia or Armenia , but most have separated caucasian Albania from these two areas. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 01:17, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. This might seem to fly in the face of the keep-and-move opinions but there are logical reasons. 1) The article is a sub-stub; acknowledging the existence of an object doesn't make it inherently notable. 2) The website to which the article refers is still under construction, so no adaptation of information from that source can be carried out in order to flesh out the notable status of the college. 3) The author or other interested party/ies have had five days to improve the article to the point of notability and haven't done so. My conclusion to delete doesn't mean that this article shouldn't be recreated, just that a new version should include information that satisfies <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. <span style="border:1px solid #808;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../%28/a/e/User_talk%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User talk:(aeropagitica)"><font style="color:#fff;background:#808;"><b>&#160;(aeropagitica)&#160;</b></font><font style="color:#808;background:#fff;"><b>&#160;&#160;(talk)&#160;</b></font></a></span> 14:15, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> What? SVMC stands for Sri Venkateswara Medical College. It is a college, not simply a website. Yes, there is a website for the medical college. The article needs severe copyediting as it only seems to be talking about the alumni and their website yet doesn't say anything about the college itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are not multiple, verifiable, reliable, independent third-party publications on this. For one the BBC report just restates the local article, and you have forgotten that multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.

<li><b>Response to above comment</b> I disagree. The BBC story may well be the result of secondary research, however the Surrey Online article is a new development and features interviews with the protagonists after the event. These are therefore different sources that inform parts of the article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 193.25.116.40 (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.25.116.40.html" title="User talk:193.25.116.40">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.25.116.40_9cc2.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.25.116.40">contribs</a>).</small><small>Sign your posts</small></li>

<li><b>Response to above comment</b> If you do some basic research, for example a whois or a visit to this IP's talk page, you'll see that this is part of a bank of IPs used by hundreds of public libraries in the UK. Are you suggesting that this IP posted the original video to YouTube? I'd like to know how you found the IPs from YouTube's servers. Also, the geographical distance between the location of the incident and this IP would suggest to me that you're wrong. The only violation here is your attempt to bend the rules to get rid of an article you don't personally favour. The article is as valid as many other internet meme articles and should stay - your attempt to use the rules around original research have failed and now you're resorting to other tactics. Exactly the kind of thing the wikipedia community can do without. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 193.25.116.40 (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.25.116.40.html" title="User talk:193.25.116.40">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.25.116.40_9cc2.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.25.116.40">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> -- There are 2, such assertions, however, the article probably needs {{context}} more than deletion. I'll see what I can do in that regards. The two assertions(if weak ones) are that he's an editor of slashdot, which in notability is about the same as being an editor for the new york times(maybe that's slightly overdoing it, but my guess would be about the same readership levels on both things). Then again, I may be overestimating slashdot's importance. I'd still go with strong keep.</dd>

Also, it is not a fluke that the article has been around for two years with two dozen editors passing through and none of them tagging it for deletion. Also, note that CSD is specifically for unremarkable people or vanity pages, and the "assertion" requirement is a further restriction beyond that. It is not designed to delete articles about notable people which happen to not make a strong assertion of notability. While the CSD is prone to this error, if there is some indication that the person is <i>in fact</i> notable (and the person tagging or deleting should check), then it does not qualify. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 14:19, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also, highly POV as to which topics to be included - creator has already had major change of mind {<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_engineering_science_and_mechanics_topics&amp;diff=69713683&amp;oldid=69703465" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_engineering_science_and_mechanics_topics&amp;diff=69713683&amp;oldid=69703465" rel="nofollow">see here</a>} - arbitrary lists are not encyclopaedic. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 14:07, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Lists aren't bad. Wikipedia isn't paper. The list captures potential areas of expansion and thus is useful. I don't see how this particular list is POV (can someone explain that - with a specific topic from this list as an example). I don't see how the user who created the article pruning it has anything to do with the article having a place in wikipedia. Also the list isn't arbitrary it clearly states what it should contain - like hundreds of other "list of X topics" lists - see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematical_topics_in_classical_mechanics.html" title="List of mathematical topics in classical mechanics">List of mathematical topics in classical mechanics</a> - even better <a href="../../../m/a/t/Category%7EMathematics-related_lists_689b.html" title="Category:Mathematics-related lists">Category:Mathematics-related lists</a>. Additionally the article was in existance for less than 24 hours before it was prodded - why not give it some time to develop rather than judging it based on the fact it's a new article&#160;? Can anyone give some actual deletion criteria&#160;? <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegapixie_ea09.html" title="User:Megapixie">Megapixie</a> 15:26, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - the early Prod was a considerative act; much better to Prod early than wait until the creator has wasted extra time. I suspect that the creator may not have been aware of the power and flexibility of categories. All the creator needs to do is to make a category (hey, I'll do that now) and produce stubs for those that are red linked. It is POV because you have an arguement as to what is included; if this list remains I shall be making changes. With categories you have much more flexibility because x-discipline topics can be in multi-categories. The time that lists have a role is when substantial annotations are made; not the case here. BTW thanks for pointing out that Wikipedia isn't paper; I'd missed that. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlueValour_0082.html" title="User talk:BlueValour">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BlueValour_6735.html" title="Special:Contributions/BlueValour">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

How is it any more POV than a category&#160;? An article can be in two categories - it can also be in two lists - how does it make any difference&#160;? Why can't you produce an example topic from this article whose inclusion in the category is POV&#160;? I'm still waiting for you to produce a stub for Superfluid hydrodynamics that isn't going to get prodded/<a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedied</a> (A1) for either being too short or inaccurate in about 10 seconds. Can you address my points:
<ol>
<li>What is an example from this list of a subject whose inclusion is POV&#160;?</li>
<li>Why is it impossible to include a subject in two list&#160;?</li>
<li>Other than your personal feeling, where is the guideline/policy page that says categories are better suited for this purpose&#160;?</li>
<li>How are stubs written on the subject of <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vortex_dynamics.html" title="Vortex dynamics">Vortex dynamics</a>, Penetration dynamics, Impact mechanics and Functionally graded materials going to last 10 minutes, when they are written by someone who knows nothing about them&#160;?</li>
<li>How are you going to work out what redlink subjects <i>might</i> have been included in the list, if the creator (and other users) had been given time to develop it&#160;?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This list is is not so different in nature from other lists of engineering topics, e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_engineering_topics.html" title="List of engineering topics">List of engineering topics</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_aerospace_engineering_topics.html" title="List of aerospace engineering topics">List of aerospace engineering topics</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_biomedical_engineering_topics.html" title="List of biomedical engineering topics">List of biomedical engineering topics</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mechanical_engineering_topics.html" title="List of mechanical engineering topics">List of mechanical engineering topics</a> and so on. If this article is to be deleted then so should those be, which would be ultimately unfortunate. Perhaps, this is an instance of non-experts assuming the mantle of expertise. The nature of engineering topics is that they are interdisciplinary and therefore not prone to absolute classification. Such fuzzy boundaries on lists are not unhelpful if the context in which they are generated is clarified.</li>

<li>I can't believe a group of people can decide to delete a building from histroy because of it's notability. Take a look for a photo of Caary Wharf, it's in the skyline from the West angle, part of the original development now overshadowed by other towers whos notability is only height. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhillprice_4018.html" title="User:Phillprice">Phillprice</a> 15:02, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Spamvertising for online casino company; creator originally spammed links to gambling sites to other WP articles; when I removed them, he posted this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NawlinWiki#empire_online" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NawlinWiki#empire_online" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> on my talkpage, proposing that Wikipedia become a "business partner" of his company. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 14:37, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Response</b> Given <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">User:2005</a>'s cleanup of the article, and given that the company seems to meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, I am willing to withdraw the AFD nomination. I did not, however, "create an inappropriate AFD" -- when I created the AFD, the article was the older, spammy version created by the "looney affiliate".

<li>Actually you did not put the afd on the older/spammy article, which is the reason for the response. You put a prod on the crap article, but that was completely removed and a full, useful article put in its place, which only then had the afd inappropriately added, with the obsolete comment about the nutjob writing in your user talk. I suspect that you added the afd when you saw the prod wasn't there, but didn't read the new article. In any case though, the first one was useless but what is there now is just a normal, referenced article about a major business. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 19:30, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The COMPANY didn't ask to "partner" with the Wikipedia. C'mon now, lets not be ridiculous.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The company is notable by virtue of being publicly traded and a major player in the online gaming industry. What the user posted on someone's talk page is irrelevant to whether or not the article in question is spam; this should be a discussion of the merits of the article and whether or not the subject is notable, not whether or not the person who originally drafted the article had bad intentions.

<ul>
<li>The company's public status is not the only reason for its notability. The company is a major player in the online gaming industry as well. The two combined make the article notable enough to keep. Their total net revenue for Q1 of 2006 was $21.1 million according to Sharecast. They're also extensively covered by Casino City, which is a major player in online gaming new coverage. <a href="../../../r/r/a/User%7ERray_9aaf.html" title="User:Rray">Rray</a> 00:09, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Being listed on a stock exchange is not a notability criterion. Neither is having a revenue over some arbitrary threshold.

<li>Better. But <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> says nothing about the publisher. It is the <i>work</i> that must be non-trivial.

<p>Subject's sole "claim to fame" is a sports column for Salon.com.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Kaufman's column is <i>not</i> a minor feature—it gets daily billing near the top of the page. NTK makes his bias clear on the talk page: <i>Perhaps I am biased because his column bores me and I rarely even glance at it. Just because he is the sports columnist for Salon doesn't make him some sort of authority, Salon is not a sports magazine and the column seems to be a "cover-the-bases" afterthought.</i> Well, I'm also a Salon Premium subscriber, and Kaufman's column is the biggest single reason that I am. It's ridiculous to say that a major columnist at a major online magazine is non-notable, and the article is in pretty good shape after only a short period of work. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConeslayer_540b.html" title="User:Coneslayer">Coneslayer</a> 15:04, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Salon.com is a highly notable website, putting its significant contributors on the radar.

I DID have  a list of OEMs (Hardware+software) for Linux PCs.
I had them listed as external links at the bottom just like other articles with other PCs like Windows and Apple.
I think it is unfair to omit these computer manufacturers.

Other models of computers in other articles are listed such as: 

Apple Computer, Apple II, Apple Lisa, and Apple Macintosh Xerox Star Osborne  Acorn Archimedes  RiscPC Atari ST BeOS BeBox Pegasos NEC PC-9800 NeXT workstations Sun SPARCstation SGI Indigo and SGI Onyx

It is unfair to not list Linux PC models.

<dd>There's nothing architecturally significant about a PC running Linux. Usually it's just an IBM PC compatible running an x86 Linux distribution. All of the computers you mentioned are in some way notable or architecturally significant. The article under consideration was just a list of computer models and commercial links.

<li>HELLO REALITY ALERT HERE!!! What is with you guys? You have waaay too much time on your hands pal. I'm sure like Gamaliel it was just a coincidence that you went to the User:Dwain talk page right? But nothing is up no sockpuppet use is going on. User:Pitchka links to User:Dwain page. Duh! This was done a long time ago when people were saying that Pitchka was a bad word in some language or another. There was nothing wrong with having two accounts for editing as long as the one was identified and you didn't try defrauding the system by voting multiple times. So before you get all George Bush stole the election on us just cool out and see reason. I still use Pitchka because I created many articles and wanted to be credited for those creations.

A valid analogy might be <i>Religiously affiliated colleges at Canadian Universities</i> - but Schools of the 1870s fails because it's not a cohesive group, whereas Ivy League is. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. My analogy was, of course, a bit hyperbolic. But after looking over the article again, I can't see an <i>article</i>, with a coherent topic, anywhere.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Why would this list be more notable than say, Pac-10 business schools which would include Stanford, Berkeley, Southern Cal, UCLA, Washington, and Oregon? <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 19:13, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not that I've heard of the PAC-10, but if <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> didn't have an article, would the correct action be to delete <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> or to make an article for <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>France and Germany are infinitely more important than a loose association of business schools. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 19:19, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>France and Germany are only finitely more important than an association of business schoools, but that's neither here nor there. If the absence of article A is sufficient in one case to argue for the deletion of article B, what changes in my hypothetical example? Is it somehow a strawman? As I understand it, it's merely "If an article with validity level X doesn't exist, we should delete all other articles of validity level X" - what nuance have I missed? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:25, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, if their importance is in doubt. If there isn't a list of Big-10 molecular biology programs, then there shouldn't be one of Ivy League molecular biology programs. The only reason that the articles on France and Germany should survive are their sheer importance. And you're overvaluing the concept of Ivy League. You are presuming that "Ivy League is a very different concept from Universities founded in the 1870s". This is not true in case of the business schools. All of them (except Wharton) were founded in the 20th Century. Even the earliest ones are contemporaries of other important schools such as MIT Sloan and NYU Stern. There is nothing historical or operational that distinguishes the Ivy League business schools as a whole from the other good business schools. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 19:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't understand what you mean by "if their importance is in doubt" - so if someone passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but is not that important (say, an MLB player with a short career), and another person of similar importance doesn't have an article, we should delete the first? The business schools are <b>not</b> the same as programmes - and they're not divorced from their parent institutions. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your example is a non-issue. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> explicitly states that "Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league" generally deserve their own article. There is no such standard for a group of programs associated with an athletic conference. Actually, anything associated with such a convoluted category would be a likely subject for AfD. And while I agree that no program is divorced from its parent institutions, it generally is divorced from whatever conference or group the institution is associated with. Do the Ivy League business schools have exchange or collaboration programs that are not found between, say, Harvard Business and MIT Sloan, or Columbia Business and NYU? If the Ivy League business schools do coordinate with one another in exclusion of other comparable business schools, then the group is notable and deserves an entry. If not, the group is simply unnotable. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 21:07, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The whole argument you presented (as far as I understood) relied <b>only</b> upon the presence of another article. It didn't address the merits of this article whatsoever. Notability isn't a criterion for deletion anyways, except where people are too polite to say "This is spam" (i.e. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>) and use it as a euphamism instead. As for co-ordinated action, I don't see the argument - lots of uncoordinated activities that form a pattern are worthy of articles, i.e. <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism_in_Asia_1718.html" title="Imperialism in Asia">Imperialism in Asia</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:15, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you read what I wrote above, you'll see that I did address the merits (or lack thereof) of this article. And I'm sorry, notability IS a criterion for deletion. To quote <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, "Articles are deleted daily on grounds of notability, and this has been common practice for over a year now." As for the analogy with <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism_in_Asia_1718.html" title="Imperialism in Asia">Imperialism in Asia</a> — Well, if those Ivy League business schools did fight one another like the Japanese, Russian, American, and British imperial forces did in Asia, then the group does deserve its own article. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 21:32, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If you read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, you'll discover that's neither a policy or a guideline. Articles are never <i>really</i> deleted on grounds of notability, they're deleted because they're spam or vanity, but we're too polite to say (or don't want the arguments). In areas where spam isn't a problem (science, math, arts, history) notability is never used as a criterion for deletion, because they don't get spammed. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 02:14, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Coment</b> Dude! If your PC is talking to you, I'd suggest it's maybe time for some sleep. Only kidding, that was me, I must not have been signed in. Apologies for the mess, I think I was messing around with my keymap configuration, and forgot to change it back to UK English after I had finished. I can't even recall what it was I meant to type. I don't think that the video should be viewed in comparison with other 911 videos though. It's a bit like comparing 'Robinson Crusoe' with 'Titanic' (or whatever that horrible film from a few years ago is called). Both have their own following, just because one of them gets a lot of airtime on mainstream media, doesn't make the other one any less relevant. --Tess Tickle 13:41, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes i created this article perhaps somewhat in haste, i admit to it perhaps being somewhat original research, but i really do believe that it is *possible* to find "reliable" sources to back it up, i just have not had the opportunity to do so yet. I suppose i wouldnt be totally heart-broken if this article was deleted but i guess my main point was to try to represent a certain philosophical point of view which, as i wrote in the article, combines about two or three other points of view which are themselves represented by other articles within wikipedia, presumably those articles are acceptable to you, so i dont see why this hybrid article wouldnt be since essentially it references internal wikipedia articles. I agree it probably should have other sources as well, and this may be possible to do, and maybe i should just try to write this article into those other articles (i.e. <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_nihilism.html" title="Moral nihilism">moral nihilism</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_mathematics.html" title="Philosophy of mathematics">philosophy of mathematics</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/a/Dualism.html" title="Dualism">dualism</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physicalism.html" title="Physicalism">physicalism</a>. I appreciate your feedback though, and yeah maybe i was too hasty without getting enough other sources first. Lacking Lack 20:21, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I could correct Thorne here, this is listed on Amazon.co.uk - it is a British title. It will no doubt migrate to Amazon.com as they update their database. The wider and more important (in my opinion) issue is that this is an established contemporary Scottish writer (who also has an entry on Wikipedia) and who has written his first English title - significant in Scottish literature terms. I recommend keeping this article - but deleting the reference, perhaps, to the publisher - no need for publisher, but rest of article OK imo. Thanks. Ann Shaw, Glasgow 15/08/06</dd>

<li>There is no need for an individual article on every book that an author has written, especially when the article on the author is as lacking as the one on this one is. Discussion of the bibliography of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus_Peter_Campbell_42f8.html" title="Angus Peter Campbell">Angus Peter Campbell</a> should be in a "Bibliography" section of that article.

<li>As the author of the article on Invisible Islands, and a relatively inexperienced Wikipedia user, I agree with Uncle G. On reflection, perhaps articles on every book concerned is not the most wise thing. Apologies - the book is significant in Scottish literary terms, and indeed I could have expanded on this point (but didn't for fear of being too extravagant). So, to sum up, apologies for causing fuss, and I'll go back to the Wikipedia guide to seek more advice for future articles about individual books. Sorry for causing any hassle to you guys. Points taken, in good spirit. Magg.</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - In addition to addressing the other 4,500 articles on my watchlist, and dealing with this and other AfD's, I have not had the opportunity to improve these articles. I had hoped to do so after the AfD was complete, but I was not around in the 38 minute period (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Finnerty&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Finnerty&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">check article history</a>) before your new AfD was created. I had attempted to contact the author of the article by leaving a message on his talk page, which went unanswered, there was no email address available and the user's last edit was in March 2006. I will as respectfully as possible ask yet one more time for a simple demonstration of good faith by requesting that this AfD be withdrawn to allow sufficient time to address the concerns you have raised and bring it up to your standards. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 21:42, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That is not the article under discussion. I might also add no effort whatsoever was made to expand that article, in spite of the claims of notability 'on Google'. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 23:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, Indeed; if the original nomination of this article was bundled with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Joe_Kelly_%28Freeholder%29_2dcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Kelly (Freeholder)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Kelly (Freeholder)</a> instead of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Atlantic_County_Board_of_Chosen_Freeholders_5bca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders</a>, it is more than likely that the outcome of the previous discussion for this article would have been "keep" instead of "no consensus". In any event, good editors who are part of a WikiProject intend to expand this article and deserve a reasonable period of time to do so. This renom also does not seem consistent with the spirit of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Nominating_an_article_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Nominating an article for deletion</a>, which states: "In general, although there is no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations, articles that have survived a nomination for deletion should not be immediately renominated." <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 13:12, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The 'keep' for Joe Kelly is based on the results of a google search, none of which was brought up in either the AfD or the article in question. I therefore have reason to doubt the verdict of the AfD as entirely valid. The other two were not ruled 'keep', so I take the 'no consensus' as no decision. The articles in question still do not pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The keep arguments are based on the rapid renomination, and not on the merits of the articles. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 16:20, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The subject is a county official, and as I understand it is not even remotely close to that and would appear not to satisfy the criterion above, notwithstanding articles covering those holding similar positions who have survived AfD. There appear to be few other critera for his inclusion as notable.

A <i>county</i> officeholder does not meet the standards for political office, and there has still not been any assertions of notability beyond the local offices or 'significant press coverage' that would rise to the standards set forth in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The standard are Wikipedia's, not mine. It's not as if I nominated the article for speedy deletion. The article has already had more than enough time to be brought up to standards, but it wasn't done. It wasn't done for five months. The purpose of an AfD is to use that time to fix an article, not after. There still has been no claim of notability outside of board membership, which does not meet the standards of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>, Indeed; if the original nomination of this article was bundled with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Joe_Kelly_%28Freeholder%29_2dcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Kelly (Freeholder)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Kelly (Freeholder)</a> instead of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Atlantic_County_Board_of_Chosen_Freeholders_5bca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders</a>, it is more than likely that the outcome of the previous discussion for this article would have been "keep" instead of "no consensus". In any event, good editors who are part of a WikiProject intend to expand this article and deserve a reasonable period of time to do so. This renom also does not seem consistent with the spirit of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Nominating_an_article_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Nominating an article for deletion</a>, which states: "In general, although there is no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations, articles that have survived a nomination for deletion should not be immediately renominated." <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 13:14, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Having an ISBN is not a criteria for notability. One can get an ISBN by asking for one.

<p>Reason the page should be deleted</p>
<p>Vanity article in breach of Wikipedia guidelines.</p>
<p>Subject of the article is a minor (local) politician in Northern Ireland. He is not a member of either the elected Northern Ireland Assembly or the UK Parliament but is rather merely a local councillor and a former failed student politician. Pondersomething 14:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The Wikipedia notability guidelines mention statewide/provincewide politicians, without reference to the fact that these words have different meanings in, for example, Ireland - where a county is the equivalent of a state in importance, although not in population or area. As such, I recommend a keep, as Belfast City Council is as important as, for example, Mayo County Council. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupersheep_75b6.html" title="User:Supersheep">Supersheep</a> 18:53, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Belfast is a city (admittedly an important one) and not a county.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. Although the sum of the parts means he is more than just a city councillor (as assistant to an assemblyman and MEP), I would contend that his day will come.

<p>I am listing this article and its subarticles for deletion again because I believe the consensus on the last discussion should have been "delete". Also, after reading this discussion from last month (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Binaca_Geetmala_1971_efb1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Binaca Geetmala 1971">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Binaca Geetmala 1971</a>), I saw that many other users agreed these articles should be deleted.</p>
<p>Once again, I really don't think local radio station year-end countdowns are notable enough to deserve articles, especially not notable enough to deserve an article for every year from 1980 to 2005. This main article and the 26 sub-articles should all be deleted. KROQ may be a popular radio station in L.A., but that does not mean all of its year end countdowns are notable. These countdowns were copied and pasted from <a href="http://www.rocklists.com/kroq.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rocklists.com/kroq.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> of KROQ's official site. A link to the countdowns can be added to the main <a href="../../../k/r/o/KROQ-FM_06a7.html" title="KROQ-FM">KROQ-FM</a> article. Also, others may use these articles as a reason to create similar articles for their local radio stations. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">musicpvm</a> 17:56, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete subs</b>. Arguably there's encyclopedic value in knowing what was popular in a certain place in a certain year... but having 20+ pages of word-for-word duplication of an external site isn't necessary. Keep the main article and turn the subarticles into <s>external links</s> an external link to <a href="http://www.radiohitlist.com/KROQ/KROQ-main.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.radiohitlist.com/KROQ/KROQ-main.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireplace_0f6a.html" title="User:Fireplace">Fireplace</a> 17:00, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Even though much of the same information can be found elsewhere on the web, I think this is a very valuable and historic resource.

I also like the Wikified links to various artists here. I ask myself, is Wikipedia better or worse for having these articles here? I would say 'better'. For historic value, I say keep these pages.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Borders on listcruft, but given KROQ's importance in American radio it's notable. Like another voter said, it gives a unique insight into the development of modern rock music. If prose could be worked into the lists, that might alleviate some of the issues here. Although I must say this deserves to be here as much as a list of Festive Fifty songs by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Peel_dd69.html" title="John Peel">John Peel</a>, and none of those are listed on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 00:17, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>LAX won a national design award at the American Center for Design in 1994. In addition, Print Magazine awarded it in 1994 a top design award as well thus making the book notable.</p>
<p>tomdobbs.com has been featured in discussions on Entertainment Tonight and is watched by Morgan Creek and Universal Studios to track feedback about the film, Man of the Year.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<p>tomdobbs.com is a grassroots campaign about change in politics and it is supposed to be about the candidate and is an underground, viral method of creating intrigue about a film. The countdown is to the premier. Again, the book is an architecture theory book - these are not printed in large quantities - ever - because the market for these is not huge. Notable architecture books do not have to be bestsellers. I think his book is an excellent example of writing about a period in time where deconstructivist architecture, serious theorists, and unrest in LA came together and looked at a situation. It is still used in schools in architecture today - SCI-Arc for example. The ACD100 award is a prestigious design award in Graphic Design and adds to the idea that the book is notable. As for the guitarist, there are other Mick McConnells, yes. I was just trying to create a listing for a friend and colleague that I have worked with and thought it was time.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsacult_92cc.html" title="User:Itsacult">Itsacult</a> 05:36, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>LAX, the book, is notable because of its award in the American Center for Design's 100 show. Quote from Walker Art Museum, The 100 Show is considered the toughest graphic design competition in the U.S., entered by invitation only. Each year 100 winners are selected in the categories of announcements, brochures, books, annual reports, and programs, and are presented in the 100 Show annual publication.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsacult_92cc.html" title="User:Itsacult">Itsacult</a> 05:55, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The don't delete historical persons comment is not applicable because it was not what I was referring to above.

<dd>I guess the point we are trying to make here is that you have not proven that Mick McConnell has made a significant contribution in his field. 14 unique links on google and a book with no reviews/sales on amazon are not enough to show a significant contribution to the field. <span style="font-family: serif"><i><a href="../../../f/o/p/User%7EFopkins_79f0.html" title="User:Fopkins">Fopkins</a> | <a href="../../../f/o/p/User_talk%7EFopkins_e814.html" title="User talk:Fopkins">Talk</a></i></span> 06:36, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>unfortunately, "Martens" is pretty common, like "Smith", and "Jan" is "John". 53,200 Ghits for "Jan Martens". Narrowed down to 1,290 for "Jan Martens" +Maurice, and half of these are results of geneology searches. The remainder are from private sites, and many are in dutch. I agree the page is probably autobiographical, as it is posted by User:Adriepaint, Adrie being the name of the subject's wife. The bio itself is a cut-and-paste of the bio from <a href="http://www.nederlandse.naievekunst.nl/janned.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nederlandse.naievekunst.nl/janned.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. If not autobiographical, it would be a copyvio. Maurice could be quite notable in his field, but we have no information about where he has exhibited, or which museums have his paintings. I do not find his bio particularly blatant NPOV, but it is unsourced and unverified per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not being interested in commenting on other topics all the time does not warrant the devaluation of a comment, especially one as well researched as this comment. The user account was created before afd flag went up. Also note that every user account has to have a first comment somewhere, perhaps on a subject matter the user feels warrants his/her time. There are now concerns about a vested interest against the Bushtarion article (or Bushtarion itself?) - somebody seems to be seeking any excuse possible to have this article deleted, and is trying to devalue any valid comments from valid users that are otherwise disproving the accused "lack of notability". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/z/z/User%7EAzzer007_e76b.html" title="User:Azzer007">Azzer007</a> (<a href="../../../a/z/z/User_talk%7EAzzer007_c850.html" title="User talk:Azzer007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Azzer007_8e3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Azzer007">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><small><b>Comment</b>: Of course I am involved in it - how do you think I can pull up so many facts/sources on notability and advertising? Perhaps you can tell me what makes a game notable, if not tens thousands of users through the ages, a 5 year history, news articles on the game being published on multiple gaming websites (I am happy to source these for you if you are skepitcal), extremely high ranks for major search phrases as "free multiplayer game" (in fact equalling Wiki's own search ranking for the same search phrase for Wiki's <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a> page) which are not really/realistically possible to be engineered (recommended reading: <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/technology/" rel="nofollow">Google Technology</a>). Why are you so desperate for this notable game to have it's Wiki entry deleted? Are you a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionist" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionist" rel="nofollow">deletionist</a>? Do you wish to ignore these facts? Are you upset that I am disputing your afd flag? Are you taking it as a personal attack on yourself/your beliefs of what is notable, and so seeking any means necessary to mark for deletion and ignoring any facts? Please take the time to actually dispute the sources of information provided as to why it <i>is</i> notable, so your points of it <i>not</i> being notable can be considered as fact and not being presumptuous or otherwise. I think the ullness is now on you, now that notability has, in my opinion, been established. I note also you have marked a number of other games up for deletion, and have found a few comments against your "deletionist" attitude with a quick Google search - I wonder, purely as a point of interest, do you play any browser based games yourself? --<a href="../../../a/z/z/User%7EAzzer007_e76b.html" title="User:Azzer007">Azzer007</a> 19:02, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><small><b>Comment</b>: In the modern web world, I think Google can be seen as "covering" a subject by relating its search ranks with related phrases. I won't give further information than has already been given on this coverage, from a source that is one of the most well known and advanced in the web world right now.

<li><small><b>Comment</b> Does every single encyclopaedic entry on the entire of Wikipedia require a newspaper or magazine printed article to allow the article to stay? I ask out of curiousity. Secondly, is ignoring online gaming websites articles about an online game that exists purely in the online world not being horse-blinkered, ignorant, and outdated (especially given we are having this discussion on an online web-based encyclopedia)? I have provided all the relevant sources you could ask for that relate to an online only browser based game, why do you choose to ignore these as sources? How common or likely is a printed article going to be for an online browser-based game? I'm not saying none would exist for any game, I'm actually saying that demanding printed articles and printed articles only is incredibly... silly? --<a href="../../../a/z/z/User%7EAzzer007_e76b.html" title="User:Azzer007">Azzer007</a> 20:56, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small><b>Comment</b> You ask for information, I provide it, you try to ignore/dismiss it (unless you personally have heard of it?). Their Alexa rankings alone prove all three to be immensely used websites (you yourself have cited low Alexa rankings - in the 2,000,000+ range - as reasons to delete Wiki entries citing notability, so don't now try and dismiss high alexa rankings) - I have a feeling we can go in roundabouts about this forever, with you dismissing all valid sources simply because you don't like the source/you want to stick to your deletion flag. MPOGD, OMGN, and World Online Games to name a few are huge online game sites (as seen by their Alexa ranks) in the field of "Web Based Games" (as well as other online games). They are the most relevant sources you can find (sites such as Gamespot, and gaming magazines like PCZone, focus on "store-bought" graphical games, not web games - so they are not valid sources).--<a href="../../../a/z/z/User%7EAzzer007_e76b.html" title="User:Azzer007">Azzer007</a> 22:41, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small><b>Comment</b> I know what their Alexa rankings are - if you look up, you'll see I've actually already posted them. I also know that the lower the rankings the better - hence my point about you using Alexa as a reason for <i>lack</i> of notability on a site with more than 2,0000,000 Alexa ranking, and me listing 3 gaming directory websites around the 40-50k mark. I have made a lot of effort here tonight - perhaps you would like to try and add weight to your side and make a little effort now; what online web game directory websites do you think are notable? List three news sites/directory sites that feature/specialise in online web games (this article subject's field), so that everybody knows in future what would, in your eyes, make a web based game "Notable" for me (with their Alexa rankings if you wish, though I can check that myself).--<a href="../../../a/z/z/User%7EAzzer007_e76b.html" title="User:Azzer007">Azzer007</a> 23:27, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - First of all, please do <i>not</i> accuse other editors of being ignorant. It is not going to help your case in the slightest. I have read the article, its history, researched it on google, and looked at your edit history; I don't think I'm ignorant. Second of all, my arguments have been stated before, but I will reiterate them. 26,000 hits is not sufficient in my opinion, especially for something that is computer based. 6,000 pages link to Bushtarion's page - I'd guess at least 5,000 of them are blogs. I will look at this when I finish my comment. If you could direct us to where exactly the awards are located and what other games have won the awards, it would be a tremendous help. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 20:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Ultima Online doesn't have the afd flag that I can see. Ferion's doesn't seem to have the "discuss/vote/talk" page, though I don't really know how that works so perhaps that is intentional. Regardless - Hattrick, Runescape, and Asheron's Call are not currently contested (and I see no reason why they should be - they are major games) - and the fact is those games are all incredibly major/notable games that almost anyone who has been online/involved in online games in the past 5 years will have heard of, with the exception of perhaps Lunatix to an extent (and whether or not Peephole wants to flag their articles for deletion or not). You asked me to provide a link to awards, and list other notable games that had won it. I provided you with that information. Do you dispute the link, or do you think none of the other games I listed that had won the award are at all notable in the online games world? I'm sorry, but I feel like every time I provide information, it is being ignored or other "rules" are being applied to try and get around any of my comments, like it's a personal vendetta against online games having a Wiki entry (see above comments for immediate example - Peephole asks for reliable sources of press releases, I provide it, then he comments that he wants printed press releases in newspapers/magazines... etc.) - I really hope this isn't the case, as I always see Wiki as the place for encyclopaedic information on almost any subject you could wish for, I never knew there were editors that went around deleting things like this (I could understand if they were articles about my neighbours dog, sure! But major online games!?). I can see absolutely no reason why anyone could seem so adamant, perhaps even desperate, to delete entirely valid and acceptable entries (as I say - they are hardly about my neighbours dog, they aren't vanity articles, they aren't adverts, there is lots of relevant information and sources online for them, etc.!).

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe the onus is now on you, Peephole, as information and sources have been provided multiple times on request, and dismissed with no effort on your part. You cannot simply dismiss a source, give a reference to a long winded and fairly vague reference that is a catch-all for any form of "reliable source" in the entire media (and even not-so-media) world, and then cover your ears singing la-la-la. You flagged it for deletion, you are trying to dismiss appropriate sources as being not-notable, and so you are now asked to link to <i>appropriate</i> and <i>relevant</i> sources that you think would be, in your personal opinion (as this is, afterall, now all down to personal <i>opinion</i> by the looks of it, rather than any form of fact), notable - given that this is on the subject of online web games (not console games, not store-bought/shelf/video games, or in other words "software", as you cited in your original deletion nomination, and not general world news/world media - as none of those are appropriate or relevant for the fields of online web-games). Once you do this, assuming none of the sites you provide have made mention of Bushtarion before and assuming they are indeed relevant and appropriate, I will seek to gain future notability with them (though this also assumes your dismissal of every other source, fact, and notability is in fact warranted official and fair, and that somebody else wouldn't in future mark the article for deletion again and dismiss those sources you provide as <i>they</i> haven't heard of them or don't believe them to be notable... and round and round we go).--<a href="../../../a/z/z/User%7EAzzer007_e76b.html" title="User:Azzer007">Azzer007</a> 16:40, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../a/z/z/User%7EAzzer007_e76b.html" title="User:Azzer007">Azzer007</a> does ask you to name three <b>web browser gaming sites</b> which have an Alexa rating considerably greater than those previously mentionned - i.e. sites with Alexa traffic rankings at least better than 20,000. He wants you to put them on this page, along with the traffic rankings so he can check the credability. Basically, he wants you to find web browser gaming directory sites (which focus on games such as Bushtarion and not ones which involve high intensity graphics) which you deem notable. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheTallOne_68d2.html" title="User:TheTallOne">TheTall</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheTallOne_b4a3.html" title="User talk:TheTallOne"><font color="red">One</font></a> 16:31, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Because I've danced to your tune above and beyond the call of duty enough now in this discussion, while you simply sit there saying "Nah, not notable" "Nah, I don't like it" to anything you can (whilst ignoring any comments &amp; sources you cannot dismiss off-hand) and linking to very vague and non-directed Wiki articles. While I'm sure you're enjoying it, there's only so much dancing another person will do when you whistle. As I stated in my above comment, the onus is most definitely on you now to disprove the notability points provided, and provide evidence that there is, in fact, far more notable appropriate and relevant sites that have not covered Bushtarion at all. I cannot find any myself, but obviously if you've dismissed the ones I have provided as not being notable, then clearly the reason for doing so must be because you know of much more notable ones. So, what are they?--<a href="../../../a/z/z/User%7EAzzer007_e76b.html" title="User:Azzer007">Azzer007</a> 16:51, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I was under the impression that the article I provided was going to settle this debate.

<li>All right. First off, it's got quite a few unbacked claims (<i>"Computrols has established a solid reputation over the past 20 plus years as a leader in building automation systems"</i>), and describes customers as "<i>benefiting from the power, simplicity, and reliability of Computrols</i>," which violates Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> policy. The article needs some good reliable sources. Also, it needs to include some reason why we should care about this company (that is, why it is notable) and rather than just say "It's a notable company", it needs to prove it and show why exactly this company is important enough to warrant an encyclopedia article. The article as it appears currently reads like an advertisement written by someone at the company. —<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott5114_5c93.html" title="User:Scott5114">Scott5114</a><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScott5114_67da.html" title="User talk:Scott5114">↗</a> 03:51, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. There are so many playboy playmates out there that sublists are useful in navigating them. This one does have an objective stadard -- D cup.

<li>Nowhere in the list is it explicitly stated that a model must have breasts of a certain size to be included.

<li>Ummm...see the third sentence. "These models generally have a D-cup or larger chest". Read in context, this refers to the models on this list, not playboy models in general (which would be absurd because many, many (most, in fact) playboy models have less than a D-cup. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 19:04, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Two points: First, the phrasing is ambiguous from context. Second, that "generally" in the graf means that anybody who wants to add a woman with smaller breasts to the list can do so, as long as he or she personally thinks they're big enough to qualify as "big". Hence, the POV thing. You could try making List of Playboy Playmates with cup size greater than C, or changing the inclusion criteria on this list to a verifiable, hard-and-fast wording and purging everyone who doesn't meet it. Otherwise, I have to stick to my opinion. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 20:59, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe I have met your requests. I have inserted a non ambiguous D-cup standard for inclusion. i have also removed the name of every model whose individual article does not assert breast size. if you read playboy you know that not all profiles include cup size in their measurements (some just provide the number), which explains why some have this and some don't. Although I'm sure some unsubstantiated cup size assertions exist on these articles, this seems like the kind of issue that comes down to content issues in individual articles and doesn't seem like a basis for deleting this entire list. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 02:36, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is already a <i>Pornstar</i> category sporting enough porncruft. Essentially non-neutral? Wow, from when have started considering a statement on a measurable size "non-neutral"?

<dd>I strongly advise that you check a few of the other lists, before deciding "unencyclopedic".

<dd>My point is, there's no use for this. It would be far better if you had a list of models (maybe broken up into seperate list articles if necessary) and listed their sizes there - since Playboy apparently prints their bust size, issues can be used as a reference. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a> 10:43, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They don't print the cup size with every issue. They print the chest measurement, e.g. 36-24-36. Some also note the cup size but not all. Also, I read a year or so ago, probably in <i>Playboy</i> that the average bra size for U.S. women is a 36C, so D would be the beginning of "Big" since it's the next size past average. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:28, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b>Two solutions - "unsubstantiated" bust sizes should be removed from the list, and, if necessary, the bottomline may be upgraded to DD or more.

<p>Seeing as the prod was removed with no reasoning behind it, I'm listing this article for deletion. The only notability that this <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pants-Off_Dance-Off_ae25.html" title="Pants-Off Dance-Off">Pants-Off Dance-Off</a> contestant has is that he was used in a New York Times and CNN article about the series itself. The show is not as wide spread as American Idol (the author used "Why is <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hung_60a2.html" title="William Hung">William Hung</a> on Wikipedia?" as an excuse for this person's inclusion) or even <a href="../../../s/o/_/So_You_Think_You_Can_Dance__8c68.html" title="So You Think You Can Dance?">So You Think You Can Dance?</a>. I believe this article should be <b>deleted</b> because of the esotericness of the show, its audience, and its contestants (the nightly grand prize is US$200, not a recording contract or anything larger). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 20:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Unfortunately, New York Times and CNN has written about him, fairly extensively actually, as the primary subject in their articles, and it's not just a passing mention, so he gets by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I'm not sure "esotericness" = "nonnotability" (just as "famous"&#160;!= "notability"). See the essay <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle_G/On_notability</a>, specifically the section Notability is not fame nor importance. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 01:32, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.My personal impression is that shows are run by the presence of its contestants &amp; just not by the name itself and the guy i mentioned won the show 3 times"...I would like to see,why we only be interested in mentioning the name of the show &amp; not the contestant who has won it??Notability does not only constitute the show's name itself but also the winning contestants who participated in the shows.I agree with the contributor above,Notability is above &amp; beyond the fame ,importance or notriety of an individual....If New York times or CNN claim the show to be "the dumbest on the cable",then again it is adding to the Notability of the show/participants...Besides both these articles mention more about this contestant rather then the show itself.

I have decided to call one of the members of the United-SF here in Minnesota to contact him about the party. he told me they were still working but were not as active.

<li><b>Clarify</b> From what I can tell the United Somali Front is a completely different organisation from the United-SF. The former is an armed group based in Somaliland (which probably does deserve an article), the latter an unarmed group with nothing but a website which doesn't even name the leader!

<li>Hello. I am new to the Wikipedia world, but I was anxious to get started with the McCain-Lieberman Party concept. It is a term used now by many political junkies and political scientists, but in a casual way. I know from conversation and blogging that it is frequently discussed. The exact nature or definition of the subject is often vague to people who are not regular political junkies, that's why I think it's important to not delete this article. I know from the Sitemeter records on my old blog that after Lieberman lost and Brooks wrote this column, many people googled the phrase. However, they were met with countless blog entries that are vague and not neutral.
<p>This isn't a phrase that is simply secluded to David Brooks. After he used it multiple times on television and in speeches, it became part of the political science colloquial conversation. For instance, I had the good fortune of having lunch with Mr. Brooks, Clarence Paige, and a few political scientists at the University of Illinois and during that conversation the phrase was used multiple times.</p>
<p>The article is not meant as a prediction or a "crystal ball." Rather it is simply to define a term that is becoming more frequently used. Simply google it as proof.</p>
<p>This topic would be a very important contribution to Wiki. Please reconsider your nomination for deletion.--<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnemanbandbjm_d1d6.html" title="User:Onemanbandbjm">Onemanbandbjm</a> 22:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as neologism. Comment to Onemandband: Unfortunately, this term is very new - only <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> (that is, not used exclusively in blogs) five days old to my knowledge and research. That makes it a neologism, something that Wikipedia does <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> allow. If the phrase stays around for a while, however, it may become notable and deserve its own article. However, there's no way to tell right now whether this term will even live out the month. The important question to ask is: Will this be remembered in 25, 50, or 100 years? If this phrase is only around for a few months, it certainly won't be remembered, and thus does not merit an article in the encyclopedia. Thank you for your enthusiasm, though, and feel free to leave a message on my talk page if you ever need any assistance. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 22:10, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>-Onemanbandbjm, why don't you keep the article as a draft connected to your userpage.

<p>As I explained in the main article, Brooks finally solidified the term with his column. Perhaps we could make it a current event topic and then you can determine whether it is getting enough hits and reader time to warrant becoming a permanent article. Or some kind of disclaimer would also be acceptable. This is a concept which will become increasingly prevalent as Lieberman runs as an independent and with the chance of McCain losing the presidential primary. I don't think there can be any harm in Wikipedia defining a term that is new, in fact, that is part of its duty. Wikipedia is meant to be flexible and malleable. It is supposed to be better than the other Encyclopedias in that it is on the cutting edge of human knowledge. Neologisms are part of its value. When something is published in the New York Times, the world's largest newspaper, it isn't exactly obscure. It clearly doesn't just define the term, it explains its history and provides outside research from Pew as to its validity.--<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnemanbandbjm_d1d6.html" title="User:Onemanbandbjm">Onemanbandbjm</a> 22:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This is clearly <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Brooks was criticizing the concept as a workable political party - he wasn't "solidifying the term". The Note and the <i>Hartford Courant</i> articles are reporting on the Brooks AYou're jumping the gun here - as others have pointed out, Wikipedia is not a rumor site. An article such as this could lead some people to believe that such a party does in fact exist, when it clearly does not. Please consider the suggestion to keep it as a draft in your own user space, at least for now. <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 23:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> per above. The idea of keeping it as a draft on the user page until later has merit. <a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.sweeton%40wnri.com_fe56.html" title="User:J.sweeton@wnri.com">Jerry G. Sweeton Jr.</a> 23:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Defense</b> People will only think it's a real party if they don't read the first line which specifically uses the word FICTIONAL. It's true that Brooks is critical of the possibility toward the end of his article, and that can certainly be mentioned in the article. But he is hoping for the possibility. If it turns out that the concept dies as a means to describing America's political middle then we can delete the article. But why do it when thousands of people are looking for information on the Internet about this subject? If my article sounds like a rumor or a prediction then that can be changed, I did not intend for it to be that. It is more of a political junky's way of succinctly referring to America's political middle and of identifying its current leaders.
<p>I'm confused here, is Wikipedia running out of server space? I mean, how many neologisms and often irrelevant articles exist on Wikipedia? How many that will only be relevant for a year or less. Perhaps a few million? One way to solidify this concept is precisely by putting it in Wikipedia, it has become that influential in our society.</p>
<p>As examples, Baseball Baby provides many through articles he has written, "Armstrong Gun, FACEP, ACEP, J-pouch, W-pouch, Jesse L. Reno, Mount Vernon Arsenal, Ovingdean, Brian Britt, Pi Alpha Alpha, San Solomon Springs, National Association for Ambulatory Urgent Care, Stork enamine alkylation, Cixiidae, Joe Zewe, Odontogriphus, Order of Daedalians, South Side-Baker Historic District"</p>
<p>Or from Srose, "Gustav Suits, Juhan Liiv, Madis Kõiv, Mart Saar, Mats Traat, Nikolai Baturin, Peeter Sauter, Ene Mihkelson, Elo Viiding, George R. Austin Intermediate School, Wildlife biologists, Isla Iguana Wildlife Refuge, Saddleback clownfish, Juno Februata, Abtu, Fastachee, Ahayuta, Ene Ergma - only possible with the help of Avjoska!&#160;:) --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnemanbandbjm_d1d6.html" title="User:Onemanbandbjm">Onemanbandbjm</a> 23:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>One way to solidify this concept is precisely by putting it in Wikipedia, it has become that influential in our society.</i> — Being a platform for the promotion of novel concepts is precisely what Wikipedia is <i>not</i> for. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>.

<li><b>Defense</b> To clarify: This is not proposed as a reality. This is not proposed as a prediction. This is a methaphorical concept used to succinctly describe America's moderate middle. And it more specifically refers to a particular iteration of that middle, namely, the McCain-Lieberman version of it. On the official Wikipedia page, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> nowhere does it say that such a metaphorical concept cannot be published, thus that objection does not stand and that is the only objection that matters since that is the intent of the article. If the editors feel that I misled readers by making predictions or creating reality then I will be happy to edit the original article. Until then I would appreciate an official citation in published Wikipedia rules as to what precisely this type of article violates. This fictional concept is more notable than probably 50% of all fictional concept articles on Wikipedia, so that argument also does not stand. Please show me a precise citation as to what is being objected to. I feel that the original editor made a comment and his posterity have simply fallen in line with his comments: <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupthink.html" title="Groupthink">Groupthink</a>. --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnemanbandbjm_d1d6.html" title="User:Onemanbandbjm">Onemanbandbjm</a> 01:33, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>"This is a methaphorical concept used to succinctly describe America's moderate middle."</i> However it's not a well-known or widespread concept.

<li><b>Defense</b> After Brooks and other have been discussing the idea for over a year it means that my article is no longer a publishing of original thought. I'm not inventing anything here. I'm reporting on the facts of the situation, describing the concept, and providing broader analysis(the Pew data). I'm not using this as a soapbox, if I were the text would read, "Centrism is ostensibly the best political philosophy that anyone can hold."

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Defense</b> First, that accusation is a complete exaggeration. Second, please again show me where that is listed on Wiki's official page defining what is acceptable and what is not? I will not relent until someone proves to me that this concept goes beyond the bounds of what is accepted practice.

<li><b>Alternative</b>: Even though I'm the one who created this AfD, I just had an even better idea: rename the article "computer and video fighting games in need of articles", add it to the fighting games category, and remove all the blue links. That way it is no longer redundant with the category, and also links to items without articles, which is the one major thing that lists do that categories do not. I also propose that this be the preferred treatment for all lists that are redundant with categories. <a href="../../../l/u/v/User%7ELuvcraft_7624.html" title="User:Luvcraft">Luvcraft</a> 00:42, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>No. Segregating redlinks and bluelinks to separate daughter pages would remove <i>context</i> from both lists. The two pages would want to link to each other, in violation of the ban on links to Wikipedia: from article space. (And, ironically, the Wikipedia: daughter would be impossible to <i>categorize</i> along with its sister.) The process for adding either new articles or new links would become more labor-intensive and prone to error -- and less transparent in its history. And, need I repeat myself-- there is no redundancy to be fixed, and redlinks are hardly the best reason to keep lists. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 19:38, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; lists and categories are not redundant. This simple list already does two things the category cannot: it lists "prominent examples", and it presents both the English and Japanese titles where applicable. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 01:35, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The alternate titles are listed in each game's article, and redirects take care of any attempts to search for the article under its alternate name. As for the "prominent examples", there are plenty of games in the list that aren't prominent at all, like <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bio_F.R.E.A.K.S._72bb.html" title="Bio F.R.E.A.K.S.">Bio F.R.E.A.K.S.</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter%27s_Destiny_0ba2.html" title="Fighter's Destiny">Fighter's Destiny</a>, so it would require a lot of cuts before it could stand as a "list of prominent fighting games" article, which is not its intended purpose in the first place. <a href="../../../l/u/v/User%7ELuvcraft_7624.html" title="User:Luvcraft">Luvcraft</a> 02:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We do not delete things just because they have yet to live up to their potential. If the list needs fixing, then fix it. I mention alternate titles because nowhere else on Wikipedia will you find all this information on one page. Certainly not in a category. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 19:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But <i>what is its potential?</i> All we have is an alphabetical list of articles, which is exactly what a category is designed to give you. If someone wants to turn this into more than that, go ahead, but otherwise it's redundant and should be deleted. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 06:36, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed. This article could turn into a good "list of notable fighting games and series" by removing the non-notable ones and providing synopses for the rest. <a href="../../../l/u/v/User%7ELuvcraft_7624.html" title="User:Luvcraft">Luvcraft</a> 19:59, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Melchoir. Key being, this list is not <i>necessarily</i> redundant - including information like year and developer would make this much more useful, not to mention that a list can contain both red links and non-link games - games that are in the genre, but won't have articles, and/or games that are already in a series article but have no individual article. For instance, all the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilty_Gear_c1d1.html" title="Guilty Gear">Guilty Gear</a> games, but there are also plenty of fighters that don't have or don't need pages that would still warrant a mention here. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 18:11, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> I think what Andrew is trying to get across to you, correct me if I'm wrong Andrew, is that he has done things. You might consider them minor, but they are things minor or not minor to YOU. Andrew feels this ISN'T minor. I don't think being in a movie is a minor thing either. Besides, he probably will be in more movies if he has been in this one so we should just keep it up instead of having to recreate these things. They're Hogan's kids. Of course their going to be in the spotlight. Not Linda's old self of course. She's fully cooked. In fact, Linda's burnt and stale.
