<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Although it's largely just a resort, it <i>does</i> have its own runway, and there aren't many holiday resorts (or similar) that have that. It gets lots of Googles (9700ish) too.

<ul>
<li>It's fewer than that. I'm sure that this isn't the only "Lake Lawn Resort". If you make it "'Lake Lawn Resort' Delavan", you get like 6k, and lots are duplicated yellow page listings. Are all resorts, notable? <a href="../../../m/m/m/User%7EMmmbeer_c9c3.html" title="User:Mmmbeer">Mmmbeer</a> 01:34, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, most certainly not all resorts are notable. Perhaps this is my UK perspective: if a resort here had its own airstrip, it would be quite something. The Google hits are, as you say, quite a lot of advertising. But quite a few of them also appeared to be mentions that Company X had had their Event Y there. Though any resort can manage that. Ho hum...I'm struggling a bit with this one. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:26, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's a resort with an airport (i'm still not sure if that makes it notable). However, this is all the article says.

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. Resorts are generally notable as places with communities of interest and this particular one was founded in 1879. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 02:02, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>, unless significantly improved. The article is currently little more than an advert and a platform for an external link.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable destination for people in the upper Midwest. By the way, if you search just "Lake Lawn" and "Delavan" you pick up a couple thousand more hits than with the word "Resort" added, since a lot of people refer to it as "Lake Lawn Lodge". <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 19:31, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The current version seems factual.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The question is not whether it's factual, but whether it's notable. What's so special about this place that sets it apart from other resorts? Does it have a long and distinguished history? Have famous people gone there? Have there been notable events that happened there? Anything? So far, the most interesting thing the article tells you is how long it takes to drive there from Chicago. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 00:07, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Indeed, but I <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Arguments_against_deleting_articles_for_non-notability" title="Wikipedia:Notability">disagree that non-notability is a valid criterion for deletion</a>, except to the extent where it precludes verifiability. People's appeal to non-notability as a reason for deletion makes it appear as though it is a non-controversial part of official WP policy. As it stands, I see no reason why people who are looking for information on Lake Lawn Resort should be met with a blank page. <a href="../../../a/r/j/User%7EArj_a0cf.html" title="User:Arj">arj</a> 01:07, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem lies that a conspiracy theory is by definition original research I quote from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>: "<i>Colloquially, a conspiracy theory is any non-mainstream theory about current or historical events, with the connotation that that theory is unfounded, outlandish, or irrational or in some way unworthy of serious consideration.</i>" and that your project states that you "<i>Feel that evidence for that belief needs to be represented in Wikipedia</i>". This is evident as you note that the 9/11 Commission Report is "<i>Full of blatant lies, whitewash. The most accepted coincidence theory, same as the Warren Commission.</i>" on Wikipedia:WikiProject Conspiracy: The World Conspiracy Guild (among others on that page). This therefore presents some conflicts with the rules of Wikipedia and we should not promote adding conspiracy theories into Wikipedia. If you feel that this project is important, I suggest you reword it so it is not as controversial. And just because the tag says article doesn't mean it can't be applied to other pages, the VfD is here to get a community consensus about certain pages in Wikipedia. And adding original research is in contrary to current policy. And you can go VfD Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam:SIIEG as you have the right to so long as you provide a valid explination on the VfD page on why the project is innapropriate. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">T</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">C</a> 02:47, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete or improve..</b> - I think the concerns that the Wikiproject pages are encouraging original research are valid. However, there are notable conspiracy theories, also, which have and should have articles. I see nothing wrong with a project for improving articles on the subjects, so long as it is not soliciting original research or original/non-well-known conspiracy theories. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 01:30, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> Bro, of course articles need to be NPOV and sourced, but a project? A project is like a talk page, it does not need to be NPOV at all, its like a private room where we disscus strategies. if we cant talk open, how are we suppposed to develop our ideas and know what to add to the articles and what to not add, and what to improve and source better? Do whe need to be "politicaly correct" even in a project that is not included in the ecyclopedia? Anyway, if you insist, then help me to NPOV it. Whadever it takes to be able to have a common ground where we can assemble, even if it means we must keep mainstreamers happy even in our projekt. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:41, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think the only compromise most people are willing to make is if you <b>clearly</b> define this project as limited to working on pages labeled conspiracy theories. I have no problem with a conspiracy project dedicated to working on <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_assassination_theories.html" title="Kennedy assassination theories">Kennedy assassination theories</a> or Nick Berg conspiracy theories but you clearly set your scope beyond that. Therein lies the major problem as I said above, we do not want original research on <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> for example. Again, if you re-evaluated your scope, I think most users would not have a problem. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">T</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">C</a> 23:57, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not every use of cluster analysis adds a permanent concept to our vocabulary. This is a confusing neologism which gets zero hits at scholar.google.com and all hits at google.com are Wikipedia mirrors. It's confusing because there is a moderately more accepted, and different, usage of the term <i>supercluster</i> in genetics, see <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercluster_%28genetic%29.html" title="Supercluster (genetic)">Supercluster (genetic)</a>. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 03:01, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've found an early (though rare, inconsistent, and probably a neologism at the time) usage of <i>supercluster</i> in this sense (of groups of human populations) by the pioneering researcher in the field (<a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalli-Sforza_26a3.html" title="Cavalli-Sforza">Cavalli-Sforza</a>), and have edited <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercluster_%28genetic%29.html" title="Supercluster (genetic)">Supercluster (genetic)</a> to reflect this.

<p>Non-notable &amp; potentially POV redirect</p>
<p>This name is a non-notable individual who died in Florida in 2001. The name is redirected to her employer at the time, then Rep. <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Scarborough_6f36.html" title="Joe Scarborough">Joe Scarborough</a>. Redirect appears to be for the purpose of routing attention about Klausutis' death to Scarborough, possibly for political or POV reasons. It also appears to be intended to augment a controversial sentence about Klausutis in the Scarborough article that is heavily opposed by many editors on the talk page there, and is currently the subject of RfC's and revert warring.

<li><b>Delete</b> Given that: the name of this project is mildly offensive and in bad faith (SIIEG pronounced "siege"! Who are we at siege against?); that it's goals should be the goals of all Wikipedians; that some of it's own membership seem to have been breached it's own mission statement and policies without similarly being admonished by the SIIEG membership; that it seems to single out a particular group of editors (e.g. liberal Muslims) for criticism in bad faith, based purely on their private religious and political beliefs; and that otherwise we already have Wikipedia Project: Islam for precisely this reason. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> (<a href="../../../a/x/o/User_talk%7EAxon_2304.html" title="User talk:Axon">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Axon_75d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axon">contribs</a>) 15:40, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In my short time here, I've been following the various debates on Islam-related articles, and I think I have a fairly neutral view of the situation. As far as I can tell both sides of this "debate" have bad-egg editors violating a number of Wikipedia policies, and both sides have reasonable and fair (if principled) editors. I think to sort this whole thing out the members of the latter group need to seek each other out across the aisle and make a real effort to reach some kind of consensus with each other. Otherwise it'll be more of the same edit-warring, personal attacks, etc. I could see SIIEG as being a means to either end.

The number of hits for his name only increase if other combinations were searched for, e.g. "Lewis, Peter" quantum, or "Peter J. Lewis" quantum, etc. Not that I put a lot of stock into google searches when it comes to rating academics studying the intricacies of an incredibly complex and mathematical discipline. Peter Lewis is an active player in group of living philosophers attempting to achieve some understanding in regards to quantum mechanics. He is well published in highly respected philosophic journals. And while you might not find him notable enough for the Wikipedia encyclopedia, he does appear in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry on "The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics". I submit to Wikipedia that any philosopher who is notable enough to have their arguments/philosophy appear in such a prominent encyclopedia as the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, is notable enough to have an entry on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/t/f/User%7EAtfyfe_75c5.html" title="User:Atfyfe">atfyfe</a> 19:50, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b>, but with commentary. I feel that a good list article <i>could be</i> written about famous people who have been thought to/alleged to/purported to have ADD/ADHD; it would need to exercise at least <i>some</i> selectivity, so that we don't include every single person ever nominated by any source, but with that as a ground rule, I believe that a good list article could exist, contrary to what other votes have said. We don't have to verify that the person <i>had</i> ADD/ADHD, we just have to verify that there is a prominent body of opinion that the person had it.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I think a list of DVDs with descriptive audio for the visually impaired is a valuable reference-- and there aren't that many of them (of the hundreds of DVDs in my collection, only three have this feature), so the list isn't likely to become overly unwieldly. But we need people to actually update this thing to make it viable rather than relying on others to do the work, so my proposal is to give it a <b>conditional keep</b> and revisit this in a few months if no one has expanded the lists noticably within that time. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:41, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conditional keep</b>: I am the originator of this page. Indeed it seems almost nobody has touched it since I posted it (or the regional variants). This is pretty strong evidence that people interested in DVDs accessible to the blind just aren't interested enough to maintain a list, which should be surprising but isn't. Nonetheless, unless somebody can show me a Wikipedia policy page that states that Lists must always be kept up to date (within what timeframe?), I see no reason to delete the pages. They were true and accurate as of their origination date. However,
<ul>
<li>I do firmly disagree that the page is "unencyclopedic," a sort of catchall criticism; Wikipedia has innovated in the domain of encyclopedias by <em>encouraging</em> lists, something I support. The list <em>was</em> encyclopedic when it was created!</li>
<li>As for "unmaintainable," clearly the page <em>is</em> maintain<em>able</em>; it's just that nobody wants to bother.</li>
<li>"Unnecessary" is clearly false.</li>
<li>I certainly don't understand how this list might be deemed "original research" (an unusual pejorative) when a list of, say, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lesbian%2C_gay%2C_bisexual_or_transgender-related_films.html" title="List of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender-related films">all the gay films in the world</a> isn't (to use an example of an actively-maintained list).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So let's leave it for a while and see if conditions improve. This is the sort of thing that a few E-mails (especially to blind mailing lists) could remedy.

Yes, I checked the help files and still didn't find it.) <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeclark_deb3.html" title="User:Joeclark">Joe Clark</a></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not really a 'strategy' at all, as the decision to build two 'dozers' rather than three does not have nearly the same effect in C&amp;C Generals as the article makes out.

<li><b>Keep</b> Earlier today, I did a major reorganisation of this page to make it more encylcopaedic and factually accurate. Firstly, the two v three dozer thing is of massive importance - have you ever played the game online? It is one of the first decisions the player makes, ans is thus key to his/her future success. It clearly is a strategy by any reasonable definition of the word.

<li>hahaha, that's funny. Anyway, I'm for definitely keeping this article. The term wikibully may be new to wikipedia, but bullying behavior is by no means foreign or new to wikipedia and I can assure you that I have been bullied and I have seen other users being bullied who were too weak to stand up for themselves or simply didn't have time to fight back and some of them seem to have quit wikipedia because wikipedia seems to have no way to easily spot and remedy bullies and bullies' standard harsh methodology of forcing their views down everyone else's throats. All bullies basically have the same negative attitude and it's time we did something forceful about it, that is specific to bullying behavior. If a similar policy was enacted at Columbine, I'm sure the Columbine massacres would never have taken place at all, because the bullying behavior at its root would've been nipped in the bud.</li>

<p>Those users who are voting to delete imho, are either not active contributors or if they are, then they haven't tackled some of the really controversial pages on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a>, where people literally become vicious with their attacks and the discussion can hardly be called civil at all.</p>
<p>The same minority of wikipedians, displaying bullying tendencies, are seen spreading their message of hate, with most normal users too busy with their lives to go after them using the lengthy wikipedia processes. There should be simple and straight forward way to deal with bullies on wikipedia.</p>
<p>Take a look at this scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>A bully harasses another wikipedian for something, like inserting comments that he, the bully, dislikes or does not share.</li>
<li>The user warns him, that he should change his hostile attitude and stop his threats, and the user reminds the bully, that through the bully's edit history, the bully is digging his own grave by continuing to bully the user.</li>
<li>If the bully does not stop, his name is submitted somewhere along with a list of his bullying edits gleaned from his edit history.</li>
<li>The bully is then officially warned by an admin to stop his bullying and shown the bully's list of bullying edits as proof which is undeniable.</li>
<li>It would be a completely insane bully who still does not get the message and still does not stop from bullying. Most bullies would stop bullying at this stage.</li>
<li>The bully would learn the lesson that <i><b>bullying does have negative consequences</b></i> and also that <i><b>no one likes a bully.</b></i></li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, I say <b>keep it</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Bulldozer_6c7d.html" title="User:The Bulldozer">The Bulldozer</a> 19:39, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thank you to those people who are supporting to keep the wikibully and especially for taking the time to express their views on it, much better than I did. If there are no objections, is it alright if I move the wikibully page to Wikipedia:Wikibully (as suggested above by a couple of people)?

<li>Personally, I disagree with doing so. For one thing, no moves should be done EVER during a VfD; it messes up link structure on VfD pages. If the consensus is to move to Wikipedia:Wikibully, then an admin will do so. Otherwise, let the VfD run its course. In any event, if it were to be removed, much of it would have to be rewritten as a "How not to be a Wikibully", "How to deal with Wikibullies", etc. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 20:48, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't exactly recall saying I don't believe in God, at least not here, but I will admit I do not believe in superstition, including religion, nor tribalism, including patriotism, nor do I even believe absolute freedom exists, and I certainly people talk about it without having any idea what it means. I am certainly not a commie or a fascist, and as for Darwin, well, I generally believe he existed, which is more than I can say about God. America is an awful big thing to hate wholesale, but I don't like nations in general. Nor am I overly fond of people, as a species, come to mention it. Political assasinations.

<dd>Threatening the life of the leader of the free world is not a joke. You are this close to landing in the slammer my little foolish friend. Aren't you aware that the American secret service does not allow threats to be made against the President, even in jest. People are interrogated and imprisoned routinely in my country for saying what you just did (which I'm not even going to repeat). The only thing of note that you just blurted out above, is that may be, just may be, somewhere there's a little part of America, that you don't want to see eliminated from the face of the earth. Thank you so much for that! May be I should call the white house, and ask the President that he declare August 1st, a national holiday from now on, since it was on this day that your majesty gave his permission to America to continue to exist? <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazy_Little_Woman_6498.html" title="User:Crazy Little Woman">Crazy Little Woman</a> 04:44, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't recall threatening anyone's life. I just said political assassinations weren't such a bad thing. Presidents Reagan and Bush seem to agree (executive orders notwithstanding); they tried to kill Quaddafi and Hussein, respectively. Fine with me, but unfortunately they killed all the wrong people. I think if people killed the leaders of nations rather than the poor dupes who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time the world would be better off. Then again it might be better off if no one killed anyone, but that might be too much to ask for. Oh, and perhaps I should have mentioned another thing I don't believe in is treason. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:56, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

Ever heard of the tactical nuclear missiles that the soviets dared to park on America's doorsteps? It was that son of a bitch Castro who let them do that. I'm beginning to dislike you and your ultra libral views immensely. Please remember, that it was our boys in WWII who freed that bowl of dust known as Europe, a continent that loves to hate America. USA handed Europe its freedom and prosperity on a silver platter. And what do you give us in return? <i><b>Pure and unadulterated contempt</b></i>. Your last entry about treason, better not be a jab at me. I wear an American flag with pride. I wave my American flag from my American car with pride. I have an American flag waving from my front porch at <i><b>all</b></i> times. If I wasn't slightly disabled, I would have joined the military and killed all those sons of bitches in Afghanistan who attacked my country on 9/11 and that cunt called Usama bin Laden would have seen his intestines pulled out by me, while he was still alive.

<dd>But we <i><b>did</b></i> save your butts in WWII. Would it <b>kill</b> you to admit that?

As for those klingons called Indians &amp; Pakistanis, it was not that butt naked half blind beggar called Ghandi or that I wanna-be-a-white-man self-important fool called Jinnah that freed the Indian lands from the Brits. Hitler pummelled Britain so much that they had no choice but get the hell out of there. They <i><b>still</b></i> did not want to quit India. But once again, it was the <b>mighty &amp; proud</b> American President who told them to hurry it up and get out of the Indian countries. Otherwise, those naked beggars had been fighting since 1857 to throw the Brits out - AND HAD FAILED COMPLETELY. Now these beggars love to hate the USA and <b>not once</b> have they ever thanked the USA for its role in their achieving their independence. But interestingly, now that they are all free, they are piling over each other to try and go to Britain. Idiots should have never thrown out the Brits, and they would all still be citizens of the United Kingdom. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazy_Little_Woman_6498.html" title="User:Crazy Little Woman">Crazy Little Woman</a> 16:39, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you don't <i><b>like</b></i> the tone please feel free to change it so that it is to your liking. Please know that bullying occurs more commonly in at least certain parts of wikipedia than you or me might be aware of. There are over half a million articles in the english language wikipedia, and many others in other languages, and no comprehensive way to keep track of abusive users. The <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> policy and any other IP address blocking policies are unenforceable, as all that does is block IP's which can be counter-productive since many innocent wikipedians also suffer, because many users share ISP's and proxy servers and therefore, IP addresses. Please read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPA#Remedies" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPA#Remedies" rel="nofollow">NPA (Remedies)</a> page.It says on the page itself and I quote:</dd>

But we can still tag and track bullies, so that they may be shamed into stopping the bullying. Being in a state of denial or personally attacking me is not going to make the problem go away. So, why not at least document the problem.

<li>Okay well then I'm confused, and somewhat bemused. The vote is overwhelmingly to keep <i>Sexiest Women</i> but overwhelmingly to delete the <i>Awesomely Bad</i> list. Yet they are essentially the same type of list — a commercial editorial categorization. This is completely inconsistent, to say the least. Was it because one list was posted on a Saturday, perhaps?

<p>(This is an "interesting" one!) I wasn't sure whether to put this on a VfD or RfC or what... but here it is. It is worth saying that the page was previously deleted last month. <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Karl_64c9.html" title="Hot Karl">Hot Karl</a> is also relevant, because it was on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Hot_Karl_62ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Hot Karl">VfD</a> and ended up as a redirect to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass_to_mouth.html" title="Ass to mouth">Ass to mouth</a>.</p>
<p>Now, it seems clear that Hot Carl and <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Karl_64c9.html" title="Hot Karl">Hot Karl</a> should be treated the same. However, there is some controversy on <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com" class="external text" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com" rel="nofollow">Urban Dictionary</a> as to what the term actually means - essentially whether it involves defecation or ass to mouth. If the former, perhaps it should redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coprophilia.html" title="Coprophilia">Coprophilia</a> instead. Or perhaps they should both just be deleted as unverifiable or unencyclopedic. If they are ruled unencyclopedic, there are several other sexual slang terms that should perhaps be considered (e.g. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_punch.html" title="Donkey punch">Donkey punch</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_steamer.html" title="Cleveland steamer">Cleveland steamer</a>). <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbis_377c.html" title="User:Bobbis">Bobbis</a> 18:09, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. My purpose for listing all of the articles by year, from 1999 on, was to create a timeline on the growth of digital media, the essays representing the perceptions of that specific time. The goal was historical, which is why all of the links go to their Archive.org page rather than the site itself (with the exeption of 2004 and 2005, which are not yet on the archive). A listing of select articles by date seemed more useful to a researcher.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not seen anyone else use the same type of listing technique as I employed, but then Wikipedia is still an evolving form itself and an idea used in the proper context should be evaluated on its merits. I admit, on a surface level I can see how these links can be confused with spam, but these select articles individually offer detail beyond the scope of Wikipedia and serve as subjects for further reading. The point of the layout was to offer key events and technologies in a convenient glance.</p>
<p>I invite Trickyt and Finlay McWalter and everyone else who wishes to vote on this to read a few of the articles from 1999, 2000, and 2001 and then ask if they think they would be useful to someone researching MP3 several years from now. My plan was to create similar listings for similar site's like P2Pnet.net, which is edited by Jon Newton, Slyck.com by Thomas Mennecke and the essays of Declan McCullagh on CNET. I am just waiting get some more energy to plow through several years of essays to pull the gems. It makes no sense to go through that effort if its going to cause problems. I think these articles are important and appropriate, but that's only my opinion and I can probably use some guidance. The description of MP3 Newswire itself is modest, only a short paragraph and a listing of a few of the contributers. -- Mp3hist | <a href="../../../m/p/3/User_talk%7EMp3hist_9c99.html" title="User talk:Mp3hist">Talk</a> 22:57 August 1, 2005</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> - With Mp3hist's explanation, it seemed like this website was more important despite such a poor Alexa.

Also, looking into Alexa's history, MP3 Newswire has had several jumps in readership (altough they don't get much higher than 40,000). It seems like they have a legitimate claim in being a notable place for news about MP3. (If Mp3hist wants to show the history of this technology, I think that's valid, as long as it's within the history part of the article, where it will be seen by those who are going to use it.) -<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLeahy_11b5.html" title="User:JJLeahy">JJLeahy</a> 15:44, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Roughly 15,000 Google hits for exact phrase, and, imho, the persistent vandalism to this entry shows that author's work is getting noticed. Vanity is not sufficient grounds for deletion if entry is relevant/subject notable. Also, subsequent, critically analytical [if POV, and in need of neutralization] changes have been made to this article, showing interest from the non-vandal side of the fence too. This is an entry that apparently provokes strong feelings in some, and is in need of expansion / input from editors other than the author, not deletion. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Lamo_094a.html" title="User:Adrian Lamo">Adrian</a> 19:17, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My only comments to this would be: (a) persistent vandalism of this particular entry is probably less reflective of its relevance and more reflective of the author's reference to it to garner attention. For example, the vandalism appears to be concentrated around the times of mention by the author on his weblog or in the column that prompted this relisting. (b) While Wikipedia is great at the multiple author expansion/edit model, self-written bio pages like this are the best examples of the single-editor problem -- precious few others are in the position to contribute about a subject as narrow and unknown, and when they do (as in the current Metafilter adds/deletes), it's mass-deleted as vandalism rather than edited and tuned to remain neutral. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelfuego_7a53.html" title="User:Delfuego">Jason</a> 19:37, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

To his credit, he's done so somewhat, but I'd be uneasy about this article being kept, despite a majority opinion, without explanation -- ie, specific suspect accounts involved in the voting, votes not grounded in solid policy, etc. That said, I still support the whole not-deleting-this-entry thing. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Lamo_094a.html" title="User:Adrian Lamo">Adrian</a> 03:58, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair enough. Here's my position. A journalist with notable publications writes an article on himself. Is this bad? Yes. Should we assume that he knows about our policies on vanity pages? No. Assume good faith. Don't bite the newbies. This is someone who is giving Wikipedia good press, and who probably made an honest mistake. Regardless of the original status of the article, it's been edited by many people who are not him now - that makes it not vanity anymore. It's just wrong to delete an article because of a genuine mistake of a user who is being a real ambassador of good faith and for whom a strong case for notability can be made. If I had started this article, saying he was a journalist with publications in Macworld, the New York Times, Wired, and Slate, there would be no objection. The issue is that people are pissy that he made a mistake. And even more pissy that he made his mistake publicly on Slate. That's not a reason to delete. Reasons to delete have to do with the content of an article. Too much of this discussion has to do with the article's creator. And those aren't valid votes. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 04:18, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personally, I have supported a person editing autobiographical pages in the past. But that guy was notable, and it was appropriate for him to have a Wikipedia page. Not so for this guy. But whether you have compelling reasons for ignoring each vote is irrelevant, because you have already made it clear that you will ignore the results of the community process, even before it is completed, and no matter how compelling the popular consensus is. This is the very definition of prejudice. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 08:39, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, This is my first VfD. In fact, this discussion has been highly illuminating for me, teaching me much about Wikipedia and the process of creating, editing, and deleting entries. The entry should be kept as a sort of "meta-entry" about what Wikipedia is, can be, and shouldn't be. Because you have to keep the discussion about the VfD, you also have to keep the article to which it refers. Although, in fairness, if you can both keep the article, and keep the links to it alive, and at the same time perform a redirect, then the article should be slid to the User Pages section. Like it or not, the Slate article that tweaks Wikipedia is now a permanent part of the ether - people will be reading it and linking to it for years to come. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangali_5158.html" title="User:Malangali">Malangali</a> 11:46, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not a tool for reward or punishment. For a biography, the question isn't how annoying the subject is; it's whether the subject meets the generally agreed-upon <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_Inclusion_of_Biographies_a5ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for Inclusion of Biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria_for_Inclusion_of_Biographies</a>. It is independently verifiable that Farivar has written for "periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more". Therefore, a biography of him merits inclusion, according to Wikipedia guidelines. (And, yes, I think it would actually be a good thing to have articles on every writer for the New York Times. Wikipedia is not paper; there is no shortage of space here. More information is better than less information.) That's why I vote <b>keep</b>--but for those who are unpersuaded, I point out another possible solution that was used in a previous situation.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>When I joined Wikipedia, I am embarrassed to admit that I created an article about myself, because I met the criteria for inclusion. After becoming more familiar with Wikipedia standards, I came to understand that it was inappropriate for a user to judge his own notability. I therefore <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Jacob_Sager_Weinstein_a150.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jacob Sager Weinstein">put the article I had created up for VFD</a>. The consensus that emerged was that it would be deleted--but that a user who felt the information was worth preserving would recreate it from independently verifiable sources. This might seem like a rather roundabout approach, but I'd argue that it is reasonable compromise that is true to the spirit of Wikipedia. So... My vote (and first choice) is that this article be kept. My second choice would be that, if it is deleted, a user recreate it from independently verifiable sources. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobw_974e.html" title="User:Jacobw">Jacobw</a> 15:34, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>On what planet? Until this Wikipedia page popped up, I'm sure a lot of us here (Mr. Snell excluded) had never heard of Mr. Farivar. Putting up a Wikipedia entry on yourself to make yourself "notable" isn't exactly the way to go about doing it. I'm going to agree with the recommendation to <b>userfy</b>, as that seems to be the most graceful way to solve this problem - Mr. Farivar stays on Wikipedia in some fashion, and all the arguments used against it thus far would become irrelevent, as he's a user, not a "very notable Internet personality."

<ul>
<li>-- This article meets Wikipedia policy criteria for inclusion of biographical entries, which include several standards under which a subject may qualify as 'notable' -- Farivar meets enough of these standards for his entry to be valid. Votes to delete based solely on "this is vanity!" are not reflective of valid cause for deletion under WP policy, and may be disregarded unless amended to show objective reasoning recognized by existing WP policy. I note again that there's enough interest in this topic that it's highly probable that the community will polish and update it as time goes on, the lack of faith in the WP process shown by some notwithstanding. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Lamo_094a.html" title="User:Adrian Lamo">Adrian</a> 13:30, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, <b>I</b> first heard about Cyrus Farivar before even knowing he had made a Wikipedia article about himself. It was from a mailing list my former work colleague manages.

<li><b>Keep</b> The current version is accurate, reasonably neutral, and summarizes his involvement in a briefly newsworthy even (the greenlighting hoax).

<li>If someone had walked in off the street and written this entry about Farivar, I don't think we'd be having this discussion. As it is, we're contemplating disregarding his relevance because we don't like his conduct. I recognize, respect, and disagree with the original reasons for this Vfd, but some of the votes here smack of a desire to tear others down, not make Wikipedia better. To me, one of the fantastic things about Wikipedia has always been the potential for controversial entries to grow and evolve. This one won't be given a chance if deleted, and that's a shame. Also, I'm a bit concerned regarding the number of extremely new accounts participating in a VfD regarding a vandalism-prone entry. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Lamo_094a.html" title="User:Adrian Lamo">Adrian</a> 20:15, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- I see my name on Google all the time. I have occasionally been the subject of "internet controversy." I am a published journalist. I have the common decency not to create a Wikipedia page about myself. This opens the door to countless other "vanity pages" by would-be actors, writers, etc., and I see no benefit in having Cyrus Farivar on a list with H.L. Mencken. When Mr. Farivar writes something on the same level as Mr. Mencken, I will be the first to argue for his reinstatement. Hell, I'll even write his entry. Until then, he doesn't belong here. -- The New Zorker (note, no Wikipedia page) 209.113.141.74 20:56, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>note: user's IP is new, but the user himself wrote the original entries for <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Along_The_Watchtower_f85d.html" title="All Along The Watchtower">All Along The Watchtower</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Willie_McTell_%28song%29_a167.html" title="Blind Willie McTell (song)">Blind Willie McTell</a> ages and ages ago.

<li>I have to ask: at what point is someone "Wikipedia-worthy?" And who decides that? Surely Mencken doesn't define the bottom limit. Does David Pogue? Does Steven Levy? Does Maureen Dowd? And what if that decision is influenced by the behavior of the author or the subject of the page, rather than his/her own merits? In addition, what if this wasn't a self-created page? Then the "vanity page" arguments have to turn into something else. Ego page? Nepotism page? <a href="../../../j/s/n/User%7EJsnell_4a6e.html" title="User:Jsnell">Jsnell</a> 21:17, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're right, you're right. It's unfair to put a "bar" down in terms of these sorts of arguments. If he didn't create the page himself, there would be less of a "delete this page" upswell. But the fact remains, David Pogue, Steven Levy and Maureen Dowd are all fairly well-known, or at least have a following of some sort. I see no Farivar Fan Club. If I create a page on <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Chass_3c2a.html" title="Murray Chass">Murray Chass</a>, an author whose name I currently see on the front page of the New York Times website, does that grant him legitimacy? While I acknowledge Mencken is a poor bar to set, a bar does exist, and Mr. Farivar does not clear it. The New Zorker 21:25, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the vote, invisible user. I don't really appreciate your mention of "whoring" in conjunction with "Macworld," but since your sentence is completely nonsensical I can't really question it directly. The Slate reference was a joke -- we professional writers, we makey with the jokey sometimes, see? I see what's going on here. Cyrus stepped on a landmine that was armed with the sanctimony of Wikipedians. And he is being punished (in various ways) for that. I'd like to believe that this article is being voted for/against deletion on its merits (or lack of same), but it's clear that some participants in this process are slagging on the spirit of Wikipedia while claiming to endorse its tenents. It's too bad, but very enlightening about the weaknesses in a system as strong as Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/s/n/User%7EJsnell_4a6e.html" title="User:Jsnell">Jsnell</a> 23:37, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>;Subject announcement of a Wikipedia page about himself will do more good for Wikipedia than harm. Might bring a large number of new readers to Wikipedia. (This is the first time I've ever edited anything here.) Furthermore, his role in outing the 'greenlighting' hoax will have done a lot in bringing to light the existence of 'hoax communities' like WookieFetish. Finally, what's so bad about vanity pages? Is disk space not getting so cheap as to be free? Won't vanity pages make people care more about Wikipedia? If a person gets used to writing a page about themselves, that should introduce them to the process of Wikipedia and might get them to start editing other pages about subjects they care about. All of this is a good thing, right? 63.197.5.4</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I am in a position to know that Cyrus Farivar was one of the ringleaders in developing the "Greenlighting" hoax - the purpose was to see how far the traditional media could be hoaxed before Cyrus would "uncover" the hoax and be the hero. The whole "Greenlighting" hoax was designed in large part by him in order to get recognition for himself (his blog had been receiving very little traffic or attention). Unfortuately Cyrus jumped the gun and pulled the plug on the hoax before it really got going. Therefore since Cyrus was a conspirator in creating the hoax in the first place, this entry is only serving to perputate his self-grandeur. 209.225.104.124 02:58, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

I have not RTFA on policies, but it seems to me that is what is germane here, not personality, popularity, relevance etc. Clearly, there are other ways to utilze the wiki-resources to announce oneself to the world, and while I do slightly tip my hat to C.F. for the brazen marketing, I also offer a slap upside the head for not following the posted TOS.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is also not paper. Besides I don't agree that this article constitute a "memorial" these people do have <i>"a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered by their friends and relatives"</i>. Lots of people are notable, not for who they where, but for the attention theyr deaths caused. <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Charles_de_Menezes_a252.html" title="Jean Charles de Menezes">Jean Charles de Menezes</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadou_Diallo_24c5.html" title="Amadou Diallo">Amadou Diallo</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Schiavo_eb3a.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a> to list a few.

<li>I don't feel that I'm biased at all. To assert that my vote was based on the fact that I'm not Eastern European is absurd. As far as the individuals you listed are concerned, each of their deaths is entirely different. Menezes is notable as it was a total error and was caused by a 'trigger happy' attitude brought on by the fear and hysteria of the London bombings. Diallo's death deals with the disturbingly pervasive issue of police brutality in American. Schiavo's death became a political issue and talking point and is therefore notable. As I mentioned previous, the deaths of the couple in this article is a tragedy. Unfortunately, it has nothing distinctly notable that sets it apart from other civilian casualties of war. -<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 18:36, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

They became a "symbol" of the conflict, and hence notable. Just like <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank_man.html" title="Tank man">Tank man</a> was no more or less notable than the other Chinese dissidents, but because pictures of him was picked up in the media he became a notable symbol of the conflict (except he didn't die (AFAIK)), another example of a casualty of war that became notable was <s>the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Nguyen_Ngoc_Loan_executing_a_Viet_Cong_prisoner_in_Saigon_6a66.html" title="General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner in Saigon">Viet cong prisoner</a></s> <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen_Van_Lem_f64a.html" title="Nguyen Van Lem">Nguyen Van Lem</a> who was executed on camera during the Vietnam war.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The number of Google hits isn't the only criteria. I'm sure a lot of individual slang words have far more Google hits, but do not merit their own articles on Wikipedia. This article was VFDed almost a year ago, but it's still nothing more than a dictionary definition. There simply isn't much to say about "retrosexual" except that it's a slang term that metrosexuals invented to describe non-metrosexual men. There's no group of people that actively identifies itself as "retrosexuals," nor is there any group that's known by most other people as "retrosexuals." It's simply a neologism that retrosexuals came up with as a lable for all men who aren't in their group. As such, the article should be deleted, turned into a redirect to <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrosexual.html" title="Metrosexual">metrosexual</a> (where all neccesary brief discussion can take place), and then protected. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 06:18, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It should be kept. It's a reputable source for polish culture in the 21st century. My local paper has listed it on a soccer links site and has talked about it in the paper. It's how other cultures can be introduced to polacy on the internet. A very good way to meet and share ideas. Non-notable? your non-notable. Keep it. --Ryankozlowski 17:00, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

It shouldn't be a cause for deletion, and it shouldn't enter into the minds of thsoe voting, because it is untrue. All the voters with IP's are simply Polishsoccer.com members who don't have Wikipedia membership, and this sort of introduction surely won't entice them at trying to enhance the Polish soccer section of Wikipedia.
