<p>The article states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Another, less distinctive, type of artificial island is formed by the incidental isolation of an existing piece of mainland by canal construction.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Is this really so? I would understand a reference to phenomenas as for instance the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curonian_Lagoon_6ba2.html" title="Curonian Lagoon">Curonian Lagoon</a>, that however isn't artificial, but canals... aren't they too narrow? --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Magnus_89a1.html" title="User:Johan Magnus">Johan Magnus</a> 22:36, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I agree, this particular phenomenon isn't terribly interesting, hence the words&#160;: <i>less distinctive</i>, <i>incidental</i>; however, it is one way that an island is artificially created and a piece of land is surrounded by water. For examples, see <a href="../../../d/i/t/Dithmarschen.html" title="Dithmarschen">Dithmarschen</a> and particularly <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marble_Hill%2C_Manhattan%2C_New_York_202b.html" title="Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York">Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York</a>, which shows a real complex history: first a part of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> Island, then isolated for about twenty years, and finally reconnected with the opposite shore of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bronx_bb96.html" title="The Bronx">the Bronx</a>. This of course was a recipe for municipal chaos. It wasn't really clear what borough it was now in; when a judge found it to be legally still a part of Manhattan in the 1930s the Bronx Borough President declared it 'the Bronx <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudetenland.html" title="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a>' (things worked out a little more peacefully here). The Romans also created one from the <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tiber.html" title="Tiber">Tiber</a>, called <i>Isola Sacra</i>, the holy island. Anyway, sometimes interesting (like Marble Hill), usually not so much, I think its something that should get a mention in this article.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 00:08, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

Thank you for your interesting answer. Dithmarschen is the only example physically close to me (200 miles), and in that case it wouldn't at all correpsond with my understanding. It would be, to me, similar to say that North-America was made an "island" through the digging of the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama_Canal_ac67.html" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a>. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Magnus_89a1.html" title="User:Johan Magnus">Johan Magnus</a> 00:27, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess the first thing you'd have to do is to ask why Ellis Island is considered an artificial island on the Wikipedia article, and possibily many websites and encyclopædias, at <a href="../../../e/l/l/Talk%7EEllis_Island_3df7.html" title="Talk:Ellis Island">talk:Ellis Island</a>. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 16:35, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd><i>Ellis Island, <b>complex of one natural and two artificial islands</b>, joined by causeways, in Upper New York Bay, northeastern New Jersey and southeastern New York, near Manhattan.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>To therefore call Ellis Island an artificial island is only partly correct. If one may look at maps <a href="http://www.ellisisland.com/images/MapBit.gif" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ellisisland.com/images/MapBit.gif" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, aerial pictures <a href="http://images.encarta.msn.com/xrefmedia/sharemed/targets/images/pho/000fb/000fb58f.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://images.encarta.msn.com/xrefmedia/sharemed/targets/images/pho/000fb/000fb58f.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and satelite images <a href="http://www.galvinized.com/ellis/images/map.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.galvinized.com/ellis/images/map.jpg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> of the island, even that definition by Encarta is in doubt, because it is evidently clear, that the "complex of islands" is in actual fact just one. The US Supreme Court judgement over its ownership <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;navby=case&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=120ORIG" class="external autonumber" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;navby=case&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=120ORIG" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> does not talk about three islands, but one expanded island. The official website of Ellis Island makes no mention of it being so, nor of its "artificial island" status <a href="http://www.ellisisland.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ellisisland.org" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Non of the sources listed in the <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellis_Island_c334.html" title="Ellis Island">Ellis Island</a> page support Encarta's view either. In fact, this page <a href="http://www.saveellisisland.org/site/PageServer?pagename=StructuralDevelopment" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saveellisisland.org/site/PageServer?pagename=StructuralDevelopment" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> has an excellent diagram on the land reclamation profile of Ellis island over the years. Three islands? An artificial island? Hardly.</dd>

<p>Ellis Island is 90% artificial; it is much more artificial island than natural island. Most "traditional" artificial islands have been built on some existing natural structure, either a reef or a tiny bit of stone or dirt sticking above the water.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 17:41, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I constantly say above, please provide any source which states that an "artificial island" includes one which was expanded from an existing island. Also, please show any source which tell us the % of landfill needed before the island "becomes" artificial.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 17:50, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course there is no <i>International Commission on Artificial Islands</i> that sets up an official definition. Many sources describe massive expansions of tiny islets as "artificial island". The point is, that if an island is 90% artificial, it should be discussed in an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_island.html" title="Artificial island">artificial island</a> article. We should adopt a pragmatic definition when discussing this phenomenon.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 16:39, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I dont mind helping, although I must caution again if this definition amounts to original research. HKIA is only 75% reclaimed land, and one of the original islands can hardly be considered an "islet". Why is it erroneously being called an "artificial island" by less than authoritative sources? Conversely, are all islands which were substaintially expanded called artificial islands? The point is engineers, reporters and governments even and etc like to use the term "artificial island" because it feeds their self-ego into believing they have created something purely out of human hands, even when it was not entirely true.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:45, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Via RFC</b>:</p>
<p>I would not call oil rigs artificial islands. I can see why someone might want to though. Whoever is trying to change it has to know that generally oil rigs are not referred to as islands, because it is silly. They just want to change it to be more inclusive. I can respect that, I argue semantics all the time. I think it is easy to solve, you can make up some conditions if you want, how about these:</p>
<dl>
<dd>An island: is not floating</dd>
<dd>An island: is attached to the ground</dd>
<dd>An island: has a coastline</dd>
</dl>
<p>With this, all islands and artificial islands (since this is really about the defintion of "island," not just "artificial islands") fulfill all the conditions easily and obviously. Nothing else but an island would really fulfill it (I think). Oil rigs, not so much. This actually sits well with me, because you might be able to call the tube parts of oil rigs "artificial islands" (if they are attached to the ground) which is ok with me, but then the whole structure itself, the oil rig, isn't an island. This works with bridges and stuff too. Their supports would be little artificial islands, and I don't know if anyone would get too upset over that. You wouldn't call a bridge an artificial island that's for sure. What do you think?--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 10:25, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don't like defining things so much, you may just want to go with the more subjective culturally defined "island," and defer to "the things that people call islands", but since no calls oil rigs islands, then you simply don't call them that. I think whoever is wanting to call oil rigs islands has their own personal definition of island that they think is neutral and objective but it doesn't fit with other people's, so that means consensus either on a more hard-line objective definition like I suggested above (but which more than likely counts as "original research"), or consensus that the definition should defer to common usage. Or something like that&#160;:). I think mine is close enough to the subjective defintion, but I do understand that it can seem out of line to people. Personally, I like to keep things subjective when they are as common as the word "island" but I also like seeing if I can make up an objective definition. Anyway, I just hope these ideas help in your discussion.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 10:39, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
