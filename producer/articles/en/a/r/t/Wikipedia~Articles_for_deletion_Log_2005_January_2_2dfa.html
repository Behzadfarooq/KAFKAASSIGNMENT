<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was keep.</p>
<p>While reading through many of the comments below, I note a large number of new and/or anonymous users whose votes have to be steeply discounted. I also note from the comments that many of the people who chose to participate in this discussion are expressing opinions which are at variance to my understanding of our general community norms on similar issues. While there is a clear concensus to keep the article at this time, great caution should be used before considering this a precedent for other decisions. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:43, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

Constructed languages don't have to be popular to be notable. They are often interesting and unique examples of what languages can be. Though I found Toki's syntax interesting enough, I'm not sure if it's truely encyclopedic. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntangir_86a8.html" title="User:Intangir">Intangir</a> 02:47, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>*<b>Not sure</b>. As mentioned elsewhere a google search for "Toki Pona" brings up 26,000 pages. However , about 18,000 of them are wikipedia related, and therefore a little suspect(a google search of ' "Toki Pona" -wikipedia ', gives only 7,650 results). <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntangir_86a8.html" title="User:Intangir">Intangir</a> 03:28, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the most fascinating things I've discovered on Wikipedia. I can think of no more notable <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_language.html" title="Constructed language">conlang</a> ever created in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep!</b> I honestly don't know how many people use the language, although the estimation of 12 seems far too low to me. But, does it matter? Most constructed languages, Toki Pona included, were <b>not</b> created with the purpose of acquiring a community of speakers; instead, they were created as works of art. Establishing the significance of such a language by the number of people who actually use it is the same thing as establishing the significance of a symphony by the size of the orchestra that performs it. If you really want to know how wikifiable a constructed language is, you'll need to find out how complete it is, which degree of esteem it has received inside and outside the conlang community, and how verifiable all this is. Well, Toki Pona scores well on all these fronts. A simple google for "Toki Pona" generates no less than 26,400 hits; seventeen wikipedias feature an article about it, while numerous other wikis refer to it in other articles. As an insider I can assure you that Toki Pona enjoys a high reputation; in fact, it is one of the most successful artistic languages ever created, especially if you consider the fact that it lacks a book or a movie as a vehicle. The article definitely deserves to stay! <a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 06:34, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC).</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. There are 'much' more users then twelve and WikiPedia in TokiPona is a very good place to learn the language and increase that number. --Earwin Burrfoot</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. As Toki Pona is currently in what could be considered an initial period of growth, and as the language already has a large number of followers (who stem from several different base languages), it definitely merits inclusion in Wikipedia.</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. Toki Pona is the most perfect conlang around. It has the best insa/nimi (meaning/words) value. It's getting more and more popular (slowly, but anyway). It's surely a product of Great Linguist's mind. It is not vanity NO way. Toki Pona is a genious language. Its Wikipedia was one of the best resources for me, beause it was not <b>about</b> toki pona, but it was about whatever <b>usign</b> toki pona. So it was a way to explore things and toki pona simultaneously. Those idiots writing "vanity" just have no idea what they are talking about. Keep it, it IS worth. Thank you.</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. WikiPedia on TokiPona is really one of the best places to learn the language and one of the most amasing things on the whole WikiPedia.

<dd>It seems to be a common misconception that Toki Pona is only known because of its presence on wikipedia, but that is simply false. I and others learned of it well before noticing it on wikipedia. Extensive websites about it exist, created by people in various countries (I've seen English, German, Russian and Esperanto webpages about Toki Pona). Translations and original works and comics exist. It is simply wrong to assert that it's known only because of wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/o/u/User%7EGoulo_62ba.html" title="User:Goulo">Goulo</a> 08:37, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That is absolutely true. Thing is, each wiki entry is mirrored and mirrored ad infinitum. Same with DMOZ entries. That's something inherent to the Wikipedias, and you definitely cannot blame Sonja for that, especially if you take into consideration that she can't even be held responsible for the page! Besides, you are right: even if you omit all the wiki pages and their mirrors, there remain a substantial amount of other web pages. [On a personal note: I am also the author of a language with a wiki entry; let me tell you that it is really annoying to have to dig your way through all those wiki mirrors if you want to check if something new has been written about it]. <a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 15:28, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC).

<dd>Hm? I'm not sure if IJzeren is replying to me or to Megan1967. The indentation suggests me, but I wasn't talking at all about the issue of wiki mirroring or whether Sonja wrote about Toki Pona in wikipedia or its mirrors, and I'm not sure what that has to do with the question whether Toki Pona should be deleted from wikipedia. In case it was unclear, I'm saying that Toki Pona has presence and significance independent of wikipedia and its mirrors, and that indeed many people learn of it via sources other than wikipedia and its mirrors. Given that variety of Toki Pona activity that is utterly unrelated to wiki, it is therefore false to assert that Toki Pona is only notable because of wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/o/u/User%7EGoulo_62ba.html" title="User:Goulo">Goulo</a> 17:21, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Note that I'm not <i>attacking</i> this approach - I geuninely don't get what it is supposed to do.

<li><b>Keep it, please.</b> It seems very bias that you decide to keep information about big companies, such as Xerox etc and straight away want to delete information about small companies, such as ours. Keep in mind that all information is factual. Another argument for keeping this entry is the entry for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prous_Science_222a.html" title="Prous Science">Prous Science</a>. Judging from user comments, Prous Science is likely to be kept, so if Prous Science is allowed Vagrant World should also be allowed. Vagrant World does not have to be non-notable, it depends who you ask doesn't it? If there is anything we can do to make the entry for Vagrant World more notable or tolorable to you, please tell us.User:vagrantworld 16:04, 2 Jan 2005 (CET)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, Wikipedia is not for advertising. Big companies are included because they affect the lives of millions and are therefore encyclopedic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The difference is that Xerox is a well-established company that has become a household name. This makes it notable. Vagrant World is not yet two years old and has, seemingly, no particular accomplishments or noteworthiness. This makes it not notable. If there is in fact something that makes it noteworthy — publishing a book that's become regarded as important in its field, for instance — then that should be mentioned in the article. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 23:27, Jan 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Generally, whether something is notable is decided by how many people know about it (for most kinds of articles). I'm not saying this is a good or a bad thing, but it does mean that topics related to fictions will be sufficiently notable at a much lower level of importance than other things, as they reach a much larger audience. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 08:03, 2005 Jan 2 (UTC)

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 5 keep as is (one of which was opened since the VfD nomination and is discounted as a possible <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">Wikipedia:sockpuppet</a>), 2 keep as redirect and 9 delete (two of whom took the time to say they would also support the redirect). Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, this decision defaults to keep.</p>
<p>Reading through the arguments and supporting links (and filtering out the personal attacks on both sides), I find myself agreeing that, to the extent that Mr Villeneuve has attained notability, it is right now almost solely derivative from his relationship with <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permanent_Defense_0ae3.html" title="Permanent Defense">Permanent Defense</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> He led an important aspect of opposition statewide to an initiative that would have seen the installation of over 18000 slot machines in Washington State. He succeeded against well-funded, well-organized opposition. This seems clearly notable by any measure, he was quoted representing the opposition in the Seattle Post Intelligencer<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/165437_vsoundoff19.html?searchpagefrom=1&amp;searchdiff=293" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/165437_vsoundoff19.html?searchpagefrom=1&amp;searchdiff=293" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The Permanent Defense article reads like a political pamphlet but that's another story. Villeneuve is clearly an important player not just in local politics but statewide and like him or not he warrants an article, with more facts and in more neutral form than the Permanent Defense article. It really should stay. I can help perhaps by adding to it, no one could allege I am sympathetic to his views, I'm not. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertas_b65c.html" title="User:Libertas">Libertas</a>

<li>I suspect Libertas's vote has less to do with the subject matter than the fact that s/he is upset with me over several unrelated disputes (see <a href="../../../l/i/b/User_talk%7ELibertas_0781.html" title="User talk:Libertas">User talk:Libertas</a> for details). If Libertas had any knowledge of Washington state politics, s/he would understand that Eyman's latest initiative seriously unpopular almost from the beginning, and that Villeneuve's efforts (which, again, I support) had little to do with its overwhelming defeat. The only well-funded opposition to 892 came from the tribes. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 06:52, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Radicalsubversiv makes another personal attack in order to diminish my position. I am more familiar with Washington politics than he might think. The initiative received 35% support did it not, hardly dead on arrival. I acknowledge others worked with Villeneuve, particular public sector rent-seekers who wanted to keep the taxes flowing. But to deny Villeneuve's role in it seems churlish and is most probably some nasty internal left dispute within the happy community of Washington liberals and marijuana activists. Radicalsubversiv misuses his role here to prosecute outside battles. I think he protests too much about supporting Villeneuve. I smell a rat. You're wrong about the funding sources btw, but why let facts get in the way of your story. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertas_b65c.html" title="User:Libertas">Libertas</a></li>

<li>Yeah, and given that it also tells you I live in Birmingham in the UK I'm unlikely to be deeply involved in Washington left politics, wouldn't you say? I see absolutely no evidence that this was nominated in bad faith. The subject of the article is indeed 'of dubious notability' in that his notability outside of the group of which he is a member is questionable. You have not, despite all your contributions to this "debate", provided any evidence of personal animosity between the nominator and the subject. Even if you did it would scarcely make a diference as radical has commented on the <i>article</i> and its merits, as has every other contributor. You on the other hand have continually cast aspersions on other users and made ridiculous ad hominem attacks on users who differ from you in politics. You are bullying other users.

<li>Should've known better? Is Wikipedia a product catalog for old technology? What kind of impact has this thing had? If it has had any it should be mentioned in the article.

<li>External links can always be changed or deleted, although this one seems to have legitimate information on the topic so I don't see what's wrong with it. What are your criteria for a notable enough PDA that <a href="../../../t/a/p/Tapwave_Zodiac_3b0d.html" title="Tapwave Zodiac">Tapwave Zodiac</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_Axim_c305.html" title="Dell Axim">Dell Axim</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/i/CLI%C3%89_9bd9.html" title="CLIÉ">CLIÉ</a> fulfill and this one doesn't? That they're not outdated? I don't see that as being much of a factor since we cover all sorts of things that are outdated (like, say, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet_Biscayne_0f73.html" title="Chevrolet Biscayne">Chevrolet Biscayne</a>). It doesn't look like an advertisement for the product, it's doing no harm, and it's definitely more encyclopedic than all the Digimon minutiae we insist on keeping. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 18:28, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>People keep saying it is notable. If so, please add what is notable about it to the article. Otherwise, it is just an old PDA.

<ul>
<li>While the 69,000 google hits cited by RaDMaN do lend a great deal towards the notability of this handheld, so does the number of websites explicitly dedicated to the 200LX. IIRC there used to be a paper-based magazine also for HP Palmtops geared towards the 200LX. As Livajo also points out, we have articles for <a href="../../../t/a/p/Tapwave_Zodiac_3b0d.html" title="Tapwave Zodiac">Tapwave Zodiac</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_Axim_c305.html" title="Dell Axim">Dell Axim</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/i/CLI%C3%89_9bd9.html" title="CLIÉ">CLIÉ</a> as well. Most outstanding is that this is a long expired piece of hardware and still it is garnering a relatively very high hit count. There is no point in the senseless deletion of this article, bytes are cheap and Wikipedia is not paper.

<li>So, it is encyclopedic because it has fans? Was it the first to use some new technology? Did it do something better than any other PDA? Saying that one article belongs because we have articles about other equally non-notable subjects is not a very good argument. Rather than adding more non-encyclopedic articles we should be removing the ones that already exist. <a href="../../../d/c/e/User%7EDCEdwards1966_6213.html" title="User:DCEdwards1966">DCEdwards1966</a> 04:50, Jan 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The Grateful Dead has fans, should we delete them too? Please do not twist my words around. Yes, the number of "fans" is a good beacon for how <i>notable</i> something may be. My argument isn't how many fans they have, but that this article has an excellent opportunity for growth and expansion and there is no clear advantage to the slashing and burning of valuable Wikipedia articles.

<li>It sold well? It is well-known in its field?

<li>And by the way, the suggestions are obviously not reasons to delete. My suggestions, if implemented, would be reasons to keep. Also, I did not twist your words around.

<li><b>Keep</b> I made the topic. =p I own one and have never been able to find a comparible device. Small, qwerty keyboard, rugged, very expandible (at least for its time), runs DOS. All that aside, it was a highly notible landmark in palmtops at the time, and a moneymaker for HP right up until they pulled the plug in preference for ce machines. Yes, it was profitable and they stopped production anyway. This topic should remain because of the historical placement the device has in the history of palmtops. Yes Wikipedia is a catalogue of old products, especially uniquely notible and highly influential ones. Yes I linked to my own work. To that end, i'm willing to donate all the info from there here if there is sufficient interest, although all the various rough notes probably don't belong here. My own website plug is not vanity, I'm quite proud of this device and apparently others are too. -- <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysy_d18f.html" title="User:Sysy">Sy</a> 22:17, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Merge" basically means "keep". It would be interesting to know just how many of these articles which are retained after a VfD where the preponderance of votes is either merge and/or delete, actually get merged, rather than "kept" or "no consensus" (meaning kept). Anyway, as the father of a 5 year-old, and therefore (temporarily) an expert on Thomas the Tank Engine, I can tell you that Diesel is a very minor character, who appears in ony a couple of the episodes, of which there are dozens.

<p>IMHO this is just another POV split, this time from <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a>. Even relevance looks somewhat fishy: <i>A contingent of a few independent researchers and amateurs maintain a community on the internet of people who, for one reason or another, reject the standard Big Bang model.</i>.

<li>I'm inclined to agree, especially since there's already a criticism section in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_bang.html" title="Big bang">big bang</a>.

<li>As the creator of the page I can say that I really don't want this page or its progenitor (<a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-standard_cosmology.html" title="Non-standard cosmology">non-standard cosmology</a>) to exist as such, but there are a number of people who really want to present a thorough and coarse rehashing of old arguments, no matter how ridiculous they are.

<li>Interesting comment. How would you provide a link on a page which is intended to be informative as the way that someone can donate to organizations collecting donations for victims of the Indian Ocean tsnumanis? QuakeAID is the only organization that is 100% dedicated to providing relief for victims of earthquakes, and has been doing this since July 1998. Because it has done this from Greece, is perhaps why a number of US-based organizations do not record it. However, believe me, there is a world outside the US. Not all charities are US-based and or US-created. --BAOU 06:36, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My objection to the donation link is that it is essentially a solicitation, requesting that the reader pay money, which is frowned upon in an encyclopedia, even for good causes. My vote to delete was based on my opinion that for any organization, there has to be some evidence that it is somehow noteworthy, that it stands out from others and is generally well-known in its field. Just doing charitable work does not make an organization encyclopedic. And contrary to the stereotype, there are actually lots of people in this country who are aware of the world outside the US, including me. I would vote according to the same policy just as readily to a non-notable American company. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 02:49, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you should pay attention to that struggle. You are at risk as well. The facts, which I suspect you have not even considered are that QuakeAID registered quakeaid.com through Network Solutions. During the first year of registration, while the amount paid $70 was still *in force*, Netsol allowed and Register.com was able to permit the registration of the domain name by another person (could be one of the people so fervently objecting to QuakeAID's presense here) and despite numerous legal attempts against Netsol, and then the registrant, it has been unable to recover its property. From my perspective, QuakeAID is the victim. --BAOU 06:36, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're right. I'm on a personal quest to find facts.

Meanwhile, I continue to uncover mountain after mountain of documentary evidence of repeated legal problems and disputes related to any organization even remotely affiliated with Greg Lloyd Smith.

The article should quote the response from Baou about RadMan in the interests of NPOV (including all views means including theirs too).<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 05:52, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but make it NPOV - the article has changed considerably, so that the original reason for the RfD certainly does not apply any more. However, the current version is so anti-QuakeAID that it also raises questions about NPOV. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 13:51, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, if it is fraudulent then the owner will just re-create it in a few months and it might not get noticed for long enough for someone to donate.

<li><b>Comment</b> The FBI state on Wednesday that "False Web sites have been established that pretend to be legitimate relief organizations asking for donations - one of which contains an embedded Trojan exploit that can infect your computer with a virus if accessed." Under the circumstances, I don't think we should be providing a clickable link to any organization claiming to provide tsunami relief unless it's on a well-vetted list (like the USAID list). The last time I tried to sanitize a link to a dodgy organization—a diploma mill—I was beaten bloody and retired in defeat. <b>Does retaining this article means retaining a clickable link to QuakeAID?</b> Will those who vote "keep" accept the link being tagged "nowiki" or does keeping the article mean keeping a working, intact link? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:49, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: I voted to keep, but I agree that we shouldn't provide clickable links. The article was probably created to increase visibility of a dubious organization. Since direct links appear to affect things like Google's page rank, I'm against providing a working link in this case.

<li><b>Comment</b>:in all of this meandering discssion I have yet to see the QuakeAid or Baoutrust representative offer any evidence about their past contributions to charities, or how they have spent any of the monies they have collected since 1998 in Quake relief. Would the person from QuakeAid care to provide this forum with any links to such evidence? Such a simple action would quickly move this discussion forward, I would think. (Comment left unsigned.)
<ul>
<li>They've been oddly silent. Usually people who try to promote a business or POV, and see the article get NPOVed before their eyes, get quite upset and try to revert or delete the article, often saying they're "withdraw ing their permission" to use the material they contributed under GFDL. Either the QuakeAid people have cut their losses and given up, which is <i>unusually</i> sensible, or just possibly this is the calm before the litigious storm. Rhobite is right: we need to be very careful to keep the article NPOV. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:06, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: This ain't yellow pages, it ain't the guide to helping people who have been earthquaked. We don't give recommendations and endorsements. QuakeAID's domain figured in a WIPO case that set a precedent, which makes it encyclopedic. QuakeAID is, for better or worse, listed as a foreign disaster relief organization by at least one US Federal government agency, which makes it encyclopedic. If you think the content of the entry is bad, perform a cleanup.

<li>What makes something "encyclopaedic" is that it is treated comprehensively in an encyclopaedia. Please don't encourage the use of "encyclopaedic" as a synonym for "notable", because as is clear to anyone who owns a dictionary it isn't one.

<dd>Yes, I noted that you avoided "notable" by employing what you take to be a synonym.

<dd>From <a href="../../../e/n/c/Wikipedia%7EEncyclopedic_889f.html" title="Wikipedia:Encyclopedic">Wikipedia:Encyclopedic</a>: "Articles need to be of sufficient <b>importance</b> to be included in Wikipedia.

<dd>My reading of <a href="../../../e/n/c/Wikipedia%7EEncyclopedic_889f.html" title="Wikipedia:Encyclopedic">Wikipedia:Encyclopedic</a> is that the <i>subject matter</i> does have a bearing on whether an article is encyclopedic.</dd>
<dd>Here in VfD we don't (or shouldn't) judge <i>article content</i> so much as whether an <i>article</i> has encyclopedic potential. I disagree that I misuse the term. The encyclopedic criterion <i>does</i> support a more general equivalence of your own restrictive application of the term "notable", although there is rather more to it than a synonym. As a mergist I'm keenly aware that many <i>subjects</i>, while they may have little or no encyclopedic potential, at least for the time being, can be covered very well within <i>articles</i> on more general <i>subjects</i>. VfD is where we make such decisions on an article-by-article basis. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:03, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The result of the debate was keep as redirect. Despite the large number of votes to delete, I am exercising my discretion as the closer of this discussion. The redirect is consistent with the VfD decision on <a href="../../../q/u/a/QuakeAID_76cd.html" title="QuakeAID">QuakeAID</a> above. Since the two companies are closely linked, I consider this a much better outcome. It directs readers to a fact-based page about a suspicious entity. I strongly believe that, had the other voters returned to this discussion thread after the changes to the QuakeAID article and after seeing that this article was redirected to it, they would have amended their votes. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:26, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 6 clear delete votes (two by users not signed in), 6 clear keep votes, one redirect and one that I could not interpret. Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, the article defaults to keep.</p>
<p>Noting that voters for both keep and delete raised concerns with the maintenance of this article, I am adding the clean-up tag. I also believe that their concerns justify the retention of the "factual accuracy" tag for now. If those concerns are not able to be resolved in a reasonable amount of time, it may be appropriate to renominate this article for deletion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:40, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>You shouldn't blank a page just because you don't like the contents, and I have therefore resurrected it. I vote <b>keep</b> based on the fact that (a) there is a generally accepted neutral definition of what it is to be <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservatism_%28United_States%29_3379.html" title="Neoconservatism (United States)">Neoconservative</a>, so one can check the inclusion of any of the names; (b) lists of people by political belief are acceptable and indeed there are many of them; (c) the list can be useful if it is checked and supported. That does not mean that I think the article as it stands now is all right - it needs a thorough check and copyedit to remove POV. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 23:49, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I am <b>abstain</b>ing for now because while the current list does not define what is and isn't neoconservative, I see potential encyclopedic value in a list of self-professed neoconservatives, which at least has an objective basis for inclusion. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 23:59, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Maybe I'll be seen as pushing some kind of hobby horse, but is there really a problem with this kind of list? We have other lists of people defined on fairly loose grounds.

<li>Now I'm aware that just because someone is described by someone else as a neoconservative, does not mean that the label is a reasonable one to apply to that person.

<ul>
<li>The definition of neoconservative is subjective. And unlike having a list of words that start with c, every name on there is disputable and thus removable in an edit conflict. Whereas, the article of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservatives.html" title="Neoconservatives">neoconservatives</a> can cite sources of the definition and illustrate its history, the list has no such potential. In a best case scenario, the list of neoconservatives would be just a copy and paste of the neoconservatives article. I don't believe anyone can legitimately argue how a single person can stay on that list without a never-ending dispute. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownman40_16e4.html" title="User:Brownman40">Brownman40</a> 00:17, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>I have moved the page to a location that I consider to be more appropriate for this kind of list. That someone is a neoconservative is very difficult to verify if he himself says he isn't. That someone is called a neoconservative, and by whom, and with what criteria (if any), is verifiable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:24, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I did a quick query of List of liberals. What if we went down that road? I really want us to find consensus on this topic and not have it be a political debate. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownman40_16e4.html" title="User:Brownman40">Brownman40</a> 00:38, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not a political debate as far as I'm aware. I have moved the list to a more suitable location. Most of the people on the list whom I checked (see above) seemed to have been described as neoconservatives by reasonably credible commentators on verifiable grounds. I see that you're still blanking large amounts of the page, but I won't get into a war over this. Can we agree as common ground that close association with an organisation such as <a href="../../../p/n/a/PNAC_a34d.html" title="PNAC">PNAC</a> tends to cause political commentators to describe someone as an ideologically neoconservative thinker? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:45, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(Again, editing may continue while a page is on VfD. This does not constitute blanking.) And no, it is not agreed upon common ground that close "association" with PNAC (whatever that means) is a definition for being a neoconservative. That allegation is akin to me saying that members of the Democratic Party are liberals. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownman40_16e4.html" title="User:Brownman40">Brownman40</a> 01:14, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

I ask if we can agree that close association with PNAC (eg working for them, speaking on their behalf, being a member in any capacity) is likely to cause people to describe someone as ideologically neoconservative. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:22, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>PNAC's mission: The Project for the New American Century is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to a few fundamental propositions: that American leadership is good both for America and for the world; that such leadership requires military strength, diplomatic energy and commitment to moral principle; and that too few political leaders today are making the case for global leadership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Only if neoconservatism was defined as above, (which it is not in our article) would I support your proposal. Currently, your proposal would not suffice as the definition of neoconservatism does not fit with PNAC's mission.</p>

<p>Well you listed it above yourself. That is what many people mean when they say "neoconservative." The proposal that US dominance is good for the USA and good for the world, and the proposal to pursue dominance by military means. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:42, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>One thing that disturbs me greatly is that you continue to claim that your editing was not "blanking", yet at one point you removed every single name from the list.

<li>You still don't seem to get it. Those names were deleted because they were unverifiable. Your claims of blanking are back-door attempts to suppress editing.

<dd>I know nothing of the sort. I am seeing people whose entries in Wikpedia have described them as neconservatives without controversy. Here you come in, mob-handed, and decide that the description is "unverifiable." These people exist and have been credibly described as necons.

<ul>
<li>definition of neoconservative on Wikipedia (IMO, badly written. Italics are my comments).</li>
</ul>
<p>Neoconservatism is a somewhat controversial term referring to the political goals and ideology of the "new conservatives" in the United States.</p>
<p><i>That sure explains a lot. [/sarcasm]</i></p>
<p>Compared to other U.S. conservatives, neoconservatives are characterized by an aggressive stance on foreign policy, a lesser social conservatism, and lesser dedication to a policy of minimal government. The "newness" refers either to being new to American conservatism (often coming from liberal or socialist backgrounds) or to being part of a "new wave" of conservative thought and political organization.</p>
<p><i>Does not fit with PNAC's mission. PNAC does not state anything in its mission regarding a "lesser social conservatism" or a "lesser dedication to minimal government. Furthermore, PNAC does not state that it is unilateral (mentioned in the article) and its mission does emphasize diplomacy, which pokes holes at the "aggresive foreign policy" theory.</i></p>

<p>I think you're straining a bit too hard here. Diplomacy is <i>part</i> of foreign policy. You say that PNAC "does not state anything in its mission regarding 'lesser social conservatism'". Nobody has claimed that it did. I'm asking you if you recognise that a close association with PNAC is likely to cause commentators to describe someone as ideologically neoconservative. This list isn't about who is and who isn't a neoconservative, it's about people who are often deescribed as neoconservatives. I'm looking for common ground. Please stop trying to turn it into as debate about who is and who is not a neocon. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:14, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I understand Tony you're looking for common ground, but I disagree that a member of PNAC equating to a neoconservative is common ground per the current definition. The conclusion that PNAC membership equates to neoconservatism is invalid unless we are about to say that being a member of the Democratic Party means you're a liberal. The word usage "people who are described a neoconservative" is merely a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel word</a> and does not change the dynamics of this debate. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownman40_16e4.html" title="User:Brownman40">Brownman40</a> 02:28, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>You'll have to take this up with whoever else edits the page. I've tried to explain to you that a criterion for someone being called a neoconservative isn't the same as a criterion for someone being a neoconservative. I fail to see how the statement that someone (who is described as being a neoconservative) is described as being a neoconservative is a weasel phrase. They either are or are not described as being a neoconservative. This is verifiable, you can find who said it and look into the circumstances in which he said it and the reasons he gave. Then you put that into an article and you have a list that will be useful in people who have their own ideas about what they think neoconservatism is and can evaluate it accordingly. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:35, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Please Delete</b>. As someone who attempted for a few months to remove ridiculous assertions of people who are simply not neoconservatives, I certainly vote for deletion. People in the discussion are trying to get into political debates rather than simply looking to see who is a self-identified as, or frequently externally identified as (through legitimate sources), a neoconversative. The page is useless and damaging to the wikipedia. There is an obsession with the PNAC association (however loose) and the Iraq war that many people cannot get over with. [Weasel word] fits this problem perfectly. Sure, you can find people who call Dr. Rice a neocon, but you can also find idiots who call bill clinton a socialist. Is bill clinton debatedly a socialist??? This page should be revisited in 5-10 years. --Jesse

<li>While I think the page should be deleted, I disagree that it is impossible to have a list of people who are verifiably neoconservative. Wolfowitz, Perle, Charles Krauthammer, Irving and Bill Kristol, Francis Fukuyama, John Bolton, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Robert Kagan, and a select bunch of others are DEFINETELY neoconservatives. One problem is that the neoconservatives are a small movement that is decades old, and it is not a broad and consistent political philosophy. The other problem is that many of the editors are attaching a moral judgement to the term (as a codeword for a "cabal" that has taken over the Bush Administration and American foreign policy) and hence - deliberately or subconciously - are trying to label anyone associated with the Bush administration as a neoconservative. So instead of looking to see which legitimate sources have called someone a neoconservative, people on the page are trying to disect the neocon philosophy (which is broad and inconsistent, as to be expected from a diverse group of people spanning decades) themselves and try to determine if an individual is a neocon. Delete the page and if someone is a neoconservative, put it in their page with a description of references to who and why they are called that. --Jesse</li>
