<li><b>Comment</b>. I've heard this before, it may be reasonably well known. I found one site which had a description of the puzzle and added the link to the article.

<dd>Guess I was a bit too hasty. Having now actually read through it I have to say that I'm not convinced that it's quite correct&#160;:) The point of the example is that the scam artist can always offer you the same bet regardless of the colour of the card he flips up. But he'll offer you a win in the cases where the two-coloured card is the one selected. Since the odds are 2/3 that the card is actually single-coloured you only have a 1/3 chance of winning. I think&#160;:) - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 20:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b>This is a fairly standard example used in probability theory to demonstrate some fundamental concepts, like a riddle because of its relatively unintuitive results, but not quite a riddle.

<dd>Wow, this changes everything. Heraclesprogeny, I've only skimmed the new article, but it looks like great writing! Not encyclopedic style, but that might be fixable.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. It's a nice example, but I'm afraid it's not encyclopaedic enough. I'm all in favour of short examples to explain key concepts, but this is a bit too long and more text book material. By the way, I didn't read and think it over carefully but it seems to me the conclusion is wrong. I think that if a card is chosen at random, and then either side is also chosen at random, and this side turns out to be green, then the probability of the chosen card to be the doubly-green one is 2/3, but the article says it's 1/2. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 13:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Changed vote from <i>weak delete</i> to <i>delete</i> because it has no references, making it original research, as pointed out by Melchoir. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:36, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Abstain</b>. Changing again as the article is still being edited and some clues to references have been found (see talk page). I still think that it is not encyclopaedic enough, but it's approaching the gray area so I don't feel comfortable deleting it while it is being worked on. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 10:19, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> as original research (not to mention wrong). Sorry, Heraclesprogeny, but I've read it through and I can't imagine that you found a reference that would make the claim "Thus, there are only two possible cards, double green-faced or purple/green-faced, and each has an equally likely probability of being the one you chose". The whole point of the example is that this argument doesn't work. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 19:49, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Hmm Haukur suggests the artle (newly written) is now incorrect. Perhaps he is right. But this seems a discussion for the talk page, and helpful to get right. This seems a basis to improve and fix the article, and not a basis to delete. And meanwhile, I shall not bet my salary!

<dd>I would agree with fixing the article, except that we are not in the business of <i>doing</i> our own mathematics around here. Ideally someone would come up with a reference, but pending that, it's all just original research. I feel justified in beating this dead horse not just because it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy</a>, but because the current article is a cautionary example of what can happen when even well-meaning, intelligent, and thoughtful contributors ignore that policy. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 04:09, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You all make valid points. When writing, I was afraid it was lengthy and a bit too "text book", and I didn't include any refs. because, at the time of writing, I wasn't using any. This is all learnt material and <b>not</b> original in any way, but I couldn't produce any references pertaining to the exact question. Any first-year text would do as reference for the rest. I thought this to be a good example because it illustrates so many fundamental and often overlooked points. Incidentally, I have attached a short paragraph at the bottom of the article for those who still have questions about the answer. I will try to dig up some references soon, but understand if it must be deleted. Thank you for your patience as this is my first effort at contributing to this valuable resource.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's been stated the article is wrong, but it's better to say it's ambiguous. No mention is made of whether the person will offer the same bet if another color shows. If the same bet is made irregardless of color (then modulo other possible ambiguities), then obviously the bet is not 50/50 as stated, since 2/3 of the time you will get a card with both sides the same color. This is similar to the "What are the odds that the other child is also a boy" question (or whatever that is called). That one is much more famous by the way, having been popularized by Martin Gardner, Marilyn Vos Savant, etc, with plenty of literature and references. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 17:13, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What the host would have done if the other color had shown is an interesting thought experiment, but it doesn't affect the answer to the question, which is quite unambiguous. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 19:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure it does. If the host offers the bet only when one color shows, then it's 50/50, but if the host offers the bet always, then you should bet the other side is the same color. The situation is ambiguous precisely because we are not told the host's intentions. And the intentions <i>do</i> make a big difference. If for some reason, you don't believe me, you can try repeated trials yourself and see: draw a card out and then guess the opposite color shown. Do this, say, 25 times. Now try this again (same number of times) but always guess the same color as shown. Now finally, start over again but every time you draw a card and see purple, put it back in the hat, shake it up, and try it again until you see green. Then guess your color (it doesn't matter, since now it is even odds). --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 21:02, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you weren't a mathematician I would just give up right now, but perhaps there is hope. Forget about the host. We draw from the hat a large number of times. True or false: of the draws when we see red, 2/3 of the time, the other side is red. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 21:19, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Uh, you mean green or purple, right? Your true false question shows that you're not getting the point of my comments - that it's important to state the host's intentions. This is quite standard fare. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 21:33, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I think I see what you're saying now. In my previous response, I somehow assumed that when drawing a green/purple card, you would draaw it showing green. So your point is that when the host only offers the bet when green is shown, 2/3 of the time the other side is green. Well, ok.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes I'm changing my vote again, too. Shows the process works. The version as of now, with input form several editors, has clear references, and we don't need to debate 1/2 versus 2/3 as editors. The references quoted are clear that the answer is 2/3.

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for the corrections. Must say I'm a little embarrassed that I made such an obvious mistake. When I saw the question and saw it was up for deletion I felt it would be a shame to lose such a nice example, at least I was right on that! By the way, I changed the colours from the original "white and red faces" because some people read much more into these things than they should. Cheers.
