<p>A POV attempt to portray the European Union as a country with its own culture, geography, education system, sports, etc, in a similar way to the article Life in the United States. All the information here is already discussed in <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> and many other articles. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Watts_14b9.html" title="User:Jeff Watts">JW</a> 11:57, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, there's no false or unverifiable information, the subject matter is certainly notable, and it doesn't say that the EU is a country of its own. Europe does have its own culture, geography etc, at least to a certain extent. And while the integration process continues, this becomes more and more of an issue (at least hopefully). - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 12:03, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Europe may have its own culture and geography, but the European Union doesn't. There's no such thing as "life in the European Union", people in Sweden, Italy or Ireland live in different countries. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Watts_14b9.html" title="User:Jeff Watts">JW</a> 12:11, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course it does. And the people in Sweden, Italy and Ireland all have the common denominator of being citizens of the EU (both officially and in practice), and everything that the article states applies to them. And you must see yourself how odd it sounds to claim that there's no life in the European Union. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 12:21, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not what I said. And it is simply not true to say that the member states of the EU have a collective culture or sports that are separate from that of the rest of Europe. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Watts_14b9.html" title="User:Jeff Watts">JW</a> 12:38, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> – it is an emerging topic. Although this article can not be exactly compared with Life in the United States, a comprehensive article about the “life” in different countries of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> is perhaps not out-of-place. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 15:06, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge or delete.</b> <b><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a></b>, and I would certainly recommend merging or deleting the US equivalent as well. All of this should be mentioned or refered to in article like <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. It's basically an impressionistic article topic that is utterly impossible to clearly define and delimit. It could reasonably include everything from <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentarism.html" title="Parliamentarism">parliamentarism</a> to <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knitting.html" title="Knitting">knitting</a> and can't be limited to just human activities. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 15:44, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Nowhere in the article does it imply the EU is a country or a monolithic culture. The article is merely a set of summaries of pages about the European Union and its various human and social aspects, all of which are notable. Merging with <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> (which deals primarily with its institutional and technical aspects) is not a good idea as that page is already too long. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 16:02, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I certainly don't think the EU has any monolithic identity beyond the overt structures, but I don't think this article contradicts that, and I don't really see it as POV. It clearly shows how the EU - a notable supranational body - influences these areas of life, as distinct from how it functions as an organisation in itself. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">AlexTiefling</a> 16:20, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why do we need a separate article with a fairly confusing and non-encyclopedic scope and title for this? Why can't this be elaboreated on in <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> or articles like <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_in_the_European_Union_c5c3.html" title="Sports in the European Union">sports in the European Union</a>? "Life in XXX" can mean anything and nothing and seems rather to serve some sort of diffuse <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiPortal_cb01.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiPortal">portal</a>-like function as a link to various "XXX in region/country/union Y"-articles. We have portals, we have articles for the countries, regions, unions, etc., yet for some reason we need yet another article to explain this with far fuzzier terms. Very few readers would probably ever look for this kind of information in this kind of article. This seems to be more about pleasing ourselves rather than non-participating readers. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 16:41, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - There is not such thing as "life in the European Union" in a way that there could be "life in Denmark" or "life in Ireland". "Life in the European Union" suggests that citizens of the different member states are part of a single community, the way that nations or towns are. That is POV, as well as untrue, and isn't the kind of approach WP should take on a controversial subject. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Watts_14b9.html" title="User:Jeff Watts">JW</a> 21:12, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's arguably POV to claim that EU membership has no communal value, as you are doing. Please don't use VfD to promote your point of view on European politics. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">AlexTiefling</a> 15:58, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are some POV problems (the various treaties aren't discussed in a historical and political context--few of them have been without controversy). The effects of membership of the Council of Europe and the European Free Trade Area, even the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schengen_Agreement_6d60.html" title="Schengen Agreement">Schengen Agreement</a>, are neglected.

<ul>
<li>It's too bad that the motivation got hung up on the POV, because that's simply not the issue here. The point is that the article is basically a mirror of a bunch of other articles and nothing that anyone would ever search for if wanting this kind of information. It's just as pointless as the US equivalent. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 09:39, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Although there is a clearly defined 'Europe' region which includes non-EU nations such as Norway and Switzerland, it's easy enough to see that one can refer to the EU as a region, identical with the union of the areas of its member states. Such a region includes Tahiti and not Switzerland, but it's still a well-defined region. Otherwise, how are expressions like 'Entering the EU' (of travellers) meaningful?<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">AlexTiefling</a> 15:58, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
