<li>According to the article, it does sound like what would be the equivalent of a high school in India. It really would be nice to keep this article to reduce systemic bias. The question though is whether it's verifiable.

<li>Would you say the same if I wrote a stub about my house? Or my cat? The article is not nominated because it's a stub, it's nominated because the subject is fundamentally inappropriate for an encyclopedia. However much time this article is given, and however wonderful a description of an ordinary school it becomes, it will still be a description of an ordinary school, and encyclopedia articles are not the same thing as school prospectuses. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:33, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> by the nominator. I'm starting to find this quite amusing: I as the nominator didn't mention anything about the notability of the school and neither did anyone of the people who suggested delete. However, most of the people in support of keeping the article do so on the basis that the school is notable. I cannot conclude anything other than that they haven't read what was written before they stated their suggestion of what to do with this article, which goes explicitly against the instructions that accompany AfDs. Hence, for this reason and also for the reason that notability isn't part of the set criteria for articles about schools, I strongly urge the closing nominator the disregard all the "keeps" based solely on notability. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 01:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Koffieyahoo, may I request you to elaborate on the reason for your nomination then. You had written a reason about it being a primary school, which you have since struck. You point to WP:NOT which is very generic. There are many other school articles here. Can you explain how this one fits into WP:NOT and the others dont? -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush">Lost</a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 03:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You provide a non-argument for inclusion, every article should be evaluated for its own merit. However, all the other almost empty school articles which basically only provide the location of the school plus some info on former head masters/teachers and the curriculum shouldn't be here either for exactly the same reason, but it is "not done" in this community to nominate them all at once. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 04:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I understand this correctly, the article is up on AFD because its a stub? Weren't most featured articles started as stubs at one point of time? If having very little info is the reason for afd, I would still recommend <b>keeping</b> the article to allow time for organic growth. -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush">Lost</a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:56, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It's a directory entry, and, yes, currently also a stub. Moreover, at the moment it also lacks any references to any non-trivial published works, which is extemely important in the context of any encyclopedia. Also, AfDs are about the current merits of articles, not about what they can potentially be in the future. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 05:11, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

If lack of references is a concern, {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-verify_e98c.html" title="Template:Cleanup-verify">cleanup-verify</a>}} is the tag to add (point no. 10).

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not worried at all about the existence of the school, what I am worried about is getting the article above the level of a directory entry. Personally, I don't see that this will happen by the simple lack of reliable, verifiable sources on any other information added. That's also why I sent it to AfD and have not just tagged it appropriately. I thought this would have been clear implicitly, but apparently not. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 08:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
