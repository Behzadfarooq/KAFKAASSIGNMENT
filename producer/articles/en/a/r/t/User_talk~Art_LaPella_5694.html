<p>Your comment on deuterium makes some sense, but mostly suggests that the article on Big Bang needs more detail in some places. The use of the word "universe" as having more helium includes gas clouds that have little but hydrogen and helium in them, and so are assumed not to have been processed in stars, as well as planets such as Jupiter that are mostly hydrogen and helium, but as is well known with modest complements of material processed in stars. Yet I do not think you could be right if you assume all the material in Jupiter or Saturn had been processed inside a star. Low mass stars produce mostly more helium, and as you go up in mass you can produce the heavier elements, but you destroy the helium. I guess what I am saying is that the primordial (pre galaxy formation) abundance of helium appears to be about 25%, as determined from unprocessed gas clouds, the oscillations of RR-Lyrae stars, and other data such as the compositions of very low mass stars that never ignited (brown dwarfs) and the gaseous planets (with corrections for the inclusion of some matter pre-processed in stars, but not a majority of the matter, and with corrections for differential escape of gases during planetary formation.) The first big contribution was actually by Bob Christy (of Caltech) - reference: Title: A Study of Pulsation in RR Lyrae Models Author: Christy, Robert F. Journal: Astrophysical Journal, vol. 144, p.108 Publication Date: 04/1966</p>
<p>who found a 30% helium abundance for these stars which are thought (from their very low metal abundance and location in the halo of the galaxy) to be mostly unprocessed primordial matter in their outer parts, which control the oscillation. (The inner parts provide the energy and would have more helium, but they are just the energy source, and the production rate does not vary appreciably) (think of a tractor engine with a flap over the exhaust. The flap oscillates up and down not because the power varies, but due to gas dynamics and the dynamics of the flap). Later work corrected Christy's values closer to 25%.</p>
<p>Nice to see a fellow mainly in investments has such broad interests and provocative questions. Hope I helped. <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 04:53, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nice addition to set up a link! Thanks. One has, of course, to allow that supernova blasts are in the broad sense steller nucleosynthesis sites - all the heavy elements come from there. <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 00:14, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your concern and your contribution. It has only been a couple of days but (maybe it's my imagination) it seems that the editing traffic has gone down thanks to your notice. The problem during these past few weeks and since this link became part of the Mainpage header is that it's new visibility has given rise to a whole host of ideas to expand its content which is exactly the opposite of its intended purpose. I'm pretty sure you understand the concept of keeping this page short, simple and readable for our newest visitors and users. --<a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 19:34, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing me to the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Dispute resolution page</a>. I had already been through some of them, but not exhaustively. I've certainly had dialog with Joshuaschroeder, inititated a Request for Comments in the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Talk%7EPlasma_cosmology_bb1b.html" title="Talk:Plasma cosmology">Plasma cosmology talk page</a>, had third parties look at the discussions, suggested a survey (that he declined) on the Electric Universe talk page. All that, together with the points I mention in my <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Joshuaschroeder" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Request for arbitration</a> led me to what I felt was a last resort.

<dd>Hi, Art, I saw your comments in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_mediation_Plasma_cosmology_b8d4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Plasma cosmology">Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Plasma cosmology</a>. You wrote <i>I don’t know the science well enough to make an independent judgment of the issues here</i>. For me, one of the saddest things about this and other disputes is that I and other knowledgeable volunteers are being obstructed (due to lack of time) from adding <i>new WP content</i> explaining important scientific issues in cosmology and gravitation theory, which in my view tend to be much more subtle and interesting than the often semi-imaginary issues raised in newsgroup discussions or elsewhere on the web. I wish that intelligent laypersons understood this much better, and I believe that the only way to rectify the situation is to make available readable, accurate, timely, well-informed and fair summaries in a venue such as WP. Indeed, WP should be an ideal venue for doing this due to the convenience of wikisoftware! Unfortunately, I feel that the political structure of classic Wikipedia <i>obstructs serious editors</i> because resolving disputes like this one take way, way too much of our time. Sigh... <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 05:09, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't feel "obstructed (due to lack of time) from adding new WP content", nor do "resolving disputes like this one take way, way too much of [my] time" except in the sense that Wikipedia in general may take too much of my time. If I were <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy__Jimbo__Wales_0579.html" title="Jimmy &quot;Jimbo&quot; Wales">Jimbo</a> I would make Wikipedia less democratic. But since I'm not, I give however much time to trying to resolve edit wars as I feel productive, and if you look at my contributions you'll see I do a lot of other noncontroversial stuff. My introverted personality is much better suited for cleaning up details than for leadership, although I might take credit for the December lull in this edit war. When somebody says something obviously wrong I call them on it, though not the last few days due to IRS season. I'm not real sold on your proposal to start over and do things your way - you assume that everyone would suddenly stop arguing, but it seems more likely to just give them more issues to argue. The underlying philosophical issue is this: Is either side so wonderful that it justifies opposing the other side even when they're right? And if so, how does that make them better than creationists, who are despised by both sides, although most any religion promotes a moral code that science depends on? If both sides were encouraged to try to be right, they might learn to prefer trying to be right to being loyal, and then they would be real scientists regardless of what conclusions they came to. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 06:27, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In general, baryogenesis refers to the time when electrons and positrons decoupled from the field. This nominally occurs in the lepton era. It's not to say that baryons weren't around before then. There are disagreements as to what "baryogenesis" really means, but the article (rightly, in my opinion) emphasizes B-L number asymmetry occuring as the general definition. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 19:35, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, now that we have all agreed to do it on the Wiki, I have intiated the next step which is an intial statement to see where we all stand. Just state your point of view on the issues at hand without making references to others or the conduct of them. Just to let you know, I have been reading over the talk page and will address the concern of needing a person who understands plasma comology. I feel after reading it, I have a pretty good grasp of it as I am pretty good in science. However, the issues seem to extend beyond just simple right and wrong on the issue but rather into what should be included and where we should draw the line. I hope, as mediator, to rectify these differences and to reach a consensus. As a last note, I suggest you put the mediation page on your watchlist as I will not always give messages like this.

<dd>Well, OK. The first thing I would have done is to toughen up this language that occurs 26 times, once for each letter: "Wikipedia policy requires that material must be verifiable and supported by citations. Please provide citations for all new additions, and help us find citations for existing entries". Language like "or it will be reverted" would give contributors fair warning that they are going to a lot of work for nothing if they don't provide citations. It should appear 26 times, and also at the top, because most contributors' edit summary starts with the letter name of the paragraph they edited, showing that they wouldn't read something at the top. It seems a shame that we can't use "plate smasher", for instance, because Google says Greeks really are occasionally called plate smashers, but I can't think of a good way to turn that into a policy. It's technically possible to link to a Google search, but it wouldn't look like anything else I've seen on Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would also put something like this on the talk page:"We are suspending new contributions without citations, at least until Primetime returns so he can provide the citations." Perhaps you would prefer not to invite Primetime to go back to the way it was, but you did express unease at taking advantage of the block. The language on his talk page makes his return seem uncertain. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 20:37, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You changed Melinde to Malindi, but I changed it back, since Melinde is how the land was known at the time and, more important, it is how Camões referes to it. The link still goes to Malindi, so I think there is no harm. If someone wants to know what land it is, they can just click and they will see that it is Malindi. For example, Calicut goes to the Kozhikode article. I think there is no harm done in having the names by which the poet referres to the lands. Thank you.

<dd>Sorry about the confusion. As for you improving Os Lusíadas, I coulden't be happier. Regarding the italics, I did used them, but I was working on Word, since sometimes when I write directly in Wikipedia, I have to confirm some words and I lose all the job I did. When I passed it from Word to wikipedia, some of the italics were gone. About my «and» sign (I'm assuming it is the one above "...and, most...",and not from the article (if it is, please do correct it)) I used it that way because of how I use "e" in portuguese, and I don't know the rules of the english language, I'm only 14).

I understand that the Portuguese people are presumably as proud of this epic as we Americans are proud of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence_f3f2.html" title="United States Declaration of Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a>, but notice that article doesn't say anything like: "The heroic, victorious patriots liberated their fatherland from the yoke of tyranny." It isn't easy to tell if it was written by an American or an Englishman. Similarly, it isn't easy to tell if <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Waterloo_202f.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> was written by an Englishman or a Frenchman. That's what all Wikipedia articles are supposed to be like - see <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms</a>.

<p>About the «» in my country that is the same as "". Change it if you want to. About the tone, etc., they aren't mine, I just translated thie article, nothing more, I didn't edited it. You can make it more neutral. I asked a portuguese user that is in wikipedia longer than me and is interested in articles related to the country, but i still have to see his answer. you could ask someone that may have a more neutral point of view. Cheers.</p>

<dd>I don't usually do Point Of View edits, but you'll see I gave it a try anyway. A big thing I did to tone down the point of view was to change some comments into quotes, so Camoes' writing isn't confused with undisputed fact. So please make sure that I didn't attribute any words or ideas to Camoes that he didn't actually say.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I looked at the Portuguese Wikipedia version, so I can see what you did (I can guess about half the words because they resemble other Romance languages and because I just read your English version). I then saw the word translated as "canyons", and used an Internet translator to correct it to "cannons". Similarly, I think "fecund" (which means often having children) should be "eloquent" although most Internet translators couldn't translate that word at all. Most of my English language edits were simply reading your version and substituting something that sounds more normal. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 23:24, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia software makes it look as if I rewrote several paragraphs completely. Actually, I never changed more than a few words at a time, which is my usual editing practice. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 23:29, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you. I removed the quote marks in the paragraph that says "Since Viriathus..." since the paragraph is only explaining what Camões was saying in his verses, and wrote "In these strophes Camões tells us that since Viriathus...". About the "Theis history proves it" part, I put "Jupiter says that their history proves it...". I used "Makes you [this] favour the Supreme/" since mercê is closer to <i>favour</i> than <i>recognize</i>. Thank you for your support.</p>

<dd>The previous <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permissiveness.html" title="Permissiveness">permissiveness</a> link goes to a disambiguation page. Yesterday, permissiveness was a redirect to <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Spock_c797.html" title="Benjamin Spock">Benjamin Spock</a>. So while reviewing what someone did to my redirect, I changed links to permissiveness to a paragraph of Benjamin Spock that discusses the word permissiveness. I wouldn't revert to a link to the disambiguation page which doesn't explain the word much. There's no Wiktionary entry for permissiveness, so an alternative would be to remove the link altogether. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 22:25, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Art, I don't think we've ever interacted before but ever since I started editing the Main Page again I keep noticing your name popping up everywhere.

<dd>I would like to be nominated if the main purpose is WP:ERRORS, presumably so I can fix typos on the main page without waiting for an administrator. However, when I read the RfA page, it seems to take it for granted that I would be expected to take charge of arguments and decide who should be blocked or banned. That wouldn't fit my personality very well, although I have often sniped at unreasonable talk page behavior. I am involved in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pseudoscience_f6ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience</a> but not as a primary antagonist.

<dd>In my experience, as long as you have a clear and credible reason that you want admin privileges, people go on to the next question. However, in all honesty, I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into some opposes based on a lack of edits to the project space, as this is the proxy for knowledge of policies on blocks, deletions, etc (aka the 'typical' admin stuff). I just recommend that you be clear in the RFA what you want the tools for and not get too worked up if people start asking you how you distinguish a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy</a> from a <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">prod</a>.

<dd>Ian is more pernicious than Tommy in some ways because he is more patient and tries to push his non-mainstream POV into mainstream articles and eliminate mainstream crticism from non-mainstream articles while following the other rules to the letter (sometimes to his own detriment as when he broke 3RR because he thought he had a mandate from BLP). He also has made positive contributions to the encyclopedia while Tommy hasn't made any. I think on final evaluation, though, Ian is probably more disruptive than he is helpful. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 18:23, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Art. I notice that you've added yourself to RfAr:ScienceApologist as an involved party. Why there, but not to RfAr:Pseudoscience? I ask because I literally just became aware of your existence - you certainly weren't <i>involved</i> in any of the central issues I enumerated - and if not for <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, you might almost be suspected of following ScienceApologist around and "getting his back", so to speak, rendering just the sort of timely assistance to him that has been so loyally rendered by other "helpful" administrators like Pjacobi and JoshuaZ. I know you probably think that you don't have to explain your behavior, but as a gesture of fairness and good will, would you mind explaining your behavior anyway? I ask because it seems to have an element of POV and thus fails to reflect the punctilious neutrality expected of a Wikipedia administrator.

<dd>It's true that I didn't formally add myself to the list at RfAr:Pseudoscience. I've only looked at one other arbitration last year, and I forget if I said anything. But of course I was involved at RfAr:Psuedoscience, where you made your presence obviously noticeable. So I now act as a somewhat interested party, not trying to take charge as an administrator - indeed, I was approved as an administrator with the idea I would only use my administrator powers on the main page for now. As for the punctilious neutrality that would be expected of such an administrator, I'm pretty sure you aren't the example of it. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 18:29, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw your comment, including your mention of "the ever-shifting standards for verifiability" in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a>.

<dl>
<dd>The talk page says "Please provide citations for all new additions, or they will be reverted", a much higher standard than what is given more than lip service in the rest of Wikipedia. Is that the single standard? In that case, we should immediately delete ABC, Banana, Beaner, Bloke, Bog Wog, Bong, Brown Sahib, and maybe A-rab, and that's just counting the A's and B's. There's a clear enough verbal consensus, but I would be more impressed with it as a consensus if it were put into practice, which would take about 10 minutes. What I see instead is an eternal merry-go-round of words going in and out for reasons that seem to have nothing to do with explicitly stated policy. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 04:46, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't keep a constant watch on the article, but try to go through from time to time to remove unsourced entries. I see you sometimes format or copyedit unsourced entries, which you could as easily delete. When we did the iniital clean-out I left entries that had links to active WP articles. Do you think we should delete those too? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 06:02, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When I think about it, a link to a long WP article (what do you mean active?) is almost as good as a citation. But that distinction hadn't occurred to me before, so I'm glad I didn't get involved in the eternal add and delete cycle while formatting or copyediting unsourced entries. Most of the linked WP articles don't do much more than repeat what is already at List of ethnic slurs, so wikilinking to such an article doesn't prove much. If there is to be any chance of ending the cycle of deleting and re-adding the same words, we could start by changing the 27 warnings to say a wikilink is good enough, or to say a long enough or referenced enough wikilink is good enough, after asking for comments on the talk page. While we're at it, the obscure <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">Newspeak</a> policy of "For the purposes of this list, ethnicity can be defined by either race, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a>, region, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>, or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socioeconomic.html" title="Socioeconomic">socioeconomic</a> class" should be harmonized with the "List of ethnic slurs" title. There would have to be a really vivid line between referenced and unreferenced, between really ethnic and redefined ethnic, to stop people from just routinely re-adding everything as they do now. <a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBig_Bang_8875.html" title="Talk:Big Bang">Talk:Big Bang</a> handles a similar merry-go-round by printing a warning in red. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 06:45, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>If you weren't from Seattle I wouldn't bother asking this and would assume your name was Italian, Romansh or Iberian of some kind. But because you're from Seattle there's a chance your family goes back to pioneer days in the Pacific Northwest and/or you have some Native American bloodlines on the patronymic side....because in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinook_Jargon_a2d8.html" title="Chinook Jargon">Chinook Jargon</a>, <i>la pellah</i> means to roast, as in roast in an oven. It's a native adaptation of <i>le foyer</i>, the French word for the same. So "just asking in case", partly because if you <i>were</i> of a family with a CJ name, you're also likely descended from a Hudson's Bay Company employee and a friend of mine (www.fortlangley.ca) would like to hear from you (her site is partly a descendants-of-HBC-employees meeting space).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 08:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The rules for submitting DYK (Did You Know) nominations are listed at <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template_talk%7EDid_you_know_8ba7.html#Suggestions" title="Template talk:Did you know">Template Talk:Did you know#Suggestions</a>. The relevant passage from that paragraph states "...no more than 5 days old (unless it was under 1000 characters, marked a stub, and has been expanded by at least an additional 1000 characters)". The St. Genevieve Church article was started on December 31, 2006, which is more than 5 days old. The exception for expanding from a short article under 1000 characters doesn't apply because on January 10 the article contained 14,168 characters; furthermore, it wasn't marked as a stub on that date, and the expansion since January 10 has been only 33 characters. (The exact numbers are debatable but you get the idea.) I don't select Did You Know nominations myself, but those are some of the rules used by those who do the selecting.

<p>Hi, Art. Collapsing windows could indicate the presence of a virus or malware on your hard-drive. Main indicators of malware being present can be examined in a HijackThis (<a href="http://www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/files/HijackThis.exe" class="external free" title="http://www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/files/HijackThis.exe" rel="nofollow">http://www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/files/HijackThis.exe</a>) registry scan log. I suggest you revert to Norton AntiVirus at this stage. Update your copy online including the new virus definitions and let it run its course. --<a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoeticbent_b4ab.html" title="User:Poeticbent">Poeticbent</a> <a href="../../../p/o/e/User_talk%7EPoeticbent_45c8.html" title="User talk:Poeticbent"><small><font style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#FF88AF;"><span style="border:1px solid #DF2929;">&#160;talk&#160;</span></font></small></a> 17:49, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, HijackThis isn't very useful, because it states that it lists files the operating system needs along with malware, if any. This is confirmed by its inclusion of much well-known software such as "Toolbar: Norton AntiVirus" among the alleged malware. I reran an Norton AntiVirus scan (which is set to automatically update anyway), but I got the same result. I think a better guess is that the combination of Polish Wikipedia, Netscape, and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_1c6b.html#Editions" title="Windows XP">Windows XP Professional</a> could be incompatible. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 21:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please take a second look at <a href="../../../h/i/j/HijackThis_45b0.html" title="HijackThis">HijackThis</a> before you go any further. Even though, it lists files your operating system needs, it also reveals items that shouldn’t be there, like visited websites etc. You can read about how to make sense of the <i>registry scan log</i> by going to <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/download3155.html" class="external free" title="http://www.majorgeeks.com/download3155.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.majorgeeks.com/download3155.html</a> or better yet, read the tutorial at <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial42.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial42.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial42.html</a> <a href="../../../h/i/j/HijackThis_45b0.html" title="HijackThis">HijackThis</a> helped me once in removing malware from my <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_1c6b.html" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a> Media Eddition.--<a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoeticbent_b4ab.html" title="User:Poeticbent">Poeticbent</a> <a href="../../../p/o/e/User_talk%7EPoeticbent_45c8.html" title="User talk:Poeticbent"><small><font style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#FF88AF;"><span style="border:1px solid #DF2929;">&#160;talk&#160;</span></font></small></a> 21:56, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I spent an hour or two studying things like cookies, and the dire repeated warnings against removing the wrong things. I concluded that you must know a lot more about the operating system than I do, although I do a lot of <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASIC_e4ac.html" title="BASIC">BASIC</a> programming. Several years ago I merely upgraded my Norton Anti-Virus, and I never did get that computer's operating system to stop crashing after that fiasco.

<p>What fiasco do you mean, right-clicking? There's an item in your registry that blocks the new window from popping up. Actually I’m not that much of a geek. It took me days to figure out <a href="../../../h/i/j/HijackThis_45b0.html" title="HijackThis">HijackThis</a> <i>registry scan log</i>. I’m a bit of a neatnick though and I didn’t mind investing the time to learn about the process. I’m no longer sure how I did it, but it did work in the end. My old scan log shows that the files I probably removed looked something like this, at least I'd like to think:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\fwfr\fwfrm.exe</li>
<li>C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\fwfr\fwfra.exe</li>
</ul>
<p>What I remember is that the files I removed looked alien and out of place at a glance. Please, take it one step at a time, Art, and if you’re too busy for that sort of thing, just ignore it. Nothing is going to happen. --<a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoeticbent_b4ab.html" title="User:Poeticbent">Poeticbent</a> <a href="../../../p/o/e/User_talk%7EPoeticbent_45c8.html" title="User talk:Poeticbent"><small><font style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#FF88AF;"><span style="border:1px solid #DF2929;">&#160;talk&#160;</span></font></small></a> 07:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, those files aren't there; about half of them mention Symantec or Norton Anti-Virus. The fiasco means years ago, when Norton's "help" screen suggested removing c:\temp and I believed it. Undeleting helped, but the system never really ran like it did before. I don't have that machine any more. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 20:19, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With regard to the Europa in the listings of the Great Britain Commemorative stamps articles.</p>
<p>Every year each country in the EU issue a set of stamps to mark the European Postal and Telecommunications Conference, each year a subject is chosen and all the countries issue a set of stamps on that subject. All the countries name this issue the 'Europa' stamps, therefore in the context of philately, which the article relates to, Europa is the correct spelling when refering to those sets of stamps. This can be verified by referring to any Stamp Catalogue. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinBoylett_77cc.html" title="User:ColinBoylett">ColinBoylett</a> 20:20, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Europa is the correct spelling. If you read the article, it still says "Europa". All I changed is the wikilink target that comes up if someone clicks the word. Europe is called "Europa" in German and (I think) some other languages, so I understand why Great Britain would have Europa stamps (although I've never seen them in the US). But the question is, why should the wikilink go to the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europa.html" title="Europa">Europa</a> disambiguation page? If "Europa" is to be linked at all, I would think people would want to know that the word means "Europe". That would be more helpful than a disambiguation page listing all the other meanings of the word "Europa", such as <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europa_%28moon%29.html" title="Europa (moon)">Europa (moon)</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europa_%28mythology%29.html" title="Europa (mythology)">Europa (mythology)</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 21:45, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your guess is correct; "Plumb dulcis" is indeed Latin. "Plumbum" means "lead", as in "plumber" and "plumb line". That's why the chemical symbol for lead is "Pb". "Dulcis" means "sweet", as in "dulcimer" or (Italian) "La dolce vita", "the sweet life".<a href="../../../w/r/i/User%7EWrittenright_1ed5.html" title="User:Writtenright">Writtenright</a> 03:27, 8 March 2007 (UTC)Writtenright</p>

<dd>Done. What does this mean: "The square area encircling the canal..."? I don't think the area is a <a href="../../../s/q/u/Square_%28geometry%29.html" title="Square (geometry)">square (geometry)</a> - I think you meant the area in square kilometers. If so, just remove the word "square" which is already implied by the word "area". How does this area encircle the canal? I don't think it makes a circle around the canal. If you meant this area borders the canal, then how can it be meaningful to measure its area to the nearest hundredth of a square kilometer? All of Poland borders the canal, so why did you include only this precisely measured area? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 00:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your invaluable contribution. In response to your question, I believe the area in square kilometers refers primarily to the lakes with their tributaries, which can be measured quite precisely, except that it is neither round nor square. It is the area of the entire watershed as mentioned on UNESCO's website. I changed it accordingly.

<dd>Yes, I understand this version. Here's another problem: The longitude and latitude are in the city of Augustow. But if I move it one <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minute_of_arc.html" title="Minute of arc">minute of arc</a> north, from 53 degrees 51 minutes to 53 degrees 52 minutes north, the location goes into a body of water labeled "Necko", which is presumably the Lake Necko in the article and can be considered part of the actual canal. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 04:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Art. This is great stuff. Thanks again. I’m not sure who Jan Peczkis from amazon.com is, but apparently, he’s a featured reviewer there credited with pages upon pages of reviews (333 to be exact <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746/ref=cm_tr_trl_mr_1261/002-8541713-8034417?ie=UTF8&amp;sort%5Fby=MostRecentReview" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746/ref=cm_tr_trl_mr_1261/002-8541713-8034417?ie=UTF8&amp;sort%5Fby=MostRecentReview" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>) with Reviewer Rank: 1261 on amazon scale, which apparently is closer to the top that it might actually sound <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/top-reviewers.html/ref=cm_aya_bb_tr/002-8541713-8034417?ie=UTF8&amp;aid=A3Q04XXGGED746#A3Q04XXGGED746" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/top-reviewers.html/ref=cm_aya_bb_tr/002-8541713-8034417?ie=UTF8&amp;aid=A3Q04XXGGED746#A3Q04XXGGED746" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.

I’d like to be on the safe side and follow his own choice. It might be just a somewhat coincidental moniker even if it doesn't sound probable, therefore I’m removing the Wiki link to the real person Jan Peczkis with the pseudonym John Woodmorappe. "John Woodmorappe" didn't sign the review. Let's be a little more cautious about accreditation.
