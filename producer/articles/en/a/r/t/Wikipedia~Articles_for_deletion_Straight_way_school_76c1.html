<p>Mostly just finishing incomplete nomination. However, given that the entire content, once the external link and the mission statement from their website is removed, would be "Straight Way School in West Covina, California is an Islamic school and mosque on a single lot. Contact information is as follows: 1912 West Merced Ave West Covina, CA 91790", it seems to lack enough content to be worth keeping. Seems like Cleanup at the bare minimum.

<li>Comment for people who complain about boring mission statements: they aim to "Provide well-planned secular subjects (Math, Science, etc) to the student which protects them from the unethical curriculums." and to "Protect the caravan of the school from any one (hypocrite) who tries to cripple it's noble mission". <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:05, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: At this stage, there is not sufficient sources to verify the school is licensed, or any info about the school. So, it doesn't yet qualify for inclusion.

<li>What does "being licensed" have to do with it? It is verifiable - that is the only criteria for this encyclopedia. WP is not the government.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:29, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If a school is licensed, information about it is collected, monitored, and verified by the government. The government is our reliable source in such a case. We need at an absolute minimum one reliable source of information. The school's web site, is not reliable or impartial. It's a private site. The complete lack of verifiable on information has already caused a problem with editing, since the school's claim to accept regardless of creed is highly dubious, yet we have no way of checking this. A licensed school would have any mandatory admission rules stated in its license (or charter), and we could check what that rule is. In this caes, the school can say anything, and we can't challenge it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 23:47, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That might be the case with claims or details about the school, but that has little, if anything to do with the existence of the article on WP itself (and the point of the AfD process). The website has photos, extensive information which is easily verifiable through a websearch and white page/yellow page listings. If you want to debate the inclusion of it's admission rules or other specifics is not a question appropriate to AfD which deals with the existence of the article itself.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:53, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>An Islamic school in California sounds interesting. So I choose <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHonbicot_fd59.html" title="User:Honbicot">Honbicot</a> 23:38, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>A Google search reveals <a href="http://schools.privateschoolsreport.com/California/WestCovina/StraightWayThe.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://schools.privateschoolsreport.com/California/WestCovina/StraightWayThe.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which lists the schools affiliation as Jewish. No idea if this is erroneous, but I must say that <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a>'s assertion that "It is verifiable - that is the only criteria for this encyclopedia." is basically false, and it is unclear whether he/she is referring to Wikipedia policy for inclusion in general or the more specific <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html#Keep" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Keep</a> referenced above, which is admittedly more open about how/why schools should be added.

<li>Wow, that's an amazing mistake on the part of <a href="http://schools.privateschoolsreport.com/California/WestCovina/StraightWayThe.html" class="external text" title="http://schools.privateschoolsreport.com/California/WestCovina/StraightWayThe.html" rel="nofollow">privateschoolsreport.com</a>. I'll need to double-check articles using them as a "source". This shows the danger of us relying entirely on non-authoritative sources. Also, I have to say, mentioning a place in a <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:JiPDI5QeMOkJ:www.aqmd.gov/tao/FleetRules/1195SchoolBus/R1195%2520ImplementationGuidancev1-1.doc+%22straight+way+school%22&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:JiPDI5QeMOkJ:www.aqmd.gov/tao/FleetRules/1195SchoolBus/R1195%2520ImplementationGuidancev1-1.doc+%22straight+way+school%22&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">bus list</a> is not good enough either.
