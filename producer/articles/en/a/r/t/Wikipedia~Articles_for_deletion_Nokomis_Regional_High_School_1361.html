<li>Actually I agree with Denni. You, Kappa and a couple others have been rather anti-discussion on these. There are some, such as Xoloz, who are willing to discuss it in a civil manner, but going around accusing people of bad faith, WP:POINT, and factionalizing them is rather disappointing to AfD as a whole. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 05:27, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why do you suggest merging or deleting schools, but you skip right past the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_All_Lights_Fucked_on_the_Hairy_Amp_Drooling_69f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling">AFD</a> for an <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Lights_Fucked_on_the_Hairy_Amp_Drooling_ca57.html" title="All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling">album</a> which only sold 32 copies. But it's getting all-keep in it's AFD. Why not suggest merging the album into the band article? There are lots of things less signficant than schools, that are kept on wikipedia, without a fight. I know that "non-notability" isn't the real reason for most delete votes on schools, since many less notable things are safe from deletion. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 08:59, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because I felt like it. You are not required to vote on every single AfD article, and neither am I.

<li>We are voting here based on the encyclopedic nature of this article and its non-notability. As for the album, supposively its by a band thats notable. However, the argument is simply not valid because nothing is inheritly notable - that's why we're here. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 09:02, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's relevent because the band (community) is notable enough to warrant an article. Those with a deep interest in the band (community) wish to delve into the subject by reading about individual albums (schools). They feel that the album (school) is an inherent component of the band (community). Information on every album (school) would clogg up the larger article about the band (community). Plus not all those reading about the band (community) care about every album (school). But the dozens (hundreds or thousands) of people who bought the album (graduated the school) would have great interest in the album (school). Therefore the notability of the band (community) means that every album (school) should also be kept. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:39, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's kind of a fractured analogy. If every album ever published got an article, it might be apt, but they don't. The inclusionists want every school to have an article though, no matter how insignificant and ordinary. As it stands now, some album articles get kept, others get deleted. You can't say that about school articles. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 04:07, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>See #Keep, but briefly, as I understand the arguments, schools are <i>public institutions</i> essential to <i>communities</i> and masses of individuals in their formative years. They are generally <i>fixed in location</i>, and often have <i>long histories</i>. They are likely each to attract substantial <i>communities of interest</i> to WP. I don't firmly agree with these points, but I see some value. My high school, for example, was founded in 1970, with an average class size of 1,000 people. It serves a city of 70,000, each citizen likely to know it. It is known across the entire US state, and well-known by adjacent towns, such that I estimate at least 350,000 people know of it and have reason to search for it. In my state, my school <i>is</i> (or was) average (ie. I looked up class size and campus size when enrolled there, and it was in the middle.) 350,000 potential searchers is good enough, arguably. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 10:27, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do <b>firmly believe</b>, however, that these arguments absolutely distinguish schools from boxes, gyms, bars, factories, and all the other general categories to which the are compared by some here. Generally, most students have at least some interest in their school (if only because they are stuck there in young life when they would rather be outside), and I <i>know</i> most parents have an interest in their children's school. The aggregate community attachment to these places, in my experience, far exceeds community concern for other "buildings," as schools are called here in dimunition by some. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 10:34, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It was sarcastic a bit but it was certainly not an insult (far from it). The whole point of it is a criticism of your and other arguments that are arguments about the type of article it is rather then the article itself. I apoligize if you were offended though&#160;:). Again, the above arguments are about the type of article it is, rather then the article itself, which I do not believe is a valid argument for keeping a specific article&#160;:). <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 13:37, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's true that this is an argument by type. However, for school-supporters, schools are like real towns (which have become notable ipso facto based on an argument by type.) I know that this is controversial, and I don't even know whether or not I agree with it. However, it is, in my view, a <i>reasonable argument to make</i>, and I am slightly frustrated with school-opponents, who I do feel sometimes unduly belittle these arguments from others.</dd>
<dd>The reason I will always vote keep for any real high school is that I recognize at least ~30% of our committed editors enjoy these articles, and embrace a reasonable position to explain their notability. In such a circumstance, with WP operating as a consensus forum, I believe any attempt to delete real high schools is less than useful. It doesn't mean anyone is wrong to so nominate; it doesn't mean their arguments are wrong either. But, in a consensus forum, when a static position of "Let's-agree-to-disagree" is reached, the default is (and should be) to keep. I believe we have reached such a stasis, and I will continue to vote, by type, a default keep on real high schools as a method of conveying my belief in this stasis and the relatively low utility of further dispute. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 13:56, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that those arguments could be applied to any local fast-food place for example - and those kind of articles get purged here easily. Having seperate school articles is a lot like having a seperate article for each mcdonalds outlet - sure a lot of people have worked there - maybe even shaped their lives, so to speak - they have served thousands of people, I'm sure. It sure isn't encyclopedic though, much like most of these school articles. As I've said before there are hundreds of these substubs - all the same, just citing the year and principal of the school - nothing worthwhile about most of them. No parent is going to go here for school information because it will at the very least always be outdated and inaccurate, especially now due to the proliferation of these substubs. More morbidly, if you were to make an article about a teacher at one of these schools it would get speedied quite quickly. Deleting a school is good because it encourages someone to write a better article - as if someone was really to rewrite this they would not use any of the current content most likely. Finally, I can almost garuntee you no one "enjoys" articles like this because there is no real information here - plus its just a line... a line&#160;:). Giving an opinion of a carte blanche keep based on type of these kind of articles is doing much more harm than good because its discouraging useful debate (heated as it may be), giving people the OK sign to write substubs of just about anything with no real information, and in general encourages article creation without any real encyclopedic content. Of course, I could be wrong on all this&#160;:). <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 14:47, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If one could get ~30%+ of committed WPians (after extended debate like we've had on schools for a long time) to agree in general that every McD's is notable, or that Xoloz' nosehair is notable, it would be worthy of inclusion here under my argument (notwithstanding even my own assessment of my nosehair as useless). WPians decide what belongs in WP, and the system exists with a (admirable, IMO) bias that anything with substantial support stays. That is a consequence of the non-majoritarian nature of the process. It is also a geneal guideline not to delete, <i>but to expand</i> when an article on a noteworthy topic is poorly written. I see no reason this guideline is inapplicable to schools, although they be numerous. And lastly, it is, in my view, unknown whether a poor stub or a blank page is more like to motivate a visitor to write a quality article. Some less experienced WPians simply have a "page-creation phobia," but are not afraid to <b>cleanup and expand</b>; I know I was once one of these newbies.&#160;:) <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:08, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
