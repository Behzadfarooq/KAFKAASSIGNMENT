The above comment; nomination "reason" for deletion, and start to this discussion is patently false and misleading.

<p>I think the objectivity of this debate is horribly distorted at best. It appears that the Nysted guy has been met with the same criticism for each Wiki entry -- whether Lee Nysted, NystedMusic, or this current one. Reviewing the deletion discussion forums, it seems the central argument against deletion is that Nysted's group (in whatever form) lacks notoriety/credibility.</p>
<p>Let's look at this objectively. WP:MUSIC defines the following as "central criteria" for inclusion. I've bolded those which Nysted clearly meets:</p>
<p>1. Has had a charted hit on any national music chart.</p>
<p>2. Has had a record certified gold or higher in at least one country.</p>
<p>3. Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,3 reported in reliable sources.</p>
<p>→4. Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</p>
<p>→5. Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</p>
<p>6. Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city; note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</p>
<p>→7. Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award. <i>(Ok, nominated with a Grammy, but I think that fits the bill)</i></p>
<p>8. Has won or placed in a major music competition.</p>
<p>9. Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. (But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page.) →10. Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network.</p>
<p>11. Has been the subject of a half hour or longer broadcast on a national radio or TV network.</p>
<p>For composers and lyricists:</p>
<p>→1. The person has has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the person and reliable.</p>
<p>2. Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above, a notable theatre, or has been taken up by a musician or ensemble that qualifies above.</p>
<p>3. Has written musical theatre of some sort (includes musicals, operas, etc) that was performed in a notable theatre that had a reasonable run as such things are judged in their particular situation and time.</p>
<p>4. Has had a work used as the basis for a later composition by a songwriter, composer or lyricist who meets the above criteria.</p>
<p>→5. Has written a song or composition which has won (or in some cases been given a second or other place) in a major music competition not established expressly for newcomers. <i>(see Grammy nomin above)</i></p>
<p>6. Has been listed as a major influence or teacher of a composer, songwriter or lyricist that meets the above criteria.</p>
<p>→7. Appears at reasonable length in standard reference books on his or her genre of music.</p>
<p>While I'm not a Nysted fan -- all I've seen of him is from this article in question -- it's interesting enough that an open forum like Wikipedia would rather have NO information about this musician than SOME information. When I think of Wikipedia, i think of an "end all, be all" information forum. Why not let Nysted and his cohorts have their say? He may meet only the minimal requirements, but they should be sufficient; now, if there's something UNTRUE or DISHONEST about his entries, then we're on something different, but I don't see this being a dishonest quest.</p>
<p>While he's certainly not of Bob Dylan notoriety, I vote <b>Keep</b> -- his notable group members (some from my beloved Chicago) should easily qualify him.</p>
<p>Does anyone think Wikipedia is any less credible because his entry exists??!! --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicago60607_d4fa.html" title="User:Chicago60607">Chicago60607</a> 23:48, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not create the Lee Nysted Experience, or Nysted Music, although both articles should be allowed, or in the alternative, my name, and the Nysted Music articles should re-directed to The Lee Nysted Experience. (A legitimate and verified inclusion into the encyclopedia.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have asked the author of the re-direct of the Lee Nysted Experience (from Clear Channel) to simply list verifications of all claims, which he did, very kindly. He is the "dewart." He is no way related to me; does not work for NystedMusic. In fact, he works for one of the world's largest digital radio stations and media companies. I am grateful that he has come to my defense.</dd>

Please help to make this encyclopedia what it is designed to be.</dd>

<li>.) 99% of all digital sites now carry Nysted Music, including parts of his second album with noted artist Todd Sucherman, drummer for STYX with Wikipedia page.</li>
<li>.) Retail outlets like BestBuy, and Starbucks are listed as having signed Lee Nysted (See THE ORCHARD.)</li>
<li>.) Matt Walker, (the drummer) verified musician in Lee Nysted band / ensemble. Same for Todd Sucherman, the drummer.(See Wikipedia.)</li>
<li>.) Lee Nysted web site verifies all digital sites as does Orchard.</li>
<li>.) Artistopia verifies the above</li>
<li>.) Google: Lee Nysted and you will find 15,000 sites that will verify the above.</li>
<li>.) Several of Lee's songs are played right now on the largest radio stations in the world. (See Orchard)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> The only possible criterion of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> this subject could meet is <i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</i> Lee Nysted has used as studio musicians two drummers who are certainly notable, but is a studio musician in a band if he is a hired hand who does not otherwise tour or write music for the band (and according to the article, Lee writes his own music)? <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 00:07, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The authors and subject of the article have little experience with Wikipedia, so I forgive them their breaches of rules such as calling a legitimate nomination on Articles for Deletion "vandalism" or based in "wrong motives", a breach of our rule that we should always <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I must also insist that they stop claiming that people are making up rules when we are having a discussion about how to interpret them; this is disruptive.</dd>
<dd>To the question "Could anyone open a Wiki account and speak about this issue? Would the opinions matter?", in our <a href="../../../g/d/_/WP%7EGD_ec47.html" title="WP:GD">guide to deletion</a>, which I recommend you read, we state "Because of our past problems, opinions offered by new or anonymous users are often met with suspicion and may be discounted during the closing process." Opinions that are phrased politely and properly based in Wikipedia policies and guidelines are likely to be given greater weight. To the question, "Who is the decision making body?", we are it -- Articles for Deletion discussions are open to any Wikipedia editor and drawn from the entire community by intention. If there is a legitimate complaint about the <i>procedures</i> of a particular AFD, an appeal to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> may be made, but that will almost always simply result in a relisting and a new vote.</dd>
<dd>As for the article before us, there is a persistent argument for notability based on the projects of these other musicians, but notability is not associative; the individual must be independently notable. The <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> loophole puts an article on shaky notability ground, and this one is a primary example of why. Articles still should meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> above all, and "15,000 articles on Google" is not meeting that requirement. Google is <b>not</b> a source. Labels and companies that sell music are not <b>independent</b> sources, no matter how "reliable" they may be (presumably their information is accurate, but they have a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>). All Music Guide is occasionally used as proof of notability, but they don't actually write about Nysted, they just list one album and not the most recent. That would meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for information on that album, but it isn't really good enough per our <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guidelines. I strongly appreciate that Mr. Nysted is an accomplished musician, but the lack of sources which meet our <b>policy</b> is a difficult bar to step over. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:10, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment:</b>All artists in all bands directed by labels and production companies are "hired hands." The <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_Street_Boys_8836.html" title="Back Street Boys">Back Street Boys</a> were all hired hands. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Corgan_9198.html" title="Billy Corgan">Billy Corgan</a>'s band were all hired hands. Double standards are not seemly. All members of established bands that are now back on the road, are hired talent. A band is a band. The Experience is a band/ensemble by definition. You have simply chosen to re-write the rules and criteria; definition of band/ensemble. Majority rules? Let's get a rope?</p>
<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<p>As I suspected all along, this is nothing more than a "witch hunt" (as seen by all the "new" posts from MySpace users.) The article meets the guidelines and Wikipedia criteria. I am in no way involved with any false or misleading information about Lee. Billy Corgan wrote all the material for the Pumpkins, yet it is a band/ensemble.</p>
<p>The Lee Nysted name and the name of his band should be available to the world as it is on thousands of sites. If that does not happen on Wikipedia; for the wrong reasons, then Wikipedia guidelines and criteria do not amount to more than the gang rape that is happening here.</p>
<p>This is the reason I asked the question above.</p>
<p>I resent the idea that Lee and his fans would add to this charade.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> You need to understand something about how Grammy nominations work. On the first go around, MANY artists get nominated, by peers, by their labels, by the raidio stations, by just about anybody. Then there is a winnowing, by committee's I think, that reduces the nominees in each category to 3-5. THEN the full body votes on those reduced lists to arrive at winners. EVERYONE that was in that first grab-bag is a NOMINEE, but this first round is almost never listed anywhere. Simply the fact that Lee's nomination does not show on the Grammy's website is NOT proof that he was NOT a nominee. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillWSmithJr_9db3.html" title="User:BillWSmithJr">Bill W. Smith, Jr.</a> 08:17, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you Mr. Smith. There is a second tier to determine if the inclusions are actual and in the right genre. There are steps taken to verify the facts about artists. Not everyone can submit a "tape." The artist must then meet certain guidelines established by NARAS. The next tier goes to voting members only. Then there is a final tier, which is the one recently published.<a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> 15:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: Mr. Dhartung, I believe Mr. Smith was trying, and rightly so, to correct a remark that is considered against Wikipedia guidelines and that is to assume that Mr. Nysted is lying about his Grammy nominations. There is nothing phony about Mr. Nysted's claims; unless the author of that statement can prove otherwise, it must be withdrawn as not credible. The comment was made by someone that has no knowledge of the "Grammy" process, and thus committed an error in judgment, by "our" standards. I am a user here.<a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> 00:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> Mr. Smith committed no breach of process, but he is wrong if he is asserting that because it cannot be disproven, then we can use a person's claim that they were included in a private tier of Grammy nominations. This is exactly opposite to Wikipedia policy. We may only use the claim if it can be independently verified. Saying that is not saying that anyone is lying, and you are muddying the waters to portray it that way. <b>We cannot use this claim, period.</b> --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 23:12, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>See above and below, and you will see the link to 1 of three "private" nomination ballots for Lee Nysted and hundreds of Grammy "hopefuls." The ballot was found in Google.</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b>: To dispel the rant of "phony Grammy nominations" here is a link to the 3rd tier for 1 of 3 Grammy awards I was nominated for: Song #264 <b><a href="http://larryedoff.com/Song_Year.pdf" class="external text" title="http://larryedoff.com/Song_Year.pdf" rel="nofollow">Lee Nysted Song of the year#264</a></b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted</a> 04:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Song #264 was nominated in the second tier. There is nothing unusual about being a nominee. It happens all the time and it is the truth. Claims that is was a "phony" should be stricken as false and misleading, aside from being insulting to my name.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted</a> 14:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's fascinating. The document you point to is clearly marked <b>Entry List</b>, not "Nominations", "Nominees", or anything of the sort. According to the official website, "Entries are recordings submitted for GRAMMY consideration. Entries that meet all eligibility requirements are then voted on by The Academy's voting members and the results of that vote are the nominations." <a href="http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY%5FAwards/Voting/FAQs/#one" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY%5FAwards/Voting/FAQs/#one" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> While it is certainly possible that your entry was advanced to the nomination round, the document above proves nothing of the sort. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 18:28, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Reply:</b> Entry list are those that were nominated and made the list. If you go to the end of the list you will see verification that said list came from NARAS. As I said earlier, the nominations were done and I ended up in the third tier, after the voting members, including me, voted. I had 3 nominations, one of which was for Best Gospel performance? Go figure. End of Grammy story.</p>
<p>You sir, Mr. Dhartung, are not following your own guidelines of assuming that what I tell you is correct. I back it up with a document from NARAS and you still do not get it. Thank you Mr. Smith for your accurate depiction of what is happening here.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted</a> 20:58, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The ballot, you see, is very real. I cannot use it in the article, because that would be a copywrite violation.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted</a> 20:58, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b> To: Mr. Dhartung I think it is imperative that "reviews" not be made a central issue here. If you want reviews, many of the links in the article will give you reviews. (Hundreds, in fact.)However, reviews literally have nothing to do with the reliablity, notability and verification issue, all of which have been met. If you want reviews, we will list dozens from the various sites out there. That is not seemly and it is not part of the issues that Rambling Man stressed as the keys to keeping my article about Lee's band. <s><b>Strong Keep.</b></s><a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> 00:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Reply to Dhartung reply:</b> Mr. Dhartung, It is ironic that one of the reviews that was here, was deleted for copywrite infringement. On my web site, you will find a copy of it.(a pdf file.) I own the copywrite, now. Not a soul took the time to find that out. The link is out in the article. There are at least 90 reviews, if you want to go to the article?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted</a> 16:17, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reviews at AMG are listed in iTunes. The author of the AMG review signed his name on iTunes. AMG is listed as the source. <b>AMG is one of 2 sources considered reliable by Wikipedia for albums.</b> There are at least 5 additional reviews listed in the links provided. Independent networks around the globe. If you are now making reviews a central issue, we will be happy to provide hundreds of reviews and their links. CLEAR CHANNEL and the authors of this article will provide this page with additional notability sources, including the other key member of the band, Scott Bennett, who won a Grammy for his work on the SMILE album (Brian Wilson.) We never intended to make this a parade, but that is what we seem to have here. The unforunate part is that no one wants to help edit the truth, you seem to rather prevent the truth from coming out.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted</a> 14:45, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b> I think anyone looking at the references in the article today, and the days ahead, will see very clearly that the <b>"non-trivial works,"</b> reviews, and the notability issue is clear "as a bell." If the editors of Wikipedia want more I will provide more. I am prepared to add 1400 reviews, comments from over 10,000 sites worldwide, and the links to same.</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b>: please do feel free to add references and reviews.

You should, however, bear in mind <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and refrain from overlinking. The debate on Grammy nominations is moot, as nominations do not count for squat here: <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> states: "<i>Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award</i>": "nomination" does not equal "win". Also, it's a big stretch to call a session musician a band member, as there is no permanence at all, and certainly no sharing of royalties. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Gadd_49d3.html" title="Steve Gadd">Steve Gadd</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Porcaro_df73.html" title="Jeff Porcaro">Jeff Porcaro</a> played on tens of thousands of tracks, and so that stretched (and fallacious) logic would enable every one of those artists who recorded with them "notable". <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 07:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Quite the assumption, Mr. Dhartung. The two journalists that wrote the article are to be commended for their works and the due diligence expended to get all the details in, so the article would qualify for publication according to Wikipedia guidelines and criteria. Rambling Man indicated what was needed and that has been supplied many times over. The basis for Wikipedia, as a resource of information, is getting to the truth rather than throwing it away. A good editor would help to write an article about an artist that works within the framework of this encyclopedia. My work is very real as is the band/ensemble. The Lee Nysted Experience is notable by every standard known to mankind, including Wikipedia. The idea of starting out this way on Wikipedia, is unfortunate. It is even more unfortunate that editors with less than 6 months of experience here, can and do, destroy the very framework of this organization. Journalists are not required to like the people they write about, nor do journalists have the right to censor the real truth from an encyclopedia.</li>

Essentially, these are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. That is the key problem here and, as stated in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, multiple, non-trivial published works are the central criterion for inclusion. The album is distributed by Orchard Music, as are thousands of others by independent artists, but is (despite the strident comments at the top of the page and elsewhere) not produced by a notable record label. That is another issue under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Congratulations on the first-round Grammy nomination; the criteria states that awards must be <i>won</i>.

Judging from the fact that only four editors, three of whom are <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single-purpose accounts</a>, feel this article should be kept, the arguments have yet to sway anyone who has opined towards deletion.

<li>First off, I did not write the articles. Your agument about that, Peter, fails.</li>
<li>Second, "Google hits" will never be a reliable guide to notability. Anyone can buy Google hits. The original article was in my name, and should have been left; edited. My web site is getting hundreds of thousands of google hits, partly because we use ad-words. The Lee Nysted name is the source. Your argument, Tony, fails at both ends. Further, you are only one editor to return, and I suspect that you have not gone through all of the links, or the new sources, judging by your comment about notability.</li>
<li>Third and most important, the article now meets all of the requirements as set forth in Wikipedia rules, guidelines and / or established sources for reliability/notability. Quite simply put, the discussion should be over and the article stays per the comment made by The Rambling Man.</li>

It seems to me that while <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> has failed to note that not everything about Lee Nysted is self-published, he has broadly hit the nail on the head: there seems to be a determined claque that wants to see an article on this artist, and this claque is determined to cite any source it can to claim notability. I've taken a look at the references cited, and my own view is that at present notability is not proven: once I remove the various self-published sites and sites that simply mirror press releases ( see the Jazz Review link for a particularly egregious example of this - exactly the kind of thing that doesn't make a good source but has a superficial gloss of plausibility ) I do not find much more than for any other minor pub or club artist. This is not enough, and for that reason I feel that we should <b>Delete</b> this article. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 16:16, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd like to say that although they did not play a part in my decision, I was very unhappy about the small number of editors for this article, and in particular the fact that <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> appears to have no existence other than as a member of the Lee Nysted fan-club. I also didn't care for the slightly intimidating comments that she (??) left on <a href="../../../o/h/c/User_talk%7EOhconfucius_eb60.html" title="User talk:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a>'s talk page: let's try to play nicely. Finally, I notice that <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Nysted_e100.html" title="User:Lee Nysted">Lee Nysted</a> has made some contributions to this article and to various talk pages. Neglecting the similarities in posting style between <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Nysted_e100.html" title="User:Lee Nysted">Lee Nysted</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a>, which ( "assuming good faith" ) I am assuming is entirely coincidental, I would suggest that if Mr Nysted is really keen on getting an entry in Wikipedia he would be more likely to get it by concentrating on his music. The musicians we cover in this Encyclopedia tend to get their coverage because of their musical work, not because of their skill in quibbling in deletion debates. Notability arises from accomplishment, not from publicity. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 16:16, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> because I cannot find anything out there that is not either trivial or emanating fomr the subject (a press release or whatever).

<li><b>Delete</b> had a look at the AMG review - it's not there, they merely show the album to have been released, as such, I don't think the subject is notable and there's no hard, reliable sources which prove otherwise.

<dd>AMG lists the album. AMG is a reliable source, per Wikipedia. AMG lists at least one person, Matt Walker, that is notable. AMG has a review of the album up on iTunes.<a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> 21:24, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Stewart Mason wrote a review and it is up all over the world. The most visible place is iTunes. I believe I am, by rights, an editor and user here, as is C. H., and anyone that uses Wikipedia. I am reviewing the article and making changes that should qualify the article for inclusion. That is what editors are supposed to do.

<p>Please refrain from deleting my replies and comments. I am an editor and after 6 months of being here, I have as much time as many of you. I will defend an article that was up long before many of you arrived here. (Not written by me.)Please refrain from being condescending and, please leave out the "I cannot find routine."</p>
<p>I have provided everything required of any article, per Wikipedia rules guidelines, reliability tests, criteria, etc. I will post dozens of links to sites all over the free world to show you that my music is out there.</p>

<li>1. Start with THE ORCHARD.com link. Go to "digital partners." There you will find 14,000+ partners that are carrying my C.D. Amazon is one of the dealers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2. Go back to the article. I will start releasing threads. Most reviews are copywritten, so you may have to join sites. I will not post copywritten material, that I do not own.
