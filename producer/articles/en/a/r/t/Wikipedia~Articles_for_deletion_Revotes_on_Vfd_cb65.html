<li><s><b>Delete</b>. I was taken. He suggested it in the Vfd of his article as if something he'd found in passing, but he did NOT divulge that he had just invented it. He then begged me to use this new procedure in his stead since if he used it it would look like he was trying to save his article. So I read the rules, it said if two people changed their votes it could be used, so I dutifully started it in the hopes that it would solve the huge debate that had previously raged. I cannot say whether he was intentionally decieving me or not... <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 23:39, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</s> it was all a misunderstanding... <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 04:12, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Where did he do the begging? I looked at both your talk pages and don't see any conversation about this. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 23:51, Apr 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, nono, not "beg" in the actual sense, but he said "<i>Yes, I call for a revote. You seem to know the proper procedure for doing that. Since you have more experience at this then I, could you please put the header in place or whatever needs to be done? If I do it, some people will perceive it as "founder of the article bias".</i>" so it was basically like he wanted to do it but couldn't, so I did it instead... <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 00:00, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Did he actually point you to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevotes_on_Vfd_754b.html" title="Wikipedia:Revotes on Vfd">Wikipedia:Revotes on Vfd</a> at some point? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 00:03, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)

<li>He did mention <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevotes_on_Vfd_754b.html" title="Wikipedia:Revotes on Vfd">Wikipedia:Revotes on Vfd</a> before on the same discussion; probably <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> didn't notice his hint that he was the policy's creator. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 00:14, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course he did, otherwise I'd never have found the page. "<i>How does this sound? <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevotes_on_Vfd_754b.html" title="Wikipedia:Revotes on Vfd">Wikipedia:Revotes on Vfd</a>.

<dd><b>Hold.</b> We don't delete policy proposals. We either accept them or reject them. If they are rejected then they go to "rejected policy proposals". I made this proposal in a good faith effort to make the system better. Was it inspired by problems I encountered on wikipedia? Yes. Isn't every proposal similarly inspired? However, don't disparage it just because it was made quickly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>MTG, you misunderstood what I wrote. I never intended for the proposal to be taken as anything other then a <b>proposal</b>. I was told that there was no revote policy, so I said in response "How does this sound?" and "Well, for what it's worth, there's the "how to do a revote" proposal for all to consider." On the proposal page, I clearly put "This is a <b>proposed policy.</b>" on the top of the page, and listed it on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_policy_thinktank_91d8.html" title="Category:Wikipedia policy thinktank">Wikipedia policy thinktank</a> for proposed policy accordingly. (Look at the original version of the page and you will see this. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Revotes_on_Vfd&amp;oldid=12751917" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Revotes_on_Vfd&amp;oldid=12751917" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.) I made every reasonable effort to indicate that this was a proposal and not official policy. Also, knowing that some people would take things the wrong way, a couple hours after I posted it, realizing that the proposal would just cause more controversy in the short term, I said forget about it; I said that I would not ask for a revote. Then Master Thief Garett said, that, it's alright, you can ask for a revote. So, I asked him to do the how and why or whatever needs to be done so that the revote procedure would be done in a regular and traditional way and be free of any perceived bias.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>I did not intend for Master Thief Garret to use this proposal.</b> The fact that it <i>was</i> used is about the worst possible thing that could happen. The whole point of asking MTG to initiate/supervise a revote was so that it would be unbiased and done in a verifiably unbiased way. There was no attempt to deceive. MTG, I'm sorry that you misunderstood my statements. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 03:29, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Hold</b>. I second this vote. This has all been an unfortunate misunderstanding blown out of proportion, and we really need to wait until such time as this can be assessed correctly. We ideally need to wait some time for tempers to cool.

<dd><b>Comment</b> My perception is that it <b>is</b> all just an unfortunate misunderstanding, though <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> might have been just a little bit to energetic in defending "boner-&gt;blunder" article. Unfortunately, this has all gotten a bit of a life of its own and I suspect the two of you will just have to sit there and watch things play out. I suggest not worrying too much about it, it will all die a natural death, and by the way <b>I don't think anyone really thinks its a big deal.</b> Just let it blow over and shrug it off. You might even consider taking all the relevant pages off your watchlists. Do <b>not</b> yield to the temptation to respond to <b>everything.</b> Some comments will be offbase or unfair or misunderstandings; don't try to correct all of them. We tell everyone to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a>. Well, the consequence of that is, when you're bold, you sometimes goof. And when others correct your goofs you sometimes you should just sit back and let it happen. A hundred years from now it'll be all the same, right?

<li>I was not aware that you <i>had</i> to use the {{notpolicy}} template. I put "This is a <b>proposed policy</b>." at the top of the page instead. What's wrong with that?

<ul>
<li>It is a new template, created in the last month or so, to help reduce the constant confusions as to what was policy and what wasn't. Most semi-policy and policy thinktank pages have already had that added. Since I noticed yours didn't have it yet, I added it ☺. Notice that even on the edit box I said "add bright yellow box", which is almost the only real difference adding it made. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 12:08, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Disagree. Saying that the only reason it was listed on VfD was because of the title, when it quite clearly was because of his dare, is a bit of stretch to believe was done on good faith. If it wasn't for that, I agree that there would be no problem in him removing that comment. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 00:57, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it was on Vfd before I posted that on the commons. The article was on Vfd about 10 seconds after it was created because someone saw the name as inappropriate. I posted that bit in the commons in the hopes that the post would draw objective, open mined people into the discussion (of at least people who didn't want to see the article deleted)--people who would see the inherent usefulness of the article and help improve it, but the post clearly had the opposite effect. People seemed to take offense at being called "pesky deletionsts" (in retrospect, that's kind of obvious), and a few even seemed determined to delete the article at all costs. However, I must say that the majority of people have mellowed in the past day or so. The war drums have stopped. I actually have much more respect for the deletionist point of view now, thanks to the efforts of some very wise Wikipedians. See my home page for details. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 03:39, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per RickK. Look, if the page changes, people can <i>change their votes</i>. You can message the delete voters on their talkpages and ask them to reconsider. It's often done. That route has been working quite well. Please use it rather than make up policy every time something doesn't go your way. Jeez, the one thing we are not short of here is <i>policy</i>!<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:14, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, attempt to subvert the vfd process. If you have rewritten an article, you should leave a message on the voters Talk pages to argue why it should be kept. If you want an article to be recreated after being deleted you should make a request at votes for undeletion. This is the normal procedure for saving articles. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 04:20, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Subvert? There's a loaded word. It's an attempt to <i>revise</i> the vfd process. The current process is ridiculous. Leaving a message on every voter's talk page = cumbersome. Wrongly deleting and then having to undelete = absurd. There must be a better way.</dd>

<dd>The early votes were done before any discussion occured. That's like holding an election first and THEN having an official debate about the election. It makes no sense. Either some sort of process should exist to redo early votes, or voting shouldn't even happen until the relevant issues have been discussed. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 09:12, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
