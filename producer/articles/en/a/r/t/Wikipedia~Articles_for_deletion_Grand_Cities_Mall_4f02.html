<dd><b>Comment</b> actually I'd be more than happy to see all the pokecruft gone from Wikipedia, but realistically speaking, that will never happen. Still, just because Wikipedia has become a stomping ground for hundreds of articles about the minutiae of a childrens cartoon (curiously written by people who apparently are not in the target 10 year old market) doesn't justify adding any other sort of article.

<li><b>Delete</b> Malls are businesses, in the business of renting space to retail stores. That means <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is the applicable standard. The article, and this AFD to date, contains no evidence (and not even an assertion) that the mall meets the standards set by <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. And yes, I assume that there are swarms of other mall articles out there that deserve deletion.

<li>I had no idea Grand Forks was in South Dakota. Only lived in North Dakota most of my life and thought GF was in North Dakota. Guess I learn something new each day from people who can't even take the time to get the facts straight. It was the first built/completed but second opened (by six days) in North Dakota. It also has been the longest open as "The Park" was closed for a few years then reopened back in the 1980's, and although it had damage because of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flood_of_1997_20ad.html" title="The Flood of 1997">The Flood of 1997</a> it was re-modeled and one of the very first businesses reopened after the flood. I'm quite sure a search of the local paper, the GFH would bring up these facts, though they don't have a searchable Archive online. Guess I'll head down to the local library and do a bit of research. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 05:26, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I think that many of the "delete" votes come from people who live in places where shopping malls grow like weeds, and thus cannot conceive of why any individual mall would ever be notable. I sympathize, but also recognize that the notability of something depends not just on <i>what</i> it is, but also on <i>where</i> it is. In the case of North Dakota, a large enclosed mall is undoubtably notable, even if it wouldn't be in, say, Phoenix or Los Angeles. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybum_d3c8.html" title="User:Skybum">Skybum</a> 00:32, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not ready to change my vote yet (and I think this will be no consensus anyway) but this is finally the first really interesting reason to keep and I'd like to see it expanded upon. Are malls really so rare in the State of North Dakota that the first mall is notable? I have to admit, where I live, in 1 hour's time I could get to 10-12 malls easily. A mall simply is no big deal.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:44, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not voting either way on this (I usually vote to keep malls, but I'm wishy-washy as to this one), but I think this AFD proves we need to have a discussion on shopping mall notability in general. There have been a lot of mall AFDs lately, many of which <i>have</i> been kept either on their own accord or by lack of consensus (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Carlingwood_Mall_cdb5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Carlingwood Mall">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Carlingwood_Mall</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mall_of_Louisiana_c47d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mall of Louisiana">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mall of Louisiana</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Oakland_Mall_e3f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Oakland Mall">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Oakland_Mall</a>). It is my opinion that <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> applies more than <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> here, as most articles don't necessarily pertain as to malls as a <i>business</i>, but rather their status within a community as a landmark, economic power, etc. This places them within the same realm as parks or schools. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 13:58, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Isotope, I guess I should explain. Enclosed malls are not abundent up in North Dakota cities as a whole. Fargo, the biggest city in North Dakota has one...West Acers. Grand Forks, has two (columbia and grand cities), Jamestown has one, and there is one in Bismark, the state capital. Something else to point out is that theses cities are hours apart, making enclosed shopping malls nearly a novelty. Grand Forks and Fargo are 45-50 minutes apart via the interstate highway 29 (which is 75MPH and little traffic). Jamestown - Fargo is +2 Hours and Bismark-Fargo is 4-5 Hours, hence the reason the editors from North Dakota are so against this delete. It's the longest running enclosed mall in a state with so few of them around. I can understand if LA, NYC, Miami, DFW, or KC has 10-40 (or more) enclosed malls within the city (or suburbs) making someone from that area believe enclosed malls are not notable, but from an area where the next closest enclosed mall is a +2 hour drive...the mall would be notable. This mall is notable for the community because it is a 'big deal' for the city. It was the Focal point of the city's shopping economy for decades, and still has drawing power. In a state with a <b>total population of 642,200 people</b> I hope you can see the context, when a <b>city</b> such as LA has a total population of 4,097,340! , --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 15:48, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think I can approve of where this sort of reasoning takes us. I have family members who live in rural West Virginia. Up until they got a Wal-Mart last year, they had no shopping of that nature within around an hour of where they lived. Does that mean that the Welch Wal-Mart should have an article because it's a "big deal" to the few people who live in the northern part of McDowell and the southern part of Wyoming counties? I don't think so. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 19:25, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think you can compare a Wal-Mart store to an entire mall. A Wal-Mart, no matter what kind of an impact it has on a local community, is just one store. On the other hand, a mall is more than just a store. In ways, it is almost like an entire neighborhood. The Grand Cities Mall had a major impact on the city of Grand Forks. When it opened, it started the decline of once-bustling downtown Grand Forks. In ways, the mall was a "new downtown". People had never seen anything like it. It seemed huge back then and its opening forever changed the business climate and the landscape of the community. In North Dakota, the opening of a mall is not a regular news item. The opening of this mall was especially noteworthy since it was basically the first mall that anyone had ever seen in this area. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">Matth</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">w<font color="green"><b>UND</b></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewUND_1acf.html" title="User talk:MatthewUND">talk</a>)</sup> 00:56, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
