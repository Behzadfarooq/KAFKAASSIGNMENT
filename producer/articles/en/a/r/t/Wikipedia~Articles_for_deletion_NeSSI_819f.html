<p>Initally prodded as an advert (which it is). Tagged for speedy as a copyvio (which it is not). I am bringing it here for consideration. I say delete because it is non-notable, far too specialised to justify a WP entry. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 07:21, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination. Individual research programmes at universities usually aren't notable to get their own articles. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyingtoaster1337_9f8e.html" title="User:Flyingtoaster1337">Flyingtoaster1337</a> 09:13, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>See also the comments from Veltkamp in Talk. I don't agree with the reasons given above for deletion:</li>
</ul>
<p>Advert? No, the entry is describing a technology development which has been taking place since 2000. Three competing companies which have produced products meeting the standard are named but no individual products are identified or endorsed. Images of their products are included to enable the reader to see what completed systems systems look like. The focus of this article is to describe the design concepts and the advantages of this approach.</p>
<p>Too specialised? This article deals a technology set, Process Analytics, which is present in every single refinery and petrochemical plant in the world, and in each of those plants there may be hundreds of such systems. Put another way, Process Analytics is a technology sector worth several billions of dollars per year. There is a Wiki entry for Laboratory. Process Analytics has a similar degree of specialisation as Lab Analytics. In fact I'd recommend further expansion of both Laboratory and NeSSI to describe analytical technologies in greater detail.</p>
<p>Non-notable? There are tens of thousands of Process Analytics systems in the world. The NeSSI approach will dramatically change the way that such systems are designed and used. This is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Individual research programmes at universities? No, this is an industry-wide initiative with most of the work being done by industrial companies (both vendors and end-users). CPAC at the University of Washington has provided a neutral umbrella under which these companies have been able to meet and make progress. --JJG UK 13:07, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> not an encyclopedic article. should be on the homepage for this project, not here. not notable enough.--<a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETainter_ef79.html" title="User:Tainter">Tainter</a> 15:46, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> --</li>
</ul>
<p>The volume of public articles (over 20+) in trade publications and journals and the series of presentations and devoted sessions at national and international conferences (50+) should lay the <i><b>notable</b></i> issue to rest. The remaining issue of whether this topic is too specialized seems like a weak argument for deletion -- all new technology is <i><b>specialized</b></i> when it is first introduced. Just because the community this page serves is a technical one is not justification for deletion -- there are many (most?) Wikipedia pages that serve small special interest groups. In writing this page we attempted to distill the essence of the topic down to a broad introduction that would give the reader a sense of what NeSSI is and why it is important. Most of the specialized technical content (including a complete history of its development as reflected in technical presentations and papers given at various conferences) remains on the main NeSSI web site included as an external link. <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVeltkamp_2b96.html" title="User:Veltkamp">Veltkamp</a> 21:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> --</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to the argument that this is too specialized, how is this different than an article on <a href="../../../s/o/a/SOAP_4de9.html" title="SOAP">SOAP</a> (Single Object Access Protocol). That is a protocol that was developed for commercial use in a specialized environment. The functionality that the NeSSI initiative is attempting to bring to current analytical sample system designs mirrors the type of development that SOAP has gone through.<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECIRCORTech_151e.html" title="User:CIRCORTech">CIRCORTech</a> 21:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, if you also read the talk page of the article, it seams a site has been created by the developers of the program to create a wikipedia page, surely this is an advert? <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 00:24, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, we simply pointed out that that we were publicizing the planned submission of a Wikipedia article on our existing web site as a "heads-up" and a mechanism for soliciting comments from our site visitors relative to the proposed content for the eventual Wikipedi page<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVeltkamp_2b96.html" title="User:Veltkamp">Veltkamp</a> 22:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Sheesh...I cannot beleive this is so controversial. The NeSSI Wikipedia page was submitted based on 2 criteria:<br />
1) The growing maturity and acceptance within the chemical processing and manufacturing communities of the NeSSI concepts for developing new sample conditioning and handling systems as a viable alternative to tradtional sampling system practices. The NeSSI effort (while it started, and is obstensively managed, out of the CPAC consortia at the University of Washington) is an open industry-wide initiative open to anyone. The NeSSI effort is not interested in private commercialization as a goal (although we do encourage the development and commercialization of products by interested companies which support the end-user's ability to implement the NeSSI concepts) nor do we collect any fees, royalties, or compensation for individual or corporate involvement or use of NeSSI. We currently have 300+ individuals suscribed to our mailing list and the active participation of over 50 major international companies. To date the NeSSI effort has resulted in over 600 new commercial products, an ISA/ANSI standard, and over 150 installed systems in companies around the world. It is fair to say the NeSSI concepts are being embraced as a <i>de facto</i> standard for many sampling system needs within industry.<br />
2) Our view is that Wikipedia serves as an open-source repository for information (general and specialized) that provides a reference point for individuals using the internet to research a topic. Our NeSSI page submission was prompted, in large part, by the volume of requests we have received for background information from editors and reporters wishing to provide media reports of NeSSI, as well as requests from individuals wishing to learn more about this topic. We have made a sincere attempt to craft the NeSSI Wikipedia page to conform to the encyclopedia-nature content consistent with the Wikipedia guidlines. Perhaps we fell short in this attempt...but isn't that what the discussion facility (suggestions for how to improve the content to make it more suitable) in Wikipedia is designed to address? It seems that suggesting a contribution be deleted simply based on a reader's lack of familiarity or understanding is counterproductive and limits the "openness" Wikipedia is attempting to promote. Of course, we could simply write-off Wikipedia as a potential reference source for disseminating NeSSI information and continue to provide our own resources (web page and mailing lists which we plan to maintain independent of Wikipedia) to serve the public requests. Obviously, we still believe that there is a place within Wikipedia for information about emerging trends and new technology -- but if that is not the community view then so be it.<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVeltkamp_2b96.html" title="User:Veltkamp">Veltkamp</a> 22:09, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>NeSSI is not an advertisement. It has been featured or covered as an example of new technology made possible by industry/academic collaboration by several chemical and process analytical journals. For example (short list): Chemical Engineering Progress (Dec. 2003), InTech (August, 2001 and Feb. 2002), Control (March 2003), Chemical and Engineering News (May, 2004), Instrumenta UK (Dec 2003). RD Canada.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> We received some constructive comments from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ryanpostlethwaite" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ryanpostlethwaite" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ryanpostlethwaite</a> and its clear that some edit is needed to more clearly define the nature of NeSSI and its relationship to University of Washington, companies participating in NeSSI commercialization, end-user companies supporting NeSSI, and the general public. This edit will likely appear early next week. Also, we will also attempt to supply more of a context for NeSSI that is less technically orientated (again next week). Hopefully that will help make the page more generally interesting and informative. <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVeltkamp_2b96.html" title="User:Veltkamp">Veltkamp</a> 18:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Having studies this kind of stuff eons ago, it's certainly not over-specialized (or written beyond reasonable comprehension levels) for people with any kind of interest or curiosity in this area. This is an encyclopedia after all.
