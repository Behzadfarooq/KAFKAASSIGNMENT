Technical errors in the nomination process made it appear that this discussion was closed, possibly discouraging participation.

<li><b>Delete immediately</b> It is suggested that this page be either deleted or I will move it to "Jewish Christmas Tree", because of the simple fact that it is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> and should be removed in accordance with <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

<li>It's not a neologism, the term being in widespread and frequent use for decades as shown by the source citations on the page.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tree.html" title="Christmas tree">Christmas tree</a> is not "traditionally Christian." As far as I know, Christmas trees are not mentioned in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>. If I'm wrong, please provide a citation. Our article on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tree.html" title="Christmas tree">Christmas trees</a> discusses this in detail and suggests that the practice either originated as a pagan custom, or as a nonreligious celebration originating in 18th-century Germany (which was objected to by at least one priest specifically as <i>not</i> being Christian).</li>
<li>Even if it were considered offensive, the appropriate remedy would not be to delete the article, but make sure the article is neutral, by providing proper, well-sourced material showing to whom it is considered offensive. The article <i>already addresses</i> the differences of opinions between Jews in some detail. I am not aware of any widespread objections by Christians, but if there are, please provide <i>properly sourced</i> commentary for inclusion in the article.</li>
<li>I don't see how <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> applies, because nothing the actions and procedures surrounding this article were disruptive to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>The article was discussed in AfD very recently. In its present form, it received fourteen keep votes and no delete votes. (For some reason <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordain_c8a5.html" title="User:Jordain">Jordain</a> did not vote in the first AfD, even though it is clear he or she was aware of the article.) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:52, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It should not be moved to "Jewish Christmas tree" for the following reasons. Unlike <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah_bush.html" title="Hanukkah bush">Hanukkah bush</a>, "Jewish Christmas tree" <b>is</b> a neologism. This term is not used to any appreciable extent. Our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">naming conventions</a> call for the use of the most common term; this is "Hanukkah bush," not "Jewish Christmas tree." This specific question of whether the article should be entitled <a href="../../../h/a/n/Talk%7EHanukkah_bush_4bf6.html" title="Talk:Hanukkah bush">Talk:Hanukkah bush</a> on whether the article title should be <i>Hanukkah bush</i> or <i>Jewish Christmas Tree</i> resulted in four fairly strong opinions, all to the effect that it should remain at <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah_bush.html" title="Hanukkah bush">Hanukkah bush</a>, and no dissenting opinions. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:51, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. The only <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> I see here is <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordain_c8a5.html" title="User:Jordain">Jordain</a>'s AfD nomination. Sorry, but you can't delete something just because the idea is offensive to you. If that were the case Wikipedia would comprise one article and it would be about something totally generic like <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay.html" title="Clay">clay</a>. As for the article itself, I am judging it on its current incarnation. A quick look around the internet shows that there are a few examples of a Hanukkah bush in the manner it is described in the article... enough that I'm willing to let it stand for now, though it is scraping the edge of non-notability. I'd also recommend a cleanup tag as the article could be written a bit better.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:46, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The article is different now. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hanukkah_Bush&amp;oldid=22582671" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hanukkah_Bush&amp;oldid=22582671" rel="nofollow">the original article</a>, to which the nomination and comments above this line refer, was a transparent hoax or not very funny joke about "a recently discovered leaf-like drug" whose effects on "classmates" included laughter, memory loss, premeditated streaking, etc. The new article is intended to be, uh, for real. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 03:00, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as rewritten. The article as it currently stands refers to the usage as cited by several voters on this topic. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 01:49, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not a joke or a hoax. It's not a universal jewish tradition, but I'd be surprised if any reform Jew hasn't at least heard the phrase since childhood. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 02:36, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Off-topic, but User:Jordain recently moved the article to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Christmas_Tree_87c2.html" title="Jewish Christmas Tree">Jewish Christmas Tree</a> with the edit comment "Hanukkah bush moved to Jewish Christmas Tree: Name is insufficient, anti-Christian." This page currently has an audience of potentially interested editors, so anyone with opinions on this may wish to chime in at <a href="../../../h/a/n/Talk%7EHanukkah_bush_4bf6.html" title="Talk:Hanukkah bush">Talk:Hanukkah bush</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:52, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
