<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>, on the balance of arguments presented. As one&#160;!voter puts it, <i>We shouldn't be combing through fansites looking for speculative material to make an article out of.</i>. The question of whether or not it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> was discussed in some depth, with credible arguments for, some creative interpretations of that policy, and some individual elements undoubtedly having credible arguments against OR, but the overall subject - insignia not covered in canon - is pretty much a guarantee that, whether or not it is technically OR in every respect, it contains core elements which must be original research, and it unquestionably represents a level of detail in excess of what is generally considered appropriate for a general encyclopaedia. Material of interest only to a very small number of dedicated fans - carefully avoiding that piece of Wikijargon which I know is on the tips of several tongues. Friends, let's not fight any longer. This can go to memory Alpha, I'll happily hand over the source if anyone wants it, but on the basis of the arguments presented below this is simply too far from the core principles of verifiable material neutrally stated from reliable secondary sources. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:02, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete if not cleaned up</b> - I admire that someone has obviously been working on this article <i>trying</i> to source it, but statements like "With the exception of Commodore, Rear Admiral from Star Trek: The Motion Picture and Star Trek: The Original Series and vice admiral from Star Trek: The Original Series, no such insignia has ever been deemed official by the producers of the Star Trek series, therefore making the insignia purely conjectural" don't fill me with the idea that this is heavily sourced. The article is written well and has sources for <i>some</i> of what's written, and I'll happily change to keep if the OR stuff is removed. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 19:37, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Conjectural, non-canon stuff that the article states itself often comes from misconceptions, backhanded explanations or outright costume errors?

<li><b>Delete</b> - look, the first paragraph sums this up nicely. "Alternate ranks of Star Trek are Starfleet ranks and insignia that have never appeared in canon Star Trek productions or materials, but have been described in non-canonical literature or fan sources. The main sources of such Star Trek rank insignia are Star Trek novels, technical manuals, fan magazines, and internet websites not directly connected with the publication of the show." This, self-admittedly, doesn't have reliable sources, only unrelaible ones. Therefore it's unverifiable and should, unfortunately, be deleted. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> 20:48, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, in the first AfD, Husnock said that established editors had been working on this for over a year. I appreciate that they thought they were creating a good article (and one that might be a credit to another wiki, let me add), but if experienced Wikipedians put a lot of work into an article and it still failed (by a long measure, I think we can agree) to demonstrate that the topic met our standards for coverage, I am unconvinced that any amount of work could result in the article meeting the inclusion criteria. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 01:03, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge sourcable material to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia.html" title="Starfleet ranks and insignia">Starfleet ranks and insignia</a></b> - my contention with this page is that it inherently differentiates between <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28Star_Trek%29_c0ba.html" title="Canon (Star Trek)">canon</a> and non-canon, and some Trekkish editors incorrectly conflate non-canon with unreliable -- which I don't think is the case. IMHO, excising material because it is non-canon is non-npov. Anyhow, there's a lot of conjecture in this article, but some of it is sourceable to published secondary sources; that material should be siphoned over to the "regular" ranks and insignia article; readers can decide on their own whether to "buy into" canon and non-canon material. --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 01:03, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or merge</b>. First, the most common objection I've seen so far is "original research". There's two quotes from <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> that I think are relevant:</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
The way I read that, quoting a statement directly from an off-screen source (such as a technical manual or a novel) is fine, as long as you make it clear where it's from, and that it's not canon. OTOH, using any source to invent new material yourself would definitely be OR.</p>
<p>"The Branch Admiral rank appears in the non-canon "Star Trek: The Next Generation Officer's Manual"" (the claim that it appears in this book is a verifiable fact)<br />
"Leonard McCoy rose to the rank of Branch Admiral" (not stated on-screen, so it's conjecture)</p>
<p>Here are a couple other examples to illustrate my point (totally made up, of course):</p>
<p><br />
Good, in-universe tone: "Luke blew up the Death Star (source: "A New Hope" movie)"<br />
(based on canon source)</p>
<p>Good, out-of-universe tone: "In the novel "Dark Side", it is suggested that Luke used the Dark Side of the Force when he blew up the Death Star. However, this novel is not considered canon."<br />
(sources the claim, but makes it clear it's only suggested, and it's not an established fact within the fictional universe yet.)</p>
<p>Bad, in-universe tone: "Luke used the Dark Side of the Force when he blew up the Death Star. (source: "Dark Side" novel)."<br />
(it's not clear from this sentence that the source is non-canon)</p>
<p>Bad, out-of-universe tone: "It is suggested that Luke used the Dark Side of the Force when he blew up the Death Star"<br />
(unsourced, dismiss as purely original research by the editor until a source is found)</p>
<p><br />
If anyone has some arguments about this reasoning, please share them here.</p>
<p>Now, onto this article - the old Warrant Officer section was a mess, but it's been much improved. The only section that still bugs me is the Admiral's ranks - four versions of TOS ranks, based on two websites? <i>(cough) OR (cough)</i>. I asked for a definitive source last time this came up, but none's appeared, so I'm going to delete this section - it can be put back if sourced.</p>
<p>The main concern that would make me jump between keep and merge is <i>the size of the article</i> - if the current article (minus admiral's ranks) is below the current minimum size for an article it should be merged to the main ranks page (while making very bloody clear that these aren't canon ranks). If articles of this size are commonly allowed to stay independent, then the same standard should be applied. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 01:52, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep/merge - I would say that this article does indeed have references to merit some sort of inclusion, so I feel that deletion is unnecessary. As for merging, I'm told that in the past these actually were merged but they were forked as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia.html" title="Starfleet ranks and insignia">Starfleet ranks and insignia</a> became too large (and is already quite difficult to load with the mass of images). If something can be done to reduce the complexity of dealing with the size of the article, then I would say merge, but if not, it seems like a valid option to keep the article. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 02:05, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep/merge</b>; I agree that this is a bit minor for its own article, but it is an essential part of the Star Trek ranks and insignia coverage.

<li><b>Question</b> - Is there a policy or guideline out there which talks about the size of an article? How big does a stable article need to be before it can stand as an independent article, and not be merged into a parent topic? (By "stable article", I mean it's not a stub, and it's been fully sourced, but it's unlikely to rapidly expand in the near future.) <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 07:09, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'll come out of retirement to vote on this due to my original argument: 17 sources are provided from various star trek manuals, publications, and live action productions. Warrant officer section was heavily re-written to reference exactly where the material came form and how the rank evolved over the years from no apperances at all to heavy apperances in Star Trek literature with O'Brien stated in the novel of "Emissary" that he held a "warrant". I'm sure this vote will not help, since forces at work seem intent on deleting these articles and I am making no further edit controbutions to this website with perhas the exception of reverting obvious vandalism. With that said, please no one bash my vote, call me names (like "Craftateer") or state that I have no idea what OR is. I'm just voting. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 07:22, 15 December 2006 (UTC) P.S.- Delete folks please visit <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Comparative_ranks_and_insignia_of_Star_Trek_%282nd_nomination%29_097d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Comparative ranks and insignia of Star Trek (2nd nomination)">here</a> -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 07:33, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article signs its own death warrant in my opinion with the comment, "Alternate ranks of Star Trek are Starfleet ranks and insignia that <i>have never appeared in canon Star Trek productions or materials</i>, but <i>have been described in</i> non-canonical literature or <i>fan sources</i>. The main sources of such Star Trek rank insignia are Star Trek novels, technical manuals, fan magazines, and <i>internet websites not directly connected with the publication of the show</i>." It seems an admission to lack of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and and inherent violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. At most these insignia have been described in a book- the pictures are mostly pure conjecture and OR. By way of example. The 'ensign first class' insig is apparently descibed in the book "Doctor's Orders". I have included its picture right. How much of the book was taken up with the description of the insignia for so accurate a rendering to be produced?- <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 12:55, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To be perfectly honest, I've got no idea. I've listed it as an unknown for now, until we get some sort of confirmation - thanks for pointing it out. Still, even if the rank is just described in the "Doctor's Orders" novel and not illustrated, we can still list it as a non-canon rank - just one <i>with an unknown insignia</i>. I think I'll have a quick look at some of the other ranks that claim to be only mentioned in novels, but still have rank insignia shown. In the worst case scenario that all the rank insignia listed from novels are bogus (no appearances as cover art or anything), we'd have to replace two or three pictures in one section of the article with an "Unknown". That's hardly a convincing case to wipe out the entire article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 14:23, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

First, are these the original thoughts of the Wikipedian editor? No, they come from published sources. Second, if a non-canon source says that "Ensign First Class" exists, then we're allowed to say, "According to this non-canon source, Ensign First Class exists." This is not an interpretive claim, or an analysis of the rank, it's a simple statement of fact.

<li>It is certainly an example of <i>unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material</i> which the lead of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> mentions. It appears that nobody has previously, on the basis of these continuity errors, published a hypothetical rank system which accounts for them. I base this conclusion on the fact that no such study is cited, and that in several cases the article says that no explanation has been offered.

<dd>Let's look at the whole sentence you took that quote from.
<dl>
<dd><i>It includes unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position — or which, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>A simple list of non-canon ranks, each individually sourced, is not "a novel narrative". (Building a hypothetical rank system with canon and non-canon ranks <i>would</i> be synthesis - but this article doesn't do that.) An article that lists several sources for and against the warrant officer rank, but does not make a claim itself, does not constitute "historical interpretation". <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 13:22, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You appear to be relying on a very narrow interpretation of <i>novel narrative or historical interpretation</i>. This is a narrative, and historical interpretation, of continuity errors, and it is novel. What more do you want? You can easily disprove the claims of OR by citing secondary sources which provide a similar narrative or interpretation. What we get in the article are primary sources. That's no use at all for disproving a charge of original research. Quite the opposite: it vindicates the claim. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 14:31, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>- Assume that the rank "Dogsbody" appears in the non-canon book "Stuff".</dd>
<dd>- The statement of fact, "in the non-canon book, "Stuff", the rank of Dogsbody appears" is not OR, since it does not extrapolate the original work. It is a descriptive claim, which complies with the OR policy I quoted in bold, since it is "easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge" - anyone who reads the book can confirm that the rank appears.</dd>
<dd>- A host of secondary sources is not necessary when making a factual claim about a primary source. (Compare with Hamlet - you don't need a secondary source to simply say, "In the play "Hamlet", Hamlet meets a ghost". If you want to start discussing character themes and motivations, like "Was Hamlet insane?", however, then you <i>do</i> need secondary sources.)</dd>
<dd>- "Dogsbody is a canon rank" is incorrect, since the source is non-canon.</dd>
<dd>- Interpretation like "Dogsbody is roughly equivalent to Ensign" is OR, unless this claim also appears in the book. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 22:45, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Wikipedia is not the place for original research, conjecture, and speculation.

The issue is not whether the references are reliable (personally, I think they are reliable when you're talking about star trek fanon) - their reliability is immaterial to the discussion at hand.

<p>Since there appears to be a level of confusion, let me explain a few things about Star Trek franchise's understanding of canon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, I do want to point out that everything on star trek is a fake. It is all fiction, someones original fantasy (not even research).</li>
<li>A lot of material published by the official creators of the show is considered fanon such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Animated_Series_3340.html" title="Star Trek: The Animated Series">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a>. This is primarily to maintain series continuity. They do not want to introduce something that will hunt them later on.</li>
<li>Practically every star trek episode has a novelized non-canon (fanon) version almost always written by the same people who write the script for the episode. These aren't fan work as the word "fanon" suggests but official publication not considered canon. Novel series have a canon within themselves and they often do contradict the official canon TV show. Tucker never died in the novelized version of <a href="../../../e/n/t/Star_Trek%7E_Enterprise_849e.html" title="Star Trek: Enterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a> unlike the tv series.</li>
<li>There are official yet non-canon publication such as Star Trek games, Star Trek Encyclopedia, as well as various "tech" manuals of the show that occasionally cover material never shown on TV. These books are 100% original fantasy just like the show. However, the people writing the books and making the show are the same people.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for wikipedias approach to the matter at hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia's policy on original research does not care if material is considered canon or fanon. So long as it is published (Star Trek Encyclopedia certainly is published), OR can no longer apply. If you feel there is unpublished material on the article, feel free to comment them out.</li>
<li>Conjecture (speculation) is acceptable on wikipedia provided its not OR (ie my speculation). For example creators of the show have long 'speculated' how ST:TOS admiral insignia supposed to look like. Same thing happened with the movie pins. Different tech manuals and etc have contradicted each other until canon was established with later movies. Star Trek Encyclopedias representation of the pins have evolved over time in accordance with canon. We have entire articles based strictly on speculation such as 9/11 conspiracy theories article.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the merge idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>That is a very bad idea. The article <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia.html" title="Starfleet ranks and insignia">Starfleet ranks and insignia</a> as is is about 32ks and thats just wiki code. A merge would make that article very hard to load on computers with slower internet link. This article originally was part of it and was forked off of it for this very reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the move to other wiki idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory alphas project-scope does not include fanon with the only exception being <a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Animated_Series_3340.html" title="Star Trek: The Animated Series">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a>. This is similar to wikipedias project scope. As encyclopedic they can be, dictionary definitions or entire books are not welcome here but instead on wiktionary and wikibooks respectively.</li>

<dd>"Practically every star trek episode has a novelized non-canon (fanon) version almost always written by the same people who write the script for the episode." This is just wrong. There are exactly two novelisations of episodes or films written by the person who wrote the episode, compared to what, several hundred episodes?

<dd>Ok, I guess my knowledge is flawed. I am after all getting old. So please remind me, what is the status of the novels? Are they written by random fans? --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 11:37, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well not fans but random writers would be about right. The other problem with the novels is that because they are non-canon, the powers that be don't care if multiple writers do follow-ups to the films or novels that don't match up with each other. Take the last original cast movie - there are a number of novels set just afterwards - none of which match up. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 11:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
