<li>I ment to that we should keep the fake biography. It wouldnt be seen only by forum goers, it would be a street name where only one of the forum members works. After the street is named there is no reason for any of this to be here. The intention of this article was solely for credibility to get people to vote for the name. There was no intention to trick regular wiki users, and if left alone would have taken up its own little space until the vote.

<li><b>Locke</b>: despite the rather unfortunate fact that DaPenor's name does have some rather ...interesting... implications to it, Holden was a true pioneer, ask any historian who has studdied the colonization of Michigan. his legend clearly has been altered, but if you have ever been to some of michigan's lesser known museums, you can still see several maps with "Holden DaPenor" signed in the lower left hand corner, proof that this cartographer from the 1800's existed.</li>

<p>i did about holden for history, and even visited one of the outhouses he used.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to delete this article is doing the State of Michigan a disservice. Even if it is a fake it deserves to be kept for its humor value alone.</p>
<p>This is REAL</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Pingy</b>*: Holden Dapenor needs to be recognized as a influential member of American history. Without him, we would not have the Michigan that we have today. Besides, this can be used as historical evidence for reports for instance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Berrien County Historical Society</b>: Holden Dapenor was a real man. Although some facts are misrepresented, he was a cartographer in pioneer-era Michigan. There has been hardly any information widely released about him, hence the lack of results in search engines. We are hoping to change that, and bring Dapenor's achievments to light.</li>

<ul>
<li>If this person is real, and of great importance to the history of Michigan, then explain the following: Why does not a search on the term Holden Dapenor return ANY related results on Google, Altavista, Lycos and Yahoo? If this is a real person, he should be mentioned somewhere, at least once on the billions of pages indexed by google! If this article has any humouristic value, it should be stated clearly in the article that it is a hoax!

</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Even so, if a person is significant enough (as the article claim), he is likely to be mentioned by other sites, and not only on local historic sites!

<dd>Even if he is a local hero, let's take a look at some things....:
<dl>
<dd>Michigan has approx. 10 mill. inhabitants. The place where I come from (Sandnes, Norway) has approx. 55.000. Even so, a search on a local 'hero' of ours (Jonas Øglænd) return 600 results on google, and the only thing the man did was to produce some bikes about a hundred years ago. My point is that even if he is a local man, he should have been mentioned somewhere on the net, if not, the article is to be removed due to Wikipedias policy on verifiability and original research! You claim that the man is who he is, so it is up to you to provide us with a reputable source, instead of trying to blaim the lack of sources on the fact that he was a local hero... <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 06:48, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The creator of the thread who is also the one who came up with the idea to name the road is also an admin on totse. However creating a web-hoax and a wikipedia page was not his idea. No one in charge at totse condones any vandalism here. --<a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAGruntsJaggon_80c9.html" title="User:AGruntsJaggon">AGruntsJaggon</a> 06:20, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
