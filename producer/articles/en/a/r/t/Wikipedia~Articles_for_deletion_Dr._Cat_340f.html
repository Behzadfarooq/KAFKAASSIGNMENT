<li><b>Undecided (comment).</b> Tough call for me, but all casting their opinions on this vote should read the article's <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Talk%7EDr._Cat_695e.html" title="Talk:Dr. Cat">talk page</a>. The <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon%27s_Eye_Productions_ed27.html" title="Dragon's Eye Productions">company he founded</a> produced one notable game, <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furcadia.html" title="Furcadia">Furcadia</a>, which might warrant the inclusion of an article about the company, but it's tough stretching that justification to the designer himself.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article <i>really</i> could use some improving, yep (too tired to do anything right now, I'll try tomorrow).

<li><b>Keep.</b> (article's primary author) For starters, Dr. Cat <i>is</i> his real name, albeit not his birth name. I believe he has had it legally changed. Anyway, he is notable for being half of the then two-person team <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon%27s_Eye_Productions_ed27.html" title="Dragon's Eye Productions">Dragon's Eye Productions</a> that created two notable games, <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furcadia.html" title="Furcadia">Furcadia</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/a/DragonSpires_1392.html" title="DragonSpires">DragonSpires</a>. His contributions are already evident in the online game industry for being one of the pioneers of the <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMOSG_84a4.html" title="MMOSG">MMOSG</a> genre. His notability is likely to continue and increase with the popularity of his contributions. Google test: His in-game Furcadia pseudonym "Felorin" passes the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Felorin%22+-Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Felorin%22+-Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Google test</a> at 10,000 results, in addition to however many results are attributed to him from searching <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Dr.+Cat%22+-Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Dr.+Cat%22+-Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Dr. Cat</a>. Compare this with video game developers <a href="../../../j/u/k/Jukka_Tapanim%C3%A4ki_ab19.html" title="Jukka Tapanimäki">Jukka Tapanimäki</a> (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jukka+Tapanim%C3%A4ki%22+-Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jukka+Tapanim%C3%A4ki%22+-Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">200 results</a>) and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Bueche_2436.html" title="Chuck Bueche">Chuck Bueche</a> (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Chuck+Bueche%22+-Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Chuck+Bueche%22+-Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">800 results</a>), who have undisputed articles. Autobiography: the article wasn't written by him or anyone closely involved with him. As the article's primary author, I don't know him personally, and my only relation to him was a single brief conversation with him in-game several months ago. Bottom line: please do not judge his notability simply because the article is currently in a stub state and because his name is eccentric. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 00:38, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b>AFD those other articles if you want to. But this AFD should discuss this page, not those other articles. There haven't been any reliable sources (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) provided about this man's notability. There has been no other arguments provided other than he is a game designer of many and a couple popular games. Which doesn't make one notable. 10,000 google hits isn't close to being plenty by the way. --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 00:55, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am not disputing the other articles I mentioned. If anybody should, it's you, since you are disputing this one. I was making the point that those articles, despite returning a much fewer results with the Google test, have not been disputed once in their year and two-year histories. And personally, I do not think they should be. As for the results being not "plenty", try searching a random sample of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Game_programmers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Game_programmers" rel="nofollow">Category:Game programmers</a>. This course of action would also be appropriate for finding what the predominant opinion seems to be regarding the verifiability of sources like MobyGames. You say that creating a couple popular games and contributing to many other (also popular) games isn't enough to be notable. I disagree. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 01:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as nonnotable game designer. Doesn't seem to have been in a particularly high position on the Ultima project teams. The Furcadia game (which btw isn't even at the beta stage of development yet according to article) is not encyclopedically notable enough for the co-creator to have his own article. <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragonspires.html" title="Dragonspires">Dragonspires</a> has even less weight - article claims that when this game was developed/released in 1994, this was one of the "first ever graphical MUDs" but the Wikipedia article on MUDs cites <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_b442.html#Graphical_MUDs" title="MUD">an example of an early graphical mud dating from 1985</a>. Possible <b>merge</b> with the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furcadia.html" title="Furcadia">Furcadia</a> article. Also suggest <b>Transwiki</b> to Wikifur, if the wikifurries think he is very notable in their subculture. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:09, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
