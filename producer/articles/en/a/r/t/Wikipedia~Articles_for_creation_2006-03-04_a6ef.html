<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-04_a6ef.html" title="Edit section: Gonabadi Dervishes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gonabadi Dervishes</span></h3>
<p>gonabadi dervishes are a group of NEMAT ALLHI moslem sect but becaus the shrin of their leaders are located in the city of <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonabad.html" title="Gonabad">gonabad</a> they are called in recent decade as gonabadi dervishes , this group of dervishes are more realestic group . they are educated ,successful comunity . 21 Feb 2006</p>
<p>a specific well-known notorious group in Qom, along with members of the police, attacked the temple belonging to the Gonabadi Dervishes of Iran and occupied it. The group that was part of the attack is known as the Fatemiyoon. This groups which resides in Qom whose some leaders are ideological supporters of ultra-conservative cleric Mesbah Yazdi are affiliated to the Imam Khomeini institute in Qom. The Fatemiyoon group entered the temple and imposed its ritual, and continued this while the owner and others protested their forced entry and ritual.</p>
<p>The occupation began when the occupiers applied pressure on the temple keeper living on the premises with his wife and infant, forcing him to leave his residence. They first shut their water supply, and then they prevented the delivery of the powder milk that was sent to the family for the infant. At this time other individuals belonging to the Dervish group who knew the temple keeper well and witnessed the events thus sympathizing with the family, forced their way into the temple and re-took it from the occupiers. On January 25th, 2006, when they entered the temple, it had been vacant for 3 years and sealed by officials. The Fatemiyoon group opened the seals after occupying the sanctuary. When the Dervishes re-took the building, they were shocked at what they learned. Inside the temple, the occupiers had installed sophisticated surveillance equipment that recorded the movement of large parts of the city of Qom while their eves-dropping equipment could pick up voice signals from quite afar. The location of the Shariat temple is on Eram Avenue, Shariat Street. Eram is the most important avenue in Qom, adjacent to the residences of many of the grand ayatollahs. So the theological center had been turned into a surveillance station to spy and eavesdrop on the grand ayatollahs of Qom.</p>
<p>After the Dervishes re-took their center, they in honesty listed all the equipment, in the presence of their lawyers, and returned them to the Fatemiyoon group. From this point on the whole story takes on a different twist. An unpleasant string of events follows.</p>
<p>After the Gonabadi Dervishes re-take their center, pressure on them to leave it begins and intensifies as time goes by. Officials call the Dervishes the “occupiers.” The Qom office of the Ministry of Intelligence asks the Dervishes to leave the building. This takes place while the Fatemiyoon were openly threatening the Dervishes. They ask them to leave so the Fatemiyoon can take over the building. At this time, the Qom Intelligence office arrests and detains the four lawyers (Amir Eslami, Omid Behrouzi, Golamreza Harsini, and Farshid Yadollahi) who had been defending and negotiating the rights of the Dervishes and their center for four days. When they are released, they are given an ultimatum: the Shariat temple must be vacated in three days, on February 11, 2006. During the three day period, the Dervishes knock on every door to find a sympathetic ear for their plight. They write letters to the leader’s office and to those of some grand ayatollahs. They argue that they have absolutely no issues with the government, regime, the Islamic Republic, etc. Nothing happens.</p>
<p>On February 11, 2005 about a hundred Gonabadi Dervishes had gathered inside and outside their temple. One of them explains that on that day, they wore a black strip around an arm, as a symbolic religious act sympathizing with the martyrdom in Shiism. “We even carried flowers and pastries,” he said. But there was no friendship in sight. Facing the Dervishes who had come from all over the country and included old, young, and women, was a column of policemen who totaled in four-digit numbers, who too had been brought in from different parts of the country. The alignment clearly signaled battle. In Qom, the Dervish leader known as Seyed Ahmadi Shariati, is well respected by the local police force, which explains the presence of the out-of-town policemen.</p>
<p>As time passed, more plain-clothes men who carried walkie-talkie radios and batons began to gather on the side of the policemen. They too comprised clerics and ordinary people, two of whom carried loudspeakers who spoke to the crowd across using insulting and threatening language. One of them was a well-known prayer leader known as Salahshoor, while another was a cleric called Shahshahani who was known in Kerman to be an accomplice in the serial assassinations of the Ministry of the Intelligence in late 1990s.</p>
<p>As the group facing the Dervishes grew in size, it began to surround them. But the Dervishes and others were not intimated, while still holding their flowers, pastries, and pictures of the current and former leader of the Islamic Republic, and those of the war martyrs.</p>
<p>The attack began as the sun set. “They beat everything and everybody with their electric batons, regardless of whether it was a man, woman, or child,” said one witness. Then after hours of that, they put the top of the temple and an area around it on fire, with the Dervishes and their supporters inside the fire ring. Then began the stone-throwing by the assailants. Those who tried to flee, were beaten to death or near it. “Next to me was a woman with her tiny infant. They pushed her so that her child fell to the ground. I picked up the child and noticed that he was hardly breathing because of the tear-gas smoke. Then they attacked me, one grabbed the child from my arms, and threw him into a water ditch on the side of the street,” said a man who had experienced the whole episode. The assailants wanted to capture everyone on the side of the Dervishes and so had brought in tens of buses for this purpose. By this time, people were running in all directions and trying to flee the scene. Some of the shop-owners gave refuge to those fleeing, but they too then became the subject of attack, until the victims left the shop.</p>
<p>Eventually they occupied the temple. They also occupied Shariati’s residence. The next day, bulldozers were brought in to demolish the temple and the residence, setting fire to the property inside it. Shariati had been threatened and left his residence prior to the attack, and so survived the assault.</p>
<p>When the dust settled, it is reported that some 2,000 individuals have been detailed and jailed (the governor of Qom puts the figure at 1,000). Arrest warrants have been issued for 20 individuals in addition to Shariati and his four lawyers. Another lawyer Bahman Nazari belonging to the sect who had traveled to Qom from Tabriz was immediately arrested as soon as he approached the officials to represent the detainees and presented his practice license. <a href="http://sufinews.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://sufinews.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Between the early 1600's and the mid 1800's Arabs primarily in North Africa (Barbary) had participated in the slave trade of Europeans.Pirates from famous cities such as Sale, Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli kidnapped Christians and Jews from all over Europe to be traded as slaves. Many of these slaves were encouraged to convert to Islam through torture. European governments tried, often in vain, to negotiate the release of these slaves. Many of the Muslim rules were reluctant to release their precious 'white gold' and cheated the europeans or responded by seizing more ships. the Palace of Moulay Ismail was built almost entirely by European Christian slaves. The jews had a mixed role in the slave trade, often serving as slaves and slave owners depending on their nationality and economic status.</p>

<p>Suzanne Toolan. Sister Suzanne was born 1927 in Lansing, Michigan. At age seventeen she moved to Hollywood. In Hollywood she became a student of Richard Biggs. She earned a masters degree in humanities and then began her teaching career. She has directed choirs for high schools, colleges, parishes, and seminaries. In 1971 she came up with the song “I Am the Bread of Life”. It appeared in more hymnals and church books than any other song. It has even been translated into ten different languages. Suzanne Toolan values prayer, and it is a huge part of her life. She is known for her gentleness and quietness. She has amazing compositional skills that have increased the prayer life of many Catholics who have been to her schools or have listened to her music. She is currently a composer who still writes songs. Some other songs she wrote are Communion Processional Song, Is the Lord-Mission Hymn, and Holy, Holy, Holy. The way Suzanne Toolan made “I Am the Bread of Life” was, in 1971 she was working on some music for a Eucharistic song to be used at an archdiocesan event. Frustrated with her work, she tore up the words and threw it into a trash can. As she was leaving the room, she ran into a student who asked what music she was playing. The student thought it was very nice. She then took the scraps of paper and played it again. The song was later called “I Am the Bread of Life”.</p>

Billy was born approximately a year after his father's film <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_of_the_Apes_683c.html" title="Planet of the Apes">Planet of the Apes</a> was completed and his parents started dating. Helena was in another film at the time she found out that she was pregnant and to keep her role, she invested in a corset to wear under her costume, so as to hide that fact. Contrary to popular beleif that a corset would injure a developing child, Billy was born without any known complications. He now lives with his parents, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Burton_a41c.html" title="Tim Burton">Tim Burton</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helena_Bonham_Carter_f389.html" title="Helena Bonham Carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_England_5af2.html" title="London, England">London, England</a></p>

<p>Making timeless music is difficult and important. You may not fully understand how or why bands make such music, maybe you don’t even care.</p>
<p>Immune makes timeless music. An unearthly movement, that only after repeated listens begins to take shape. Not that these sounds are not immediate, some things just take more time and require a little more effort.</p>
<p>Reference points musically could head towards Brainiac, Massive Attack, Tool or the later work of Sneaker Pimps, but to compare Immune to others does it a huge disservice – everyone needs to feel loved...</p>
<p>Formed in early 2002 and currently based in Leeds, UK, Immune has wrapped itself up in its own world. The independent ethic owned by Immune has resulted in Gizeh Records (a label set-up and run by the band with members of Glissando), web/art design and putting on shows in and around the Leeds area.</p>
<p>2004 saw the release of ‘Elek’, a 3 track EP recorded and mixed by Immune in their own studio. It put Immune and Gizeh on the impossible musical map.</p>
<p>Immune's debut album '1/f' is released through Gizeh Recordings in April 2006.</p>

<p>Radio personality Producer Laura was born Laura Heywood, in Oakland, CA. She grew up with plans to be an actress, appearing in commercials and print advertisements for products such as <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/TIME_Magazine_fd15.html" title="TIME Magazine">TIME Magazine</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computers_4214.html" title="Apple Computers">Apple Computers</a>, and <a href="../../../g/t/e/GTE_32d3.html" title="GTE">GTE</a>. She entered college at the [[University of Puget Sound]] in 1997 on an acting scholarship, but quickly re-focused her attention to campus radio station KUPS. She became an on-air host of several shows and was hired as General Manager in the fall of 2000. During her college years, she also honed her radio chops with summer internships with <a href="../../../k/f/r/KFRC_333a.html" title="KFRC">KFRC</a> FM and the Sarah &amp; Vinnie Morning show at KLLC (Alice@97.3) in San Francisco.</p>
<p>After graduating from UPS in 2001, Laura moved back to California and immediately went to work as the interim Morning Show Producer for the Gene &amp; Julie Show at KZQZ (Z95.7 FM). This proved to be the perfect kickstart to a successful career in San Francisco radio.</p>
<p>Laura started off 2002 as an assistant producer for the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_London_bc2d.html" title="John London">John London</a> Not Just Sports Show on KNBR 680 AM. In no time, Laura became a fun and controversial part of the on-air staff, titillating the audience by arguing with John &amp; the guys about politics and sexuality. She quickly gained a fan following that made her an in-demand presence at station events.</p>
<p>While working at KNBR, Laura filled her schedule with many additional radio projects, including producing pre- and post-game broadcasts for Giants Baseball; hosting a weekend show at hip-hop station KWIN and a night show on light rock station KJOY; working on the production team for <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> game broadcasts; and launching a successful side career as a voice-over artist.</p>
<p>After two years with the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_London_bc2d.html" title="John London">John London</a> Not Just Sports Show, Laura joined the staff at sister station 107.7 The Bone (KSAN), where she worked as the producer of the Lamont &amp; Tonelli show as well as hosting the mid-day show. She continued to be extremely popular at live appearances, channeling that popularity into successful fundraising for various charities. She was also featured on a line of Laura Heywood merchandise including t-shirts, panties, lunch boxes, and Christmas ornaments.</p>
<p>In August of 2004, Laura was cast in a high-profile television commercial series for Dove Shampoo as part of the Campaign for Real Beauty. A long form version of the campaign can be seen at <a href="http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/scrollpage.asp?url=special_events.asp&amp;;id=1779" class="external free" title="http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/scrollpage.asp?url=special_events.asp&amp;;id=1779" rel="nofollow">http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/scrollpage.asp?url=special_events.asp&amp;;id=1779</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of that year, Laura left Susquehanna Broadcasting (the home of KNBR &amp; The Bone) and made the move to New York City, where she was hired by <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirius_Satellite_Radio_4c94.html" title="Sirius Satellite Radio">Sirius Satellite Radio</a> as the producer for The Bower Show on the newly formed <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxim_Radio_71f1.html" title="Maxim Radio">Maxim Radio</a>. There, she was given the moniker "Producer Laura" and gained an international fan-base.</p>
<p>Laura continues as the producer and co-host of The Bower Show. Listeners love her ability to simultaneously be one of the guys (she takes charge of sports updates, and can chug a beer like a champ), but also flaunt her sexy side, with frequent references to her buxom frame and the popular contest "Pick Laura's Panties".</p>
<p>She is having the time of her life in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, but hopes to someday return to the Bay Area to raise a family.</p>

<p>Gymnosophy was originally the doctrines of a sect of philosophers who practiced nudity and asceticism and meditation. In the early 20th century, the term was appropriated by several groups to denote a broad philosophy that included as a central thought that the nude human body is a natural condition and should be accepted widely for the betterment of society. This philosophy is related closely and, often interchangeably, with nudism and naturism.</p>

<p>There are 701 breeds of dogs. Some are the Chihuahua, Leonberger, Bernese Mountain Dog, Labrador and Maltese Terrier. All of these dogs are special, although no-one can resist their looks. Never will the dog be left out of the category of 'smart animals' so why can't humans be in that category too??</p>

<p>Arthosclerosis: Arthosclerosis involves the thickening of the arteries in your heart. Your heart is made up of a number of different passageways that carry blood. Your arteries are one of these passageways. With this type of heart disease, the inner walls of your arteries narrow due to a buildup of fat and cholesterol. As your arteries narrow, blood cannot flow through them, leading to possible heart attacks or stroke</p>

<li><b>Decline.</b> In general we do not have articles for to bootleg albums, and the inclusion of this one outtake, "Suzy Parker", doesn't seem to make it notable enough to make an exception. In any case, you haven't provided enough content to create an article, or to judge whether it deserves an article. Feel free to resubmit. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 20:34, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think, this guy from the bootlegzone (last lines) has gathered some good reasons for an article describing this historic double album :<i>......1972, I ordered it from a London Dealer who got bust. After reading about it in the NME I gave up. Six months later out of the blue it arrived. I was amazed then and continue to love this stuff. The raw rock 'n roll energy of a band still playing and laughing together continues to confound the idea that the apple was rotten at the core. The original seemed great quality but has been improved on by susequent issues. However nothing can replace the thrill of getting that sudden brown paper surprise in '72; the start of a long and winding (expensive) road. All hail <a href="../../../t/a/k/TAKRL_adbe.html" title="TAKRL">TAKRL</a>.</i> (must be an interesting bootlegger label - I don´t know).</li>

<li><b>Decline</b> (but note that I am the nominator from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Suzy_Parker_%28Beatles_Song%29_6afc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Suzy Parker (Beatles Song)">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Suzy_Parker_(Beatles_Song)</a>). There are hundreds if not thousands of 'Beatlegs' and unless some evidence is presented to suggest that this one is especially notable it's an easy and obvious decline. Personally I've never heard of it and, yes, I <i>had</i> heard of the 'Suzy Parker' track! I'd also point out that writing an article on a bootleg album which contains that track is not an appropriate response to the AFD. It doesn't alter the fact that the track in question has only one thing going for it in terms of notability: it was by The Beatles. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 01:07, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Loudspeaker colouration {link from Impulse response page} refers to subjective characteristics of a loudspeaker system's performance that are not present in the original signal being fed to the speaker. Since the late 1930's these characteritics have been given descriptions that relate to the frequency band in which they are apparent such as nasal, quacky, honky and brittle. These is a good agreement between trained listeners as to the presence of colouration in a speaker. Examination of the coloured frequency band using conventional frequency response measuring audio test equipment may or may not reveal measureable disturbances. Sensitive high resolution and time domain measuring audio test equipment may reveal buried signals or slowly decaying resonances which may be otherwise masked or not troublesome to the average listener. There is no clear correlation between subjective colouration and measurable performance.</p>
<p>Loudspeaker cones manufactured from different materials such as plastic or metal have different mechanical and acoustic properties. They may have a similar frequency responses (sound pressure responses) but they are most likely to sound subjectively different and to exhibit different colourations which can sometimes be suppressed by applying a counter layer of a lossy material, such as PVA. This will however increase the moving mass and reduce efficiency and is not frequency selective.</p>
<p>In the 1960's The British Broadcasting Corporation's Research Department pioneered the use of plastic as a loudspeaker cone material as it offered lower colouration and greater repeatability than paper cones; this has become the primary cone material.</p>

<p>David P Willoughby, who was a champion body builder in the early twentieth century, performed extensive anthropometrics measurements on highly-conditioned (male) athletes and found a direct proportionality between waist and height. His ideal form had a waist to height ratio of 45.8%. Willoughby also tabulated data for the morbidly obese, and found the same proportionality between waist and height, but with a waist to height ration of 57.7%.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although in the Metropolitan Life Tables the weight values are proportional to the square of the height (in accordance with the calculation of Quetelet's Index or Body Mass Index), in Willoughby's data the weights are proportional to the cube of the height (in accordance with Rohrer's Index).</p>
<p>The Willoughby athlete weight is then the average ideal weight for male athletes; strength-trainers may weigh more, while endurance athletes will weigh less.</p>

<p>Achintya Bheda-Abheda is a Vedanta doctrine taught by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as a synthesis of the teachings of all the Vaishnava sampradayas. It means "paradoxically (achintya) dualistic (bheda) and monistic (abheda)".</p>
<p>This central concept of Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology teaches that the absolute reality can be understood as non-dual and unmanifest (immanent brahmajyoti) and as dual (transcendent personal God). Thus it can be considered a form of panentheism. It is the philosophy followed by ISKCON (Hare Krishna movement).</p>

<p>A group of Primary Schools in the UK and Europe, led by St John Fisher primary, have been working together to create a FREE website for Primary Schools on Citizenship. Their work can be viewed at www.timeforcitizenship.org . Over 3,000 schools have now registered with us.</p>
<p>We are hoping to get children working together to discuss aspects of Citizenship across these countries. We offer prizes for submissions to the Great School Projects and the ART gallery, and give children a role in the further advance of the website. There is a very popular Problem page - problems are sent in by children and answered by children.</p>
<p>Previous project winners were primary schools in the UK, France, Spain, India, Australia, Brussels, Poland, Turkey, Belarus, Lithuania, South Africa, Ireland and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>A library of FREE lesson plans is available to teachers to download and use. We ask in return that they send us some plans or some aspects of an exciting lesson they have taught – sharing best practice.</p>
<p>There is also a section involving parents and the emergency services, particularly the police. Various police forces are using the site to share their programmes and some of the "stuff" has been very well received!</p>
<p>If you would like to view our site for Primary schools by Primary schools, you may do so on the home page of www.timeforcitizenship.org .</p>

<p>Karan Bilimoria is the founder and CEO of Cobra beer. The son of a high-ranking officer in the Indian Army, he read Law at Cambridge before qualifying as a chartered accountant. Much to his family's dismay however, he rejected the stable accounting profession in favour of numerous small business ventures; though later in life he would point to his business grounding in accounting as a contributor to his success.</p>
<p>Bilimoria originated the idea for Cobra beer after being personally dissatisfied with lager beer in the UK, believing it to be a poor companion to Indian food. Cobra beer went on to be a massive commercial success, exploiting the boom in the Indian food industry in the UK in the 1990s. Today (2006), Cobra beer turns over £60million and is brewed in thirty countries.</p>
<p>Bilimoria has been awarded various accolades, including a CBE.</p>

<p>JÓZSEF GALAMB</p>
<p>(1881 - 1955)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Born in Makó, Galamb finished his education in Budapest at the predecessor of the present-day Donát Bánki Technical College. After receiving his diploma in mechanical engineering he worked at the Steel Engineering Factory in Diósgyőr as a draftsman, then at the Hungarian Automobile Co., where he won a postgraduate scholarship to Germany. In 1903 he worked in many German cities as a skilled worker. When he learned of the American Auto World Fair in 1904, he used his savings to travel to America by ship in October. He found employment as a toolmaker at the Westinghouse Corporation.</p>
<p>He joined the Ford Motor Company (nearly two years old at that time) as a designer in December 1905. Subsequent to redesigning the cooling system for the model-N, he became the chief designer of the company, and constructed a lot of parts of the famous model-T. From 1915 he worked on the Fordson-tractor plans. In 1921 he founded a scholarship for the poor students of his native town who wished to take up higher education at trade school. During World War I he was busy designing military hardware, e. g. anti-submarine detection systems. He visited Hungary many times, lecturing at the Association of Hungarian Engineers and Architects. During World War II on Ford's suggestion, he designed a small six-cylinder car, which was completed in 1942. On doctor's orders he retired from active work in 1944.</p>

<p>Team Eighth Wonder, a group of programmers/hackers that created several programs and hacks during the year 1998-2005.</p>
<p>Their leader 'ad4' created most of the content and releases that the group produced both released and unreleased programs. The group focused mostly on ICQ related tools and bugs, but there was a majority of Email programs as well.</p>
<p>The group was very quiet about what they did, not leaving traces so it is hard to determine what they did since nothing could be traced back, one trace however can be found on zone-h.org's deface mirror where one webserver compromise by ad4 has been mirrored. So it is safe to say that the group has both the skill and knowledge in the computer security industry.</p>
<p>Information points towards ad4 of Team Eighth Wonder and RaFa of World of Hell where close friends, making the rumors about ad4's involvement in hacking to be accurate.</p>
<p>AOL/ICQ had several times contacted the group about intellectual property rights and so claiming to go to court unless their 'wants' was met.</p>
<p>The group closed down in May 2005, unsure if it will restart again. It is still unknown exactly why the group closed down but rumors points in two directions, either the heat from authorities got too much or the members did not have time to continue developing and producting things for the community.</p>
<p>Last information about the group includes the members ad4 (leader/founder), TUBORG and x0 Former members include C4w3, masTa, ka0s, anemic Other members are unknown but sayings mention at least one more member located in Malaysia.</p>

<p>The son of a commercial potter in Sebring, Ohio, artist Viktor Schreckengost learned the craft of sculpting in clay from his father. In the mid-1920s, he enrolled at the Cleveland School of Art (now the Cleveland Institute of Art, or CIA) to study cartoon making, but after seeing an exhibition at the Cleveland Museum of Art he changed his focus to ceramics. Upon graduation in 1929, he studied ceramics in Vienna, Austria, where he began to build a reputation, not only for his art, but also as a jazz saxophonist. A year later, at the age of 25, he became the youngest faculty member at the CIA. In 1931, Schreckengost won the first of several awards for excellence in ceramics at the Cleveland Museum of Art, and his works were shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>By the mid-1930s, Schreckengost had begun to pursue his interest in industrial design. For American Limoges, he created the first modern mass-produced dinnerware, called Americana. Along with engineer Ray Spiller, Schreckengost designed the first-cab-over-engine truck for Cleveland's White Motor Company. By the end of the decade, he had designed the first Mercury Bicycle for Murray, Ohio. In 1939, the bicycle and The Four Elements in clay were displayed at the New York World's Fair.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, Schreckengost's designs for children's pedal cars (as well as bicycles and toys), helped Murray, Ohio become the world's largest manufacturer of pedal cars. His design and ceramic work was interrupted by World War II, when he was recruited by the Navy to develop a system for radar recognition that won him the Secretary of Navy's commendation. After the war, Schreckengost resumed his industrial design career creating products for Murray, Sears, General Electric, Salem China Company, and Harris Printing, among others. Approximately 100 million of his bicycles were manufactured by Murray, making it the largest bicycle-maker in the world. H</p>
<p>Throughout his distinguished career, Schreckengost remained on the faculty of the Cleveland Institute of Art, where he founded industrial design program in 1933, and which became one of the most important design programs in the U.S. As a teacher, his legacy is lasting, and he influenced many designers, including the creators of the Ford Mustang, the Little Tykes playhouses and plastic cars, and the Crest Spin toothbrush.</p>

One of the pictures accompanying the centerfold spread features Lorrie holding onto a diving board while floating on her back in a swimming pool, with her exposed front very visible. The caption to the picture reads "A pig-tailed Lorrie pools her resources"--an obvious reference to her body.</p>

<p>Black Sheep Ale is a tradiitonal Ale which can be bought among many mining villages throuhgout britain. Despite the creamyly bitter taste of Black Sheep Ale there have been some who discredit it, and inevitably there are those who enjoy the 'fine' taste of the Ale.

<p>Mr G A Parry, OBE</p>
<p><br />
Born in the suburbs of Gwynedd in the early 70s, Mr G A Parry was raised in local orphans from the age of just 2 years old. Moving from 'orphan-to-orphan', G developed intrest and experience of lifestyles and cultures, which he used as motivation throughout harsh times in his 'orphan career'. Determined that he deserved a better quality of life, his lack of knowledge of standards beyond the harsh lifestyle of the 1980s Gwynedd, developed a sense of confusion during Mr Parry's teens. This therefore, fuled his imagination during his school years, which later resulted in his earning of a placement in the University of Cambridge to study Cultural History.</p>
<p>Mr Parry fell in love with Mongolian culture, and decided to further his knowladge of the subject by exploring caves of Mongolian mountainious regions on completion of his Degree. Determined to explore Mongolia, Mr G A Parry resigned university life on entry for his PHD course, and headed for Mongolia.</p>
<p>He earned his respect within Mongolian tribes, and developed wealth from books and documents published in Mongolia, based on his discoveries. His intrest gradually turned towards the 'Father of Mongols',(as stated in Mr G Parry's book, Mongolia; A history from the deeps)Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>Determined to influence Genghis's work upon local tribes, Mr Parry has encouraged a number of 'dying' tradditional skills used for generations in Mongolia, such as wild butterfly-tracking.</p>
<p>Mr Parry had also pushed influence of Mongolian-British relations of the right-wing parties of the modern day British Government we have today. All though, he addmits, was by far the least he would suspect, Mr Parry was awarded an OBE for his influence of the Mongol-British relation.</p>
<p><br />
Because of his knowledge of Mongolian culture, Mr Parry was selected for the role of a judge for the 1998 "Top 10 Cultural Legends of the Millennium".</p>

<p>The Alien Bounty Hunter is a shapeshifting extraterrestrial from the TV show "The X-Files". The Bounty Hunter is called upon a number of times throughout the sereis by the Syndicate, and sometimes by the Alien Colonists, to eliminate those who may be a threat to "the project". The Bounty Hunter is portrayed by Brian Thompson.</p>
<p>The Alien Bounty Hunter makes his first appearance in the Season 2 episode "Colony". In this appearance, he introduces a weapon that would become his staple, and one of show, a retractable, ice pick-style weapon that is used to kill aliens.</p>
<p>The Bounty Hunters biggest apeearances are in the two part, Season 3 finale/Season 4 opener, "Talitha Cumi" and "Herrenvolk", respectively. In these episodes, the Bounty Hunter is sent to eliminate Jeremiah Smith, a renegade alien. The Hunter catches up to Smith and Mulder at a gravel yard, but Mulder stabs him in the back of the neck with an ice pick weapon and escapes with Smith. When Scully goes to investigate the seemingly dead Bounty Hunter, the alien rises up and removes the weapon, Mulder having missed the fatal blow. He forces Scully to give the location of Mulder and Smith, and then departs to meet them. Their next encounter is in a large facility that holds numerous bees. He attacks Mulder, Smith and who is thought to be Mulder's sister, Samantha, inside the facility, but has part of the hive pushed on him and is attacked by the bees as Mulder adn the others escape. He meets Mulder again, horribly scarred from the bee stings, after Mulder has told Smith and Samantha to flee. The Bounty Hunter easily lifts Mulder up by the neck and delivers the line that replaces "The Truth is Out There" in the opening:</p>
<p><b>Mulder: Take me, let them go...</b></p>
<p><b>Bounty Hunter: You would give up your life for theirs?</b></p>
<p><b>Mulder: For my mothers.</b></p>
<p><b>Bounty Hunter: <i>Everything dies.</i></b></p>
<p>The Bounty Hunter then knocks Mulder out and presumably kills Smith and Samantha.</p>
<p>The Bounty Hunter appears a few more times throughout the series, elimintaing an Alien Seperatist in "The Red and the Black" and an alien who endangers the project in "The Unnatural".</p>
<p>He makes his last appearance in the Season 8 episode "Without". He is dispatched to elminate Gibson Praise, who Scully is attempting to protect. He eventually manages to corner them, but is shot through the back of the neck by Scully and is killed.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-04_a6ef.html" title="Edit section: Click to Call">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../c/l/i/Click_to_Call_1dd4.html" title="Click to Call">Click to Call</a></span></h2>
<p>Click-to-call services let users click a button and immediately speak with a customer service representative. Customers can either place a call over the computer using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology or request an immediate call back from the advertiser by entering their phone number. Unlike a toll-free phone number, click-to-call services allow companies to monitor and control when and where online visitors migrate from the Web to the phone sales channel.</p>
<p>A solution for click-to-call is totally different (and much more complex) than simply hooking phones together. It also requires things like self-<a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisioning.html" title="Provisioning">provisioning</a> for buttons and links; ability to manage, control, and route calls; reporting and analysis tools; advanced functions like bi-directional <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_transfer.html" title="Data transfer">data transfer</a>; complementary tools like click-to-chat and call tracking; etc.</p>
<p>Click to call services "voice-enable" any online medium, including your Web site, advertising banners, search engine ads and even outbound customer e-mails. Instead of dialing a phone number, your customers simply click a customized graphic to speak immediately with a telephone sales or customer service agents. Using <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_telephony_5717.html" title="IP telephony">IP telephony</a>-based click-to-call services, callers can use any land-line or cellular phone by simply entering their phone number. Standard phone calls are placed to both the customer and your inbound call center, and the calls are connected together. Or, if their PC is equipped with a microphone and speakers, customers can also choose to talk directly from their PC without installing any special software.</p>
<p>This allows companies to avoid the informational black hole of traditional phone contact by opening the door to bi-directional data passing and increased opportunities for collaboration between buyers and sellers. Plus, it ensures continuity of experience for the end-user between the online and offline channel. In the case of an online transaction, users that click to call from an e-commerce Web site won't have to be re-verified or authenticated by the call center since the context of their Web session is delivered straight to the call center agent's desktop. This equips the call center agent with the information they need to better assist the customer, and it relieves the usual customer anxiety of having to start all over again when they jump from the Web to the voice channel.</p>
<p>The ability to smoothly transition customers from a Web session to a voice channel is one of the largest potential benefits of using IP-based click to call services. Conventional phone calls cause a very disruptive gap in the customer experience, because customers are forced to abandon their Web sessions and literally “start all over again” with a call center agent.</p>
<p>Cross-channel data passing ensures a seamless continuity of experience by transferring information about the customer and the context of their online session directly to the call center at the time of call initiation. The call center software can be configured to display this information directly on the agent's desktop screen, or it can use the incoming data values to trigger lookups into the company’s own databases to retrieve related details (Customer records, purchase history, billing information, etc.)</p>

<p>Similar to <a href="../../../p/a/y/Pay_per_click.html" title="Pay per click">pay per click</a>, pay per call is a business model for ad listings in search engines and directories that allows publishers to charge local advertisers on a per-call basis for each lead (call) they generate. The term "pay per call" is sometimes confused with click to call. Click-to-call, along with call tracking, is a technology that enables the “pay-per-call” business model.</p>
<p>According to the Kelsey Group, the pay-per-phone-call market is expected to reach US$3.7 billion by 2010.</p>

<p>Dickson's Of Erskine is a bus company that runs between Paisley, Scotland and Glasgow, Scotland. It has a small fleet (roughly 15) of reasonably old buses from the mid - ninties. The companies colours are blue, red and white. The comapny is favoured over the larger bus companies on that route as they charge less fares and generally give a more reliable service. Unfortunately though, the company has had to downsize, selling off their better buses, to survive the threat from the other major bus companies that run that rout, notably Arriva and First Group. The company depot is located in Hawkhead, a suburb of the town of Paisley.</p>

10,000 Belarusian citizens have gathered today in Svaboda (Freedom) Square in Minsk to meet the candidate of united democratic forces, Alyaksandr Milinkevich. Thousands of interior troops, SWAT, riots police officers, have been drawn to the city. SWAT commander Dzmitry Paulichenka was in charge of the force operation. He is suspected of abductions and murders of Belarusian oppositionists and a journalist. Today this man in public has beaten up three persons. In the morning he beat up the presidential hopeful, ex-rector of the Belarusian State University Alyaksandr Kazulin, and in the evening he assaulted the Radio Svaboda reporter Valery Kalinouski, who wanted to make an interview with him. Besides, he hit a deputy chairman of the Belarusian Popular Front party Viktar Ivashkevich. Paulichenka’s subordinates or some other special services’ men even fired in a car of Kazulin’s team members, who were trying to picture how law-enforcers were seizing and beating up people who had come to a police department of Kastrychnitski district of Minsk to support the arrested candidate for presidency Kazulin.</p>
<p>The center of Minsk was cordoned off since morning. Delegates of the so-called “all-Belarusian people’s assembly” were taken to the Palace of Republic by buses. The delegates were to support the policy of the dictatorship. October Square was fenced off by special barriers and cordoned off by policemen and policemen in mufti. Only persons with special passes were allowed to enter the square. As a result, traffic in Skaryna (Independence) Avenue has been blocked for the whole day today.</p>
<p>By 6 p.m. Svaboda Square, where presidential hopeful Alyaksandr Milinkevich was to meet with voters, was cordoned off as well. However, people were not stopped by that. Lenin Street, adjacent to Svaboda Square, was filled with thousands of Minsk dwellers, who wanted to meet with their candidate. People were holding portraits of Alyaksandr Milinkevich, streamers “Freedom!”, “Milinkevich!”, national white-red-white flags, blue flags with Our Lady of Minsk icon. Activsts of youth movements put up jeans shirts at flagpoles. People were chanting “Milinkevich!”, “Long Live Belarus!”, “Freedom! Truth! Justice!”</p>
<p>Syarhei Kalyakin, the head of Alyaksandr Milinkevich’s campaign headquarters, has called upon people to go to the Palace of Sports in Masherau Avenue. People went to the palace slowly and in an orderly way, however the way was stopped by thousands of riot policemen, SWAT and interior troops. Law-enforcers were equipped well: they had helmets, truncheons and shields. Trying to intimidate people, they were taking threatening attitudes, rattling by truncheons on their shields and shouting “Wolves!” (a battle cry of some special forces). However people were not frightened. They were laughing at them, looking in their faces closed by visors, cried “Shame!”</p>
<p>The single candidate Alyaksandr Milinkevich stood in front of the wall of thousands of law-enforcers. He tried to appeal to conscience of each of them. He asked not to use violence against their people. After that Milinkevich and his team delivered speeches at the stairs of the sports center “labour reserves”. Milinkevich and his supporters were enclosed by policemen, but the candidate and his team still addressed the meeting.</p>
<p>Alyaksandr Milinkevich called upon people not to have fear, as actions of law-enforcing agencies are illegal. They are violating both Criminal and Electoral Code by preventing people to meet with the candidate for presidency. Milinkevich urged to come to Kastrychnitskaya (October) Square in Minsk on March 19, at 8 p.m., to sum up the results of the presidential elections. The single candidate took off a blue scarf and said: “Like the Zubr leader Mikita Sasim, when he was beaten up during a peaceful action on September 16, put up a jeans shirt instead of a flag, I want to put up my blue scarf and say: blue is our colour!”</p>
<p>The speeches of Milinkevich and his team members were accompanied by people’s chanting “Freedom!”, “Long Live Belarus!”, “Milinkevcih!” and “We shall win!”</p>
<p>After opposition leaders’ speeches a candidate for presidency Alyaksandr Kazulin arrived to Svaboda Square from a hospital. He was released earlier. Former rector of the Belarusian State University was released at 6 p.m. He came to Freedom Square on foot, to meet people. Kazulin also tried to talk to riot police, SWAT and interior troops. “You all are our sons! What are you doing with your fellow citizens!” the candidate said. As said by him, he saw understanding in the eyes of policemen, who “did not want to commit a crime and beat their friends, brothers and sisters”.</p>
<p>Today Milinkevich’s and Kazulin’s pre-recorded speeches, with some outtakes, were broadcast on Belarusian TV. People who watched TV speeches, are viewed as brilliant. Many Belarusians, participants of today’s events, say that March 2 has become the beginning of the Belarusian revolution.</p>

<p>Jack Wyatt Sundheim was born on February 21, 1989. Son of Karen and Brian Sundheim he has grown up in Glencoe, Illinois. Jack has two brothers Taylor and Luke Sundheim, who have arguably achived much more than Jack, maybe not Taylor. Jack had tried many activities with some sucess and limited failure. There is one object Jack loves more than even his family, money. The first major entreprenuership Jack started was his clown business. He preformed under the name "Jacko the Clown". Jack's specialties were balloon animals and magic tricks. The next profession Jack sought after was professional poker. Jack was able to dominate compition in the New Trier district. He decided to take poker more seriously by wagering online. Jack had many ups and downs winning and losing thousands of dollars. This pressure hurt Jack too much, so he decided to take his professional gambling to a less serious level. Instead he decided to place bets with bookies and on-line bookies. After Jack realized that the bookies had it good making hundreds of dollars off of him, he decided to make a new profession as a certified bookie. Some how Jack lost at this even with the juice in his favor. Now, Jack is just a casual gambler with a small addiction. During this time of prefession in business, Jack decided to try his abilities in sports. Jack accelled in Gymnastics, Baseball, Wrestling, Football, but not so much in AYSO soccer. Along with his strong morals in sports and gambling, Jack Sundheim has powerful political beliefs. Jack considers himself a member of the republican party. He views include prolife, a strong Israel, capital punishment, war in Iraq, NO gay rights, lower taxes, and manditory bible studies at public schools (new testiment). Jack is very proud of his beliefs and will back up his ideas at any cost. Clearly, Jack is and is going to be a sucessful man. He wants to become a doctor, but is still looking for a profession to make more money. Even more important to Jack is to be a good person? Yes. Jack shows more potenial than anyother person in his blood line, and there have been famous baseball and producers in his family.</p>

<p>The UBM is a sandwich created by a student from Benet Academy on Thursday, February 22, 2006. It was meant for only the extremely hungry.</p>
<p>The UBM is a fairly large sandwich, approximately 2 feet in diameter. It, of course, is enclosed in two large sesame seed buns toasted to your liking. The layers of the burger are as follows: lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, cheese, French fries, ketchup, more cheese, onions, chicken nuggets, more lettuce, a slab of ribs, a flattened dwarf cow, and a third and final layer of cheese. In the interior of the sandwich, there is to be a cylindrical hole 4 inches in diameter. This hole will extend through the top of the sandwich. It will be filled with mint shake. It is not determined how this shake is to be prevented from spreading throughout the sandwich, but possible ideas are surrounding it with a layer of cheese or lard; suggestions will be accepted.</p>
<p>This sandwich has not yet been created, but mass production is expected to begin in summer ’06. Manufacturing costs will be approximately $35 per sandwich. The sandwiches will be sold anywhere from $40 to $50.</p>

They are a mixture of natural streams and rivers along with artifical cuts. Whilst they were originally intended to drain the land they have also been used for navigation for over two hundred years, with 87 miles of waterway being navigable. The drainage of the area has caused the land to sink to below sea level so that pumping stations are now necessary to maintain drainage. The area includes the lowest point in the UK, which is near <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holme.html" title="Holme">Holme</a>.</p>

<p>scientific morality Broad scope of scientific responsibility, primary concern being the analysis of potential dangerous avenues of scientific investigation and experimentation. This is to be a non political peer review analysis of potentially dangerous research which could result in an irreversible danger to mankind or nature.</p>
<p>The "Scientific Morality Organization" would have to be a non political group with principle investigators required to sign confidentiality agreements and agreements not to offer biased results and opinion. Further more this organization would be required to have a watchdog arm , and international law would require all research groups to report any experimentation that may fall under "Dangerous Research" guidelines. This indicates a possible United Nations over sight of this organization.</p>

<p>A native of the golden West, Hipp-e has pushed the envelope of dance music from the tender age of 16. After years of parties and inspiration from other DJ's and Producers, Hipp-e decided it was time to try his hand at making music that better suit the left-coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Teaming up with partner Siesta Music in their new home of San Diego, their new friends at Soma in Glasgow, label giant Hooj Choons, and even for the East coast legends at Yoshitoshi. As a result, they drew the attention of the world to the self-contained music industry of the West coast.</p>
<p>The next phase of his skyrocketing career saw him able to take his sound to the world in the form of his legendary DJ sets. Playing slots at Fabric London, Turbo Toronto, Zouks Singapore, Soma Glasgow, Twilo New York, More Amsterdam Pacha Buenos Aires, and Allenby Tel-Aviv turned the heads of the clubbers who thought they had seen and heard it all. His sets at raves in New Zealand, Montreal, Turkey, Croatia, Spain, Brazil and all over the United Stateshave reintroduced the concept that prime-time doesn't mean prime-speeds and has the ravers listening for a change.</p>
<p>Even though one might wonder when he finds the time, Hipp-e has continued to push himself in the studio, developing a sound that belongs solely to him. His solo production for labels like NRK, Soma, Product Deluxe, and Tango has garnered instant reaction from international DJ's and has those more negative individuals that predicted some sort of Hipp-e / Halo backlash quickly zipping their lips. In addition to building his studio knowledge, Hipp-e is venturing into more unknown territory. As A&amp;R for San Francisco based Tango Recordings , he is able to take his knack for finding amazing records to play out and apply it to finding upcoming producers from around the world who will help to shape the future of dance music. With a DJ schedule that shows no signs of slowing down, and a resume that already puts him at the top of his field, and an ever growing potential in the studio, Hipp-e will continue to realize his dreams and inspire the rest of the industry.</p>
<p>After the huge success of the "Environments" album, a concept that he and Halo worked on together with live musicians and represents the fusion of styles that has become their trademark, the boys now feel it is time to move on with their careers. They have amicably agreed to go their separate ways, with Hipp-e representing the H-Foundation moniker, and each of them DJing as solo artists.</p>

<p>"A Manchester-based 5 piece, The Headlines are an experimental indie band with influences ranging form Biffy Clyro to The Smiths. Filled with catchy guitar riffs and stomping rhythms, they display a musical ability and uniqueness well beyond their years. The quintet have been together just over a year. Gigs during the fringe of In The City and continued headline shows in and around Manchester and London this year have set an excellent foundation for one of the city’s brightest young bands."</p>

<p>Quazatron is a game released by Hewson Consultants in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, based on a Commodore 64 game called Paradroid.</p>
<p>You play KLP-2 ("Klepto") and your job is to wander around the various levels of the city of Quazatron, connected by underground passages, and destroy all robot life therein. Once all robot life is destroyed, the map turns blue.</p>
<p>Enemies are destroyed by a pulse laser with which you are armed. But you can upgrade this and other parts of your shell, by grappling with robots and assimilating them upon victory.</p>
<p>The grapple mode gives you control of half the grapple board, and some laser firing triangles. The better your robot, the more you get. You start with 3. Shoot boxes in the middle of the opposing colour and it will turn your colour. The big box at the top tells who is winning. The game is over after a short time and the winning colour is shown in that top box.</p>
<p>If you win, you get to select parts from the opposing robot. Some may be burnt out depending on how convincing your grapple win was.</p>
<p>The better components however are unstable and will need to be constantly replaced, otherwise they will burn out by themselves.</p>
<p>If you lose a grapple, or your interfaced parts burn out, your original components will be used once again. If you lose another grapple then, its game over.</p>
<p>Other upgrades are weapons and devices. Watch out for the disruptor, which damages everything on screen. You can get shields for this, often from those robots armed with it.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-04_a6ef.html" title="Edit section: Situational Offenders">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Situational Offenders</span></h2>
<p>Situational Offenders normally applies to <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> type actions against children, and while it is not considered to be accepted by civilized people in the Western World to be acceptable behavior towards children. It has been found that Situational Offending can occur even when there are no attractions to children (for this article, a child is a person who has not reached the age of eighteen [18] years of age). However there are times when both parties involved in Situational Offending to be of above eighteen [18] years of age, but is still considered to be objectionable behavior in most Western cultures. This relates to such events such as <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a>. Or where the person is in a professional situation such as a teacher (boarding schools) or where the person is in care of a government provided care.</p>
<p><br />
Situational Offending is normally considered to be 'out of character' for the person to be involved with a child, and normally would be a one off offense, however it is still plausible for it to be repeated many times.</p>
<p><br />
Most situations where Situational Offending occurs is between family members, mother and child or father and child or where a close relationship such as friendship is there and live in close living conditions that would normally become stressed and needed because of certain events.</p>
<p><br />
While Situational Offences do require situations to need to occur for the behavior to happen, those situations can not be pre-identified because of variations in humans. For example the death of a loving partner may be destructive enough for a father and daughter to become close enough to engage in sexual activities. In this case it would the father that ‘needed his wife’ or the daughter replaced his wife in the sense of taking on the roll of being a ‘mother’ type person in the fathers, families, or other people’s eyes.</p>
<p><br />
It is not considered for a identified (as in the person has only called themselves) heterosexual person to act on homosexual relations, it would still be possible if the bond that was between the older person and the younger person was such that they already had a close (non-sexual) relationship before the event happened.</p>
<p><br />
Most Situational Offences only happen once, however in example of the daughter becoming a ‘mother’ type person; it would become more common for the father and daughter to engage in sexual actives. These acts can range from masturbation sessions to sessions of actual sex (or love making). While the law should not take this into account when sentencing a person to illegal activities with a child , it is more lenient to do so.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-04_a6ef.html" title="Edit section: Accounting Concepts and Conventions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Accounting Concepts and Conventions</span></h2>
<p>Accounting Concepts: Accounting is a system evolved to achieve a set of objectives. In order to achieve the goals, we need a set of rules or guidelines. These guidelines are termed here as “Basic Accounting Concepts”. The term ‘concept’ means an idea or thought. Basic Accounting concepts are the fundamental ideas or basic assumptions underlying the theory and practice of financial accounting. These concepts are termed as ‘Generally Accepted Accounting Principles’. These are the broad working rules of accounting activity. They are evolved over a period in response to changing business environment. They are developed and accepted by the accounting profession. The concepts guide the identification of events and transactions to be accounted for. The concepts help in bringing about uniformity in the practice of accounting. In accountancy following concepts are quite popular.</p>
<p>1. Business Entity Concept: Business is treated separate from the proprietor. All the transactions are recorded in the books of business and not in the books of the proprietor. The proprietor is also treated as a creditor for the business. When he contributes capital he is treated as a person who has invested his amount in the business. Therefore, capital appears in the liabilities of Balance Sheet of the proprietor. Effect: Financial position of the business can be easily found out. Earning capacity of business can be easily ascertained.</p>
<p>2. Going Concern Concept: This concept relates with the long life of the business. The assumption is that business will continue to exist for unlimited period unless it is dissolved due to some reason or the other. When financial accounts are prepared, record is made for outstanding expenses and prepaid expenses because of the assumption that business will continue. Going concern concept helps other business undertakings to make contracts with specific business unit for business dealings in future. Effect: Working life of asset is taken into consideration for writing of depreciation because of this concept.</p>
<p>3. Money Measurement Concept: Only those transactions are recorded in accounting which can be expressed in terms of money. The transactions which cannot be expressed in money fall beyond the scope of accounting. One serious shortcoming of this concept is that the money value of that date is recorded on which transaction has taken place. It does not recognise the changes in the purchasing power of monetary unit. Effect: In the absence of this concept, it would have not been possible to add various possessions. It fails to keep any record of such matters which cannot be expressed in terms of money.</p>
<p>4. Cost Concept: According to this concept, an asset is recorded at its cost in the books of account, i.e., the price which is paid at the time of acquiring it. In balance sheet, these assets appear not at cost price every year, but depreciation is deducted and they appear at the amount which is cost less depreciation. Under this concept, all such events are ignored which affect the business but have no cost. Effect: Under this concept, market price is ignored. Balance sheet indicates financial position on cost and expired cost basis. This concept is mainly for fixed assets. Current assets are not affected by it. Current assets appear in balance sheet at cost or market price whichever is lower. But both these assets are acquired at cost price.</p>
<p>5. Accounting Period Concept: Every businessman wants to know the result of his investment and efforts after a certain period. Usually one year period is regarded as an ideal for this purpose. It may be 6 months or 3 years also. This period is called accounting period. It depends on the nature of business and object of the proprietor of business. From taxation point of view one year period is necessary as income-tax is payable every year. Effect: Financial position and earning capacity of one year may be compared with another year.</p>
<p>6. Dual Aspect Concept: Under this concept, every transaction has got a two fold aspect- (i)Benefit receiving aspect (ii) Benefit giving aspect. For instance, when a firm acquires an asset (receiving of the benefit), it must have to pay cash (giving of the benefit). Therefore, two accounts are to be passed in the books of accounts, one for receiving the benefit and the other for giving the benefit. Effect: The accounting equation, i.e., Assets = Equities (liabilities+ capital) is based on this concept. This concept helps in detecting the errors of employees and in having strict control over them. This concept is of great help in indicating the true position of the business.</p>
<p>7. Matching Concept: Every businessman is eager to make maximum profit at minimum cost. Hence, he tries to find out revenue and cost during the accounting period. An accountant records all expenses of a year (whether they are paid in cash or are outstanding) and all revenues of a year (whether they are received in cash or accrued). Expenses which are incurred during a particular accounting period for earning the revenue of the related period are to be considered. All expenses incurred during the accounting period must not be taken. Only relevant cost should be deducted from the revenue of a period for periodic income statement. The process of relating costs to revenue is called ‘matching process’. Effect: Proprietor can easily know about his profit or loss. 8. Realisation Concept: Every business unit spends money to purchase goods or to manufacture goods for sale. Profits cannot be made only by manufacture. Sale of goods either for cash or on credit is essential to make earning. Without realization of sale proceeds, there can be no profit. Unearned/unrealized revenue should not be taken into account. For example, when an order is received from a customer, it does not mean that the revenue is earned or realized. On the other hand, when an advance payment is made by a customer, the same cannot be treated as revenue realized or earned. Effect: No earnings can be made by a business unit without realization.</p>
<p>9. Accounting Equivalence Concept: The proprietor provides funds for acquisition of assets. Hence the assets owned by the business must be equal to the funds provided by the proprietor. Fund provided by the proprietor is called Equity. Hence accounting equivalence concept is: Assets = Equities. In addition to own funds, money is borrowed which is known as ‘liability’. Therefore, assets are acquired through equity and liability. Therefore, accounting equation is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Assets = Owner’s equity + Liabilities</dd>
</dl>
<p>Effect: Any business transaction can be recorded on the basis of this concept. Really speaking, the principle of double entry system that every debit has a corresponding credit is based on this concept.</p>
<p>10. Verifiable Objective Evidence Concept: This concept relates with the verification of accounting record with the outside evidence. Outside evidence means study of those documents and vouchers on the basis of which accounting record has been made. Effect: vouchers, documents, etc., help a lot in auditing.</p>
<p><br />
Accounting Conventions: Accountancy is based on usages and customs. Custom or usage is a practice which is in use since long. Naturally accountants have to adopt that usage or custom. These termed as ‘Conventions’. In accounting, conventions are also known as ‘Doctrines’. Major conventions are used in preparation of final accounts.</p>
<p>1. Convention of Disclosure: Accounting records and statements should be honest and materially informative. Exclusion of material facts makes them incomplete and unreliable. Financial statements must convey all significant economic information relating to the entity. Therefore, care should be taken to disclose all material information while making accountancy record. Hence emphasis is only on material information.</p>
<p>2. Convention of Materiality: Materiality means ‘relative importance, whether a matter should be disclosed or not in the financial statements depends on its materiality, i.e., whether it is material or not. According to this convention, accounting record should be made of all material facts. Immaterial items may either be mixed with material items and then recorded or these may be ignored. An item is considered material if it has an effect on forming opinion.</p>
<p>3. Convention of Consistency: Adopting of same practice over and over again is an old convention. Continuance of one practice in number of years indicates consistency. Whatever accounting practice has been adopted in one year, same should be continued in other future years also. For example, if an asset is depreciated on diminishing balance method in one year, the same method of depreciation be adopted in other years also. It does not mean that once a method has been adopted, it can never be changed. If better method is found, it must be followed, but a note for making a change must be made in the accounts. The most advantage of this convention is that it facilitates comparison of one year’s accounts with other years.</p>
<p>4. Convention of Conservatism: Future is uncertain though an estimate may be made about future events, no one can guess future with perfect certainty in business. Therefore, some arrangement or provision is made to meet future uncertainties. Every sincere businessman makes an estimate of future losses and then some provision for it is made as provision for bad debts. Businessmen mostly ignore the items of future profits. This tendency is termed as conservatism. Therefore, the common accounting practices are: i) Do not consider any income or gain till the same is realized in cash. ii) Create or make a provision for future expected losses and contingencies on the basis of past performances.</p>

The French Overture is in the form of a <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_suite.html" title="Dance suite">dance suite</a>, but is typical of Bach in being atypical of most suites: It has no <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allemande.html" title="Allemande">Allemande</a>, and the <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigue.html" title="Gigue">Gigue</a> is not the last, but penultimate movement; the last being an Echo.</p>
<p>The opening movement is a French Overture, in ABA form: It begins with an <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adagio.html" title="Adagio">Adagio</a> section, moves on to an <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegro.html" title="Allegro">allegro</a> <a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugal.html" title="Fugal">Fugal</a> <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritornello.html" title="Ritornello">ritornello</a> section, and then repeats the opening.

<p>The snakeskin gourami is a very suitable fish for the community or semi-aggressive aquarium.</p>
<p>(Trichogaster Pectoralis)</p>
<p>Characteristics: Pale green to silvery body with a line of dark blotches along the side.</p>
<p>Compatability: A non-aggressive species that is timid toward other tankmates.</p>
<p>Special Care: Provide plenty of hiding spaces and keep away from large cichlids.</p>
<p>Diet: Frozen brine and flake foods.</p>
<p>Tank: 25 or more.</p>
<p>This gourami is a very nice and intresting fish to have, but you must at least have a little experience with the aquarium. If small holes appear in it's head, it doesn't have a disease but your PH is low.</p>

<p>Whenever anybody asks me a question about divorce, I refuse to answer it until I have first talked about two other subjects, namely, marriage and reconciliation. For God's purpose is marriage, not divorce, and his gospel is good news of reconciliation. We need to see Scripture as a whole, and not isolate the topic of divorce. -John Stott</p>
