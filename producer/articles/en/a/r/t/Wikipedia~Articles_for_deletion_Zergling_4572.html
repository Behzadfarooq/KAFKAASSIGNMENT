<p>The result was <b>delete</b> with the possibility of transwiki. The prevailing wind here is that these articles are more than we need, and any possible merge targets already contain ample information on the subjects. As I don't think the StarCraft wiki is really a sister project of ours, I'm not going to mess with trying to transwiki this whole thing (also, it is possible/likely that their articles are better than what was here!). If someone would like the deleted content to do the transwiki work themselves, drop me a line.

<li><b>Don't Delete!</b>, If this is removed from Wiki then obviously we have to go even further than that. Anything pertaining to Star Wars or Star Trek in complete details involving planets and race's have to be marked for deletion as well. If you remove one set of fictional articles, you remove them all. Personally, I don't think this is a path that should be traversed. --Wil2197 14:23, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

If one includes <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeo_and_Juliet_141f.html" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>, must we include every play ever written?

<li><b>Eh?</b> I too am in favor of transwiki-ing, and you are right to point of the slippery slope fallacy. However! Starcraft is one of the most culturally notable videogames ever.

<li><b>Keep Zergling, delete the rest</b> Ironically, the title of this AfD is the one that should be kept, and seeing it on the afd list piqued my interest to come here and say so. Do we need an article on every SC unit? No way. But the Zergling has become extremely notable in popular culture - the term has come to be a word on its own, and is also more symbolic of the game as a whole than any other unit. However, it should be made into more of an article explaining these points than the strategy-guide reading they get having one for each unit. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 19:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Additional comment to my above - While I originally said keep zergling, delete rest, I'd like to clarify I have nothing againt a transwiki, as seems to be the growing consensus. The thing is, while I don't know the SC wiki, I would assume they probably already have info on all these units, and probably more about them than we do. But if not, then sure, trans away. Also, there have been a few suggestions to merge to a list. I would say that this is probably the best way of keeping any info here, as a list of units with minor single-line-ish info. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 03:11, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete, transwiki, smerge</b>, any would be an appropriate solution to this problem. Goldom <i>may</i> be right that zergling should be kept, but I think it's really the concept of the "zerg rush" that's the culturally notable thing (I know what "zerg rush" means, I didn't know that it involved zerglings), and that is quite adequately covered in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28computer_and_video_games%29.html" title="Rush (computer and video games)">Rush (computer and video games)</a>. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:57, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge/Transwiki</b> It appears Wikipedia is on an AfD rampage, but this one actually might be justified... however total deletion is still stupid and pointless, and the slippery sloper argument is becoming increasingly valid. Merge them into Starcraft Units, etc. or transwiki them to where they fit better. But don't delete outright. The game guide stuff should not survive any such change however, but it seems that rather than fix articles, Wikipedia is just deleting them altogether. I'm not sure that's a good idea. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs">David Fuchs</a> 22:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete All</b> game guide. Someone could take all of this material slap "StarCraft Game Guide" on the cover and make some good money selling this at Barnes and Nobel. As to the slippery slope there is a difference between video games and movies or books. There is no issues of "succeeding" or "doing well" at movies or books. ALthough this should not mean that video games or individual components of videogames are inherently game guide material. For example <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a> is highly notable and the article about him has no useful information in the execution of any of the vast number of games in which he has appeared. It is the collection of small bits of information that is useful in playing the game and fail any notablilty outside of the game that is the issue.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 23:09, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

As for the quality issues, these should be resolved by <b>IMPROVING</b> rather than deleting articles. From what I've seen, most of what has been called original research is actually insufficiency of references; these issues can be addressed by deleting true OR and improving the articles with more and better references for the objective information. As for notability, there is little question, as the references a few lines up indicate, that Starcraft is one of the most popular video games in the world and has remained so for the over eight years since its release, with indicators such as media coverage and endorsement contracts for professional Starcraft players (!) continuing to go up. As for the fuzzy, poorly defined "game guide" objection to encyclopedic worthiness, the proper dividing line is an active area of discussion, but I think should be between providing recommandations on strategy (not encyclopedic), and providing objective information on details of how the game works, as we do for detailed explanations of the rules for any notable game or sport (encyclopedic). Otherwise, where is there a principled dividing line between eliminating specific game mechanics, and eliminating any rules of a game, and eliminating any content at all related to a game or sport? If forms of recreation are encyclopedic at all, providing specific descriptions of their rules or mechanics should be limited only by the same criteria as for anything else, i.e. notability, references, etc. An apt comparison here might be made to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a>, which has <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7EChess_9633.html" title="Category:Chess">dozens of categories</a>, with up to 137 articles per category; these are all properly encyclopedic as well, and must have been found so by the untold number of WP editors it must have taken to write them and who must have read them without a problem. I for one find them relevant, informative and fascinating and wouldn't want to see them deleted, just as with these Starcraft-related articles. They are filled with the sort of detailed game mechanics that populates the content of these Starcraft articles, such as this passage from <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_%28chess%29.html" title="Queen (chess)">Queen (chess)</a>: "The queen can be moved in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, any number of unoccupied squares as shown on the diagram at the left, thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop. The distance it can move is known as the Chebyshev distance. As with other captures except en passant, the queen captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits. Ordinarily the queen is slightly more powerful than a rook and a bishop together, while slightly less powerful than two rooks. Because the queen is more valuable than any other piece, it is almost always disadvantageous to exchange the queen for a piece other than the enemy's queen, unless doing so leads to a position where the king can be checkmated." An even more apt comparison might be made to <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html" title="Final Fantasy X">Final_Fantasy_X</a>, which is today's featured article on the WP front page (as of this writing). Final Fantasy X passed the gauntlet to featured status in part because it is well-referenced, obviously a notable subject, and provides objective information on detailed specifics of how the game works - see, for example, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html#Battle_system" title="Final Fantasy X">Final_Fantasy_X#Battle_system</a>. The editors who agreed that this deserved featured status did not seem to apply an absolute rule against "game cruft" as opposed to detailed, objective information on a notable recreational subject. This is the same in principle as each one of these articles would do in their ideal state, after being appropriately improved, rather than deleted. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop"><b>Reaverdrop</b></a> <small><font color="green">(<a href="../../../r/e/a/User_talk%7EReaverdrop_ce3e.html" title="User talk:Reaverdrop">talk</a>/<a href="../../../../nl/r/e/a/Gebruiker%7EReaverdrop_a5b4.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Gebruiker:Reaverdrop">nl</a>/<a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPACE_cbae.html" title="WP:SPACE">w:s</a>)</font></small> 00:36, 20 July 2006 (UTC) <i>(repeating some comments made previously elsewhere)</i></li>

<li>'There are basically three rationales to this mass-AfD: original research, notability, and "game guide"' In my case, this is incorrect. I want them deleted because the articles on the three Starcraft races already have sections for all of their units and structures which describe them well enough.

<li>Starcraft is notable. That's why it has an article. A Protoss Arbiter is not notable. Therefore, at best, it should be included in the game's article. And then it should still not be about how to use it in the game, or that's a guide. If you want to look up stats on units, there's tons of sites with that info, including the official one, so it's not like you're gonna be out of luck if these pages are deleted. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 18:19, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A reasonable standard that I've been mulling over in my mind for topics such as this is the following: "Fictional topics should only receive articles if they are featured to a significant extent (i.e. not a cameo appearance) in works which are significantly separated from the ones in which they originally appeared." For example, <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> (to use a popular example) gets an article, as it has appeared in a bunch of Pokemon media -the collectible card game, various video games, the TV series, etc. However, aside from a brief cameo appearance in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcraft_3.html" title="Warcraft 3">Warcraft 3</a>, the Zergling has never (to my knowledge) featured prominently in anything besides Starcraft. Neither have any of the other units listed here, so none of them should have articles. The same goes for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Foster_Kane_1584.html" title="Charles Foster Kane">Charles Foster Kane</a> (of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a>); I may eventually propose that that article be merged to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a>. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 01:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's certainly a...unique opinion. The <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> example makes no sense under your criteria, since all of those other works are all Pokemon works and not any more "significantly separated" than the Starcraft books. Also, I think it's fair to say that <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holden_Caufield_ae58.html" title="Holden Caufield">Holden Caufield</a> deserves an article, even if <a href="../../../j/2E/d/J.D._Salinger_c03f.html" title="J.D.

<li>Ooh, the existence of Starcraft books actually throws a real wrench into this particular issue. The difference <i>as I see it</i> is that the various Pokemon works are not as directly connected to each other as the Starcraft books are to the game: as far as I know, the Starcraft books serve as minor expansions and "riffs" on the story told within the game, while the Pokemon card game (again, as far as I know) shares very little with the TV show or the video game. Holden would, incidentally, actually be safe under my policy, though, as he appears in (or, at least, is strongly connected to) several other works of Salinger's. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 00:23, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> all. These articles have been worked on for YEARS now (look at the history on some of these), and contain a lot of valuable information. If they read too much like a game guide, there's no reason they can't be modified (after all, this IS Wikipedia). Those that have little information left after removing strategies could simply be redirected to the main StarCraft article. I think the biggest issue here is that if these are removed, there's really no telling where to stop. I mean, what about <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goomba.html" title="Goomba">this</a>? There are articles for just about every character in the Mario series. In fact, "Goomba" was once the featured article of the day, which is why I bring up this point. Also, what about the countless articles on Wikipedia dedicated to schools and songs and episodes? Are these somehow more notable than StarCraft units? I strongly urge you to re-think your votes. This sort of careless deletion immediately throws about 90% of other Wikipedia articles into question. <a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 06:02, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Goombas have been in many different games and pieces of media. No StarCraft unit can claim such for themselves.
