<p>This page serves virtualy no purpose but to smear the founder of Scouting. If this page remains it will set a precedent for other people create pages containing nothing but speculation on long dead people's sexual activity. Such pages would include how Mohamed raped Aisha, and how John Lennon had sex with his mother (and no I'm not going to write that about Lennon).</p>

<li>Comment: Before you call this article a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>, look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell#On_his_sexual_orientation" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell#On_his_sexual_orientation" rel="nofollow">here</a>, at the section called 'On his sexual orientation' in the main article for <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell_a8fa.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell">Robert Baden-Powell</a>. You can see that the topic is summarized concisely in the main article, and that the article under nomination is linked from the main article as a spinout due to length. After looking at that, and maybe at the discussion on the main article talk page, if you still want to say it's a POV fork, be my guest.&#160;:) -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 20:50, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b> Why so much detail? Why isn't the short statement in the article enough? How much information do we need on something like a person's sex. orientation?

<ul>
<li>This is an old comment of mine. But yes, there are situations where too much information can turn an article into crap, regardless of what the policy says. Quality writing/communication of information involves knowing what to leave out as well as what to put in. In fact, the whole idea of writing anything involves defining what you are trying to say, and to say we should just add all the information we can means to throw out the definintions. Articles are crammed with crap all the time, and the concequence is that they become unreadable garbage. I'm glad I'm not crass crass enough to put some of these assumptions to the test. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 21:03, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And another thing to set the record straight: I'm tired of people taking my comments and trying to imply that I'm wanting to delete legitimate info., as that is not what I've said anywhere. I simply can't fathom that people don't understand the concept of economy. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 21:11, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Apologies, I didn't do my homework; specifically, I didn't look at the relevant debate on the Baden-Powell talk page. I don't think there's actually a POV dispute; no one disputes that Jeal wrote this book and that the assertions that are in the nominated article are drawn directly from that book as sourced. The article is summarized in the main work and linked to therefrom. Therefore, changing my vote to <b>Keep as is</b>, which is to say a reasonable article branch due to length, not as a POV fork. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 04:55, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. As per Ikkyu2, POV forks must not be left as standalone articles. However large the main article is, this does not warrant its own article. Having an article about someone's sexual orientation because they may have been homosexual is a POV decision in itself; where are the articles about people who are purportedly heterosexual? Do not encourage POV forking. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">Proto</font></span></span></a><font color="#555555"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">type</font></span></span></a></small> 09:56, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This article does not present a POV different from its main article, and if anything it seems to be an attempt to <i>de</i>-emphasize the subject in the main article. It was not intended as a POV fork and it doesn't look like a POV fork. The principle that really bugs me here is that AfD is being used as a super-consensus that trumps the ordinary consensus <i>without even understanding it</i>. I don't mean to insult, but it is clear to me that the voters previous to me were not aware of the origin of this article. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 19:32, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> As I am the user who originally gathered and posted the material in the main Baden-Powell page (and then consented to the POV fork so as not to have an unbalanced article, since a fair synopsis was left behind), I have some thoughts on this matter. First of all, it is the farthest thing from my mind to "smear" Baden-Powell or his memory. As I already expressed on the talk page of the main article, this kind of analysis does not "smear" the man, it makes him more real, and humanizes him. "Revisionism" is what historians do, as our base of information grows. The material was carefully sourced, it is based on <i><b>the</b></i> authoritative biography of the man, and the theme of his homoerotic attractions (coupled with his misogyny) has been shown to run strong throughout his entire life. This is not some chance apocrypha blown out of proportion, indeed I could have written an article twice the size and adduced much more relevant information, had I had the time. But this suffices. Now, however, <b>not only are the Scouts here not happy with having removed the "incriminating" material to a separate article, they are trying to further mask it by burying it into an unnecessary "book review" article when what is of encyclopaedic interest here is NOT a book review but the homosexual leanings of a man who founded the greatest youth organization in the world (the American branch of which has turned homophobic and militantly religious).</b> Thus what needs to be deleted is the book review article itself, and this article on his homoerotic inclination preserved. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 12:49, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep as is</b>. This was heavily debated on the talk page of the article on Baden-Powell and the consenus was to have the separate article with a summary in the main article. The book review page should stay too, it simply needs expanded into coverage of the full book, not just 5% of the book. After the fork from the main article, a merge was proposed and shot down quickly. Merging the content back into the B-P main article would simply reignite an already debated issue. This sexuality article is not a POV fork. Just so everyone knows, I am Scout leader and I am obviously NOT trying to bury the entire issue. My feelings are: the book review should cover the whole book, the sexuality article should stay where it is because no one can conclusively prove he was a homosexual--it's all second guessing and supposition, and the summary on his orientation should stay in the main article.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 16:23, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, of course. I'm so sick of this nonsense. Look, people, there was a lot of talk over on the main Baden-Powell article, and it was decided <i>by everybody</i>, and there were more than a few users involved, that this was the best way to handle things. So now you, a bunch of users who haven't been involved with the main article, who haven't spent substantial time editing it, are going to say that you have a better understanding than those people who have?

<li><b>Delete</b>, because the facts of this article can be found in the Robert Baden-Powell main article. (The rest of this has nothing to do with why it should be deleted.) IMO, this article just adds some pretty sleazy and meanspirited insinuations which would easily be libelous if the man weren't dead. Baden-Powell grew up in Victorian England, attended a public boarding school, and served in the British Army for much of his life. That kind of life would make any man seem a little odd from a contemporary viewpoint. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> BrianGCrawfordMA (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrianGCrawfordMA_efc2.html" title="User talk:BrianGCrawfordMA">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrianGCrawfordMA_7e41.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrianGCrawfordMA">contribs</a>) 09:47, 27 February 2006.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The idea that is a smear is not supportable. The content comes largely from the book by Jeal, which is very well researched. I agree with User:Haiduc that this gives us a more rounded view of B-P and allows us to respect him as someone who is truly human, who faced challenges about his sexuality and lived honourably with them. To many people he is a hero and they can not face up to the fact he had weaknesses. There has been much debate about this among those who have contributed to the article on Baden-Powell. They reached a difficult consensus. To delete it or merge it back into the main article would be against that consensus. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:13, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment. This is getting rather unclear. That 'homosexuals are having "issues" with the BSA' is POV. You could just as well say that 'the BSA are having "issues" with homosexuals' - an issue that Scouting in Canada, Australia and Europe do not have. If the "author" refered to is Jeal, the author of a well researched biography, then he had no view on the BSA issues. He is British I believe and wrote the book before the BSA issues came to a head with Dale. You can not sensibly call the conclusions of a well researched biographer a "smear". It is clear that Jeal had no such intention in writing his book. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 22:04, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not necessarily. The Wiki guideline you quoted says: "Even if the subject of the new article is controversial, this does not automatically make the new article a POV fork. Provided that all POVs are represented fairly in the new article, it is perfectly legitimate to isolate a controversial aspect as much as possible to its own article, in order to keep editing of the main article fairly harmonious." Now, read the article up for afd and the talk on the main article.

<li><b>Response to comment</b> I am not sure I understand your "If it doesn't fit into the main article, even if it is in no way a POV-fork, it's still not encyclopedic." I am sure you are not questioning the practice of spinning off sections which are overlarge. That is the <b>only</b> reason it was spun off, as far as I am concerned. As for the material not being encyclopaedic, I beg to differ. In today's intellectual environment is it of the greatest interest to examine closely the habits and motives of our ancestors, especially (and unfortunately) when it comes to the sexuality of important figures who are role models in today's world. Many scholars have studied and written about the sexuality of Lincoln, or Alexander the Great, and there is no argument in scholarly circles that there is value in that research - as opposed to, say, the sexuality of Lincoln's chambermaid. If Jeal (and other scholars) focus at great length on the erotic motivations and impulses of the founder of the Boy Scouts, who are we to claim that this research is irrelevant, and should be kept out of encyclopaedias?! Forgive me Daniel, I have a lot of respect for your work here, but I think <i>you</i> are the one who is passing the buck with this approach, and promoting a culture of denial. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 17:57, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> I mean fit as to both size and relevance. You can get overdetailed on some things, and I simply believe that this is a case of that. If we are squeezing in so many details that they need to spill out, perhaps some should be pruned rather than making a new article on something so specific.</dd>
<dd><strike><i>sexuality of Lincoln, or Alexander the Great</i>: Are you serious? Look, I understand what you are saying here, but <i>make me a case</i> that this guy is <b>that</b> important. Would you make an article on George Bush's sex life? This is not an historical figure. No one said anything about it being <i>irrelevant</i>. Examining the sexual habits of our "role-models" is just not something I agree is productive.</strike> Cuture of denial? That isn't my intention here, and I hope it's not taken that way. About passing the buck, I mean in the sense of not passing it to the Wikideletion system have to deal with articles popping up on every Jim, Jake and Bob's sex life because this could set a prescendent.</dd>
<dd>I don't mean it's irrelevant or unimportant; I don't mean to imply that at all. I know this is important to some of you and likely to many others as well. I just think it can be reconceptualized a bit. Perhaps an article on the controversy overall around this guy? I'd need to read into it with more detail, but I hope you can see what I mean. Instead of gearing it to be about so-and-so's sex orientation, how about "So-and-so and the Scouts" or "The So-and-so Controversy" or something that is not quite so focused and in which some other material could be added to round out the subject.</dd>
<dd>Believe me, I'm not trying to censor or deny anything. I'm just trying to help make it fit better into the encyclopedia as a whole. I mean the <i>concept of the article</i> is unencyclopedic, not the content. I changed my vote to a simple delete.</dd>
<dd>All this is beside the point as to whether it is POV or not; I haven't given that aspect much thought up to now. That's why I said POV or not; the <b>concept</b> is what I'm questioning, as well as possibly undue weight. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 20:50, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's incomprehensible to me that we could delete material for being <i>too</i> detailed. Wikipedia articles are meant to grow. Once a subject is notable enough for an article, he is notable enough for as many sub-articles as the sources will support. You say " <i>make me a case</i> that this guy is <b>that</b> important".

<dd><b>That's not what I said either guys.</b> An encyclopedia gives an overview, and <i><b>yes</b></i>, there is some information that will have to be sacrificed. You can't fit the entire world in here and have a book for every article. Why don't we have a description of Abraham Lincoln's fingernails? It's valid info, right? It's the truth. And yes, there are levels of importance among individuals. This guy is not going to get the same level of coverage as Napoleon.

<dd><b>Ad infinitum</b> We should drop the whole thing simply because this conversation is not worth the space it is taking up. But, as a couple of closing thoughts . . . different time periods will have different perspectives on what is encyclopaedic and what is not. The ancients would be laughing themselves silly over this whole to-do. "What is the big deal," I can hear them say, "the fellow obviously loved boys more than anything else in the world, gave his life to them, and for some reason kept his hands off them. And did not care much for women and only put up with them when he had to. What else is new, he's just like us!" But we are not among the ancients, we live in a real culture of denial, one that has disneyfied a complex and very bright man into some paragon of modern middle class virtue, when really he belongs much more among the ancients than among us. This has led several top notch historians to put great effort into debunking that myth.<br /></dd>
<dd>The reason Jelks and (presumably) Rosenthal felt obligated to dwell at such length on this topic is because it is counterintuitive to most readers and thus instinctively dismissed, for reasons I will not go into over here, but having to do with the natural conservatism of most people. Thus if you are going to present such an eccentric point of view, you better be able to back it up. They, who know the topic better than any of us, obviously felt they <i>could</i> back it up. For us to casually mention the outcome of their research, without summarizing the argument in enough detail to convey its strength, cheats them <i>and</i> the reader of their due.<br /></dd>
<dd>Than being said, I share your discomfort with the <i>apparently</i> prurient nature of the article. I would not object to changing the title. But how to make it encyclopaedic and easily findable? And how to get away from the clinical terminology without obfuscating the point that it is his erotic drive that raised him to greatness? We could call it Baden-Powell and pedagogic eros or some such, but that begins to look like original research. You suggest discussing general controversies about him. But I am only aware of this one. The Scouts will not be pleased to have all this land back into the main article, and I too think it is a bit too thin to accomodate lengthy discussions.

We can try to work together, all on the same side of this, and brainstorm and see what ideas we can come up with. How about "Homosexuality and Scouting"? Perhaps too broad?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I like this a lot. It should be expanded, actually, if possible. Encourage expansion of content on notable subjects, including breaking off content into subarticles where it is appropriate. Obviously people on the "delete" side are coming at this from two directions: some think it is excessive information (deletionism), and some people suspect POV in the basic nature of the article. I don't think either is correct. Deletionism is a worthless philosophy for reasons that have been stated and restated; the POV issue is irrelevant to me, because I figure you could branch out articles on several other aspects of the man's life, if you had enough information to work from and it was in a notable context. I'm not going to have a bias against this because it deals with a controversy; it's only natural controversial stuff gets the most attention. If I'm trying to grow a garden I'm not going to go and pull up the first plant that sprouts because it got things looking uneven by sprouting earlier than the rest: some things will get done sooner, some will get done later, and some will never get done. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:09, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. I still think this is a content fork (non-POV), but don't want to give the idea that I think the material is unencyclopedic. I just think that a balanced treatment of this issue should be read along with the core biographical information on his life. If this information was located in a broader article treating the issue of <i>homosexuality in scouting</i> I might feel differently. But I think that biographical information on BP is best placed on the BP page to put it in the proper context. I do not feel that bidirectional linking is strong enough to tie the material together. Note that there is good treatment of the issue on the BP page already, so there might not be much more to merge, but I vote Merge nonetheless.

These two things are both historical and important and affected each other to an extent that an article might be a good idea.

<dd>I actually tried to raise two points above, which it looks like is confusing people, so I'll try to separate them out more carefully:
<ul>
<li>1. What content could Homosexuality and the Boy Scouts cover? It seems to me like there isn't all that much, but I'm far from an expert.</li>
<li>2. Does anyone have a problem with creating an article that would set a precident for other similar articles, like Homosexuality and the YMCA (I don't - in fact, I think that would be a good article, and I've already got some sources somewhere).</li>
</ul>

<dd>How about a new article on Sexuality and Scouting? <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_about_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America_fc82.html#Sexuality" title="Controversies about the Boy Scouts of America">Controversies_about_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America#Sexuality</a> would be a good seed for a section on the Americans. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell%27s_sexual_orientation_2518.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell's sexual orientation">Robert Baden-Powell's sexual orientation</a> is relevant to the topic, but only a couple of paragraphs directly concern Scouting. A new article could focus on modern policy and culture, and RBPSO could be linked in a section named "History". <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 22:40, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Daniel, sorry for being obscure. It was just my clumsy way of pointing out that we should not be too inclusive so as not to lose focus. Also, this issue of eros as inspiration (or corruption) in Scouting history is by no means limited to the Americans - they are just the ones who have taken the topic to extremes, maybe for lack of historical information. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 23:26, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The discussion of B-P's sexuality is of interest to people around the world. Scouting has no problem with homosexuality in Europe, Canada and Australia. The clash with the BSA is a minor irrelevant matter to them, so do not swamp the content of this article in the BSA controversy mess, please. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:31, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Richard Simmons' sexual orientation --&gt; Gawd, I'd hate to see that one come up!</p>
<p>Well, I'm all out of suggestions at this point. Like I said above, perhaps it's not a problem we can solve right now; maybe we'll just have to do it and see what happens. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 00:45, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
