<li><b>Comment</b> She is NOT entirely self published.

Her book "Come and Tell Me" was published by HarperCollins. I assume her books went out of print and that she started reissuing them herself, which shouldn't sway us one way or the other, frankly. Worthy authors will do the same thing. At this point I'm neutral on whether to keep or delete. I think that depends on some kind of independent recognition of her talent, doesn't it?

<p>COMMENT. I am Helen Hollick. I am a respected and well known author of mainstream historical fiction. I do not know how to use this site, I trust I have not made any errors with this insertion. Until today I was unaware I had an entry here.</p>
<p>BookForce UK is my printer, I am published, now, by Discovered Diamonds, which is the new, small independent mainstream branch of BookForce. You are confusing self publish with vanity publish. I have a full mainstream contract with this company. ONLY my latest novel "Sea Witch" is "technically" self published, my Arthurian Trilogy and Harold the King are re-published editions of out of print books published previously by William Heineman. I trust you are not going to penalise respected authors who wish to keep their books in print and who have no choice but to "self publish" when their mainstream books fall out of print! We do have a living to make, and our back lists are very important.</p>
<p>My novel A Hollow Crown remains in print with William Heineman. My children's personal safety book Come and Tell Me is published by Happy Cat Books. This book was the official Home Office safety Book for ten years.</p>
<p>I am a member of the Society of Authors. I am co-script writer for a pre-production movie "1066"</p>
<p>You will find plenty of up to date information about myself at www.helenhollick.net</p>
<p>I am about to go on my second lecture tour in the Netherlands, (subject, Harold the King) I have been guest speaker on several occasions for the Historical Novel Society. I have written several articles for various magazines - I refer you to my articles etc on my web site.</p>
<p>The Historical Novel Society is an international highly acclaimed society. Your information regarding my books, I am afraid, is inaccurate and out of date.</p>
<p>a selection of reviews from my initial publication with William Heineman:</p>
<p>"A wonderful book...breathes new life into an ancient legend" Best selling Historical fiction author Sharon Penman</p>
<p>Hollick's interpretation is bold, affecting and well worth fighting to defend." Publishers Weekly, November 11 1996</p>
<p>"Helen Hollick joins the ranks of Rosemary Sutcliff, Mary Stewart and Marion Bradley with this splendid novel" Pendragon Magazine</p>
<p>"Uniquely compelling...bound to have a resounding and lasting impact on Arthurian fiction" Books Magazine</p>
<p>"Weaves together fact, legend and inspired imagination to create a world so real we can breathe the smoke of its fires and revel into Romano-British lust for life, love and honour" Historical Novels Review</p>
<p><br />
"A uniquely compelling novel which is bound to have a resounding and lasting impact on Arthurian fiction." Books</p>
<p>"An epic tale... Helen Hollick has done her homework meticulously and her story gleams with convincing Dark Age detail." Ms. London</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Whether the events described actually happened this way is unimportant, that the reader feels instinctively that they could have happened this way is the sign of a superior novel. This is a fabulous read and one to be recommended unreservedly - even to committed "Williamites". If only all historical fiction could be this good." Sara Wilson, Historical Novel Society, 2001.</p>
<p>"Local author Helen Hollick has achieved a miracle by making this reviewer sit still and silent for a whole weekend, stirring only to eat toast whilst devouring Helen's gripping book. And it's a damn big one at that, sweeping from England to France, from Wessex to Normandy, following the fortunes of Harold Godwine, Earl of Wessex and later King of England, and William, Duke of Normandy. Treachery, arrogance, lies and weakness contrast with courage, honesty, strength and of course, plenty of love interest to make you weep. Illegitimacy, fallen kings, plenty of hunting scenes and some great sea journeys and bloody battles; we follow the fortunes of the cast from 1044 right up to the Battle of Hastings itself, which is brilliantly recreated.</p>
<p>Helen also provides at the end an explanation for some of her plot "changes" - for example, her Harold is not killed by the arrow in the eye at all, but is beheaded - on the grounds that as most of the information concerning the battle and William's claim to the English throne comes from Norman sources its veracity is questionable. Compelling stuff." SW Magazine, March 2001</p>
<p><br />
"Countdown to conquest. Today, one could be forgiven for thinking that Tony Blair's Labour government had invented spindoctoring. In her epic story, retelling the tide of events that led to the Norman Conquest, Helen Hollick shows us the truth. England 1044. The Godwine family is one of the most powerful families in England. As Earl Godwine's six sons start to reach maturity, so they are rewarded with power and influence. Harold Godwine, skilled at both the machinations of court and at fighting, has inherited all his father's diplomatic skills - but none of his lust for battle. In France, William, bastard son of a duke, is brought up at the court, but trained to be a soldier. Attractive and arrogant, he is an exciting leader, inspiring his men to ever greater victories.</p>
<p>Though still precociously young, his fame begins to spread. When events in England take a dramatic and bloody turn, the Godwines are forced into exile. They must fight their way back into favour, and a power struggle ensues, which will eventually make Harold king. But William has already seen the weakness which exists in England ... the Battle of Hastings is the terrible and bloody result.</p>
<p>Following the battle, William's spindoctors justify the atrocities that have taken place and his claim to the throne. They advise him to build Battle Abbey as a penance, and ensure that all information comes from Norman sources. In this masterly and colourful recreation, Helen Hollick weaves together the history of a powerful family of noblemen, with that of the aggressive bastard of Normandy - culminating in the fierce and tragic battle which changed the course of England's history." Bolton Evening News, 21 Oct 2000.</p>
<p>"This re-telling of the events leading up to the Battle of Hastings in 1066 through the eyes of the men and women involved mixes together historical fact with plenty of personality. Hollick, whose previous novels were about Arthurian Britain, juxtaposes the stories of Harold and William as events conspire to produce the Norman Conquest.</p>
<p>What is most inspiring about Hollick is that she can produce such a mammoth book from a household where she is the only reader - both her husband and daughter suffering from severe dyslexia." Cliff Moore, Dorset Evening Echo - Weymouth - 28 Oct 2000</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hm, I'm willing to give it you the benefit of the doubt and I'll probably end up withdrawing the suggestion to delete once I have time to give this a more in-depth look.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've just sent an email to Helen Hollick through www.helenhollick.net. A copy of the email is at my talk page <a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENoroton_4514.html#copy_of_email" title="User talk:Noroton">here</a>. If she can send me the information we can use to establish notability, I will be happy to add it to the story. I've also changed my vote to "Keep", basically on faith that we can get the right confirmation in the article (presumably from articles not on the Internet). I think if we do this that it would satisfy editors here, and I hope any administrator would extend this debate if need be, for a few days if that's what it takes to get it done. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 01:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>POV issues aern't a reason to delete, either. If you can turn on the radio/TV coverage of a baseball game and the announcers are using the nicknames without need for explanation (Big Red Machine, Tribe, Bronx Bombers, etc.) that's a pretty established nickname.

<li>Though I admit that not all POV issues are a reason to delete, <i>inherently</i> POV issues—such as in this case—are. Also, the article doesn't establish <i>how many times</i> must a nickname be used by TV/radio announcers in order for it to be considered an official nickname. After all, there are countless people in mainstream media who have made up <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologisms</a> to describe teams, and Wikipedia is certaintly <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">not the place to indiscriminately record all of them</a>. --<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 03:35, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm just talking about turning on a random radio/tv broadcast. There are certain nicknames recognizable to baseball fans. Maybe this is something you actually have to follow sports to understand, I dunno. But there's a difference between established nicknames and the silly stuff sports columnists make up as filler and is forgotten quickly. It's not really an inherent POV issue, it just involves needing to improve the article. Everything you've said boils down to a need to improve the article, not a reason to delete it. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:38, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But the thing is, since it's entirely subjective, there's no way for us to determine how popular a neologism needs to be in order for it to be considered an actual nickname instead of, as you put it, "silly stuff sports columnists make up".

<dd>As seen below, parts of the lists are already verified. As for indiscriminant, is there some other way that you would classify or list baseball teams besides the 32 MLB teams which would make it more discriminant?

<li>Actually, it's very <i>relevant</i> information. Sports journalists constantly refer to teams and players by their nicknames. Also, for people who keep saying "indiscriminate" I gently encourage you to actually look up the meaning of the word "indiscriminate" in a dictionary. These lists are not it. These lists pass <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>, for 1) information and 2) navigation.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've been going through the baseball article and adding references. There are about 20 now. I have to get back to real life, but I want to say, these nicknames are <i>incredibly</i> common. It's almost hard to find references because, for example, "Los Angeles" "Halos" returns over <b>1,000,000</b> hits on google, almost all of which are about the baseball team. Some of these nicknames even have books written about them -- about the actual nickname. There's an entire book about why the Dodgers are called the Boys of Summer. Also, I'm finding tons of non-trivial references such as "<a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/baseball/nicknames/010612.html" class="external text" title="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/baseball/nicknames/010612.html" rel="nofollow">ESPN's List of Best Baseball Nicknames of All Time</a>." As I do further research in this topic -- I'm not even interested in sports -- it's instantly obvious that sports nicknames are an integral part of sports culture and I'm changing my original vote to strong keep, and if not for the handful of delete votes, I'd change to speedy. These are blatantly valid lists. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 20:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> - Alright look. This is a sim league. It's not real, ok? This was something we were doing to have a little fun. It doesn't link to any real sites or real people, it doesn't hurt anyone, it's just a little fun, innocent thing we did that isn't hurting anyone. Why someone would even take the time to get so upset about something as trivial as this is beyond me and why you would even be LOOKING at this in the first place makes me wonder how much you have going on in your life. Anyway, bottom line is this article isnt hurting anyone and nobody can even see it unless they know what they are looking for...so who cares? And as a side note...even if it gets deleted, guess what? We got our page up on wikipedia for nearly a week and got exposure for it from people with no lives. Success! And as a response to the "someone should look at HFBoards" part...THAT is a real site.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This is an encyclopedia. If you want to make a wiki about your league, fine: do it on <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com" class="external text" title="http://www.wikispaces.com" rel="nofollow">wikispaces</a> or <a href="http://www.pbwiki.com" class="external text" title="http://www.pbwiki.com" rel="nofollow">pbwiki</a>. Leave the real encyclopedia for articles about real leagues.

<dd>Mr Mixer served inside this organisation, and wrote three books on it - see the bibliography on <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_Air_Command_6b3b.html" title="Strategic Air Command">Strategic Air Command</a> of about six months ago under M. On the web it is not complete, but do a google search for USAF lineage and you will get official sites replicating most of this. I am remote from my primary/secondary sources, but Air Force magazine, the magazine of the Air Force Association, does a yearly issue with the entire wiring diagram for the USAF. I've seen numerous 1990s (and earlier copies), mainly in New Zealand, but it will be able to be accessed elsewhere. Finally if you want a web general background look at the USAF organisation page at globalsecurity.org and at the Federation of American Scientists, FAS. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 16:12, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>questions</b> Following Buckshot06's comments: Does this have to be a (big, confusing) AfD? Could not someone BE BOLD and aggregate the information in a minimal number of pages and turn the others into redirects? If that works to the satisfaction of Buckshot06 &amp; R. E.

If you <i>disagree</i> with what Mr. Donald Rasputinovich Powell or some other respectable source has to say, the burden's on you to prove him wrong, it seems to me. That's where a <i>small</i> number of Google hits may help, although no, I don't know how small. Anyway, you don't really have to decide, you just have to cite respectable sources.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:12, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Inherently POV/original research. Introduction states a scream queen is "an actress who has become closely associated with horror films." "Closely associated" in whose opinion? The editors who added the actresses names to this list? The general public? And exactly how many horror films does an actress have to appear in before she is closely associated with them?</p>
<p>Apparently Paris Hilton, Julianne Moore,Katie Rosales and Joan Collins are all "closely associated with horror films." Really?! That just shows how this list will always suffer from POV issues. Just because <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scream_queen.html" title="Scream queen">Scream queen</a> is a notable topic does not necessarily mean that a list of scream queens should also exist.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Delete</b> (see my comments below) the way to deal with Saikokira's questions and objections is the way Wikipedia generally lets us deal with POV: report what responsible sources say. A list of scream queens could be made from among the 1,030 references found <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Scream+queen%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Scream+queen%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Since a list can be made, deletion is inappropriate, at least not until after other solutions have been tried (so says <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:11, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm changing to delete. After I wrote the comment above, which I still think is correct in general, I looked at the history of the article: Started 13 December 2005, poor-citation tag slapped on since 26 February 2006, number of citations made since then, ZERO. Attempting to get the contributing editors to cite sources has failed, and nominating for deletion is the proper next step. If the editors who have been adding to the list ever since February of '06 can't get their act together enough to find the sources, then it's time to light a fire under them or throw their article onto the trash heap. No sources, no article. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:21, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Update upon rethinking. The phenomenon of Medical slang is real. WP having an article about it, maybe citing an example or two, but more discussing it's existence, how it is viewed by the medical profession, etc., could be notable and appropriate for WP. If the long lists were taken out, and some references added, this could be a good article. So keep, based on just removing the lists. -- <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_cffe.html" title="User:Alucard (Dr.)">Alucard (Dr.)</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/u/User_talk%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_01bf.html" title="User talk:Alucard (Dr.)">Talk</a> 14:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The current version of this article is a list of swear-words. Unreferenced on top of that. The fact that professional slang per se exists should be discussed in <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a>. So maybe merge the descriptive part into <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a>. If the lists are kept, I think every single expression should be referenced and it should be indicated what country it is used in.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDorisH_254b.html" title="User:DorisH">DorisH</a> 23:16, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>All of that is solvable by ordinary editors doing ordinary editing, and does not require an administrator to use any administrator tools. Editors should have the <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">boldness</a> to excise unverifiable dictionaries of slang and write proper articles themselves.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't agree that POV is neutral, and suggest a clear COI between the original article author and the subject. Article claims subject had a "distinguished academic history" at primary and secondary schools--no reference to distinction. Acquisition of two university degrees does not constitute distinction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Article claims subject is a "distant relative" of other notable people, with no references. Claims he has an interest in politics, but no evidence of any notability in this area, other than a planned speech to a minor party not represented in Parliament. Books listed include a book he may be a contributor to, but I can't find any evidence of this. References cited are not independent, reliable sources, or mainly appear to mention him only in passing. His IMDB profile lists a few appearances on New Zealand television. Google hits do come up with a large response, but almost entirely are from his own publishing company and mirrors. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomkiwi_bcd4.html" title="User:Randomkiwi">Randomkiwi</a> 04:14, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Cleanup and keep.</b> I had been editing the page and removing POV, and perhaps my efforts have not been comprehensive enough. Naturally, I am happy to be guided by fellow editors as suggested at Wikipedia: I'm happy to modify anything that can't be independently verified. I will begin cleanup now based on points raised.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Answering Randomkiwi's points: the "distant relative" claim is in a source but I cannot enter the foreign characters (Chinese). Maybe a Chinese editor can assist if I scanned the book. All the books that he wrote are in the National Library of New Zealand's records, other than the one published in the UK. (You may know that New Zealand publishers are not as good at getting titles on to Amazon and are, consequently, less visible. I do not think this to be a reason to limit New Zealanders' titles.) His work on the British book can be easily found at Amazon UK. On your point about politics, you failed to mention that he had founded a now-defunct political party, which is listed in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>If Googling, I suggest doing -site commands on his own sites: I still managed 109,000 references, but I could not locate mirrors. Next to Raybon Kan, he is probably the most visible male Chinese New Zealander in the country.</dd>
<dd>Of the footnoted references, he wrote two. I have removed the references where Jack Yan was cited as the author. I disagree that the other references (CNN, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>) are minor and he would not have been approached if he were not notable. Some other sources have since been added, but I disagree that the ones that were there were unreliable.</dd>
<dd>I believe the subject is one of the better known brand strategists in New Zealand, was the first digital typeface designer in New Zealand (easily more notable than some in that profession who are in Wikipedia: if he is removed, then quite a few others would have to as well). I trust the above answers your concerns.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStombs_27f9.html" title="User:Stombs">—Stombs</a> 11:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Editing mercs post was an accident i didn't mean to do that, and how is it vandalism to say something about the article that is not vandalism it is disscussing with you. and also i took time out of my life to take pictures jus t for kya and you guys are trying to get rid of the pictures, and also what is the problem with list of worlds in kya dark lineage? can we atleast keep the worlds of kya dark lineage i think that it is the best article that i made out of the three-<a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotspot_cc34.html" title="User:Hotspot">hotspot</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Deleting someone's critical comments in an AfD and replacing them with your own is considered vandalism.

<li>For some reason i thought the new edits were up i don't know why but that's what i thought, I think we should delete the items list and add a few items to the main article, but only the most important items like kya's boomy, today i will be fixing up the worlds in kya dark lineage.-<a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotspot_cc34.html" title="User:Hotspot">hotspot</a></li>

<dd>Look closely at all the other Anime Convention links I provided (or randomly select a couple!) NONE of them have anything more than AnimeCons.com and the official website to claim notability. Are you telling me that these should all be deleted? Anime Conventions are rarely covered by news media, and they are a fairly new thing. Another Anime Convention has more references than OVER HALF of the articles in the anime conventions category. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 17:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, some cons are missing references, but those aren't being nominated for deletion because -- at least for most of them -- people feel that we <i>can</i> find some reliable sources if we actually sit down and look. (We have been slowly plugging through the con articles adding references, but it takes time.) If you want to nominate them for deletion, nobody's stopping you. ...but I really don't think an AfD on <a href="../../../a/n/i/AnimeNEXT_4005.html" title="AnimeNEXT">AnimeNEXT</a> (one of your examples) would get far considering it's the 10th largest con in the US and is fairly well known and has received a lot of press coverage. Also, <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a> is not a good argument to keep an article.

<dd>"(We have been slowly plugging through the con articles adding references, but it takes time.)" Again, you missed my main point, and it isn't that other stuff exists, but it is that this article is more referenced than half the stuff that I mentioned!

<dd>Most of the references, however, are not from reliable sources. And the ones that are do are actually directory listings and do not confer notability to the convention. As for pointing out that other convention articles have sourcing problems of their own, you are comparing apples and oranges. Most of those articles have several reliable sources available, but they go cited in the articles. But as for AAC, such reliable sources don't exist to begin with outside of the directory/event listings, such as AnimeCons.com. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 15:49, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Patrick, I noticed you arguing that it would not be fair to "not list an event just because it hasn't happened yet". Wouldn't those conventions be even more non-notable?

<li><b>Delete</b> Much as I'd like to see this article cleaned up and preserved, I cannot agree to even a weak keep, for a number of reasons.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The Primary <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">Notability</a> Criterion states, "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject and of each other." The article in question fails the second half of that sentence. Anime-Cons.com is merely a repository of information from press releases and other data that comes directly from the Convention committees. As such, the information there is not independent from the subject.</li>
<li>The other references provided within the article do not satisfy "non-trivial" mentions. The Anime-Mania.net listing is a mere list of upcoming conventions, The AnimeNewsNetwork article is a copy of a press release which is not independent, and the oasismag.com article is a blog entry of one person's account of the convention, without any assertion of press credential.</li>
<li>The article does not contain any information that is not duplicated on the Convention's website, or on AnimeCons.com. What is the encyclopedic purpose of having an article on Wikipedia if it's just a mirror of other reference materials?</li>
<li>And on the subject of "Notability is not policy," <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">guidelines</a> can and more often than not do result in better articles than this one being deleted. In fact the only difference between a policy and a guideline is that the policy is less likely to have exceptions. You have not proven that this article needs an exception.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best solution that I see is to have the convention contact a number of local newspapers and television stations, give out a few press passes, have them write articles on the convention, and THEN and ONLY THEN, will you have the information to write an article on -- <span style="border:1px solid #63B8FF; font-weight:bold; color:#23238E; background-color:#D0E7FF;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">RoninBK</a> <sub><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERoninbk_7cd0.html" title="User talk:Roninbk">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roninbk_59dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roninbk">C</a></sub></span> 05:20, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the reason I would say that this article should be an exception is because it is the biggest anime convention in New Hampshire. That seems pretty notable. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 01:18, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with this. If Notability is "generally permanent", then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mikkakan_6cf7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mikkakan">Mikkakan</a> will always have the distinction of being the first con in its state (New Hampshire), and the first New England con (as it claims) to have an invited industry guest, even if surpassed in attendance in the New England region by Anime Boston, and now by the convention which is the subject of this very article. The former reason was enough for keeping <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_No_Brand_Con_2b60.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/No Brand Con">No Brand Con</a>.

<dd>The like you provided (as shown in that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Another_Anime_Convention&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116031412" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Another_Anime_Convention&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116031412" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, may be from an independent source - however, it's definitely a trivial mention, as it's only a listing that the convention takes place, and likely taken directly from information provided by the convention itself. <a href="http://animecons.com/cgi-bin/events/search.cgi?pg=1&amp;kw=&amp;t=&amp;mo=&amp;yr=&amp;st=NH&amp;co=&amp;at=" class="external text" title="http://animecons.com/cgi-bin/events/search.cgi?pg=1&amp;kw=&amp;t=&amp;mo=&amp;yr=&amp;st=NH&amp;co=&amp;at=" rel="nofollow">The page you link to</a> does not make the claim, as you state, that the convention is the largest one in the state - it is merely a listing of conventions, and your assertion is your own opinion based on information found on that page, and therefore original research, which should not be used. In any event, both <a href="http://animecons.com/cgi-bin/events/search.cgi?pg=1&amp;kw=&amp;t=&amp;mo=&amp;yr=&amp;st=NH&amp;co=&amp;at=" class="external text" title="http://animecons.com/cgi-bin/events/search.cgi?pg=1&amp;kw=&amp;t=&amp;mo=&amp;yr=&amp;st=NH&amp;co=&amp;at=" rel="nofollow">this link</a> and <a href="http://animecons.com/events/info.shtml/1243" class="external text" title="http://animecons.com/events/info.shtml/1243" rel="nofollow">this link</a> from that page are definitely trivial mentions, and do not confer any notability or independent editorial opinion about the event in question. The claim on the convention's own website is puffery, and also should not be used without verification by legitimate sources. Either way, it's a non-issue, as I do not believ the article will survive this AfD - I've certainly not seen anything here to change my opinion. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 17:46, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't quite see where the two links from AnimeCons.com support the claim that it is the largest in NH. The first one is a search result, which is by nature a trivial mention. The second is the AnimeCons.com listing, which we've already established that while it may help prove some facts, it can't support subjective claims like "the largest in X."</dd>
<dd>The point is, you are trying to use primary sources, (i.e. the convention's own words,) to prove what the convention claims. By our policies, we need second-hand accounts from reliable sources.</dd>
<dd>Trust me when I say that I am not unsympathetic to what you are doing. But I really think that maybe you need to take a step back, and think about this. Do you maybe have a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest?</a> Trust me, if it was my favorite convention up for AfD, I'd be upset too.</dd>
<dd>Look, if this ends up getting deleted, why don't you copy the page to a user subpage, and keep it until you can find some news coverage to back it up, ok? -- <span style="border:1px solid #63B8FF; font-weight:bold; color:#23238E; background-color:#D0E7FF;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">RoninBK</a> <sub><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERoninbk_7cd0.html" title="User talk:Roninbk">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roninbk_59dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roninbk">C</a></sub></span> 05:54, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have never been to this convention, or even in the state of New Hampshire, for that matter. My favorite convention is <a href="../../../a/n/i/AnimeIowa_0779.html" title="AnimeIowa">AnimeIowa</a>. Furthermore, as for the references, these are the requirements to say that I have used original research:</dd>
<dd>* introduces a theory, method of solution, or any other original idea;
<dl>
<dd>It is not being introduced, as it has already been <a href="http://www.anotheranimecon.com" class="external text" title="http://www.anotheranimecon.com" rel="nofollow">claimed</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>* defines or introduces new terms (neologisms), or provides new definitions of existing terms;
<dl>
<dd>Irrelevant here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>* introduces an argument without citing a reliable source who has made that argument in relation to the topic of the article; or
<dl>
<dd>Sources have been cited. One to make the claim, two to back it up.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>* introduces an analysis, synthesis, or interpretation of published facts, opinions, or arguments without attributing that analysis, synthesis, or interpretation to a reliable source who has published the material in relation to the topic of the article.
<dl>
<dd>I didn't come up with the claim, <a href="http://www.anotheranimecon.com" class="external text" title="http://www.anotheranimecon.com" rel="nofollow">they did</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The two sources provided show that AAC's claim as the only/largest convention is true, by showing that it can not be so far proved false. Importantly, content must be verifiable, not necessarily verified. If I claimed that I was the only Computer Repair Company in the entire state of Iowa, and multiple phonebooks proved it, that would be good enough verification for wikipedia, right? <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 06:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I want to say 'keep' since it's notable as New Hampshire's (first?) only Anime con as far as I've been able to determine, but given the already-stated near-complete lack of supporting information about it from secondary sources. The only source I could find was <a href="http://trancelab.com/2006/10/lord-bass-rocks-another-anime.htm" class="external text" title="http://trancelab.com/2006/10/lord-bass-rocks-another-anime.htm" rel="nofollow">Trancelab.com</a>, but it says nothing about the convention other than it happened, and they took pictures. ~ <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanOrange_39c0.html" title="User:SeanOrange">SeanOrange</a> 06:05, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The first convention in New Hampshire was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mikkakan_6cf7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mikkakan">Mikkakan</a> in 2001. Mikkakan's wikipedia article was deleted last month. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 13:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's really bizarre, to delete an article for (what appeared to be) such a significant convention in the area. Such deletions make it difficult to independently verify this sort of information, especially given how fickle the internet can be as a resource for something that people are no longer talking about... Another Anime Convention is still the largest/only New Hampshire con at this moment in time, and it's still ongoing. If these events don't warrant their own individual entries, perhaps we should find a way to merge them into an article about New Hampshire anime conventions, instead of just deleting them? Making the explicit connection to Anime Boston (if sources can be found to support the claim) might also be of some value. ~ <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanOrange_39c0.html" title="User:SeanOrange">SeanOrange</a> 14:22, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non notable church. Article was previously nominated in December 2006 (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Family_Christian_Center_3442.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Family Christian Center">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Family Christian Center</a>) when it was kept, based on the claims that it had been featured in "notable media" (except the only URL provided was for a Northwest Indiana local website which contained a brief article that was little more than an advertizing write-up, and nwi.com is <i>not</i> "notable media"). I don't see multiple, non-trivial references to this place.</p>
<p>The other reason was that we should "give the stub its time" even though it was 4 months old. Well now it's nearly 7 months, the stub has been given enough time and it is still less than 20 words long. Time to delete it. Saikokira 04:06, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable, and I don't think this stub will ever be expanded. I also noticed that the article for the pastor of this church, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Munsey_bcd2.html" title="Steve Munsey">Steve Munsey</a>, appears to be a non-notable stub and probably should also be nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 05:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The 2 "references" added to the article after I nominated it are to print publications, are these available anywhere online? It would be useful to be able to confirm them, and to ensure these are not just passing references to the Center. If these references were so easy to find it would have been helpful to have added them after the previous AfD nomination, to address the earlier questions of notability.

It's an odd form of notability and not one I'd care to claim, but it may work. I'm agnostic for now. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">BPMullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBPmullins_8d1b.html" title="User talk:BPmullins">Talk</a> 14:41, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Needs to be greatly expanded, however. Notability is not equal to "number of links on the Internet," and that was an odd argument for deletion. Links to other Websites is not a WP policy requirement in confering notability, AFAIK. A paragraph on the Starbucks is warranted, and clearly gives this church notability (and "notoriety" which I suspect is what some mean when they say "notability") since this is a rare and controversial phenomenon. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 19:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Glen is a part of the history of LonelyGirl15. He's also a songwriter and has other achievements which make him worthy of Wikipedia. I think the move to delete is politically motivated. If the article needs fact-checking and cleaning up, then we can do it. I can clean up the poor writing in a matter of minutes. I am not personally a fan of Mr. Rubenstein and I support his firing from the ARG. Removing him from Wikipedia is a different matter entirely.24.7.78.127 16:39, 17 March 2007 (UTC) <small>— 24.7.78.127 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.7.78.127_3183.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.7.78.127">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Lol politically motivated? Wow that's a new one, so is he also like an elected official because that could make him notable. Also the creators of LG15 don't have their own wikipedia pages let alone the person who joined them later.Vartan84 00:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Unlike the other creators of LG15, Glenn has over a decade's worth of professional media experience and accomplishments. Everyone knows you don't care for Glenn, HyeMew (Vartan84). But this shameless attempt to mess with him shows just how juvenille (and jealous) you really are. I'm sure it pains you that you'll never get a chance to even smell Jessica Rose in person, yet Glenn has directed her many times. And JayHenry should watch what statements he makes when affiliating himself with LG15, because there has been no statement to date that says Glenn is no longer affiliated with the show.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to know where you get off making such rash and imflammatory claims. I didn't even make this nomination out of some sort of "jealous" but after a group decision with many other people. It wasn't even my idea, but they got me to do it. For you to anonymously (despite clearly being the Glenn Rubenstein this very article is about) to lambast the nominator like this and to further threaten another LG15 fan and LGpedia admin is out of control. I can't even believe the vile your spewing here on your own page. It's downright embarassing. Vartan84 17:47, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A simple Google search backs up the facts on many of these claims. That link to a game review? It's in the first issue of Wired. If you have the issue in your possession (which I do because it's a collector's item) he is listed on the masthead as a Contributing Editor). JayHenry and Vartan84 are two bitter fans of LonelyGirl15 who are thrilled that a writer and director for the show that they don't care for may have been removed from one of his duties. He is still employed by the show (and if you check, the post where it was announced that he was removed as PM of the ARG has been removed, so he may have been given back that job title as well). Being a teenage video game reviewer is a notable accomplishment, and it's clear that the subject of this article has had a long and varied professional career. And regarding what was written above, consistent month to month bylines on the same subject, under the same column title should be enough to warrant the columnist tag. The Entertainment Weekly article mentions many of his accomplishments as well, as does his appearance on the PBS show Computer Chronicles.<a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanillaThrice_59ad.html" title="User:VanillaThrice">VanillaThrice</a> 08:54, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It appears that while not yet important, the subject has been noticed on the net and in multiple credible sources now shown in the reference section. Oddly few journalists receive much personal press and based on my experience at AfD, this subject has more recognition than others we have kept. Per BIO this is a borderline keeper. Contrary to JayHenry's assertions elsewhere this does not seem to create a precedent to lower the bar. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 16:13, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems obvious to me that this page was created, edited, maintained and now defended from deletion by the SUBJECT OF THE ARTICLE.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's just possible that Iviewit could be an article, but there are very few independent and reliable sources out there. Almost all of the information about the patent theft story comes from <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> sources. Even the sources in the article are things like <a href="http://www.iviewit.tv/CompanyDocs/pr5.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.iviewit.tv/CompanyDocs/pr5.pdf" rel="nofollow">this pdf</a> of a 7-year-old industry article that doesn't mention the company at all, annotated with boxes making claims that this is the problem the company solved. If the sources existed -- CNet or John Dvorak or somebody writing "Iviewit solved the internet video problem!" -- they wouldn't have to do that. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>In response to your comments please take note that these seem to be changes that can made to change the article but are not reason to delete without the changes. The article referenced [<a href="http://www.iviewit.tv/CompanyDocs/pr5.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.iviewit.tv/CompanyDocs/pr5.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.iviewit.tv/CompanyDocs/pr5.pdf</a> this pdf is to show that prior to the inventions and even after while it was in filing stage, the problem was existent that video could not be streamed over low bandwidths without severe distortion. It is essential to understand what the inventions solved for, the other articles on the page have others explaining the "holy grail" discoveries such as, Grabbing The Holy Grail of Webcasting. Digital Webcast (August 2000), Stephen Schleicher. I think this editor who claims nobody has written this other than myself is wrong and should read all of the articles that were written.</p>
<p>The patent theft story I am more than happy to remove any reference and point the reader to external sources for that such as Iviewit. As that relates to Dingell forwarding to the Judiciary Committee and ongoing investigations of crimes against the United States &amp; foreign nations, this is public information that should cause no problem as it is factual.</p>
<p>One also need to review the patent office suspensions that clearly show that the IP is under investigation and suspended pending investigations by federal authorities.</p>
<p>As to the statement that I am in a lot of litigation, I ask what exactly you are referring to, my company is in no litigation and I personally am not in litigation, is there something I do not know. I am involved in hosts of ongoing state, federal and international investigations which may prove later to turn into very serious litigations. Also, the art of patent is a litigious game but we are not quite at that point.</p>
<p>Again, I appreciate everyone's help and suggestions in getting this most pivotal invention story documented according to factual history. There are many more evidences of who invented the processes and verifications of such, such as strategic partnerships with industry leaders, licensing with contracts and for example <a href="http://www.iviewit.tv/CompanyDocs/colter%20letter%20to%20Calkins.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.iviewit.tv/CompanyDocs/colter%20letter%20to%20Calkins.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.iviewit.tv/CompanyDocs/colter%20letter%20to%20Calkins.pdf</a> that led to a signed license for use. There are many others but I cited three or four of them that while old they validate the inventions and the correct time frame. I have tried to leave the criminal elements and accusations from the article but will post a new edit of it in a while where I make some of the suggested changes. Iviewit 21:21, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, I wrote to the first editor (see below) and asked him to note any conflicts he may have with the story before acting as an editor due to the nature of the issue, not anything based on his advise. I noted he commented here without acknowledging if conflict exists and I would also ask any other editors to note if they have any similar conflicts before editing, this is to prevent any undisclosed conflicts upfront.</p>
<hr />
<p>The suggestion is that you should wait until someone with no conflict of interest writes the article for you. -- RHaworth 03:02, 14 March 2007 (UTC) Per the Wikipedia guidlines</p>
<p>I responded</p>
<p>"This does not mean, however, that it is impossible to write a neutral, verifiable autobiography, or that they are strictly forbidden. It is just that people tend to promote themselves, either clearly (like saying "I'm great") or more subtly (like not including important, verifiable negative incidents in their lives, or adding lots of unsourced positive incidents, or giving the negative incidents too little weight). Many people do not have the humility required to write a neutral article that sticks only to published information. Because of this, writing autobiographies is highly discouraged. If one wants to write an autobiography it is advisable to discuss it with the community and seek consensus first."</p>
<p>I had submitted for editing an entry on Iviewit initially and it was edited to become the biography Eliot Bernstein while we worked on the form of the initial Iviewit entry. This was worked on and submitted to the prior editor who made several key points we worked until it appeared neutral and to tell both about the inventions, the inventors and those who surrounded these most pivotal inventions to the digital imaging and video worlds. It is very difficult in this instance to have others get involved on a public basis to aid Iviewit in any way that could put themselves and their families in harms way, this must be considered in how the article is written and by whom. Further, it would appear that if you could core into your issues we could get to a mutual resolution as to how make it work under the allowable guidlines, under special circumstances.</p>
<p>I was unclear if your comments were to Eliot Bernstein and Iviewit or just Eliot Bernstein, if we could put the comments on each article that would be preferable to make the changes that way if no trouble to you.</p>
<p>Regarding the conflict of interest, as this is a sensitive subject under hosts of investigations, I politely ask if you have any conflicts with any of the people found on the homepage, ie law firms, lawyers, accountants, shareholders, etc. Or do you have any other interest in these matters other than from an unbiased editorial point of view? Sorry to ask but you can see by the proposed bill submitted to Senator Dianne Feinstein referenced in Iviewit and Eliot Bernstein, we have even asked the President or signatory on the bill to sign similar conflict waiver before undertaking the matters.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration. Iviewit 04:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let us see what other editors think. -- RHaworth 05:02, 14 March 2007 (UTC) I think I'm the editor referred to above. I don't know enough about the technology to know if this article meets the notability guidelines, but it certainly not neutral and encyclopaedic in tone. "heralded as being such grail" "an amazing start" "in a miraculous fit," "Instead the system that was to protect them instead is on trial for attempting to steal them." jimfbleak 06:41, 14 March 2007 (UTC) Thanks Jim! That was the kind of suggestion I was looking for. As you can see by the articles I did not herald it as the grail but rather others did. Either way I see that it could be considered not neutral and I can make those changes. By the way, where did the article go to make the changes. Thanks again. Iviewit 14:56, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have reposted the article with changes to hopefully accomodate all. There are several reliable newspaper articles linked, sun sentinel, variety, and the others already mentioned.

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is so poorly written, it is unbelievable. You really want this representing you? This, imo, is one of the most difficult things about writing an article about yourself, you really cannot see how you presented yourself to the world. I will try to edit it down, and others can debate whether to keep or not. Please reconsider whether you want to write your own article on Wikipedia. If you are notable, you deserve much better than this, and leaving it up to regular Wikipedia editors will improve the article. It would be a hundred times better if you took a breath and took the time to read Wikipedia policies and guidelines about articles, because they have been crafted over the years to help writers producer useful and readable articles. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 01:22, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Thank you KP Botany! I made some minor changes for accuracy but I appreciate your help in editing out the non-neutral parts, etc. I agree it is very hard to do an auto but under the circumstances not many are willing to come forward yet to help me until the mess is cleared. I usually tell all those that attempt that it could be life threatening as it has been for me and others before. Heck, I am so stressed by all this but more so it is hard to even take the kids to school this morning without fearing the car will blow up again killing them and that makes most days harder to focus on things like this. Thus, when someone takes a moment to aid me in any way, especially in a public forum, I count my blessings and say THANK YOU!!! If I can ever be of service to you please do not hesitate to call me.

<p>Again, I ask all those editors contributing to clarify before comment if they have any conflicts with these matters in anyway. Under Wikipedia guidlines, it would be an editor conflict I am worried about and it could easily and politely cleared with a simple statement of no conflict prior to comments. I have asked the initial editor to disclose and I got no response and further comments, this seems a bit odd. As for deleting the entry as an autobiography that is not a reason for deletion unless the article is biased. I have worked with editors to remove any elements of it and if you have a comment about that please be specific as to the reason in the article. Otherwise blanket deletes do nothing to improve the article to make it a viable autobio. --Iviewit 15:11, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless verifiable references regarding this person come forward during the AFD period. Press releases don't cut it for my concerns. At present, the article doesn't indicate notability as per WP:BIO. (And considering I've never heard of this person before, and came here after looking at a <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> request regarding the company, no, I don't have a conflict.) <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 22:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. We can't really use press releases. for notability. And it's certainly possible to write non-biased articles that should still be deleted; if I wrote an article covering an argument I had a while ago with one of my teachers during high school and gave both sides, it'd be deleted. <a href="../../../v/e/i/User%7EVeinor_0082.html" title="User:Veinor">Veinor</a> <a href="../../../v/e/i/User_talk%7EVeinor_8b70.html" title="User talk:Veinor"><sup>(talk to me)</sup></a> 23:05, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The references are press releases? Geeze, I used to write press releases, the FIRST rule of a press release is you NEVER write anything negative. It's like using a television commercial as the source of factual information on something. Thanks, Veinor, for the wholesale deletion of extraneous information when I stopped with just a few paragraphs. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:50, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There were press releases and there are articles from reputable papers, if a press release is not allowed those will be removed, please advise as to the rule that is under. The other articles are newspaper articles from reputable papers. I do not know or never have heard of Tony Fox, thus he must not be an editor. As for press releases not being negative, many press releases are filled with factual information, like -- John Dingell forwarded the allegations of fraud to the House Judiciary Committee for review -- this comes from verifiable letters from Dingell's office to the Judiciary Committee. Press releases that the founders of Adelphia were implicated in crime are not positive or that Libby is going down or Gonsalvez but must be released for the facts for compliance. KP you are next in line after Tony Snow for + spin on the Bush admininstration. --LIBBY CONVICTED BUT GLASS HALF FULL AS MANY HAPPY PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON ARE HAPPY THEY WERE NOT-- Many press releases are negative so I wonder if there is a rule as to if + or - or no press releases are allowed, they were allowed by the PR Companies who also edit. I do appreciate Tony's comments and all others should not be relevant until they state if they have conflict with these matters. Thanks Tony. Come on folks, lets edit it to the rules, clear up any rule violations and let it stand as to the facts. If there are suggestions to make it acceptable under the rules, great. As for the TV commercial being factual, am I to take it that Lavitra does not cause drowsiness when the commercial states that fact or that cigarette smokes kills when TRUTH tells me the # of Americans dead or that Drunk Driving... The articles (misreferenced as Press Releases) already cited above were from newspapers printing articles independently on the technologies: Sun Sentinel, Variety, Digital Webcast, etc. I do not have a lot of time for nonsense editing in my life, what I see here are mostly comments that are wholly false as to the articles, claims that there are no factual references despite that several articles were written by top papers independently and verifying the technologies and the inventors. If the editors would read all the articles and then comment on the page, it would help this discussion. In fact, I am shocked that out of the several articles from reliable papers, the editors here appear to have only read certain articles and ignored the others, this seems like slighted editing in attempt to cause hurried opinions by editors in this forum. --69.229.114.20 04:36, 18 March 2007 (UTC) <b>Who ever deleted the newspaper articles from reliable sources mentioned above please return them to the article as they are factual sources. Not sure who made those changes, who ever did that please state your reason for removing them and trying to call them press releases or put them back accordingly. so that they validate the claims.</b>--Iviewit 04:51, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>KP - re eliot bernstein discussion you removed newspaper articles from verified sources such as Variety, Sun Sentinel, digital webcast all independent articles written by journalistic staff and cited them as press release which was not the case for much of what you removed. Also is there are a rule for press releases you can cite, say one that states no negative press releases. Removing the sources that verify the article I am sure was not your intent. Finally all of your edits should be put back until you state if you have any conflicts with these matters. I am suprised that you did not so state no conflict before making more edits, especially where you removed the articles from reliable sources and after repeated requests for disclosure. Also if you removed the childrens names, many bios have these and in fact the reference to Joshua contains valuable information regarding dating the inventions. --Iviewit 05:18, 18 March 2007 (UTC) Why are we removing factual information such as that <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Huizenga_e8c8.html" title="Wayne Huizenga">Wayne Huizenga</a> (billionaire Miami Dolphins, Blockbuster, Waste Management) made seed investment and who the strategic partners and other licensees were. Sounds like our editors are removing facts, what is the wikirule from the wikidecider on this. It is interesting that eiditors who refuse to admit or deny conflict when asked - bad wikimanners - who ask for reliable sources and facts are then removing news articles and other facts, whassabe?--Iviewit 05:40, 18 March 2007 (UTC) Let's put the original article back up until all editors disclose that they have no conflict and then perhaps we can begin according to the rules.

<p>Wow, bias increases with questioning conflicts. There are rules for conflict both for an editor and contributor for a reason. What is editing if conflict exists? When asked if you have conflict, failure to disclose and increasing your rating to strong delete are indications that conflict exists. No conflict equals no problem in disclosure, all other actions to conceal conflict once requested is an indication of biased editing. All editors must adhere to conflict rules or else Wikipedia lacks any integrity. From the Wikirules A Wikipedia conflict of interest is an incompatibility between the purpose of Wikipedia, to produce a neutral encyclopedia, and the aims of individual editors. These include editing for the sake of promoting oneself, other individuals, causes, organizations, companies, or products, as well as suppressing negative information, and criticizing competitors.</p>
<p>In keeping with Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy, edits where there is a clear conflict of interest, or where such a conflict might reasonably be inferred from the tone of the edit and the proximity of the editor to the subject, are strongly discouraged. Of special concern are organizational conflicts of interest.[1] Failure to follow these guidelines may put the editor at serious risk of embarrassing himself or his client.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is "the encyclopedia that anyone can edit", but if you have a conflict of interest, you should avoid or exercise great caution when:</p>
<p>editing articles related to you, your organization, or its competitors, as well as projects and products they are involved with, participating in deletion discussions about articles related to your organization or its competitors, linking to the Wikipedia article or website of your organization in other articles (see Wikipedia:Spam); and you must always:</p>
<p>avoid breaching relevant policies and guidelines, especially neutral point of view, attribution, and autobiography. <b>Conflict of interest often raises questions as to whether material should be included in the encyclopedia or not. It also can be a cause, or contributing factor, in disputes over whether editors have an agenda that undermines the mission of Wikipedia.</b> Editors who may have a conflict of interest This section of the guideline is aimed at editors who may have a conflict of interest. In keeping with Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy, edits where there is a clear conflict of interest, or where such a conflict can be reasonably assumed, are strongly discouraged. Significantly biased edits are forbidden.</p>
<p><br />
[edit] Declaring an interest Some editors declare an interest in a particular topic area. They do this in various ways. Many Wikipedians show their allegiances and affiliations on their user pages. You may choose to reveal something about yourself in a talk page discussion. Disclaimer: Wikipedia gives no advice about whether or how to use its pages to post personal details. This guideline will only raise some pros and cons.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<p>By declaring an interest, you pre-empt anyone outing you or questioning your good faith. Most editors will appreciate your honesty. You lay the basis for requesting help in having others post material for you, and/or to audit/approve material you wish to post yourself. Disadvantages:</p>
<p>Your declaration may be invoked against you at some point. Your edits to the area in question may attract extra attention. Your declaration will give you no rights as an advocate. You may even be cautioned or, in extreme cases, told to stay away from certain topics.[4] In the case of commercial editing (editing on behalf of a company):</p>
<p>a disclosure enables you to ask openly for help in getting material posted and edited, but once your position is known, you will have to adhere stringently to neutral edits of affected articles, or no edits at all. Note that if you only correct bias against your company and its interests, and not bias in its favour, your editing will be different from that of a regular Wikipedian, who would be expected to do both.</p>
<p>[edit] Defending interests In a few cases, outside interests coincide with Wikipedia’s interests. An important example is that unsupported defamatory material appearing in articles may be removed at once. Anyone may do this, and should do this, and this guideline applies widely to any unsourced or poorly sourced potentially libelous postings. In this case it is unproblematic to defend the interest of the person or institution involved. An entire article that presents as an attack piece or hostile journalism can be nominated for speedy deletion and will be removed promptly from the site. Those who post here in this fashion will be subject to administrative sanction. Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons gives details on how biographical articles on living persons should be written.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <i><b>the removal of reliably sourced critical material is not permitted.</b></i> Accounts of public controversies, if backed by reliable sources, form an integral part of Wikipedia's coverage. Slanting the balance of articles as a form of defence of some figure, group, institution, or product is bad for the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>[edit] Conflict of interest noticeboard A noticeboard for reporting and discussing incidents that require editors' intervention related to the application of conflict of interest guidelines is available at:</p>
<p>Wikipedia:Conflict of interest/Noticeboard.</p>
<p><b>I am stunned that as editors of Wikipedia you all continue to fail to disclose if you are conflicted with the subject, that you are removing reliable sources to smear and entry and your degree of bias increases with each request for conflict disclosure. Maybe you don't have to disclose but if you don't you discredit Wikipedia as a reliable source of anything. Trying to delete the article by citing no sources, after removing newspaper publications is damning to the efforts this company has tried to establish. Lets elevate these matters.--69.229.114.20 17:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</b> KP thanks for the message of no conflict. No personal attacks were levied it was merely a request for that disclosure before further editing and like with Jim I look forward to working with you now to get this article in an unbiased light regarding important inventions of our times. Since the inventions are notable on a historical basis that have had major impact on our world I think that it is an absolute encyclopedia entry in substance.--Iviewit 18:02, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> I suggest that the sooner this article is deleted and this editor sanctioned the sooner Wikipedians can get on with creating an encyclopedia.

<p>This seems to be just some random nightclub or bar. No independent sources are provided to establish notability, and in my mind it hardly even makes a claim to notability. This seems somewhat similar to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Phyrst_fc55.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Phyrst">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Phyrst</a> which I nominated a while back. It was de-prodded with comment "contesting prod, as there aren't very many Finnish nightclubs on Wikipedia as it is, also added category Oulu." I disagree that there's anything inherently notable about nightclubs, and I disagree even more strongly that Finnish nightclubs should be accorded treatment any different from others, regardless of their representation on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 05:00, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - the {{<a href="../../../u/n/d/Template%7EUnderconstruction_9602.html" title="Template:Underconstruction">underconstruction</a>}} tag has been there for over 2 weeks and I don't think it qualifies as a reason to speedy close a deletion debate any longer. Two weeks is sufficient time to bring an article up to standards to at least survive a deletion debate. I'm still undecided as to whether that is the case - it's kind of late and I'm not sure what to think of it - so I'm abstaining from a&#160;!vote right now. However I felt that the claim the article is under construction as a reason to terminate the discussion early no longer holds water. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 06:54, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, the relevant parts of the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> state: <i>"A process that resulted in article deletion or keeping, should generally be respected and the article not immediately re-nominated for deletion (if kept) or re-created (if deleted). The most common reason for a repeat nomination is that there was marked lack of discussion or lack of consensus in the original decision and the second vote is required to clarify opinion."</i> Also, <i>"In general, although there is no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations, articles that have survived a nomination for deletion should not be immediately renominated. Please ensure that nominations to delete an article which was previously voted "keep", are carefully considered, and are based upon policy. Repeated attempts to have an article deleted for non-policy reasons may sometimes be considered abuse of process and/or disruptive, and the article may be speedy kept."</i> It's already been brought up in a comment by <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> that after the older AFD was closed, the "under construction" template has lingered on the page without much growth in the article. So no, it doesn't seem to be against policy to renominate so soon, but we are treading close to the edge on it. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 04:45, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as excessive level of detail of interest only to players of the game. This is not a brief overview that helps readers understand why the game is of interest (such material, if it were present, should be merged to the parent article about the game).

It seems to me that if the information <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">attributable</a>, is not covered in the game's actual manual, and is useful to players of the game, then it does not fall under the "indiscriminate collection of knowledge" section.

<li><b>Keep</b> I did write this article, so I'm a bit biased, but I think that this provides valuable infromation to a player of the game, and is not an attempt to be a game guide. The article is well-sourced, and uses a number of sources that were very difficult to find, out of reach of most players. I intend to expand the article as well as the main <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panzer_General_II_24a9.html" title="Panzer General II">Panzer General II</a>, hopefully explaining all the technical game terms. Furthermore, a google search for Leaders in Panzer General II returns 274,000 hits, while Leaders "Panzer General II" returns 729. These "leaders" were an important selling point for the game, and were even shown on back of the game's box. <a href="../../../r/w/h/User%7ERwhealey_6a05.html" title="User:Rwhealey">Rwhealey</a> 02:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Even if this article should not exist as a stand-alone list, it should be selectively merged into another list or into the main article (with less detail, of course).

<p>The article begins by saying they're signed to Mercury UK, which seems to be heading in a notable direction, but then we have "Although no official material has been released yet..." basically admitting that they haven't yet <i>done</i> anything. Bands that haven't released any albums are about as notable as authors who haven't written any books or influential short stories. It says they've done a tour, which might be the article's salvation, but then admits that it involves "small venues." It certainly doesn't help that the only two sources are a myspace page and the band's first party website. That raises questions of attributability to go with the other problems. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 05:16, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This has been tagged for clean-up, but there aren't any sources to clean it up with. Fails WP:MUSIC. Also, someone attempted to nominate this in October but it never got processed. Appears to be a vanity article created by a particular band member who has made a vanity article about himself as well. Vartan84 05:18, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> This nom for deletion is based on a grudge that Vartan84 has against a particular person. If you look at his history/talk page this appears to be his modus operandi in nominating articles for deletion. Tieran11 06:06, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Accusations of a grudge are unfounded- and I have only nominated the band and it's lead singer, as this person in question has been grooming and maintaining these pages for vanity puroses. This nomination was actually done on behalf of others in the first place, and the decision came after many hours of consultation and careful reflection. These many people decided such a nomination was necessary and asked me to do the nominating. Besides, even if it was a grudge, that doesn't make the pages in question any more keepable. Vartan84 16:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I am not a wikiexpert and thus will not vote, but whether this page should be deleted should be judged on its merits, not claims of grudges one way or another. Plus the above comment from Tieran11 appears to be just another incarnation of the 'particular person' at issue. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsincerecovedwellerskibachatd_a89c.html" title="User:Insincerecovedwellerskibachatd">Insincerecovedwellerskibachatd</a> 16:44, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

There is no warrant for having a list of local groups in Wikipaedia, as they are unlikely to be notable individually. This article is merely reproducing (in an inferior form) mateiral that is already on the website cited, and that is the best place for it.

<p>This was originally a db corp case, but the article was improved and the speedy tag removed (validly, I think). There's some discussion on the talk page from when it was a contested speedy. That said, there's still no evidence of non-trivial coverage in reliable, third-party sources. Of the four references, the first is the company's official website, the second and third tangentially mention the company's power consumption, and the fourth is broken. Nothing about this company particularly stands out. It seems to be just a boring commodity semiconductor fab, with no particularly unique features. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 05:34, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Possibly boring, but still notable according to the published references. If the current owner paid $350 million to buy out a partner who owned 23 percent of the company, that puts a total evaluation on the business of about $1.5 billion, which is fairly impressive.

<li>If you ask my <i>suspicion</i> I'd tell you that the only reason the plant hasn't been identified directly with its parent company is that associating with a foreign government tends to create negative brand implications in the domestic market. For an example, notice how British Petroleum refers to itself exclusively as "BP" in the U.S. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 12:52, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>The opening sentence states: "There have been increasing reports of anti-Semitic incidents on university campuses across North America, Europe, and Australia." However, no citation is provided to substantiate this assertion. Instead, a variety of anecdotes are given. What the article does is attempt to tie these anecdotes together into a theme: namely, that many universities are hotbeds of antisemitism. Therefore, this article constitutes <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and is a violation of Wikipedia policy. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 05:50, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. From the titles of cited refs #2 (""The Rough Beast Returns") and 7 ("ADL: Antisemitic Incidents Soar in N. California"), and the second paragraph in cited ref 8 ("Over the past 20 months, many fronts have been opened in the Palestinian offensive against Israel. One of the most important has been on American college campuses."), it appears the lead assertion is not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. But regardless, this article appears to be about the events themselves, <i>maybe</i> limited to some recent timeframe. The article as a whole is not about the recent increase, so nom based on that seemingly minor poin being uncited is not valid. The overall theme of the page per its title appears to be supported by cited refs (talking about...well, antisemitism on college campuses and in academia) not just news reports of the events, so the collection of these events is not OR either. The article seems to be a bit vague about its scope (are we talking among students or among faculty, for example) and needs a better intro describing the topic before launching into examples...hardly a reason to delete the page though. From the history, it looks like this page was a splitoff of a larger one so perhaps some context and general discussion got left behind there? <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 06:22, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but article requires, nay demands, cleanup. This is an important topic, but this is a poorly sourced POV muckrake of an article that conflates opposition to the policies of Israel and anti-semitism. (Obviously they may at times overlap. But an encyclopedia article shouldn't do it deliberately.) There is simply no way that an article with the generic title "Universities and antisemitism" doesn't once mention the <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=13451" class="external text" title="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=13451" rel="nofollow">era of the Ivy League quota</a>, for example. The quotes in the lead are deliberately provocative and make poor points (e.g. someone who conflates political rejection with antisemitism, someone else who is surprised that there are rumors about 9/11 -- or at least rumors that offend him). And what to make of sources that say things like, <i>College students got some bad press last May with the release of a poll conducted by the Luntz Research Co. for the group Americans for Victory over Terrorism. "Only 16% believe Western culture is superior to Arab culture," the poll found, "but 79% do not." If true; it explains a lot about what’s happening on the campuses of America.</i> (Did the poll even ask whether respondents did not entertain the idea that any one culture is superior?) The remainder seems to be a survey of some random incidents. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Quickly. It's awful. The article puts forth the thesis that antisemitism is on the rise in universities in the western world. There is no reliable secondary source given to back up that assertion. What it does have is a bunch of anecdotes instead. There <i>is</i> one reliable secondary source mentioned amongst the references, the British Parlamentary Inquiry. What is worrying is that the article again just presents anecdotes culled from that report instead of conclusions.

<p>Cavalcade of Wikispam</p>
<p>CONTINUOUS WIKISPAM. This time it appears a Wikiepdia editor, who previously only edited or contributed to articles in a narrow field of science, has taken it upon his or herself to champion inclusion of this spammy site which had been deleted repeatedly. The only references in the article presented by the editor are press releases and the about page, sources clearly not part of notability guidelines. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.161.123.120 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.161.123.120_ebd1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.161.123.120">contribs</a>) 2007-03-14 07:42:21 (UTC)</small></p>

The question for AFD is whether any such sources exist. You have presented no evidence that you have actually looked to see whether this is the case. Your nomination is based solely upon the sources cited in the article. It is every editor's responsibility at AFD to <i>do the research</i>. This means <i>looking for sources yourself</i>, per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> and the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a>.

<li>This reason I have recreated this article is because I believe it is notable. A search for literature guides in google will bring out BookRags in the top 20 results <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=literature+guides&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=literature+guides&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, and Alexa data suggests that BookRags is continuing to move up the rankings <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookrags.com%2F" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookrags.com%2F" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. Having said that reliable sources are required, and I need to work on that now (note I have been busy with other things, and when I have edited BookRags it has been to remove inappropriate comments). A criticism that has been leveled is that this is just a spammy site. I have seen no evidence of this, but even if this is the case, as long as the subject is notable then even if it does spam it should still have an article. Also note that one of the main reasons I became interested in BookRags is because it had easy and cheap paid access to published material, that I could not find elsewhere. I will add more soon.

<li>It has been deleted many times, perhaps not under this name but under bookrags.com or bookrags Inc. I remember that, and I see nothing had changed. I am not sure if the site is "spammy" but I do know it had to be removed several times from various other sections for spamming Wikipedia. The sources above are not notable and at least one of them, the webknowhow.net article, is a reprint of a press release. There is no evidence that educational institutions are using Bookrags, merely a directory-style link from an Indiana department of Education website. And there is an interview with the founder from 2000. Sorry, this clearly does not meet notability guidelines. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeizer000_e5d9.html" title="User talk:Seizer000">Seizer000</a> 11:16, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This article is certainly intended as spam on behalf of this company. This company is fairly unethical in its pay and its treatment of its workers; this is documented and was included in the entry, validating the page somewhat, and the fact that it was taken out confirms that the article only exists to promote BookRags. Hopefully, it will be deleted soon. IP - 24.71.104.147</dd>
<dd>I suggest Anon IP you read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> carefully - this article IS NOT intended as spam. I wrote the article in good faith, but I do understand that it may not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. How it treats it workers is irrelevant to whether it is notable enough. Note the reason why the info on it unethical pay was removed was because there was no source to back it up. Although this AFD may be closed with a delete, I suggest people disregard 24.71.104.147's comments, as they are clearly in bad faith.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I disagree about bad faith of the article's originator, however in terms of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> it seems pretty cut and dry-- it does not meet the guidelines for inclusion.

<li>Yes, the article is sourced and appears to be NPOV, but I do have to ask... does this event really mean anything for Jimmy Carter? Or for rabbits or related mammals?

<li><b>Keep</b> but rename as the title isn't very accurate and suggests Carter owned said rabbit. Maybe something like Jimmy Carter rabbit incident. A noted event that was covered by media and has also been cited numerous times in pop culture. (Cited by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Anton_Wilson_96e8.html" title="Robert Anton Wilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a>, for example, in his lecture <i>Secrets of Power</i>). I don't really see this fitting into the main article. In addition, having reviewed the nominator's statement above, I feel a warning may be in order unless the nominator can prove the article was created with the intent to "create controversy"; otherwise I feel it's an unwarranted statement made against another editor which violates Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 12:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep but possible merge/rename</b>If the article is sourced and NPOV per Wiki guidelines I see no reason to delete - however there may be a case for renaming it per 23skidoo or moving to a Jimmy Carter incident subpage as suggested above. If per the nominator there are other incidents which deserve more attention, then if these could be identified a subpage could be created incorporating all such events, including this one. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddyboy_ebcd.html" title="User:Addyboy">Addyboy</a> 12:45, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'd be more willing to keep this as a separate article if there were, say, a few books examining the controversy, media reaction and the implications to the world politics, and several media mentions depicting this specific incident in retrospect as "one of the lowest point of GWB's career", or something.

<li><b>Keep</b>. While I am somewhat sympathetic to the argument that this article is "a dictionary definition," I agree much more with those that argue that this is an important cultural phenomenon.

<li><b>Redirect</b> per Smmurphy. Looks like a "political taxonomy" is just a method of classification of forms of government. The source in the article (which you can see at Amazon) suggests that coming up with these classifications is or was a sub-field of political science. If someone wants to pad out the article in the future, the redirect can of course be undone. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:56, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This (and related List of billionaires articles) appears to me to be a copyright violation of the Forbes magazine article. This is not publicly-available data but, rather, data that Forbes reporters compile. While it would be fair use to mention in individual BIO articles that a person is on the list, or to note the first few names on the list, to simply copy the entire list and add wikification strikes me as problematic. <s>There's a reason you don't see AP simply reprint the list when it comes out in Forbes</s> and why there isn't a Wikipedia page of the US News &amp; World Report list of top colleges and law schools. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 09:26, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Addendum<b>:</b> "This case concerns the interaction of two well-established propositions. The first is that facts are not copyrightable; the other, that compilations of facts generally are." -United States Supreme Court in the case of <i>Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc.</i>, 499 U.S. 340 (1991). I believe Forbes has copyrighted these lists, and we are infringing upon their rights. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli%27i_4322.html" title="User:Ali'i">Ali'i</a> 14:15, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And the Supreme Court in <i>Feist</i> went on to hold that an alphabetized white pages phone book was <i>not</i> a copyrightable compilation of facts, because neither the selection nor the arrangement of those facts were creative, and copyright does not protect the labor involved in making anything. A factual list of billionaires, arranged by the amount they are worth, is similarly not copyrightable. <i>Forbes</i> would have had to inject some creative decisionmaking into the list for it to qualify for copyright, i.e., "<i>Forbes'</i> list of billionaires ranked by coolness." Contrast also with the ultimately subjective (and therefore creative) editorial judgment involved in making the <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> school rankings: what factors to consider, how to weigh them, what statistics to include in the tables, etc. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 17:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>strong delete all</b>. I understand it is very useful information, I like it a lot myself. But it does not belong to Wikipedia. Here are my points:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Did you ever wonder how Forbes get this list? They hire experts. Experts estimate people's wealth. Then Forbes averages up the estimates in an undisclosed way. What does it tell?
<ol>
<li>This is not <b>facts</b>. <b>Facts</b>, in general, are not available on this matter. These are merely estimates. They are probably pretty accurate on people whose wealth is mostly in US stock market or those who have to file statements and live in developed democratic countries. What if a billionaire owns an undisclosed share of a private company? How much is that private company worth? How big is the billionaire's share of the company? 2%? 79%? You have already got two unknowns. How do you come up with an estimate? What if a billionaire lives in a corrupted country? All bets are off. You hire different experts, <i>you get different estimates</i>.</li>
<li>Wealth of many in the list is pretty volatile. It depends on current oil and stock prices, currency exchange rates. This is another reason why results of this research (and, of course, this is not a scientific one) are not reproducible.</li>
<li>I do NOT understand why people assume this is not a copyright violation. Forbes pay the experts. I have no doubt Forbes have the legal rights to the results. Hire your own experts and feel free to share your results with the world for nothing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The fact that MSN or APN have reprinted the list is NOT an indicator that you can too. They all pay to many sources for the rights to use their information. You do not know about their contracts with Forbes, do you?</li>
<li>Finally, many of us, myself included, like it. So, what is the problem to look it up at MSN? <a href="../../../k/u/l/User%7EKulikovsky_1a29.html" title="User:Kulikovsky">Kulikovsky</a> 03:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>Everything in wikipedia is a result of the research of experts, here at wikipedia we do not create knowledge, we just put it together.
<ol>
<li>No argument here</li>
<li>Facts or estimates may be used here, and are very often used, if they are sourced.</li>
<li>Because lists are not copyrightable because they are not creative writing (such as songs, scripts), and on the other hand you may say "Forbes said this about this person". Just imagine copyrighting "humans have 23 pairs of cromosomes" just because it took some research to come up with that figure. Wikipedia is not the place to publish original research, everything must have been made public prior to be posted on wikipedia.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Good point, but it was in response to the nominator's remark.</li>
<li>In that case why bother with any article, since <b>everything</b> in wikipedia may be found elsewhere.</li>

I personally feel copyright is so much bunk&#160;! Is anyone holding a copyright on the Bible, Koran,Gita,Gurugranth saheb etc? or the laws of physics mathematics etc? Copyright is a concept totally contrary to the "Wikipedia philosophy" which is a open free information forum..... also a country like INDIA would be down in the dumps if we did not have free access to information in science &amp; technology espically software&#160;!!</li>

<p>i don't think it should be deleted at all. it is very public online collective of people in the music industry who discuss all manner of issues and events. the organisation is based on fact and the people in it are real. i'm confused as to what you're talking about geni.

<p>Yes there are links to our actual web sites. this isn't finished yet. we are still adding to it. and wiki isn't limited to a geographical location. there are lots of articles of interest from all over the place. don't delete this. it means something to us even if not to you. i bet there's stuff you're interested in on wiki that doesn't have general appeal.Victorpender 00:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. She appears to be one of minor announcers on a (locally major) television; she's not even listed on their own list of <a href="http://www.rtvpink.com/tvlica/" class="external text" title="http://www.rtvpink.com/tvlica/" rel="nofollow">"TV faces"</a>, i.e. major journalists.

<li><b>Keep</b> - the current article is essentially an unreferenced stub, but I imagine that there is room for expansion, and referencing available.

<p>Me and my friend Liam, who are regular riders, just noticed that the James Duguid page was going to be deleted. We were checking to see if Duguid has a website we could look at for his events or some more pictures of his riding. This page is far better than other riders pages like Steve Peat [steve peat] and his isn't being deleted. (Please don't deleted that as well, because Peat is a legend) --Thank Mike Balwik and Laim Dobson</p>

Contest of Speedy Deletion: A large community of bike riders has grown in the Brighton (England) and surrounding area. Its thanks to The Sticker Bike that using scrapped and unwanted bikes off the streets and dumped in town. It has made cycling more popular with the students and younger adults of Brighton and this promotes exercise and healthy living. It should be recognised that creating bikes with thin handlebars and in smaller sizes means that they are easy to store in flats and apartments and small rented rooms that are often quite hard to bicycles in.</p>
<p>The aim of the Sticker Bike is riding around having fun not to make a profit, just to provide transport for students and transport for couriers to do their jobs.</p>
<p>James Duguid should be recognised as a contributor to the cycling industry and as cyclist himself</p>

<p>Hi - I looking for some info on the licensing of the actual piccy of James on the page. I see that the creator is claimed as Claire Beaumont and it licensed for public domain. However the same picture arrived on Commons over a week ago with creation claimed as here but also another uploader and then "Franscio for Torque Magazine". Obviously correct licensing is very important here on other wikis - info at my talk page here or on Commons (same name) or on this page would be very helpful.

<li><b>Comment</b> unfortunately you are right, it's only 95% professional. It's distinctly possible that the only remaining non 100% full-time clubs will be relegated this season, so next year the Conference National could well meet the criteria. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 06:52, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - As per Richard's comment above, <i>potentially</i> the Conference could be fully professional next season, so players playing in it would then meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but presumably that would only cover players who play in the Conference <i>from next season</i>.....? And then if a non-fully pro team were to get promoted into it the following year we'd then have to go back to not accepting Conference players as the league would no longer be fully pro.....? Aaaarrrgggghhhh!!!! <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 08:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think the key isn't whether the Conference isn't fully professional, but whether it's always fully professional. Clubs from League 2 and up have stricter standards for facilities and organization, and professionalism is a requirement. Non-League clubs don't have to be professional, and as long as that's the case, it's <i>de facto</i>, not fully, professional. From a practical point of view, there's little non-trivial media coverage of Conference clubs and players other than in local and community papers, so it's harder to create articles with multiple reliable sources. And for the vast majority of players who haven't made it with League clubs, the Conference is where careers go to die, since there's much less upward mobility. So I think it makes sense to draw the line between League 2 and Conference. --<a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> (<a href="../../../y/t/n/User_talk%7EYtny_624b.html" title="User talk:Ytny">talk</a>) 16:12, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm against deleting reasonable articles on minor technicalities. This guy is as close to meeting the noteability guideline as it is possible to get without meeting the criteria. The article is however better than many of those for higher-class footballers, and so I'm voting to keep. Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia after all. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 12:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Sure, the article is better than those of many top flight footballers, but that's setting the bar pretty low, isn't it?&#160;:) I for one don't think it's a minor technicality - fully professional or not, the conference is part of a semi-pro setup. We're talking about a player who couldn't pass a trial at a non-Premiership club. We have to draw the line somewhere, and given that the professionalism of Conference clubs can change from season to season, I think drawing a line between League and Non-League is perfectly reasonable. If this player is really worthy of our attention, then he'll sign with a bigger club or help his club get promoted. We can always create an article when that happens. To me, that's a bigger benefit of a non-paper encyclopedia. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> (<a href="../../../y/t/n/User_talk%7EYtny_624b.html" title="User talk:Ytny">talk</a>) 14:11, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The article has been transwikied to <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scottish_Rural_Life%2C_History_Dictionary" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Scottish_Rural_Life,_History_Dictionary">wikibooks:Scottish Rural Life, History Dictionary</a> which would seem to be a much more appropriate home for this body of work. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeepday_ab54.html" title="User:Jeepday">Jeepday</a> 13:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not quite right - someone changed the title from Dictionary to glossary a long time back - that's why I continued working on it. The additional changes from Dictionary to Glossary were in the intro part. I know enough about how Wiki works to realise that hiding such changes are totallly pointless and I resent the various implications - with due cause.</p>

<p><b>Why does Wiki have such a large number of Glossaries if they are not allowed? Search for Glossary and check out the list. Why was I 'allowed' to do so much work before being told that it was going to be deleted?</b></p>
<p>Jeep is trying to be of some help with the Wikibook idea, but this article isn't a book. It is not about Scotland. It is a resource for Local Historians the World over - look how many of the items have no Wiki link.</p>

<li><b>Keep in some form</b> - While some of the terms are of wider relevance, the context is very largely Scots local history. This should be reflected in the title, perhaps 'Glossary of Scottish Local History'. This is potentially a useful resource for those of us engaged in English local history and find ourselves crossing the border into a country with a different legal system and different terminology, some of which is unfamiliar. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 00:10, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

It might be a good idea if administrators were to take a closer look at those users. They (he) have been consistently disrupting the work of DrParkes aparantly because he dared to disagree with their (his) Judo based view of the origins of BJJ. They (he) managed to get DrParkes banned by stealthy misuse of the system. Now, during his absence, they (he) are attacking anyone who disagrees with them (him). They are even vandalising and disrupting this AfD nominiation. They consistently vandalise anything that does not fit their points of view.

<dd>The problem with this "No you are!!" line of thought: Nate, Gelston, and Loudenvier have been on here and editing for a long time in separate areas of wikipedia. All of you, on the other hand, joined within the same few days, edit exactly the same articles, speak exactly the same way, even down to CAPITALIZING NAMES. It's quite a tell.

<p>Whatever you say FlowWTG, or should I say Nate? I'm sure you would like us all to go away. What a great world if everyone who did not share our point of view would just go away. There are some notable historic characters who would have agreed with that sentiment. Stalin, Mao tse tung and Hitler to name but a few. But look what happens when people stop trying to defy tyranny and sacrifice free speech. No. I think it best for humankind in general if we and everyone else who believes in the banned DrParkes keeps fighting to clear his name.

<p>Wow. This article seems to be attracting a lot of attention. For my part, the links provide sound verification for its inclusion in Wikipedia. Ley seems to someone who stirs up a lot of passion, one way or the other, in several of the editors at least. And Google´s one and a half million listed pages about him certainlty suggest sufficient notability.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b>- not really, came across it as while looking the contributions of an unhelpful editor on another article. I generally try to keep any one I come across in a good state, wikify an add citation requests but these were repeatedly removed or bad sources added. Also if you google "Barry Ley", including the quotes it give 560, this looks for the exact phrase, I did a UK only search around 167 are based here if he is based in the UK these are the most likely to be relevant &amp; getting few &amp; far between esp as unless he's a member of "PLYMOUTH &amp; DISTRICT CONSUMER GROUP" the first few are not about him.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Over a million hits for "Barry Ley" His book did indeed make it to No 1 on Amazon bestseller list albeit only for a short time and, as pointed out by another editor, about one and a half millionth place on the all time list. Out of nearly 100 million titles on their inventory since Amazon's inception. It seems positively vindictive that you should decry his work so, in the full knowledge that you have had him banned from replying. Are you afraid he will keep coming up with more proof for his claims, just as he was doing right up until the moment you managed to get him cut off?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a noteworthy subject. And it is unfair foreveryone EXCEPT DrParkes to have their say. There are plenty of sources citations and proof. More than any other article on Wikipedia it seems. The book is a bestseller and there are a huge number of other books with their own articles. Ley is a fascinating subject, well covered by the media. Unfortunately, DrParkes has committed the sin of telling the world about the true origins of BJJ in other articles. He obviously did not realise the political power of the Judo set in this organisation. Preech Jigoro Kano, or hold your tongue! <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">Kentkent</a> 19:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Ley Guard is definitely now an accepted part of the sport. I agree with kentkent that we should keep this article. If you have long legs, the Ley Guard is a safe way to defend while setting up the triangle. While it looks precarious, it is in fact quite stable as long as you grip your ankle tightly. As this technique is now accepted into the mainstream, I think that its inventor deserves to stay on Wikipedia. And I also agree with kentkent that DrParkes does seem to be getting victimised for daring to challange the judo propaganda inherent in the articles on BJJ. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesthorburn_a872.html" title="User:Jamesthorburn">Jamesthorburn</a> 08:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment to closing admin</b>. I have no opinion on this article and, in fact, have not even looked at it. However, of all the users who have edited this discussion, 2 have less than 50 edits (all of which are in this AFD or the Barry Ley article) and were created just a short while ago. These two users also happen to be the most ... I believe "obnoxious" is the most descriptive term. They are <a href="../../../k/b/e/User%7EKbenton_de63.html" title="User:Kbenton">Kbenton</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kbenton" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kbenton" rel="nofollow">edit history</a>) and <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesthorburn_a872.html" title="User:Jamesthorburn">Jamesthorburn</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jamesthorburn" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jamesthorburn" rel="nofollow">edit history</a>). Despite having edited the article's talk page and this AFD multiple times, they seem to do so in rotation: first one edits for an hour, then the other, and so on. As "obvious, disruptive sock puppet(s)", I believe a block without checkuser would be appropriate, per <a href="../../../r/c/u/WP%7ERCU_f1af.html" title="WP:RCU">WP:RCU</a>, or some other form of warning/block. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:14, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Yet another face of the anti DrParkes "socket puppet"</b> You are the obvious disruptive sockpuppet. You will try anything to keep DrParkes down. Well we will fight til the last to defend him.

<p><b>Black Falcon</b> you have met your match. From now on I will be keeping a close eye on you. Any more sockpuppeteering and/or vandalism will be dealt with as and when it arises.

<p>This article has been proposed for deletion twice previously, in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_largest_empires_8800.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of largest empires">January 2006</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Largest_empires_5759.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Largest empires">April 2006</a>. However, since then, the article has not become more encyclopedic, and as the edit history shows, is prone to POV-pushing. Moreover, I believe this to be a fundamental flaw in the article itself, not just the POV-pushers -- in that, while the article acknowledges difficulty in comparing empires from different ages and in calculating their sizes and populations, it nevertheless tries to do what it acknowledges to be difficult if not impossible. Well, it <i>is</i> impossible to do so objectively, as I think has been demonstrated. Given <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> as an overall overriding principle, <b>delete</b> (since there is no way for this article to be NPOV). --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 17:11, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> If Editors have a problem with pushing their POV on the content, that's their problem, not this subject. This subject is still reasonable for an encyclopedia, since people do care about the size of empires. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:21, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But the entire problem is that people <i>do</i> care -- but that there is no one, no one who can, with any kind of accuracy or NPOVness, really come up with a proper list of the largest empires and sort them. (Now, it might be possible to do a list of <i>large empires</i> without regard for which one is largest, but this article is not set out to do that, due to its title.) --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 17:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see this problem as an objection to the article's existence, just a component of its content. I agree, that is a problem. It won't be easy. So far, though, you haven't established a problem with the subject itself. Just one with the editors. That's not a reason to delete. That's a reason to go through Dispute resolution. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:17, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The claim that the article is NPOV and these things are immeasurable should be backed up with actual evidence. Can you find references which support this claim? If not then your point of view is your own and is not actually NPOV. Why not find sources to back up your view and include them in the article. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 18:29, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Except, this article can be NPOV, representing the historical perspective accepted by historians and other informed researchers. If those people disagree, cover the disagreement. NPOV does not say "delete anything which people can't agree completely about", it says: All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing views fairly, proportionately and without bias. Is there some reason this page can't include whatever disagreements are troubling this page? Besides, I don't see how there can be POV concerns without there being disputes over content. Are you saying there is no argument over the content and thus there is no POV problem? If so, then this nomination is groundless. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's an assertion, but with no substance to back it up. Really, try to articulate the problem. What dispute is there to the contents of this article? What positions have been expressed? Why can't the editors involved reach a consensus? What steps have been taken to resolve the content dispute? You claim there is an intractable problem as to NPOV, but you've completely failed to show what the problem is, or why it warrants deletion instead of some other action. AfD is not for deletion of articles because people disagree over the content of an article on an otherwise valid subject. I honestly don't even see how you can claim the page isn't encyclopedic, let alone such a heinous violation of NPOV. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 07:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is subject to <i>serious</i> problems because the definition of the term <i>empire</i> itself is subject to POV interpretation. However susceptible the article is to POV edits, that alone is not a criterion for deletion. The majority of the article is well-written and well-sourced and clearly passes inclusion standards. The proper way to handle POV editing is through diligent maintenance of the article and resolving potential disputes on the talk page - or if disputes get out of hand, RfC or even some kind of arbitration in severe cases - but certainly jettisoning the article is not the cure. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 18:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Nothing in the nomination points out what the specific POV problem is. Just because something might be difficult to describe or compare does not mean it presents a POV problem. Several of the categories of comparison are quite objectively set out and capable of meeting all content policies. Other sections that might not be can be removed from the article, but do not merit deletion of the whole article. Whether or not a particular "empire" is an empire or ought to be on the list is a content issue and does not detract from the fact that the list is larged composed of entities that qualify as empires. I see no problems with the article in its present form. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem inherent is that for historical empires prior to the 19th century, there is almost no reliable way to calculate their physical or population sizes. Therefore, estimates are required, and the estimates are often speculation, thus leading to multiple "reasonable" intepretations, each of which is POV and which cannot be reconciled in an NPOV manner. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 07:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is an easy reconciliation. Take any views that are reasonably accepted, or that have been reasonably accepted, within the academic community relating to this subject, and include all of them. If there are disputes, then say: While Professor Stuffy-pants of Humbug University says "blah-blah-blah", the view of Professor Baldy-head of Pretense College disagrees and offers "blabbity-blah-blah" instead. Now Professor Crackbrain of Dunder Tech's view of "blabity-dinosaurs-ufos-blah" might not be as easily included, but that's another question entirely. Otherwise we might as well use your argument to delete almost any article on history. Certainly might require a purge of maps, population estimates and whatnot. The question of NPOV is that Wikipedia not violate it, not that other people not have their own POV. Their interpretations and speculation are their own business, and including them is question of content dispute, not a question of the article's subject. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:03, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But the problem with that argument is that specifically, this article is a <i>list</i> that includes rankings, and without such rankings, it's not a list any more and would be useless anyway. The <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongol_Empire_05c7.html" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol Empire</a>, for example, will necessarily have to include some indication of how large that empire was, but it becomes problematic when this list is forced to <i>compare the size of the Mongol Empire</i> to other empires. It can't be done in an NPOV manner. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 15:19, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why not? If there can't be any possibly agreement as to the size of the Mongol empire, exactly why has every world history book I've ever seen included a map with its territory on it? You can quibble over precision if you want, I'm sure there's a lot of concerns regarding accuracy but that's a content problem, not a subject one. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are 2 references for this article which are about the article itself. They are secondary sources, they aggregate data from various sources and produce lists of empires and their sizes. This article cites these 2 references. Thus this article is surprisingly <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">attributable</a>. And the topic is obviously notable enough as it has 2 reliable references about itself. As far as I can tell this article simply takes the POV of the referenced work. If a POV does not have sources or references it does not belong on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 18:27, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There are satisfactory and reliable references for the page. However, the GDP comparisons in 1990 US$ perhaps need to have a bit more information at the beginning of the section, in such a way that it states that the GDP given (I assume) is for each empire when it <i>had</i> its largest GDP (and then largest % world GDP in the next part of the section) i.e. that it was the total GDP of the empire in the year year stated, which was the largest (annual) GDP the particular empire had out of all of its years of existence. I would suggest somehow making the article more 'reader friendly', perhaps using tables instead of lists, and (where possible) combining multiple lists into a single table. A final point, though not directly related to the article, is that the link to the "<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Empire_a365.html" title="American Empire">American_Empire</a>" of 1944/1945, doesn't actually state any information about such an empire in those years, and is a debatable empire to include in the lists. Definitely keep the article on grounds of sound knowledge and fulfilling suitable reference criteria, it just requires a small bit of editing. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_uk_0ac2.html" title="User:Barno uk">Barno_uk</a> 19:09, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The problem, as I pointed out, is that <i>every single</i> challenge is going to be itself POV, since, for example, there is no way to prove the <i>size</i> of the Mongol Empire one way or the other, but the list structure of the article forces there to be one singular size listed for it. (And if that is made a fuzzy size, then the article suddenly loses its purpose, as it can no longer be a sorted list.) --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 02:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Who that voted "keep" is in favor of having an article called "List of the Best Empires". Both are subjective and based on POV.

<dd>I'm not understanding how you say its impossible given the structure of the article. I did notice things such as quoting figures on the American Empire from 1945 or so, but thats not so much of a big deal. It seems to be comparing Empires based on its stats at their respective peaks.

<li><b>Keep</b>. We should not strive for "pure truth" (which is a pointless exercise doomed to fail), but rather verifiability. Was the Mongol Empire 36.6 million square kilometres or was it <i>truly</i> 36.59999 sq-km? It doesn't matter. To note anything other than what one or more sources state is tantamount to original research. That historians disagree on the specific numbers or that it is difficult to measure imperial size is not our concern.

What I don't really understand is why, since this is now on Wiktionary, the page is needed, or even doing any good. I might feel better about it staying if it were better-referenced. But either way it's kind of doomed to have a lot of original research no matter what, because of the type of subject it's covering (would a general reader <i>really</i> be "expected" to know all those phrases? Expected by whom? Where's the evidence that a general audience really <i>does</i> understand most of those phrases, etc.). --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 19:33, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The phrase <i>presumed to be commonly understood by the English reader</i> should be replaced by something more accurate like <i>German words used in the English language</i> (and remove those that aren't, like 'Ausweis, bitte.'). I noticed that most of the entries in this list have a Wikipedia entry of their own and therefore many of them denote important concepts from history or science. The fact that words are borrowed from another language is a fact in linguistics (socalled <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loanword.html" title="Loanword">Loanwords</a>), and these types of lists are common in linguistic texts.

<li><b>Delete</b> No references to show this is more notable than any other old train engine. There is no principle established that all train engines (buses, mailboxes, Coke machines) are "inherently notable." Is it famous as the oldest, biggest, fastest, (something?)? Then it is one more fungible item and should not have its own article. There should be articles about railroads, makers of engines, and maybe particular types of engines, but not every exemplar of a model of engine. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 21:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Now if it was one a Manor class engine that had been scrapped you might have a point but this is a engine that survived the cutters torch by pure luck that trucks are far easier to cut up than engines.

<li><b>Keep</b> - All schools get vandalised (really and virtually). This is a good stub on its way to a start. However if the head puts pressure on those who improve it, then it will get worse <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictuallers_dc4b.html" title="User:Victuallers">Victuallers</a> 20:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Vandalism on an article is not a reason to delete, nor is desire of the administration of a subject of an article a reason. BTW, when saying something, you need only place a <b>bold</b> statement once. If you feel a need to follow-up please just add whatever you want to say, or even just <b>comment</b>. Furthermore, as a contributor to Wikipedia, you agreed to license your contributions under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL</a>. As such, you do not possess the legal right to demand its deletion. Nor does your headmaster, who we cannot even verify wants this page deleted. Certainly, the concern that the information on this page be accurate and not the work of vandalism is a valid one, however, that concern is not limited to this article, but one across Wikipedia. The best I can suggest is that your school take responsibility to educate the students regarding not vandalizing this article, and if it is a problem, perhaps ask some employee to watch it. As long as that person takes care not to edit out material that is otherwise valid, I have no objection to that kind of action. If your school has further concerns about the content of this article, I suggest they hire an attorney who can contact Wikipedia's administration directly, not through this method, which has limited verification, but through other channels where the persons involved can be authenticated. I don't think there is any real reason to do so, but it would be the better option. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:14, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> We do not delete article because they get vandalized, or we would delete every featured article, which get vandalized every minute in some familiar cases. Articles about historical personages may get vandalized several times a day. Put it on a watch list and revert, or semiprotect, or block the vandal account. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 21:52, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - High schools seem to be regarded as notable per se. This may be not be a very good article, but no worse than many others. Vandalism is no ground for deletion. In any event, the article is now semi-protected, which should keep vandals away, or at least allow them to be identified and blocked. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 00:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. While in all means, the proper way is to contact our administrator, I remember there was an article about a certain woman, which had went with 5 AFD. The legal status can be contacted Community portal. If this article was originated by you, let this be a lesson to you: once it goes out to GFDL, it can't be taken back. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Leung_a0b3.html" title="User:George Leung">George Leung</a> 00:25, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

There are plenty of sources, but what they show to be notable are the people that have passed through the halls, not the school itself. Incidentally, to delete an article because of vandalism would be to give in to the vandals. As important, an article's subject has no more control over an article than any other Wikipedia editor. Unless the article invades the privacy of a nonnotable subject, the subject has no right to insist that its article be deleted. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 03:41, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment for deletion</b>: I would personally prefer starting a new AFD for WP:N, since I don't think it should be deleted due to "vandalism" or "false info". Allowing AFD be approved under such condition may set up precedents, allowing anyone who don't like a certain article to be deleted. <b>Keep</b> for now, then submit a new AFD under <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> if needed.

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>The headmaster should have the overall say on whether it is deleted or not! I put this article on here and I should have a right to get rid of it!</i> - Unfortunately under the GFDL neither the article originator nor the subject (assuming the part about the headmaster is even true, we have no way of confirming it) has the right to demand that an article be removed from WP. The article creator should have read up on what he was "signing up to" by adding content to WP, and if he didn't take the time to do so well unfortunately that's just tough luck. I see no deletion criteria which this article meets. <b>Message to <a href="../../../o/l/z/User%7EOlz06_7238.html" title="User:Olz06">User:Olz06</a>:</b> If the head gives you any grief over this incident you could always point him to this page and show that you honestly tried to get the page deleted but that WP policies don't permit such an action.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 08:01, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The school has far more content than many other school articles which have not been nominated for deletion. Notability has been demonstrated. Very few headteachers are awarded OBEs. The "Incidents" section is trivial and would be best deleted. If the current head does not like the article he is free to edit and improve the article as he pleases. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahliarose_da64.html" title="User:Dahliarose">Dahliarose</a> 09:48, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> For a school article, this article is one of the best. Its well written, has a lot of references from a variety of different sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> If an article just kept on getting vandalized and didn't have any interested editors who would keep watch over it, I'd be in favor of deleting. Although I think all high schools are notable, I don't feel the same way about what I call "vandal magnets". This article was started on January 7 and for at least a short while so far, TerriersFan has been making a lot of edits to it (as have some others). <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 01:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a good article and serves a useful purpose. Vandalism can be dealt with, just as it's dealt with for every other subject on Wikipedia.

<p>This article must be deleted because it has distressingly little to do with its subject. I like the word (an obscure and delightful vestige of an old Germanic tongue), but other than the David Howard incident, I <s>can't imagine anyone scavenging enough relevant encyclopedic content to sustain a real article</s>.</p>
<p>I have read the discussion from the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Niggardly_e718.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Niggardly">prior nomination</a> and am not convinced. The rationale of the keep votes seems to be that a) the Howard controversy was notable and that b) people would have a hard time finding info about it without typing the word "niggardly" into the search box. That argument strikes me as bizarre, but if people still feel this way 2 years later, I suggest reducing the article to a prominent Wiktionary link along with a dab statement reading something like "For the guy who got in trouble for saying niggardly, see <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html#Near-homophones" title="Nigger">Nigger#Near-homophones</a>", or "David Howard incident" or some other article that doesn't purport to be about something it's not. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 19:05, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If possible I <b>would like to withdraw my nomination.</b> Noroton has done a remarkable job digging up more and more citations for misunderstandings resulting from the use of this word. It is still desirable, however, that we change the name of the article, given that it focuses exclusively on the word's unfortunate similarity to the word <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> and does not really treat any other aspects of <i>niggardly</i> as an English word.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and here's why: There wasn't just the incident involving the Washington, D.C. bureaucrat, there were two other instances: At the University of Wisconsin, a student complained about a professor who used the word. About a month after the David Howard incident, she brought up the incident at a meeting where the school's speech code was debated; as a result of what was considered the outrageous oversensitivity of her claim (she had earlier filed a complaint against the professor), the speech code was abolished. The student's In North Carolina, a teacher was reprimanded for using the word in her class of fourth-graders. It seems to me that the article could be renamed "Controversies over the word Niggardly" with a redirect from "Niggardly". <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 20:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>As an admin of the board, I have to agree with most of what you're saying. It's not intended as advertising, but the board...while the biggest hockey board on the web...is a messageboard nonetheless and rather non-notable as such. As an aside, members that have been banned from teh board have been using vandalizing the wiki page as a means of a sandbox, and we'd rather just not deal with the headache. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPredshockey17_8028.html" title="User:Predshockey17">Predshockey17</a> 21:14, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well, if you want to be direct about it, what keeps those other articles up is that either no AfDs have been filed on them or if any have, there was no consensus to Delete. If you think there are articles on non-notable bulletin boards around, feel free to file AfDs on them. That being said, the VFR campaign had nothing to do with the HF boards. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Not to nitpick, as I am voting for deletion despite my membership at HF...but the VFR campaign most certainly DID have something to do with HF...not only did it originate there, most of those participating and creating a buzz about it were HF members through HF threads(over 10,000 posts worth). It started at HF...and THEN spread elsewhere.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPredshockey17_8028.html" title="User:Predshockey17">Predshockey17</a> 23:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: And to follow up on the last comment, if you actually noticed, I posted links to the thread that it began. If you followed the timeline, you will clearly see that is where it began in spite of it being posted to a few other boards around the same time. Also, there is a story from USA Today. It said that in order for the article to be kept, links had to be provided and I did that and followed the guidelines. If you still think that isn't enough, then just get rid of it I guess. I don't really feel as strongly about it as the folks who want it deleted.</li>

I'm not opposed to keeping him <i>if</i> his notability can be established. The problem is that the article as it stands doesn't make any claim to notability; all it says is that he was a man who lived and died, wrote a few apparently obscure publications, and had some apparently non-notable children.

<ul>
<li>The fact that he has had works published about him establishes his notability.

<li>I have finished my changes (including some minor cleanup/reorganisation).

Pretty big name and prolific in porn films, especially African-American ones, in her time. The problem with the article appears to be that she seems to have kept herself private (ironic as that sounds), and no one seems to know anything about her <i>other</i> than her stage name and what films she was in. There doesn't seem to be anything else known, and that can be sourced, to report. Since the article is a year and a half old, I don't guess there's much reason to think that situation will change. But still, I don't know that there's a specific minimum length that a porn start bio article has to be.

<dd>March 14, 2007 Response RE: The Suitability Of Scientific Communities of Practice for Wikipedia Inclusion==</dd>
<dd>We apologize for any disruption caused by our unfamiliarity with the details of scripting in the submission of any of our contributions for Wikipedia: Any and all assistance in making necessary improvements in that regard will be appreciated.</dd>
<dd>At the same time, the notability of this scientific subject material, that includes citations from notable international-caliber scientific agencies (like the U.S. <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Institutes_of_Health_5b2b.html" title="National Institutes of Health">National Institutes of Health</a>), national scientific policy boards (like the U.S. <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academy_of_Sciences_baad.html" title="National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a>) and major academic institutions (like <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwestern_University_b7d7.html" title="Northwestern University">Northwestern University</a>), seems unquestionable.</dd>
<dd>If any editors have different interpretations of any cited references, again -- we would appreciate your clarification.</dd>
<dd>In closing, we hope that the current debate is not a rejection of a 'Scientific Perspective' on any relevant subject issue (like 'communities of practice'): Scientific perspectives have their own stand-alone merit, as they add balance, to other views of a pertinent subject (such as a 'Philosphical Perspective' or an 'Economic Perspective'. All of the Wikipedia patterns of practice on other sites reveal this claim to be true.</dd>
<dd>There should not be any exception in this case: As the scientific readership of Wikipedia grows, then the scientific relevance (at least as a reading option) for any relevant issue should also grow.</dd>
<dd>We are contributing referenced and scientifically-objective reviews on important scientific topic areas that we manage professionally every day. While we welcome any constructive editorial contributions to our submitted material, we will do everything possible to ask for higher administrative action, if the stated intention is to reject any of our contributions -- mainly because they represent a 'Scientific Perspective'.</dd>
<dd>Thank you for your consideration of our request for active, line-by-line, constructive improvement of our contributions to Wikipedia.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Since the owner of the 'Communities of Practice' site has summarily removed the 'scientific communities of practice' contribution today (without comment or negotiation), a separate stand-alone 'Scientific communities of practice' (shown below) entry is offered to avoid site warring, while still giving voice to a large and growing body of scientific research: Notable citations in the field of 'scientific communities of practice' include the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, to academic institutions around the world. (Notability simply cannot be cited as a concern with this scientific field).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As the scientific readership of Wikipedia grows, the need to address their scientific interests must grow also. Moreover, there are a growing number of consumers who would like to understand 'the science' of many of the central issues of our time: 'Scientific communities of practice' is one of those issues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We are asking for an expedited approval of the 'Scientific communities of practice' entry in exchange for removing this topic from all other Wikipedia sites. We would appreciate your expedited approval of this request, and we would welcome any editorial contributions that would strengthen the encyclopedic knowledge that this entry affords to Wikipedia readers.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am the author of Paxism, and I do not believe it noteworthy enough to be included on Wikipedia. I do not know the person who published it here, but he sent me a message this evening on myspace. Apparently, he thought of using the term in a novel he is writing, searched google and found my philosophy, liked it, and copied it here. I am pleased to see that it has an appeal, but it is really not relevant enough to merit an article here. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindbender_33cf.html" title="User:Mindbender">Mindbender</a> 22:08, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>On an organizational level, there would appear to be no need to fork a separate "scientific" definition of the existing <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meaning.html" title="Meaning">meaning</a>, and no justification is given for this separate entry. The content itself reads like an opinion essay exploring a particular set of views (Jonas Salk), and a couple other (somewhat tenuous) connections. There is no reason to believe that this text represents or could reasonably be edited to represent a general, NPOV overview of "Meaning" in the "scientific" sense, even if such a separate article were to be deemed necessary. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 21:00, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think this means that <b>the AfD nomination is withdrawn?</b> I agree that the name chosen by Dawkins is slightly unfortunate, but no other reasonable name used by notable commentators has been suggested. I've started a section on the talk page about it and if we can find a name that is used by at least 4 notable commentators and has at least 300 ghits then we can rename the article later - I would not oppose a consensus to rename if it emerges from the talk pages after this AfD (though I would contribute to the debate). But let's close this AfD, with thanks to all contriubtors, and get on with improving the article and others. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 18:57, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Nice misrepresentation of the article.

The biggest section <b>by far</b> is the criticism section. Hardly 50:50.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The orginal article was arguably premature in that <i>at the time</i> the only notable reference to this argument was in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a>. However since then we have seen four notable commentators address this argument. <b>This new article is carefully refed and quite different from the old one</b>. Although 3 of the commentators criticise the argument and only one defends it, this is an accurate reflection of the critical debate and the article itself takes no POV on which commentators are right. If course the article can be improved but it is way above the notability threshold IMHO. And there is too much material to incorporate into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a> article which is already a bit long. FWIW I am the original author of the article, but the need for it was identifed by another Editor who put in a WikiLink from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a> 13 days before I created the article. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 22:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>True, but the current title is very restrictive and TGD specific.

<p>I am the person who created this article as I believe it is a worthy addition to the article about Briitish Rail Class 357 EMU's. The practice of naming locomotives after all sorts people (not just train drivers) has been around for centuries. Sadly no one seems to want to record who these people are or were. I understand that right here and now, the names which relate to the articles I have created maybe the most boring thing known to mankind, but in the future Wikipedia maybe the only place that has this information. For this reason, I would prefer the articles created to give a piece of history about these locomotives and their names to remain.</p>
<p>I appreciate that these articles maybe as much fun as watching paint dry, but I could probably find a few thousand articles by other people on other subjects that I would also consider equally boring.</p>

<li>The Danni.com profile is not 'independent of the subject' as Ashley Juggs models for that website.

<li><i>Score</i> has been around since 1992, and it's not a 'credible magazine' in the porn, and particularly big-bust genre? It's often pointed out that the Notability requirements are there to keep out vanity pages, and articles on "my neighbor's kid." Well, this article has multiple sourcing, and shows multiple video appearances, multiple magazine appearances... This is not "my neighbor's kid" we're talking about. It would be to Wikipedia's advantage to have the best biography available on subjects just like this. The "Notability" requirements are abused when they are used to delete articles on a minor celebrities, rather than to keep out vanity pages. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 22:12, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Appearing in a porn mag a couple of times doesn't establish notability. Probably around a thousand models have appeared in <i>Score</i> magazine.

<p>This article is apparently original research on an unnotable topic. It's got no references and is written almost entirely by one user, seemingly only from his own perspective. Google search <i>"position of power" media</i> returns only one result that seems remotely close to the topic, and adding hegemony to that search seems to leave nothing on topic.

<dd>Not acceptable. I appreciate you being bold, but there isnt any call for you to "fix this mess" on your own.

<dd>Withdrawing your nomination indicates you are happy for the article to remain in its original condition before you nominated it. The admin can still close it as "keep" or "no consensus" or whatever they feel is appropriate. Withdrawing your nomination will probably have little bearing on the admins approach to closing this Afd. If the admin decides "keep" then it would be a brave person to redirect the article soon thereafter, effectively overriding the closing admins decision. I'm not sure how familiar you are with the Afd process, but typically if a redirect is an appropriate outcome for the Afd, people will vote/comment along the lines of:
<dl>
<dd>"<b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article.html" title="Article">Article</a>, reasoning".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If others agree, that is usually what the admin will do when they close the Afd. If you think that a redirect is the appropriate outcome, you need to suggest it on this Afd (down the bottom please) with a good reason for doing that, taking into account what Atabek has mentioned at the end of this Afd. All discussions regarding the outcome of this article should be discussed here; not on some talk page somewhere. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 22:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> There should be an article about the destruction of khachkars in the Azeri occupied province of Nakhichevan. The current article is just a total mess.--<big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 15:52, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> <i>First</i> articles about disputes between ethnic or political group have a very strong presumption to remain in WP. WP is not an ideal version of the United Nations, in which such disputes could be settled, or the issues definitively clarified. Our role is to provide a neutral forum in which all such allegations can be discussed.</li>
</ul>
<p>When people want to suppress such an article, it can either be dissatisfaction that one's own side is not being treated fairly, or a realization that the fair treatment of one's own position will lead to conclusion contrary to one's own interests. Neither reason is valid. There is no subject which cannot be properly edited, if necessary by a third party. If both sides think a neutral article unfair, this can be seen as a demonstration of prima fascia NPOV. And if a fair article does in fact show one party to be unambiguously in the wrong--as is sometimes the case--then there is all the more reason to prevent the persecution from extending here. WP is not censored, and this does not just refer to sex. The majority of the editors here will not be personally involved in any one ethnic controversy, and an article fairly edited will express what will usually be a fair view of the range of public opinion. Let each side say in the article what it can, with opinions expressed in 3rd party quotes supported by references. The reader will judge. (And the reader will get some guide to judgment from seeing who it was that tried to prevent the article from appearing.)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Second</i> it is an abuse of process to renom articles indefinitely or at short intervals in the hope of getting a favorable verdict eventually--and the recent case of the D.B. article exposes the absurdity of our continuing to permit it. There is no written policy preventing it specifically; perhaps there should be. Personally, I would extent the general idea of 3RR to at least a limit to three tries a year at no shorter than three-month intervals, or--much better-- 1RR, one try a year. But policy is made also by the community in its decisions here, and it should refuse to entertain quickly repeated tries. Without reference to the particular parties here, I would say that a nom this quickly is often indicative of bad faith. WP:VAND defines Vandalism as editing content in such a way as to disrupt WP. Common sense would interpret this as including any attempt to disrupt WP by deleting content through the use of the WP processes. Until such behavior is accepted as appropriate for a RfA, we can at least discourage the behavior by voting keep on repeated noms unless there is truly reevaluation of the evidence or obvious injustice. It is good to see the many eds. already saying this.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 18:24, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Requesting for deletion can be done by using common sense, in this case the initiative was taken when I said that it would be better to delete it. This was not done in bad faith. There is an ungoing Arbitration case involving <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Armenia-Azerbaijan_2091.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan">Armenia-Azerbaijan</a>. This article was created during the case and involve it. My reason into proposing it, which resulted with the proposal itself, was that the creation was innapropriate. The timing is innapriate. What was supposed to be Khachkar destructions, which was reported in various notable publications such as The Independent <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article621782.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article621782.ece" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>, The Times <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article707673.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article707673.ece" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> or the Archaeological Institute of America. <a href="http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/djulfa/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/djulfa/index.html" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>. But what happened was that Adil and Dacy started toying with the article, disturbing it.

<p>I'm sick of this. It seems that nobody has any idea about the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict here on Wikipedia. If they did then they'd vote for deletion of this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article, claimed by Artaxiad as POV, was created by him. I don't see a reason why it should be deleted after the evidence of destruction in Armenia is included as well. Obviously, by first creating the article and now trying to delete it, Artaxiad does not hide the agenda of creating the article with a sole purpose of attacking Azerbaijan. Aivazovsky's forwarding to Julfa is also unacceptable (although I am sorry for him "getting sick" over it, as he stated above), because Julfa is the territory of Azerbaijan, while destruction of khachkars is alleged on Armenian territory as well. So this is obviously issue separate from the topic of Julfa. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 21:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Dacy69 and I have each reverted the redirect once; my reason is that someone should have mentioned the redirect here first in order to gather consensus.

<dd>Well, if the current Khachkar destruction pertains to destruction in Armenia as well, then redirect to Julfa would confuse the issue and limit it to Azerbaijan only.

In this case, the article <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photoshop_contest.html" title="Photoshop contest">Photoshop contest</a> directly refers to a contest in the context of concurrent submissions: "The contest usually asks users to edit the <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picture.html" title="Picture">picture</a> in a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humour.html" title="Humour">humorous</a> way, or according to a specific <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_%28visual_arts%29.html" title="Theme (visual arts)">theme</a>. The users then go away and edit the image to the requirements and post their results to the site." Photoshop tennis is executed <i>alternatively</i>, as referenced in the article: "The players pick a starting <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image.html" title="Image">image</a>, then one player makes some sort of alteration to the image in any graphics manipulation package that they like. They then send their altered image, usually via <a href="../../../e/m/a/Email.html" title="Email">email</a> (though posting the image to a Photoshop tennis <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">forum</a> is another possibility), to the other player, who then edits that image and sends it back to the first player. This process goes back and forth [...]". Given this evidence, it should be clear that Photoshop tennis must not be generalized in a manner that suggests that it is parallel in execution. <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihiltres_9c42.html" title="User:Nihiltres">Nihiltres</a> 17:25, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is not so much unsourced as unusually formatted. The articles refers directly to Amed Rashid, who could certainly be used as a major, scholarly/journalistic source. Also many of "Further Reading" could be used as sources.
