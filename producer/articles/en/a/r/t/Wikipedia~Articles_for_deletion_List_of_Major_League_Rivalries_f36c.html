<p><b>Delete</b>. POV.<br />
Edit. Add: So-called "rivalries" are mainly for the fans. MLB players are usually professional enough to keep their cool and just play the game, while the fans can get out of hand. There are no "official" listings of MLB rivalries. Some of the "rivalries" listed in that "article" are not even in the same division or league. The rivalries are from a fan's point of view. Much of the "rivalries" posted in Wikipedia were made by an anonymous user. The following articles <b>dumped the rivals</b> section that were once part of the articles:<br />

To further point out POV, users on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Toronto_Blue_Jays#Rivals" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Toronto_Blue_Jays#Rivals" rel="nofollow">Toronto Blue Jays Talk Page</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chicago_White_Sox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chicago_White_Sox" rel="nofollow">Chicago White Sox Talk Page</a> question the rivalries.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>, I do not see any POV at all. Plus, though MLB may not "official" sanction it, the fans are into it and sometimes, the rivialries will have an occasion fight or two. Plus, the Yankees/Red Sox rivalry is a classic, came into full force in 2004. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 17:29, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>While I think there is certainly room for a list of (and articles on) the major Major League rivalries, I can't really be too sure of everything in this article, as I'm unfamiliar with it and most of the links are red. I'm also not sure if it's best to put the long standing rivalries alongside a single series. Nor do I know what the Bill Buckner Rivalry is, or what could be in such an article that isn't already covered at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Buckner_98a5.html" title="Bill Buckner">Bill Buckner</a>. So I guess this vote is a <b>keep and cleanup</b>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:46, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree, it should be cleaned up. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 20:46, 20 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "Bill Buckner" rivalry is Mets/Red Sox, in reference to the '86 World Series and his famous blooper. It isn't so widely used, but it is immediately recognizable to any fan of the two teams. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 03:53, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nevertheless, I wouldn't classify Red Sox/Mets as a Major League rivalry, particularly as both have a common enemy in the Yankees, which seems to trump all other rivalries. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:12, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some of the rivalries were created by the fans, some were drum up by the press. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 04:23, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Rivalries like "Bill Buckner" exist mainly to give the sports press something to ruminate over when these two teams happen to meet. That said, many fans care deeply about the '86 WS (and similar past meetings), so the notion of a rivalry isn't inappropriate -- it is just a lesser-known rivalry. I assume "Major League" refers to the sport, Major League Baseball, and not to the magnitude of the rivalry. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:13, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am as well, I'm changing my vote above to merge with the MLB article. This list contains many "rivalries" that aren't anything more then teams playing each other.

<p><b>Move and Cleanup</b> to Major League Baseball Rivalries. Clean-up should consist of removing redlinks from the list, or at least removing all the minor rivalries (Braves-Nationals isn't on the level of Yankees-Red Sox, or even Braves-Mets) and adding several paragraphs of text explaining and analyzing MLB rivalries in general terms - things like whether they originate with the players or the fans, the role of the media in drumming them up, etc. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 09:15, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>If the list is going to be kept and cleaned up, then, the BS rivalries which have articles should be deleted, too.
