<p>The title of this article, being as unspecific as it is, is a POV fork. It is riddled with, lets call them <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">inaccuracies</a>, and whats with the Islam Category? --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 09:13, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>if there is a problem with inaccuracies, correct them. If all inaccurate articles in Wikipedia were deleted instead of corrected, there would be no Wikipedia. Tnhis article needs to be deleted, though, because its name is incorrect and there exists a better alternative now. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> 09:18, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><s><b>keep</b></s> (Abstain; I have no knowledge to judge the article by its merits). You did not provide convincing argument. POV fork of what? Why POV? Were non-muslims persecuted or not? If there are inaccuracies, please list them in the talk page or correct. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:45, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Indeed, the suggestion of Mustafaa is better i.e. to rename this article to "Religious prosecution by Muslims", which is I think a relevant subject. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> 09:00, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, only editor is a known problem user who has developed the obnoxious habit of creating new articles (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Islamophilia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Islamophilia" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Prejudice_%28islam%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Prejudice_%28islam%29" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) to suit his POV rather than being willing to cooperate with others on existing ones. (Trend within these articles is of course obvious.) <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 22:22, July 17, 2005 (UTC)

<li>You have no proof for this thus baseless slander. I have contributed to several articles and cooperated with several authors. Unfortunately, some people seem to have trouble in distinguishing between their personal POV and NPOV. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> 09:00, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, cleanup, and neuter. The topic title is about as neutral as is the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Muslims_79ae.html" title="Persecution of Muslims">Persecution of Muslims</a> article, and belongs in the same general <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution.html" title="Religious persecution">Religious persecution</a> suite. â€” <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 23:30, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>; topic already treated better, under more meaningful titles, in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Christians_5fa1.html#Islamic_persecution_of_Christians" title="Persecution of Christians">Persecution_of_Christians#Islamic_persecution_of_Christians</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Jews_8014.html#Arab_and_Islamic" title="Persecution of Jews">Persecution of Jews#Arab and Islamic</a> (sadly, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Hindus_bfaa.html" title="Persecution of Hindus">Persecution of Hindus</a> is junk.) "Persecution of non-Muslims" would refer to persecution of non-Muslims anywhere; what the author means is probably "Religious persecution by Muslims" (to which, if kept, this should be moved.) We don't have a "Religious persecution by..." series, as far as I know, and I don't think we need one. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 23:42, 17 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There does not exist a summary page yet. It makes sensde to have such a page I think. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> 09:21, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> with existing article. Persecution by Muslims is as legitimate as a subject as persecution of Muslims, so I do not see the point of earlier remarks. The remark of Mustafaa is valid, I will create a new article under this name, because the title he mentioned or "Persecution by Muslims" does not exist as yet. This one can then be deleted. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> 08:41, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup, as per <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesBurns_5f2a.html" title="User:JamesBurns">JamesBurns</a> 09:22, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><sub><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a>, it's creator and chiefe proponent agrees that "<i>This one can then be deleted</i>", as it stands this article could be about Persecution by Hindus of Christians, or Persecution of Hindus by Christians. It could be about Persecution of Jews by Hitler or his persecution of the Roma, etc. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 11:48, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</sub></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, too broad for an article, "non-muslims" is not a group per se. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 11:55, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unnecesary POV article with overly broad scope. Another attempt by <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> to disrupt Wikipedia (<a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>) by creating more POV articles when his edits are rejected elsewhere. Why not focus on compromise and work on existing articles than consistantly attempting to circumvent Wikipedia policy in this way? <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 14:03, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hm, an interesting, but somewhat paranoid twist to the story. I am quite a fan of Wikipedia (as proven by many hours of editing), so disrupting Wikipedia is not in my interest. IO value good suggestions, so I have created a new article with a title proposed by <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">user:Mustafaa</a>. Check it out here: <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a>
<ul>
<li>Paranoid: you've already created Prejudice (islam) and Prejudices (islam) articles, now both up for VfD, as well as attempting to re-create the successfully VfD'd Islamophilia article (an article which has been speedily deleted three times now). All these pages seem to contain content related to the protected <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> article. Again, I ask that you focus on compromising and contributing to existing articles rather than rushing to create new articles whenever and whevever you can. You may find you feature less on the VfD pages if you do. Also, please always sign you comments with ~~~~. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 21:38, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course, all disputed pages are about islam. The majority here agrees that the article ipse has reason to exist but disagree on its title. This problem has been fixed. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> 21:52, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> title is ridiculous and unencyclopedic. A "Persecution by Muslims" article <i>might</i> work, but should only exist if "Persecution by Christians" also exists. In any case, that can be created independently, without need of this tripe. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:51, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Handle persecution according to the religion of the victims, because it's more salient than the religion of the perpetrating regime. Grouping by persecutors is problematic because their motivations are not necessarily religious (the regime may not have an organized religion) and those responsible may actually be a more diverse body of powerful individuals, both in terms of religious and other interests. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 03:09, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
