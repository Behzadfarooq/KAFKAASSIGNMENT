<p>It's a membership organization that exists, but it fails the notability guideline of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> because it isn't "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent". Large numbers of Google hits come from SCBWI sources. And that's it. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 10:38, 9 February 2007 (UTC) <b>Change of mind - keep</b> Two book sources now added to the article.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - unsourced, no current evidence of external coverage by independent sources.

<dd>Besides the Golden Kite (all of those pages explicitly begin with the SCBWI), there are generic sources as well. The Department of English at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Dakota_998f.html" title="University of North Dakota">University of North Dakota</a> cosponsors a conference with the SCBWI.<a href="http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/english/ChildrensLit06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/english/ChildrensLit06.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> They are the primary subject of an article about grants and funding,<a href="http://www.writing-world.com/children/funds.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.writing-world.com/children/funds.shtml" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> by Lynne Remick who has published independently elsewhere such as January Magazine.<a href="http://www.januarymagazine.com/kidsbooks/siblingrivalry.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.januarymagazine.com/kidsbooks/siblingrivalry.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> They are the primary subject of this article (subscription required, I didn't).<a href="http://www.znetspot.com/members/login.cfm?hpage=240.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.znetspot.com/members/login.cfm?hpage=240.cfm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> A writer for the government of West Virginia recommends joining, on a WV govt website.<a href="http://www.wvculture.org/arts/artworks/Fall01/childrens.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wvculture.org/arts/artworks/Fall01/childrens.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> These references are buried much deeper, because so many of the first results on google are for local chapters, because (cf <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> by the way) "<i>the scope of activities are national ... in scale</i>". An organization around since the 1970s, with dozens or perhaps hundreds of local chapters, is obviously going to have citations, probably going back into the 1970s.</dd>
<dd>Now, finding these citations was time-consuming, but it was not difficult. You could have asked at <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOKS_edbc.html" title="WP:BOOKS">WP:BOOKS</a> for someone to look for sources; I'm sure someone there would have been able to help. This article has been tagged for a while, but it has had very few editors and wasn't on very many watchlists. So a trip to <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOKS_edbc.html" title="WP:BOOKS">WP:BOOKS</a> would have served well. It's not helpful to take articles directly to AFD when the subject has 61000 google hits. The citations are out there, and there could never have been any doubt that the article can be shown to be notable. But this five-day window to find sources is a <i><b>last resort</b></i>, not a first choice. Please explore other routes in the future. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 13:12, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> First, my apologies for not thinking of friends at <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOK_b369.html" title="WP:BOOK">WP:BOOK</a> as a stage in the journey. Second, there's already an article on <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Kite_Award_ded5.html" title="Golden Kite Award">Golden Kite Award</a>, and that's not the subject of this debate. Checking through Coelacan's links hasn't convinced me to change my mind yet. (Is the Remick article a reliable source?) <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 14:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's a reliable source unless you have reason to believe otherwise (e.g. she's lying, or she was paid by the SCBWI to write it). All the Golden Kite Award sources are both about the award and the organization, and demonstrate notability for both, imho. And since the University of North Dakota cite is probably the strongest cite here, what's your opinion on that one? —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 14:24, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Sadly, I don't see a single sentence about SCBWI as the primary subject in that North Dakota link. And I don't believe that notability automatically flows both ways between a corporation/organization and a named award: my reading of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is that each named subject stands on its own. Meanwhile, the Remick article isn't that strong against <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Non-scholarly_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and I think that's the most depth of published material we've seen so far. But I'm always trying to be open-minded and better sources would quickly convince me. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 16:31, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The North Dakota thing is a "<i>27th Annual Writers Conference in Children's Literature</i>", presented by the "<i>Society of Children's Book Writers &amp; Illustrators and the Department of English, UND</i>". That means the organization is notable enough that the department cosponsors an annual conference with them. It doesn't have to be the primary subject of the page; their notability is demonstrated by the collaboration itself. And I'm afraid you're completely wrong about the Golden Kite Award. The Award is notable <i>because the SCBWI presents it</i>. If the Award is notable <i>because of the SCBWI</i> then the SCBWI has to be notable to lend its notability to the Award. As for Remick, I wish you'd actually be specific about what you think the problem is. As I've demonstrated, she's independently published elsewhere (January Magazine for example), and the Writing-World site where this is published is independent of both her and SCBWI. It's not even indiscriminate free hosting, or something you can pay to have your article hosted on, Writing-World <i>paid Remick</i> for that piece, 5¢ per word, to be exact.<a href="http://www.writing-world.com/admin1/guidelines.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.writing-world.com/admin1/guidelines.shtml" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 23:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
