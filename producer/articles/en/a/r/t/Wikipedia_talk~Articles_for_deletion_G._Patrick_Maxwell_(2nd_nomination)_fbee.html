<p><i>Will anyone help put a stop to such personal attacks? This violates every Wikopedia standard of civility. If those standards are no longer applicable and this is a free for all, then I will conduct this debate accordingly. We can start with honesty of the writer of the Maxwell article.MollyBloom 07:52, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>I challenge Rob to quote some independent source that suggests Maxwell is a "prominent international figure". I have repeatedly asked him to cite references, which he has refused to do. Rob wrote a puff piece about his mentor, plain and simple.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Molly I provided you with pop-culture references outside medicine that identify him as one of the highest regarded surgeons (which you dismissed), there's a bibiography which includes many of the important papers in the development of aesthetic &amp; breast reconstruction surgery, links featuring him as the keynote speaker at meetings around the world are available, awards that he's won are (partially) listed., etc. You're being disingenuous as there is no way to satisfy your demands<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroliver_c7f0.html" title="User:Droliver">Droliver</a> 04:56, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"links featuring him as the keynote speaker at meetings around the world are available" -- Did I miss them, Rob? WHy don't you point these links out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is an example of a 'world renowned' doctor that warrants inclusion in Wikopedia, NOT Maxwell: Dr. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_E._DeBakey_ab65.html" title="Michael E. DeBakey">Michael E. DeBakey</a> is a notable physician, with an excellent Wikopedia entry. The Maxwell article is NOT.</p>
<p>Another example, Dr. Jenny, at whose mention Rob bristles. Dr. Jenny is known for the "Jenny valve" in saline implants. Is there such a "Maxwell valve"? MollyBloom 08:04, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am not the only one making this complaint, Rob. Look above. If you can so easily provide references, then why don't you do it? Pop-culture hardly qualifies - I can cite you pop-culture articles on several different plastic surgeons. Would you like them? And what novel new concept did Maxwell <i>originate</i>? You make a lot of assertions in your article, but you do not substantiate them. All I am asking is that you do so. When I did (or GassyGuy above) you refused to do so.MollyBloom 05:00, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Molly I gave you pop-culture references because you're demanding references &amp; accolades that only exist in pop-culture. There is no professional society award for "international acclaim" or "one of America's top surgeons". (That's reflected in his awards and his demand as an invited speaker.) Three large media resources with international circulation citing him in that context to flesh out his professional resume and awards is what I can do for you. As far as novel concepts to him would be the development of textured tissue expanders (which revolutionized implant based breast reconstruction), the concept of bio-dimensional approaches to implant selection, the latissimus free flap, development of the early versions of anatomic implant styles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>DId he develop all of those things, Rob? That is not the way it sounded in the article. It sounded like he participated, at best. If he was, as one suggested, the first on the article then you could say he was 'instrumental' in the development or 'led the development" or something like that.MollyBloom 06:40, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>NO it was not. I still have reference tags that you refused to edit. I have only asked you to substantiate the claims you make. And you continually insist you have, when it is obvious that you have not. In the article, you said "world renowned expert" not "one of America's top surgeons". Although, given what I have read about him, I surely would not consider him a top surgeon, even in my state, let alone the country. I would justifiably be afraid to go to him. MollyBloom 06:36, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Even if all you said were true, Rob, you completely ignored my comment here about personal attacks. Because you do not like my observations is not cause for insults.</i></p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Midgley wrote that there are not many plastic surgeons. I would like to see him substantiate this. In fact, there are many plastic surgeons. I would like someone to explain why Maxwell is somehow more notable than many many others. Further, I would like someone to explain why outright insults such as Midgley's below are acceptable in Wikopedia. These attacks are inexcusable, and patently untrue. MollyBloom 04:20, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dr <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_E._DeBakey_ab65.html" title="Michael E. DeBakey">Michael_E._DeBakey</a> is clearly notable. Let's look at his article and compare it to the one which Molly wants to remove all uncited details from and delete. Count the papers listed: zero. Count the citations to footnotes: zero. Count the claims of first doing something (eg endarterectomy) which are backed up in the manner that Molly requires for them to be permitted to remain in this article rather than being evidence of lying and POV by the authors: zero. That is a string of zeroes, and yet the article is a better article than this one, better written, better to read, showing less indication of having been fought over, and there is no need for more detailed referencing. if you want more detail, look at one of the references. The article in short is very much of the nature of this one, before Molly got at it along with others who demand that each word come with a footnote. A good example Molly, it shows up a double standard very very well. I recommend everyone involved looks at it and considers this. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 00:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let's see about claims. Here are some for DeBakey. I'd say these say alot about this doctor. And there are references. In 1953, DeBakey performed the first successful endarterectomy. In 1963, DeBakey was the first to successfully implant an artificial heart. In 1965, Time Magazine featured Dr. DeBakey on its cover for his pioneering work and innovations in cardiovascular surgery and the artificial heart. In 1969, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. During the same year, the Baylor College of Medicine separated from Baylor University under his direction. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan awarded him the National Medal of Science. Russian President Boris Yeltsin called DeBakey "a magician of the heart" after the surgeon performed quintuple bypass surgery on him in 1996. Both the DeBakey High School for Health Professions and the Michael E. DeBakey Veteran's Affairs Hospital in the Texas Medical Center in Houston are named after him. An atraumatic vascular surgical clamp that he introduced also bears his name.02:24, 7 June 2006 (UTC) <a name="The_surgeon_I_suggested_as_more_noteworthy_than_Maxwell_is_a_strong_proponent_of_silicone_breast_implants." id="The_surgeon_I_suggested_as_more_noteworthy_than_Maxwell_is_a_strong_proponent_of_silicone_breast_implants."></a></p>

<p><i>None of Midgleys complaints about my edits on breast imlants (which are all supported by citation) has nothing to do with the issue as to whether G. Patrick Maxwell is worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia.</i> I have also added numerous examples of surgeons who <i>are</i> credited with the development of the lat flap, which Rob claims is Maxwell's claim to fame. Rob's statements regarding this in the article are not supported by citation. There is a reason for this, as he is not credited in the article I found that includes a large section on the history of lat flap, and the surgeons who made major contributions. Of course, I have a POV on siicone breast implants. So does Rob Oliver. That has utterly nothing to do with the inclusion of Maxwell in wikopedia. I welcome either Midgely or Oliver to write an article on a noteworthy propenent of breast implants, or one of the many surgeons that were credited for major accomplishment on the development of lat flap. And, I urge Midgely stop distracting from the issue at hand by making personal attacks and discussing articles which have no bearing on the merits of the inclusion of Maxwell.</p>
<p>The personal attacks are not warranted, nor are they acceptable in Wikopedia. In fact, they warrant banning, and Midgely has been warned to be civil. He apparantly is unable or unwilling to do this. MollyBloom 20:54, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, follow this chain... there are quite a few (one might even say "many") doctors. Of those there are a much smaller number of surgeons (I've not counted, but say around a quarter, of those in substantive posts - reckoning from GPs being a third of the total doctor pop, the rest dividing into surgeons, anaesthetists(the largest hospital specialty) and those the UK loosely calls "Physicians" and the US calls internal medicine specialists, gastroenterologists etc. I've left Obs &amp; Gynae in among the surgeons. There are also a few public health and occupational docs, but this is a very rough cut. Of the surgeons (say a quarter of the total) about 1% are plastic surgeons. Of the surgeons in training, quite a lot would like at some time to end up as plastic surgeons, so it is quite competitive, and quite a filter they go through. Accordingly, not many (of) doctors are plastic surgeons, and those that do as well as being infrequent are selected, and therefore likely to be notable. One might run a similar rough reckoning on lawyers - many students, nealry as many graduates, few of those (in the UK model) become pubils in chambers, and fewer of those become barristers. Of the latter only a minority achieve "silk" as Queen's Counsel, and therefore any QC is likely to be notable. Those QCs who turn out to be married to the Prime Minister, those who become judges or conduct public enquiries and those who become recorders and other judges are progressively less likely to not be notable if only because of the way in which they have changed public policy through interpretation and application of existing law. SOmeone can do the similar one for the USA, it might be interesting if it isn't already somewhere in here. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 15:45, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I can show you any number of law professors who have every bit as much (and more) publications, accolates, etc. as Maxwell. This is pretty standard. Yet I would not start an entry on all of them. This is just ludicrous.MollyBloom 18:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As to the content of MollyBloom's contirbutions,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hopefully Midgely has stopped this vein of attack. If anyone has been combative here, it is Midgely. I asked for an Rfd for valid reasons, as can be seen by the many "delete" votes/comments.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Midgely's attempt to distract has been repeatedly pointed out. if you actually look at them (which action Leifern's comment does not reflect) you see a vast preonderance of edits of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implant.html" title="Breast implant">Breast implant</a> - many of them combative and associated with turmoil This is untrue, as usual. I was told that I had improved the article from the advertisement it had been. I have cited every edit I have ever made there, which is more than I can say of the previous version. It still needs work, and because of the edit war, I asked for other input . This is all reasonable. NOW, this has nothing to do with this Rfd.<br />
Midgely's attempt to obfuscate and distract is what is combative. MollyBloom 18:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC) - and little else, nothing of note that is not a direct connection to that single interest. If <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> was available and chose to edit WP, I would be satisfied if his entries only included special relativeity and <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a>, with or without <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">god</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dice.html" title="Dice">dice</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">universe</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum.html" title="Quantum">quantum</a>. However, none of us here are of such individual merit on any given subject, and I also suspect that he would chip in on <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patents.html" title="Patents">patents</a> and possibly <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> being other topics of interest and on which he could be informative. I read a long record of contributions on a single topic alone as being an indication of a focus unhealthy for WP. I view a public assertion that it does not exist, in the face of a clear and incontrovertible record of it as a suggestive indication of either a lack of self-knowledge, or an intention to deceive. I'm contemplating writing an essay for WP about it, as WP gets bigger, it will happen (is happening) more, and it represents a clear and present danger to being taken seriously as a reference work, a danger moreover which having a few or even a lot of fancruft, bandcruft and other articles on subjects of minor general interest can never represent. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 15:45, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Lastly, the question I asked was whether we are sure that two of the editors posting overlapping comments, one of them with a very short and restricted list of edits were independent of each other. I see that we are sure of their degree of independence, and it seems to me entirely reasonable that now we are sure of that degree, we can read their remarks in context. I'm bored with this, and I've made my view known - I feel a claim to an interest given I first proposed this article for deletion and have observed and assisted its improvement since is reasonable, and that the reaction from <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMollybloom_b0da.html" title="User:Mollybloom">User:Mollybloom</a> is, yet again, entirely unreasonable, and that hte blocking policy relating to alterations to biographies of persons yet living also may apply. My work here, then, is done. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 15:45, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is a list of plastic surgeons who ARE credited with major contributions on lattisimus flap: The article credited a number of physicians with contributions to the procedure. These doctor include: Iginio Tansini Stefano d'Este Hutchins Darrell Campbell Davis Iginio Tansini Stefano d'Este Brantigan, McCraw William Schneider Muhlbauer Olbrisch Bostwick It appears that if, as Rob asserts, Maxwell's major claim to fame is his contribution to the lat flap (which still has <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="These claims needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">citations needed</span></i></a>]</sup> assigned to the claim) then any of these surgeons would merit inclusion more than Maxwell.MollyBloom 20:23, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As noted over page, the article which Molly is quoting is about a procedure almost completely unlike the free flap transfer. It is both irrelevant, and by being presented demonstrates a lack of understanding of the topic. This is one thing in someone who is politely asking a question, and a recklessly differnt thing in need of correction by the author in someone who is using it in an effort to convince other people in a very public and persistent place that the person involved is not notable or their (vicarious) claim to fame is false. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 00:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Leifern, you have a misunderstanding of his position. Pat is not an employee of Vanderbilt University &amp; he's not just another physician. Patients and Physicians come from all over the world to visit and watch him work. What exactly does it take to convince you he's a "recognized expert"? In addition you're being somewhat insulting to someone you don't know about something you don't know about. Please keep in mind this <i>accusation</i> of informed consent failure was in fact dropped.<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroliver_c7f0.html" title="User:Droliver">Droliver</a> 04:34, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I never wrote that he is an "employee of Vanderbilt University" and I'll thank you not to misrepresent my position. All I'm pointing out is that his entire claim to noteworthiness (with the exception of legal action against him) is based on assertions that aren't referenced. So far, we only have your word that people travel from all around the world to watch "Pat" do his work.

<dd>Wait a minute here. Rob, you wrote "Pat is not an employee of Vanderbilt University". Then you wrote, "You can't be a tenured professor if you're not an <i>employee</i> of a University". What exactly is it that you were trying to say? The fact is that he is an assistant professor. And yes, that would mean he is an employee, but you said he wasn't, then you jumped all over Leifern when he agreed with you, or I think, was confused by your nonsensical statement. He can't be an Assistant Professor, either, Rob, if he isn't an employee. Good grief, you have convoluted this, and to what purpose? So you can prove Leifern wrong? It seems that you were the one who was initially wrong, when you said "Pat is not an employee of Vanderbilt University." He isn't? So I take it he holds no teaching position, or he is an adjunct? That is not what his bio says. Why were you trying to confuse? OR were you confused?MollyBloom 17:47, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Molly you're deliberately obtuse. <i>"The fact is that he is an assistant professor. And yes, that would mean he is an employee"</i> No it does not mean you're an employee, it means he has have an academic appointment thru the Department of Plastic Surgery. The point of clarification for Leifern was to explain his academic title<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroliver_c7f0.html" title="User:Droliver">Droliver</a> 18:30, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're a little confused. I'm just trying to understand this person's claim to notability. Clearly, it isn't his academic credentials, as he is at best adjunct faculty at Vanderbilt. So maybe it's contributions he's made to the practice of plastic surgery, but that is hardly substantiated. Arguably it's accusations leveled against him for serious ethical and possibly legal lapses, but I'm not sure that is enough, either. You're the one who made something about his employment status at Vanderbilt, not me. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 18:37, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SIgh, Leifern, you said it. It was Rob who made an issue out of his academic position and/or employment status, not Leifern, and not I. If it was not an issue, why did you make it one? I have a bit of experience with graduate environments, and I would wonder why such a world renowned authority would not be more recognized by the University - without demaning extraordinary time requirements. That was my only point. Instead, this has as usual become a tedious circular and nonsensical diatribe.MollyBloom 18:49, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since there seems to be confusion about this whole exchange, I'll attempt to interpret what is being said here. Initially, Leifern stated that "he is a run-of-the-mill practicing physician who has only risen to the level of (non-tenured) assistant professorship" which Droliver attempted to explain. The explanation seems to be this: Maxwell makes a lot of money as a plastic surgeon. If he were to become a Vanderbilt employee, he would draw a lower salary and his earnings would largely go to the medical school, thus lowering his income. Therefore, he has an association with Vanderbilt whereby he keeps his income in exchange for a title which is not tenured and is not a full professorship. This is a common arrangement within the medical world and is especially common among subspecialty surgeons such as Maxwell. He remains within the academic environment and teaches students, residents, and fellows but is not an official school employee. I hope this helps, though I'm not sure it impacts the RfD at hand. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 19:10, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am curious as to what you think distinguishes this surgeon from thousands of other surgeons and academics with published papers, or the many that have received the same awards as he has. I do not see how he possibly meets the WP:BIO criteria.MollyBloom 03:48, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In response to your question on my talk page about my vote, I can only say that I did read through the entire article, the talk pages, read the abstracts of his papers and actually googled him myself! I admit to being an inclusionist, but I think that Maxwell passes the WP:BIO/<a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> on several counts. First, he not only has a large body of work, but has published quality work (as evidenced by his award for the best article of the year). He first developed an important surgical procedure which I have seen first-hand (free flap transfer). He has taught many other plastic surgeons, not only as fellows (as evidenced by multiple web pages and CVs which trumpet training by him) but also other practicing surgeons (he creates teaching videos and helps run continuing medical education courses). He established a practice which is quite large and which was the subject of a New York Times article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/women/warchive/960707_5051.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/women/warchive/960707_5051.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. He has done charity work, testified before the FDA, and served on advisory committees for the American Association of Plastic Surgeons. I may not have written the article on him, but since there is an nicely written well-referenced article already in place, I can honestly think of no reason to delete it. If thousands of other individuals with his degree of accomplishment had equally well-written and referenced articles, then I think Wikipedia would be better off for it! <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 04:50, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did Maxwell develop the procedure, or did he merely participate in it? That is not clear in the article at all.

<p>Yes we are two different people with two distinct writing styles. How do we know you and Dr. Oliver aren't one and the same?, Further a number of doctors and scientests have testified in front of the FDA as well as a number of women with breast implant medical issues- do each of them deserve a biography (or in the case of Maxwell, a haigiography)?. I am not the same as Molly Bloom. My edits concerned the haigification of Maxwell. A good bio includes more than just a CV, it should tell the reader something of the man or woman. It should include facts that present the character.</p>
<p>In addition to the arguments I made on the talk page for inclusion of his professional misconduct, as a professional, with ethical duties, I find Maxwell's dereliction of his duties to his patient by flagrantly ignoring her demand not to be implanted with silicone to be telling of his character. I would feel the same way if she demanded silicone and he used saline. It's the patients' body and it's patient's life, it is the patient's decision, not the doctor's. There was no compelling medical reason to go against the patient's wishes, behind the patient's back. I strongly feel that is significant and should be included, <i><b>if Maxwell is deserving a bio at all</b></i>. Your comments on the talk page indicate you still don't understand that. In fact your comments suggest you don't even understand the basic facts of this case. I gather you are a doctor as well. Your lacadasical attitude astounds me.</p>
<p>Finally instead of attacking me or Molly Bloom, why don't you submit a reasoned argument that Maxwell has made a significant contribution to plastic surgery that will be talked about 100 years from now. 100 years ago, I am sure there were hundreds of surgeons who wrote academic papers in professional journals. Should they all be listed in Wikipedia? Is the surgical technique that radical or revolutionary? If so, why is it radical and revolutionary?

<dd>One reason to pursue an appeal on a point of law is that it seems to someone (including sometimes the judge) to be significant, without reference to the merits of the actual case. This is known to lawyers. It is stated overleaf that the appeal court hearing established a precedent in Tennessee on from when the period in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_limitations.html" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a> commences. Thus this is a case which might be taken to the Court of Appeal by one side, or at the instance of one or other Courts, (or, beyond my own reading, perhaps the Lord Chancellor or his Tennessee cousin in law or legislature - this is speculation). Thus, a case visibly of no merit (as much as a case which might be decided either way) may be taken to an appeal on a significant technical point and then the appeal having defined the law on that point the substance of the case be thrown back into limbo. Thus, a case may raise a question, the question be answered, and the case not heard without any conclusion on the merit of the actual case being reached or indeed heard in court. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 15:15, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That issue was only a part of the case, but it is the only part of the case that needs to concern us. It sheds light upon character of the alleged notable.

<dl>
<dd>Rob posted to his personal webpage - that is a blog, which was by and for himself, and which linked to his practice website.

<p>It seems that the complaints with this article have been voiced long before my even reading it.</p>
<p>It is dishonest for Midgley to say that I suggested deletion after or because of my edits. The fact is, there are still baseless statements, that are not supported by fact. Moreover, the fact is that this surgeon has no more publications than many tenured college professors or run-of-the-mill experts in any given field. Also, you would not suggest including an article on all those who testified before the FDA, so why this particular person?</p>
<p>Oh, I just heard from one friend who is a plastic surgeon (who does do breast augmentation and reconstructive surgery). He said he didn't know much about Maxwell, and didn't see that he was particularly notable, although he certainly viewed himself to be. MollyBloom 23:09, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sir Harold Delf Gillies, for example, which is an entry on Wikopedia. That is most certainly notable. Maxwell (unless it is <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Clerk_Maxwell_e091.html" title="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a>, the physicist) is not notable. In fact, Midgely, it might be instructive for you to see the entry on James Clerk Maxwell, so you can see how this is different. MollyBloom 23:35, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Midgley, if testifying before the FDA is grounds for inclusion in Wikopedia, then I should have an entry, since I testified. What do you think? Do you even have a clue as to how many people - experts, scientists of all stripes and lay people testify? That has got to be one of the most absurd 'reasons' for inclusion in Wikopedia that I have ever heard. MollyBloom</p>

<dd><i>How</i> many? Of those, how many on matters over which there is significant controversy? Of those latter, bluntly, how many have a professional qualification in what they are talking about? As one sifts, the likeihood of notability rises. And it is of course silly to suggest that any individual item taken alone garantees notability or inclusion - the totality of several does though. My ignorance of such detail is indeed considerable, however it has not been reduced by any information proferred here. As to the merits of writing an article about a living person who is a contributor to WP - that turns upon someone feeling it is worth starting, and there are a bunch of WP policies about it, I recommend reading some of the policies. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 15:51, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Gee, another person who thinks it is not a good idea to put silicone implants in a woman against her wishes, or include someone with this background in a Wiki article. I'm amazed at how flippant the Wiki doctors are about this, or as Midgley suggested, 'it is no big deal'. I suspect many women would think it is a very big deal. And as to Maxwell's 'world renowned' status, I have yet to see anything to substantiate that. Maybe Maxwell is a legend in his own mind, and in his followers, but I sure see little to recommend him for inclusion in Wikopedia. MollyBloom 07:24, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I stated, he is no more notable than thousands of other academics. There were at least three in the most recent NYT article mentioned by Midgely. It woudl be ludicrous to mention every doctor, surgeon, engineer, etc who is ever quoted in a paper. IT is ever more obvious to me that this is a promotional article and not worthy of Wikopedia.MollyBloom 22:29, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, for a start if you look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Plastic_surgeons" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Plastic_surgeons" rel="nofollow">here</a> you see that Macindoe (a hero) and Gillies (whose taste in needle holders I share, but I'd not compare my technique with his in any other way - another hero) are in, and so is Maxwell. One interpretation would be that for no other plastic surgeons in history or present has there been a person who felt it was worth the effort of writing about them for WP. Removing 33% of the material on plastic surgeons from WP because it isn't comprehensive seems a big step. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a></dd>

<dd>Let me see if I understand the argument: Maxwell belongs on Wikipeida, because... he is on Wikipeida? Isn't that kind of circular? I see Gillies is the father of plastic surgery; clearly he belongs. Maxwell isn't the father of plastic surgery. McIndoe has a unit of a hospital named after him and is the subject of a recent biography (book). Sounds reasonable to include him as well. Maxwell- any hospital units named after him? Ok, any books written about him? No? He did get a $1000.00 reward for a technical video (a Plastic Surgeon Oscar?) and he has the dubious honor of having his name on a legal precedent in the great state of Tennessee on the issue of when the clock starts running on statutes of limitations. But you and Oliver don't even want to include that bit of info, so obviously you don't feel that is a sufficient reason. ;-) Gfwesq 00:24, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, that is a significant aspect of the case which probably accounts for it being argued at appeal, and then disappearing. I've added it. A detailed reference to that would perhaps improve the paragraph. As to the iterative argument about being the only living plastic surgeon in WP being a suggestion of notability, yes, that is the argument.

<li><b>Comment</b> A review of Mollybloom's contributions shows a clear agenda - a single-minded approach to anything to do with breast implants and now apparently surgeons who do breast implants. It doesn't appear to me that this suggested deletion has anything to do with producing an encyclopaedia, it does seem to me that it is furthering a personal agenda of presenting a particular view to the world and minimising any other aspects' exposure. I made the first proposal for deletion, and the article is in fact considerably better, and does not have the same faults as then - although a set of Molly's edits to it before it was protected would have tended to support that argument (first delete the detail, then claim the article is so uninformative as to be unworth keeping). It does have some additions which - to someone knowing something of the area of knowledge at least - look significant. Writing about technical matters is always going to be a compromise in WP. As to notability - there are not many plastic surgeons, and few of them testify to the US FDA on an aspect of their specialty, so I suspect that this one is notable, at least within the confines of the US. WP has many times been noted to tolerate things which it would not advocate - IE if someone thought it was worth writing an article, leaving it there is reasonable, even if nobody else would have been inclined to write it. Also, if there are hundreds, or thousands of other people as notable a view commonly advanced is that there are therefore hundreds, or thousands of articles yet to write. The alternative to that would be to suggest that no new article should be presented, unless all articles in that category are presented along with it, which would pose a challenge to the productively of WP editors. Lastly, is it clear that Gfwesql and Mollybloom are entirely separate? <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 22:48, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>and <b>Strong keep</b> partly becuase this is a clear attempt to subvert WP procedures and norms, partly because to delete one article in furtherance of an agenda would encourage further depredations, and partly because assertions that someone is not notable becuase they are not in the newspapers but in peer-reviewed journals should not be supported. I suggest that an RFC on MollyBoom's activities related to breast implants and now this afd should be called and that a ban on editing any article related to plastic surgery would be appropriate and improve the quality of the WP. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 12:47, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This has been repeatedly explained and your inaccuracies exposed, but you keep repeating the same wrong information.MollyBloom 01:53, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually the facts submitted were from an Appellate opinion from a 9 year old court case (the incident may be 20 years old, but the allegation is from 9 years ago). I suppose this would be a good place to explain some things about courts and appeals.</p>
<p>1. Trial Courts do not publish opinions. That is not their purpose in life. Trial courts hear the evidence based upon logical rules to establish reliability. A trial court judge can exert considerable influence with his discretion in his evidence rulings. If he allows evidence in, its part of the record. If he doesnât allow the evidence in, it is not part of the record. If he abuses his discretion in his evidentiary rulings, the affected party can appeal the evidentiary ruling. This is not common. At the end of the hearing or trial, the facts of the case are decided and then a ruling is made by applying the law to the facts to reach a result. Both sides get to argue what is the evidence in the case.</p>
<p>2. Appellate courts review the law, not the facts- unless the appeal is based upon abuse of discretion by the trial court in its evidentiary rulings. The official position of the Appellate Court is they werenât present when witnesses testified, did not review the physical evidence or conduct the examination of the witnesses, and therefore are not in a good position to determine the facts. They can and do apply the law to the facts and review how that was done in the lower court.</p>
<p>Therefore, the facts presented to the appellate court, were the findings of the lower court when it ruled favorably for Maxwell. If you read the opinion, linked to in the article, you will learn the facts of the case found by the trial court:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. Maxwell informed Merlo of the hazards of silicone v. saline.</dd>
<dd>2. Based upon Maxwellâs presentation, Merlo preferred saline to silicone</dd>
<dd>3. Maxwell implanted her with silicone anyway and presented no evidence that he had informed her of his doing so.</dd>
<dd>4. When Merlo had to return for additional surgery, she was handed a consent form asking her consent for silicone, which she refused in line with her previous position.</dd>
<dd>5. After she refused permission, the staff told her she already had silicone implants.</dd>
<dd>6. This was news to Merlo (see 2 above) and she was visibly upset according to the staff testimony.</dd>
<dd>7. 6 above imples 3 above was done behind her back</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In short, Merlo won the right to continue her case. It is not logical as Droliver continuously suggests for her to have dropped the case after winning the appeal. It is noteworthy that in the history of discussing this case, Droliver first stated the case was dismissed misreading or misciting the appellate court decision. When that error was pointed out to him, Droliver has fallen back on âthe case was dropped.â The one statement Droliver never makes, âis the plaintiff lost at trialâ or that the trial court âdismissed the case in Maxwellâs favor on X grounds. Since we are talking about his mentor, its reasonable to assume Droliver knows exactly what happened.</p>
<p>Based upon the known facts, there are only two logical and reasonable conclusions:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. having lost his defense based upon the statute of limitations, Maxwell had no other good defense and elected to settle the case.</dd>
<dd>2. If Maxwell had a good defense to the merits of the case, presumably he would have defended himself vigorously at trial.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If Maxwell had been vindicated at trial, you can bet Droliver would be telling us this and he wouldnât be shy about it. And of course, if he lost, Droliver wouldnât tell us. Based upon his current statements, I suspect Maxwell settled because he did not have a good defense. But then Droliver changes his story a lot, so its hard to say for sure.

<p>The context for notoriety is the lawsuit against him, what was revealed in discovery such as his admitted alcoholism and entry into rehab (about the time of the lawsuit), allegations of cocaine abuse which was one of the questions of the plaintiff's lawyers, and community reputatation which is not exactly stellar on these accounts.</p>
<p>I don't really think you want to highlight the context for notoriety, do you? The paragrah about the lawsuit is sufficient, without the volatile discussion of his chemical dependencies.</p>
<p>As it has been requested that more evidence of his stature be provided to support the claim that he is both an international figure &amp; recognized as superlative within his field. I give you these links to recent meetings world-wide where he's been an invited speaker. This is in addition to hundreds of other events he's done before the last two years. Is there anyone who can plausibly still argue about this?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think anyone disputed his speaking engagement, but I don't see the point. Many academics travel for speaking engagements, or as visiting professors. I can remember professors rotating these.... This is not particularly unique or extraordinary, unless, of course, you are talking about some small low rated med school. ANd, t his is not a puff piece, either.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I looked up Visiting Professor for plastic surgery foundation, one of the references. (And it is not called 'nationwide'). Here is a professor and surgeon that seems to have considerably more experience and credentials (including speaking invitations) than Maxwell. He testified before the FDA, and etc etc etc which is not all that unusual for proponents of silicone impalnts and those doctors connected with breast impant manufacturers. Here is his CV: <a href="http://www.georgetownuniversityhospital.org/body.cfm?id=1637" class="external free" title="http://www.georgetownuniversityhospital.org/body.cfm?id=1637" rel="nofollow">http://www.georgetownuniversityhospital.org/body.cfm?id=1637</a>. He is one of many. I don't suggest that all be included with Wiki articles. This simply is not a legitmate way to determine notability. If this were the criteria, every academic and specialist in the country would overwhelm Wikopedia. That is simply ludicrous. Again, I am not discounting Dr. Maxwell's achievements, nor am I suggesting that Spear's be highlighted. Spear was a defendant in a case against breast implant manufacturers, and has had financial links with silicone implant manufacturers (clearly a strong advocate for silicone breast implants) but in a cursory review I see nothing like a claim of malpractice or personal malfeasance. This is merely one example of many, as to why Maxwell is not exceptionally notable in the field. There are many many surgeons with his expertise, and his credentials, and his CV and even more speaking engagements. That is true for about every field I can think of.. God knows, it is in law. I just have to look at half my former law professors and can come up with a CV to rival or surpass Maxwell (taking into consideration the difference in area of study and expertise).MollyBloom 03:42, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And now we are having it again. Can you make a coherent argument that Maxwell is a notable figure using the Wikipedia guidlines for notable professionals or not? I'll give you one hint, attacking Molly or me or any other editor is not a coherent argument within the guidlines. What is notable about Maxwell that differentiates him from the pack? I would point out that Gassyguy notes the last time it was promised it would be shown that Maxwell is indeed notable AND he feels that this promise was not kept. So it is not just Molly. So far the only arguments I have seen are circular ones. He is not notable, simply because Dr. Oliver says he is notable. Give an arguement explaining what he has achieved, why it is important and state whether he did all the work himself or as part of a team or what. Complaining Molly is being spiteful does not meet that goal (and really, at the risk of being insulting, it is childish)Gfwesq 04:35, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have not removed <i>anything</i> that Midgely wrote except the incorrect comment on the front page. I have NEVER deleted his vote. I do not believe it was deleted -- it probably was moved ot the talk page by Ian, but I didn't look to make sure. That probably should be corrected.. However, Midgely's ugly accusations continue, and are always baseless. He last accused me of removing his vote &amp; comments, and wrote nearly a page long diatribe on how horrible I was. Ian pointed out to him that in fact Ian had inadvertantly moved those to the talk page along with other comments. Midgely never apologized to me, or to anyone. Midgely needs to have a comlaint filed against him, and banned for continued personal attacks and violation of Wikopedia's standard of conduct. His atrocious behavior and personal attacks continue, unabated, despite several warnings from admins. MollyBloom 20:40, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is certainly scope for an RFC, however it is also abundantly clear that Molly did remove one of my comments(see over for th diff and commentary on it - it was significant), and my vote was removed. THe latter was inadvertent and not Molly. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 00:17, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I already said that, and I said why. This was the ONLY one I ever removed, and I said that. I also said you could add it back. I see you added a comment much longer. I have already sought a former resolution of the personal attacks Midley has made. Midgely has created a brawl by his personal attacks, and then called for premature closure to the Rfd because of what he created. I appreciate that Midgley finally admitted the removal of the vote was inadvertant and not by me. However, he had previously and falsely accused me of removing it then used that as a forum to launch yet another diatribe against me.MollyBloom 00:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I don't think the fact he had speaking engagements in Atlanta or in other countries means he is anything but a very good academic. Maybe I went to a very good graduate school, but this was pretty normal fare for professors. My question would be, if he was so extraordinary, why was he still only an assistant professor? That is very unusual.MollyBloom 17:35, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, so now he is <i>good</i> academic! If you knew much about medicine in the USA, you'd know that in most surgical fields (and Plastic Surgery in particular) training programs cannot afford the salaries to keep many of the best physicians on staff. That's why he's labled a clinical assistant professor (you also might see people listed as clinical faculty or instructor). The exact title depends upon the University policy and at many programs they do not give out a full title of professor to non-tenure track associates. Some give the title out like candy<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroliver_c7f0.html" title="User:Droliver">Droliver</a> 18:13, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Rob, there is no reason to be vicious. It is not just medicine, but it is almost all academic fields that don't pay well. That has absolutely nothing to do with his status as assistant professor. And I never said he was not a good academic (aside from his legal and other problems). I never made that judgment, and for you to insinuate I did, is once again, dishonest. What my point is, along with many other editors who have weighed in here, is that he is not an extraordinary 'world expert' worthy of inclusion in Wikopedia. Your statement that schools hand out titles like candy does not enhance your argument. If anything, it goes to show even more so, that he is not sufficiently notable to be included in Wikopedia.MollyBloom 18:31, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Molly there are WP:Bio guideline for worthiness &amp; I suggest you read them. There are contextual links in &amp; outside of medicine which have been provided to address questions of his stature &amp; noteriety within the field.

<dd>More than that, I'm going to point out here that I was entirely correct, because when the paper was made available for inspection, rather than relying on Molly's account of what it said, it immediately became obvious to anyone who read it that it was not a paper about free flaps, and therefore of no relevance to the technique under discussion.</dd>

<p>Again, the reason that we do not generally edit the start of the AfD is that is fiercely hard work to determine who voted having seen that misleading material before it was corrected, and decide how much their vote is based upon a true appreciation of the facts. Rather than challenging me, Molly, use the WP help desk, or look at (advice I've given before, now lets be forceful) some <i>other</i> pages of WP. Look at the talk pages of other articles (<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-catholicism.html" title="Anti-catholicism">Anti-catholicism</a> is a good one, or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum.html" title="Quantum">quantum</a> and see how they do it. Editing only breast implants and now this does not help to tune into the WP way and norms, and I suspect several people enjoy their experience less as a result. Which is not good. (I omitted to sign this -this happens, and usually someone uses the appropriate tag to note it, working from history. Midgley)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I assume Midgely wrote this, since it is consistent with his many many other insults of the same variety. It is proper to sign one's comments. It is also proper not to misrepresent, as Midgley clearly has here. I have edited many other things, than breast implants. Even if I had not, this comment is not relevant to this Rfd. MIdgley cannot support the case for keeping this article, so instead he makes personal attacks, turns the Rfd into a brawl and then calls for closure of the Rfd because there is a brawl.

I am, however, still relatively new to Wikopedia, and hope to edit much more in those areas. The ONLY relevant issue here is that it is not proper to make personal accusations on an Rfd (or any page). It is much better - and more civil - to address the merits of the artice/Rfd.

Asking one of them before you referred to that irrelevant article would have been wise, not seeking to ensure you are not wrong after you have been publicly told that you are is unwise. And yes, microsurgical transfer of any flap is related to the flap, but the essence of the technique (and arguably why the first word of the title is "microsurgical" and not "Latissimus", or "flap") is that where it ends up is not anatomically related to where it started from. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 12:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>5. I only edited one comment of Midgleys (or anyone, for that matter). I acknowledged that, and explained why, and told him to put it back if he wished. He chose instead to write a length diatribe, and bring this up repeatedly.</p>
<p>6. Midgely has repeatedly made false accusations against me. As evidence, he first wrote that Gfwesq and I were one in the same person,. Even after he was infomred by an admin that this was not the case, he again wrote that we were not independent persons, and stated that Gfwesq and I should be 'suspect' . Another accusation was when he claimed that I deleted his vote/comments and used that to launch a diatribe against me. Once again, an admin pointed out that MIdgely was wrong, here, as well. Midgley did not admit this until I repeatedly brought it up. Even after this, he once again implied that 'someone' maliciously deleted his vote. This was also untrue.<br /></p>

<dd>It was a joke, or, you had already found it but were demanding I find it for you, or it won't do anyway? It was a mistake, I misread a very complex set of edits - too complex - and it was corrected. WP isn't (supposed to be) a dialogue, it is refactored by many people, and it isn't that important who corrects an error. The Find function is, by the way, teh search within a page function, hence control F, for find.

<dd>It really needs to stop. It was suggested by a mediator that I open an arbitration, to stop this, since mediators are not admins. I probably will have to do that, since the admins here don't seem inclined to stop it. The problem with it staying is that it has turned the Rfd into a free-for-all and totally obscured the Rfd. It also is outrageous - well beyond a violation of WP civility.MollyBloom 16:56, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Rather than threaten to do something, I advise you to either do it, or don't. Prolonging things and threatening doesn't release tension for anyone.

<p><b>Okay. The above diatribe is exactly what I meant. Now in addition to insulting me, Midgley is talking about other users, as well. He also insulted an entire profession (lawyers), which is truly interesting. The whole comment above should be deleted, as it has no place on an Rfd. I request that Midgely please look at the comments below by Cowman, and the requests by mediators to stop this kind of absurdity. This is no longer discussion about an Rfd, but a forum to insult people. This is not civil, it is not adherent to Wikopedia rules or general human decency, and it is incredibly childish.

<dd>What you do, if you want to reach an accomodation, is ask for mediation. Because we all think you are a good person, and even sarcastic cynical people who say what they think like me think you are salvageable as a contributor to WP, and hopefully because someone somewhere thinks that among my 5k or so of edits there are a few worth having, or that someone who is a b'crat, admin etc on a WikiProject with 200 doctors adding material and ab-so-lu-te-ly no repeat no rows like this in its entire history is arguably not quite as described above at all times in all respects and able to do an impression of modesty on occasion might yet be handy, I predict that there will be a <s>floodrushmodest trickle</s> of offers to mediate. Which means, mediate. OTOH, if you wind yourself up tighter, then apart from the deleterious effect on the arteries, you get to find out that RFCs can turn into an RFC on any participant... looking at the ones listed above would be a very prudent I say again a very prudent action. ArbCom - well, think of it as a cross between a T2000 and the Supreme Court. Great fun to watch on a film.

<b>Here is something about microsurgery and breast reconstruction:</b><br />
<i>Dr. Robert J. Allen pioneered microsurgical Breast Reconstruction with perforator flaps in 1992. He originated the DIEP, the S-GAP, the I-GAP and the SIEA procedures for breast reconstruction.</i></p>
<p>Okay this may be a different procedure. How many different surgeons belong in Wikopedia, who each developed procedures or <i>refinements</i>? This really is a fair question.</p>
<p>Is the issue just a matter of who has a student willing to push a POV? I note that the docs who are for inclusion of their fellow doc point out his work on the microsurgical free flap. How is that related to this statement: "Maxwell is a strong proponent of silicone breast implants" that is in the article? It seems t o me more a POV by Oliver, who has been angry about the introduction in the BI article that there is any controversy whatsoever. This is exactly what I mean. There has been a lot of vicious talk here about <i>my</i> POV. Wow. I think it is obvious that Oliver has taken his love of silicone breast implants to push POV and highlight his beloved teacher at the same time.MollyBloom 21:22, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Okay I think everyone can get the idea. Why don't we just turn WIkopedia into an advertisement for plastic surgeons? OR maybe doctors in general? Hey it is great publicity! That is what this article on Maxwell is. It is not much different than any one of the dozens or hundreds of plastic surgeons that one can find googling. All of these are advertisements. Not one of them really stands out for a Wikopedia article, any more than Maxwell. Evidently, they just don't have a student with an agenda to promote POV on silicone implants and their favorite teacher.

<p>Wiki Entry: Harrison Arlington "Pete" Williams Jr. (December 10, 1919 â November 17, 2001) was a Democrat who represented New Jersey in both the United States House of Representatives (1953-1957) and the United States Senate (1959-1982). Williams was convicted in 1980 for taking bribes in the Abscam sting operation, and resigned from the U.S. Senate in 1982 before a planned expulsion vote. Williams is one of numerous public officials known to have ackowledged drinking problems during the time.</p>
<p>Okay. Here is a bio of someone who was actually convicted. True, with Maxwell, it was only an adverse ruling at an early step in civil litigation. It is relevant because it (1) shows the character of this man who had no evidence to show he provided informed consent; and (2) it shows an important issue in med mal litigation, and this case, in particular. However, Maxwell admitted drinking problems, and entering rehab. SHould we include that in a biography? It is probably a more serious issue that a surgeon have a drinking problem, than a politician. And probably more unusual (or certainly I would hope).</p>
<p>This is what a 'real' biography, and not an advertisement is. The real issue is that Oliver wants a puff piece /advertisement/ hagiography on his mentor, and pants to push a POV on silicone breast implants, as he did on the BI article. This is not a respectful use of WIkopedia. MollyBloom 22:25, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
