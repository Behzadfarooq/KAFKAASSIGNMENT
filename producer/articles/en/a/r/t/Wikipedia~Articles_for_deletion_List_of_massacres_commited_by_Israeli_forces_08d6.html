<dd>The references you add don't support that these were massacres (except Palestinains saying so). You can change it to "List of Israeli operations" for example. Note that it doesn't say List of Hamas genocide terrorist attacks which is what it is. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 23:08, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How come that you are the one to define what is a massacre and what is not? See <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre.html" title="Massacre">Massacre</a> at your own convenience. Israel has done precisely the things listed on that page. Whether it is me, you or the Palestinian people who <i>call</i> the actions for massacres is irrelevant. As long as it can be verified that they did occur and that they fall under the massacre criteria, they are per definition massacres. --<a href="../../../n/y/p/User%7ENyp_3d66.html" title="User:Nyp">Nyp</a> 23:18, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Israel has not done the things listed at all and definitely not precisely like you claim. Massacres="deliberate and direct mass killing" - what you're trying to add wasn't direct and definitely not deliberate. It was colltareal damage or MISTAKES. It was deliberate sometimes during those events already described in the original article it was copy pasted from. Hence, redundant. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 23:36, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which is why I stated that the article should be properly sourced. No, not with sources calling the actions for massacres, but with sources verifying that the incidents did occur and that Israel was the perpetrator. Whether it were deliberate actions or not is something that never will be fully agreed upon on this site, thus, a redundant discussion. Find sources for either POV instead, and do remember that UN officials stand above Israeli newspapers. --<a href="../../../n/y/p/User%7ENyp_3d66.html" title="User:Nyp">Nyp</a> 23:42, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete and salt.</b> Appears on the face of it a combination of POV-fork and soap box.

<li><b>Strong keep (after rename)</b> The title is POV, it should be changed to IDF operations with significant civilian casualties, to avoid any hint of bias. My concern arises when the list itself, irrespective of its title, is referred to as "a POV attack page".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Unverifiable - Unless someone wants to argue that one of these incidents is a worldwide media hoax, we should accept that all of these were, in fact, <b>IDF operations with significant civilian casualties</b> - i.e. on date A, some civilians (estimates range from B to C) died at location D, and the IDF was operating in the area at the time. So change the list name to something that reflects that. Any arguments about sourcing, and whether something was a massacre or not, belong in each specific article - this should be just a navigation list, not a full article. (Btw, if someone wants to argue that "significant" is biased, we could change it to just IDF operations with civilian casualties, so even 1 is enough for a mention, but that'd result in a lot of red-linked articles like we see in the terrorist lists below. If we have to go down that road, though, fine, I'm up for it - fair's fair for everyone.)</dd>

(I'm assuming those groups took responsibility for <i>every single action</i> listed there, and that there are no "alleged" attacks in those lists.)

<dd>The neatest option I see is a split into two lists. All IDF ops can be left in the current list (after a rename to List of IDF operations with civilian casualties, I forgot "List of" before), and a new List of Jewish paramilitary operations with civilian casualties list can be created to move those non-IDF incidents into. If we could think of a good NPOV name, we could keep them together, but it's becoming more and more unwieldy, if we can't use "massacre" or "alleged massacre", and we can't say "Israeli forces", since some incidents occured before Israel was created. "List of Israeli military or Jewish-aligned paramilitary operations with civilian casualties"? is getting ridiculous. Any thoughts on the split into those two lists? Like I said before, as long as incidents on both sides of the conflict are easily accessible, I'll be happy. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 07:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you are worried that some non-massacress will be included, then delete those, that is an editorial issue irrelevant for this afd. But maybe your argument is that ALL of the Israeli forces massacress occured during that single year? If not, why is it POV to list them, and who's pov? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 19:13, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We've had another five "delete - pov" votes, but no-one's directly addressed what I asked before, so I'll try again. Is it POV because of the term "massacre" in the title? If so, rename to List of Israeli operations with civilian casualties, and replace the word "massacre" throughout the list with "incident". Is it POV because it only lists one side's attacks? If that's reason enough for deletion, then <i>every list which only list one's sides attacks</i> should also be deleted, starting with the six lists I mentioned a couple pages ago. Think about the precedent that sets for a moment. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 16:43, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
