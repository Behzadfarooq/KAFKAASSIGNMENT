<li><b>Keep or merge</b> There is no separate guideline regarding school notability with any real consensus. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is the applicable guideline for this article, which says, "One common recommendation across all notability guidelines is not to nominate articles on such subjects for deletion but to rename, refactor, or merge them into articles with broader scopes, or into the articles that discuss the main subject..." Furthermore, although schools may not be "inherently notable" by your personal defintion (if you mean "extraordinary," "celbrated," or "world-famous"), they are almost always notable per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Every public school in the U.S. is inevitably the subject of multiple, non-trivial, publications, including state reports on their demographics and performance and press reports on their development, construction, bond elections, school board elections, and controversies over curriculum, busing, closure, redistricting, and endless other issues of significant interest to their locality, regions and state. I suggest that if the result here is other than "Keep," that the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information be merged into <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fremont_Unified_School_District_6bdd.html" title="Fremont Unified School District">Fremont Unified School District</a> rather than being deleted and that this article be turned into a redirect. I suspect that a separate article will be created again, eventually a "good article," since there is plenty of documentation about all of the Fremont schools that I've looked at.--<a href="../../../h/j/a/User%7EHjal_95ba.html" title="User:Hjal">Hjal</a> 19:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I do not find any compelling assertion of notability. So far the article simply says that its a pretty good school. That's good, but it certainly isn't notable. Sorry. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 20:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> now that notability has been asserted. In cases where notability is not clearly established we should be redirecting these elementary school pages to a parent article rather than rehashing this debate five times a day. <a href="../../../%28/j/a/User%7E%28jarbarf%29.html" title="User:(jarbarf)">(jarbarf)</a> 17:28, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I'm still not impressed by its achievements compared to other elementary schools.

<li>That is poor logic, by that rationale we should delete all Emmy award winners, because hundreds or thousands of people probably have received them. <a href="../../../%28/j/a/User%7E%28jarbarf%29.html" title="User:(jarbarf)">(jarbarf)</a> 23:43, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The accomplishments of an Emmy Award winner are often seen by millions of people. There are also regional Emmy Awards, and those are less notable because the works have had less distribution. While an excellent school is certainly a good thing, it affects only its students, unless it is used as a model by others.--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 01:36, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I just wanted to share one more piece of information that I have found and added to the school's page. Gomes Elementary is tied for 5th in the state in terms of performance with a recently released API Growth score of 989. This is not the first time that Gomes has been included within the top 50 or even top 10 of all schools. I am still compiling research, and I will finalize this edit later on, but meanwhile you can check out the reference that I have provided for that fact. Hopefully this will clarify the status of this article, and consensus can be reached on its apparent and evidenced notability. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 3:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
