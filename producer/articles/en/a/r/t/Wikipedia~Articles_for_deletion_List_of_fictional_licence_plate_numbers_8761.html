<p>List serving no encyclopedic purpose. It is growing, but for the past month noone has addressed my question on the talk page about the purpose it serves.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I know it's trivia. But it's a <i>good list</i> (that's my own criterion for being an article) and it doesn't try to convince you it's anything other than kruft. And it does publish it's criteria for being on the list: it has to be a number plate from a work of fiction. That is better than some lists around here which have unverifiable criteria for inclusion.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 00:19, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It <i>is</i> fairly trivial, but I've seen worse - and it is also verifiable and it's hard to see how it could be merged anywhere where it would be as useful. It needs far more linking to other articles, though. Would make a reasonable addition to <a href="../../../u/a/_/WP%7EUA_5bfb.html" title="WP:UA">WP:UA</a>, too. To answer one or two of the comments above, I don't see how this is possibly covered by WP:NOT, and non-existent things can be <i>very</i> notable - are you planning to nominate <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicorn.html" title="Unicorn">Unicorn</a> for deletion, perhaps? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:35, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Trivial is in the eye of the beholder. Some license plate numbers, such as the license plate used for the Firebird in the Rockford Files, represent links to the actor. Other license plate numbers allude to an inside joke or other non-common knowledge. But all license plate numbers are registered with a Department of Motor Vehicles somewhere, and are linked to the individual or entity that registered the vehicle. That's historical information, the value of which can not always be established in the present. Imagine the History Detectives using this article and being able to confirm a car bought at auction was once used in film or television. Or establishing that a now famous person was at one time a grunt working for a production company and was tasked with registering such a car. There are also intangible possibilities, such as finding patterns in the registration of license plates. And as we all know, once a pattern has been found, predictions can be made.

<dd><b>Comment'</b>- any license plate info about a notable show can be included on the article about the show. The article itself is an indiscriminate collection of information. We are talking about <b>fictional</b> license plates. License plate numbers change from time to time, so it would not remain verifiable for later research or pattern finding. Also, who is to say that the license plate number on a car in a TV show is its actual, DMV number? A car on a studio lot in CA about a show in NJ will have a NJ license. But does that mean it is registered in NJ? The problesms of verifiability and OR remain <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 13:13, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment'</b>- The problem with including the license plate with a particular show is that the number of plates included could become enormous. If there is an article devoted to license plates it is a compendium of license plate data that can also be linked to a show or shows. I would further argue that "indiscriminate" is in the eye of the beholder as much as is trivial. The limited lifetime of a particular license plate number is true, but irrelevant when it comes to pattern searching. A license plate might be used on one vehicle, and that vehicle may appear in several television shows or feature films. The vehicle itself may even transfer between studios, directors or producers. I don't know that to be the case, but that is the point of pattern searching, which can only be done when there is data available. One valid research example would be in using license plate numbers to connect the use of vehicles to studio/production company spending trends in a given period. In most of the older TV shows I notice that the same vehicles are used over and over as background vehicles. To me this implies limited available vehicles or limited financial resources. I don't notice the same pattern in newer shows, at least to the same extent. If it were possible to compile the VINs of these vehicles I would argue that it should be done along with license plates. Your question regarding shows that are produced in one location but feature vehicles in a different, staged location is valid. But it also supports the existence of an article of compiled license plates. To that end, another valid research question could explore whther there exists a stock of license plates that are used on various vehicles, or whether the license plate is legally registered to a specific vehicle. I would also argue that these are not "fictional" license plates. These are real license plates that are found on real vehicles that are used in fictional productions.
