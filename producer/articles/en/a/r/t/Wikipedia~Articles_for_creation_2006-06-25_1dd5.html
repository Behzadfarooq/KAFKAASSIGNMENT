<p>Channel 101: The Musical is a series on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_101.html" title="Channel 101">Channel 101</a>.com that was picked up in prime time for 5 episodes. It was created in affiliation with the Ships of Fools production team. It stared Ships of Fools writers, directors and actors Jason Makiaris and Mike McCafferty. It had cameos from people such as Channel 101's co-creator <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Harmon_87d6.html" title="Dan Harmon">Dan Harmon</a>, and such celebrities as <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Silverman_96ec.html" title="Sarah Silverman">Sarah Silverman</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donny_Most_203d.html" title="Donny Most">Donny Most</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-25_1dd5.html" title="Edit section: Plotline">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plotline</span></h3>
<p>The plotline describes two writers lamenting over the fact that they cannot come up with a great show for Channel 101's primetime. They, in connection with fellow writers, conjure the idea of <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> robots. As they are about to turn in their new pilot, the <a href="../../../y/a/c/Yacht_Rock_a346.html" title="Yacht Rock">Yacht Rock</a> group intercepts them, and, in a West Side Story-est fasion, battle them in a musically underscored montauge. We learn that the Yacht Rock's are on the Channel 101's board for screening, and can rig the competiton so that their pilots always stay in primetime.</p>
<p>As the gay robot pilot ends unsuccessfully, one of the writers, Jason, comes up with a new idea (not described to the audience at this time.)As the two main writers, Jason and Mike, go to the mailbox to turn in their new pilot, the Yacht Rocks intercept them again and tell them that the corupt, always powerful ruler of Channel 101, Dan Harmon, wants to see them. In a musical number (I'm Dan Harmon and I Shit Gold)Dan Harmon tells Mike and Jason that he can't turn out a bad series (partly because he's on the screening board.)</p>
<p>Mike gets captured while he's in Harmon's compound, and with the help of a friend, Jason still gets the new pilot into the screening room. Meanwhile, Jason and Dawn (a redhead from the Yacht Rock group) have secret, romantic meetings (mimicking Tony and Maria from West Side Story.)</p>
<p>In a number much like Telephone Hour from <a href="../../../b/y/e/Bye_Bye_Birdie_04c3.html" title="Bye Bye Birdie">Bye Bye Birdie</a>, several people use <a href="../../../a/i/m/AIM_527c.html" title="AIM">AIM</a>, Live Journals and MySpaces to tell eachother about Jason and Dawn. Dan Harmon finds out, and uses the captured and brainwashed Mike to murder Jason, in fear that Dawn may reveal to Jason his evil plan of rigging the primetime slots.</p>
<p>In an upbeat number (Oh, It's Time) Mike runs after Jason with a harpoon. Similtaniously, as everyones out with Mike, Sarah Silverman, having been kept in a room at the Yacht Rock headquarters so she could be frequently used for cameos, escapes to warn Jason. She arives, knocks out Mike with a frying pan, and sings about being free. Mike awakes, and kills her with a harpoon.</p>
<p>As this is happening, Jason's friend who snuck in the pilot, enters the screening board meeting as a pizza man and places their pilot in the screening pile.</p>
<p>Harmon finds out, captures Dawn, and as Jason and Mike come to her rescue, they find Harmon already dying from drinking water instead of <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">vodka</a>(having been switched by a vengful board member, after having been slapped.) Harmon melts, and everything is reunited.</p>
<p>As the story concludes, we switch back into, apparently "real time", with Jason and Mike finishing their new pilot script, which is what the last three episodes were. The new show that Jason came up with in the beginning was, essentially, Channel 101 the Musical, and you can't help but feeling unsatisfied. But, it does leave you happy with a nice ending number, featuring Donny Most.</p>

<p>The Breedlove Guitar Company is a small, independently run operation started in 1990 by Steve Henderson and Larry Breedlove. The company's focus is on acoustic, acoustic-electric guitars, and mandolins. Breedlove prides itself on creating guitars that they feel meld the best charictaristics of old and new in acoustic guitars. A Breedlove acoustic can easily be recognized by the asymmetrical headstocks and very large, some might say severe, cutaways. Breedlove also offers all of it's instruments to be custom ordered from a wide variety of woods and electrical accessories. Breedlove avoids using artificial aging on any of it's woods, and never uses endangered woods. This makes some of the wood available for custom guitars extremely non-traditional. Another notable feature is that each breedlove includes a truss rod that many acoustics lack, this is a feature that some love, and others hate. Each Breedlove guitar is handmade, with the necks hand rubbed. The company prides itself on each instrument it produces.</p>
<p>Many musicians find Breedlove guitars as the so called 'middle ground' when buying. Many of it's models feature the same appointments found on high priced guitars such as Martin, Taylor, and Gibson, but at a much lower price. They are however, higher priced than many other guitars out there, and Breedlove offers no 'starter' guitars. Most musicians who play Breedlove guitars remark on how good they sound, many comparing the sound to that of the legendary Martin Dreadnoughts.</p>
<p>Some artists that play Breedlove guitars are: Sammy Hagar, Madonna, Joe Craven, Doug Hoekstra, Lynn Frances Anderson, The California Guitar Trio, Ken Emerson, Alex De grassi, Ryan Cabrera, Richard Gilewitz, and Ed Gerhard.</p>

<p>--Worksmarts 03:27, 24 June 2006 (UTC) Maria Regina High School was founded by the Archbishop of New York, the late Francis Cardinal Spellman, in 1957. It was the 1st Archdiocesan Catholic High School for young women in Westchester County. The Sisters of the Resurrection, a Polish teaching order, were selected to lead the school. It's first principle was Sister Mary Gertrude, C.R.</p>
<p>When Maria Regina opened in the fall of 1957, its first students were welcomed to classes in what had been the Bingham mansion. Bedrooms on the second floor were converted to classrooms, including a science lab in the sunroom on the east of the building. Ground was immediately broken for a new high school building. In the spring of 1959, one wing of the building was ready for use. The following fall, a formal dedication of the new building took place with three full classes of students enrolled.</p>

<p>Avotor's music has best been described akin to a post-industrial/nuclear soundtrack for a film by Cronenberg or Lynch mixed combined with giant post-scapes that at times ebbs and flows from being down right errie whilst at others brutally heavy. Neither ambient nor entirely abrasive, Avotor’s unique sound(let’s call it avobrasient) explores uncharted sonic territory with words like haunting, confrontational and atmospheric so often thrown around when describing the band. Avotor was formed in mid-1998 (in Auckland, New Zealand where they still reside) combining environmental audio influences with modern music techniques. With help from a circle of additional musicians, Avotor began touring and released their debut album entitled LOOMING (currently out of print) on the electronic based Kog Transmissions label in late 1999. They have contributed to numerous compilations, released a limited edition clear 8" vinyl single, have remixed acts such as Concord Dawn (released as a limited edition 7" white label vinyl single), have played with the likes of Makebelieve, Witch, Concord Dawn, and Jakob. Several tracks have been licensed to local New Zealand TV shows, and the track 'Freezeover' was used in the motion picture 'The Irrefutable Truth About Demons', which became the most successful New Zealand film since the acclaimed 'Once Were Warriors' until 2002. In mid 2001 Avotor released ILLOOMING, an EP that would showcase alternative versions of their early tracks from their debut album. Numerous shows were played to support the release of these recordings until BILLION was let loose in November 2003 throughout New Zealand. 2004 and 2005 saw them play shows thorughout New Zealand, Latvia, Germany, Poland, Belgium, UK, and The Netherlands, along with some new members joining the alliance and recording new tunes for their recently released new 7" Nothing But Surrender/Glacier Weapon, and the new track Let Them Try on the compilation COALESCENCE alongside Jakob and No Funeral. 2006 has already proved to be a year where they’ve played their first shows in the USA as well as the beginning of the studio sessions that will make up their soon to be third album.</p>

<p>Many blogs are mere online journals, full of mundane and boring details of mundane, boring lives. Not so with "Retro Avatar's Bits &amp; Bytes Of Random Data" (random-data.blogspot.com), it is an engaging, often humorous look at life and growing older in America.</p>
<p>This blog is a great example of homespun old school Americana which deserves the attention of readers looking for a moment's relaxation. The writer's chatty style of masterful story telling is a delight to read.</p>
<p>Here is a quote (used with permission), from the first entry at the bottom of the blog:</p>
<p>"The main thrust of this blog is to entertain. Everything here is based upon real events in my life and my opinions and thoughts on things. I make no excuse or apology for anything stated here, politically correct or not."</p>
<p>The writer is the obvious product of a checkered life and his writing has a "been there, done that" feel but with an overall positive outlook on the Baby Boomer's life journey that many will identify with at once.</p>
<p>Examples of entries include: "Snausages", "Which End Is Up", "The Great Toy Feud" and "In Dog's Years, I'd Be DEAD!".</p>

<p>--Introduction-- The H.R Nicholls Society is an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> [[right wing] <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_tank.html" title="Think tank">think tank</a> on <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_relations.html" title="Industrial relations">industrial relations</a>. It was created in March 1986 after John Stone, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Costello_4af7.html" title="Peter Costello">Peter Costello</a>, Barrie Purvis, and Ray Evans organised a seminar aimed at discussing the Hancock Report and other industrial matters<a href="http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/work.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/work.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>The Society is named after Henry Richard Nicholls, an editor of the Hobart "Mercury" who in 1911 published an editorial criticising Henry Higgins, then a High Court judge and President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, accusing Higgins of behaving in a politically partisan and unjudicial manner after attacking a barrister<a href="http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/work.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/work.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. This led to Nicholls being presecuted for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contempt_of_court.html" title="Contempt of court">contempt of court</a> by the Tasmanian Attorney-General, only to be acquitted by the full bench of the High Court<a href="http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/work.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/work.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. The whole affair was a humiliation for Higgins, who wanted Nicholls to be convicted, as the acquittal aroused national publicity and widespread celebrations in Hobart.</p>
<p>Regular Contributors to the Society's publications include Ray Evans, Adam Bisits and <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Moore_5fa7.html" title="Des Moore">Des Moore</a>, the Director of the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Private_Enterprise_6161.html" title="Institute for Private Enterprise">Institute for Private Enterprise</a>.</p>
<p>--Aims and Objectives-- The Society believes strongly in the deregulation of the Australian Industrial Relations System, including the abolition of the award system, the widespread use of individual employment contracts and the lowering of minimum wages. The Society only believes in limited labour market regulation, as excessive minimum wages <a href="http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/nicholls/nichvo13/vol132th.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/nicholls/nichvo13/vol132th.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and job security lead to higher unemployment and lower productivity. Since its inception, the Society has firmly advocated urgent reform of the labour market in order to ensure Australia's international competitiveness and prosperity.</p>
<p>--Politics-- The Society has strong ties with the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_d2c4.html" title="Liberal Party">Liberal Party</a> of Australia, as its political views are associated with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Right_36d7.html" title="New Right">New Right</a>. <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Costello_4af7.html" title="Peter Costello">Peter Costello</a>, one of the Society's founding members, is the Treasurer of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> Liberal Government and Deputy Federal Leader of the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_d2c4.html" title="Liberal Party">Liberal Party</a>.</p>
<p>The Society is however controversial because of its views, and rather disliked by the left side of Australian politics. For example, in 1986 the then Prime Minister, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hawke_e803.html" title="Bob Hawke">Bob Hawke</a> branded the Society of a group of "political troglodytes and economic lunatics"<a href="http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/aims.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/aims.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>Current Federal Finance Minister Nick Minchin aroused controversy in early 2006 in a speech at a Society function where he stated that many wihin the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_d2c4.html" title="Liberal Party">Liberal Party</a> believed in reforming the labour market to an even greater extent than <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workchoices.html" title="Workchoices">Workchoices</a>, the Government's recent and controversial industrial relations package. However resistance to labour deregulation was strong within the Australian electorate, and the Government therefore had to treat cautiously to avoid being unpopular.</p>

<p>With over 800 acres of vineyards and more than 20 varietals planted, the grapes grown in this valley enjoy warm sunny days and evenings cooled by breezes from the near-by Pacific Ocean, just 20 miles to the west. The San Antonio Valley's exceptional growing conditions result in spectacular wines, may crafted by small family operated wineries.<br />

<p>Christy Sechrist is a name most independent music labels know by heart. She has had multiple #1s on internet music charts and amassed fans world-wide. At fifteen, she recorded her debut album I'm With You. It was a short-run cover disc that sold out not too long after it's release on May 31, 2005. She has been noted as a "sure bet for the future" by Wally Plecha, an A&amp;R guy for Internation Online Music, formerly known as Scout's Digest. One fan has accounted that Christy records haunting vocals akin to those performed by Amy Lee. Though she is known throughout the net, she is your average young woman. Her psychological basis in everything makes her lyrics more profound and interesting than those of other seventeen year old songwriters. It shouldn't be too much longer until gets major record label attention.</p>

<p>Klay World is a fictional region created by claymation artist Robert Benfer, aka Knox, and is where he films his clay animations. As the name suggests, it is inhabited by clay men. While it is called Klay World, it is not really a world but a mere table in Knox's house.</p>
<p>The natives of Klay World are flattish, blob-like blue clay men with stubby legs. They typically are all identical in appearance and seemingly intelligence, but plot-crucial clay men have extras, like piercings or hats or clothing or body parts slightly different to others to distinguish them from the other clay men. The clay men are also very stupid up to the point of mental retardation, and this is referenced in many Klay World short movies. In 2004 the blue clay men were joined by green and red clay men, but now these clay men are not seen as often as the blue ones.</p>

<p><b>2003</b> Klay World was first seen on newgrounds.com in 2003, but in the earliest shorts most filming was done on the floor and not the table. Also the clay men were of many different colours aside from blue, but in the short film Hulky he switched exclusively to blue blob men like the ones he does today.</p>
<p>In 2003 the bedroom was also home to a group of clay men with a more human-like appearance, with distinguishable human heads with hair and also shirts and shoes and trousers. These realistic clay men were only used in 5 shorts and never seen again. These clay men's adventures sometimes had less dark endings than the blob clay men.</p>
<p>The climax to the 2003 series was the release of a six-part movie, Knoxs Clay World. Characters from all the previous shorts, including both the realistic and blob clay men, had to unite and fight a Xenomorph action figure. However, it does not go as planned and the ending had only 5 survivors. This movie was also the first time the region was explicitly named, but in this time it was called Clay Land.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2004</b> 2004 was Knox's breakthrough. Almost all members of Newgrounds knew about his movies now. The clay men are now only blue blobs just like the ones used today, but also was home to other unusual clay life, like Peter the Pickle and the BoogieMonster, and they have now exclusively made their home on the table. The two-part short Kolors of Klay City was the second time the region was explicitly named, but since then it is now Klay World. The movie also introduced the green and red clay men who wer used in several future shorts.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2005</b> Fewer shorts were made in 2005 than any other time, because this is the year Knox began on his first full-length DVD film, Klay World: Off The Table. In this time, the green and red clay men are now not seen any more. Also in this year the clay men seemed to have increased in stupidity and got into more realistic pursuits, such as two friends splitting up, a hot-dog stand not getting any customers and a group of clay men going bungee jumping.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2006</b> In this year, there are now fewer Klay World shorts than ever because Knox is now working on not only claymation, but also live-action stupidity and a brand-new clay movie, Villain. In this new movie there are exclusively only realistic-looking clay men who live in a city instead of a table, similar to the 2003 shorts.</p>

<p>The Campion School is a all boys Catholic Secondary School in Hornchurch, Essex, it has a sixth form that is also open to non-Catholics and Girls. It was originally built by the Jesuits because of the lack of a boys Catholic school in the area as the closest was St Ignatius, Enfield. Many families from St Ignatius, Jesuit Priest and teachers paid for the land that Campion is built on and the building of the new school.</p>
<p>The Campion School is a highly acclaimed school that achieves excellent examination results. The School excelles in Music and Sport, especially a large country wide reputaion for ruby, reaching the finals of the Daily Mail Cup in Rugby twice and winning the cup once.</p>
<p><b>The Campion School has three main aims:</b></p>
<p>1) to develop in its pupils inquiring minds through the study of a broad range of subjects and through the encouragement of self-discipline and hard work in the pursuit of excellence; 2) to encourage young people to fully develop themselves intellectually, socially, emotionally, physically and spiritually through academic study and through participation in extra curricular activities; 3) to lead young people to faith in Christ and to mature understanding of the Catholic Faith.</p>
<p><b>AN EXTRACT FROM CAMPION'S BRAG</b></p>
<p>The School motto is "Auctore Deo", which means "the Enterprise is of God", and is taken from an extract of the booklet written by Campion called "The Brag". It reminds us that all that we do is with God and for God:</p>
<p>"The expense is reckoned, the enterprise is begun; it is of God, it cannot be withstood. So the faith was planted: so it must be restored."</p>
<p>The Current Head Master is Mr John A Johnson MA.</p>
<p><b>Past Pupils</b></p>
<p>The school has had many famous past pupils inculding: Lord Alton: Liberal Member of the House of Lords, Paul McCreesh: conductor, Dr John Briffa: medical writer, Colin Lynes: IBO light welterweight world champion, Peter Hunt: bbc news correspondent,</p>
<p>and has produce many professional Rugby players inculding: Kevin Sorrell, Damian Cronin, Tony Diprose,</p>

<p>Canine Degenerative Myelopathy is an autoimmune disorder common in German Shepards and possibly occurring in other breeds. The disease is chronic and progressive, and can result in lameness in the animal. In some cases it can be fatal.</p>
<p>The myelin is an insulating sheath around neurons in the spinal column. In Degenerative Myelopathy, the immune system attacks this sheath, breaking it down. This results in a loss of communication between nerves in lower body of the animal and the brain. The animal loses both sensation and control.</p>
<p>The disease usually manifests between the ages of five and fourteen.</p>

<p>Early symptoms include scuffing of one or both rear legs. This scuffing can cause the nails of one foot to be worn down. As the disease progresses the animal starts having considerable difficulties walking, and eventually the back legs become useless.</p>
<p>The disease can then move forward, affecting the forward portion of the body, including the front legs. It can then move into the brain stem causing death. According to veteranarians at Cornell University Hospital for Animals (Companion Animal Hospital) this is quite rare.</p>
<p>Progression of the disease is highly variable. The animal could be crippled within a few months, or could still be walking years later. In order to keep the animal as healthy as possible for as long as possible, a proper diet and exercise regimen are very important.</p>

<p>Little research has been done on this disease. The fact that it mostly strikes a single breed indicates a genetic component.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-25_1dd5.html" title="Edit section: Treatment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Treatment</span></h3>
<p>Most local veteranarians believe there are no treatments. However ongoing research at the University of Florida provides hope.</p>
<p>This is a chronic condition that cannot be cured. However it is possible to maintain your dog's quality of life through a proper program of exercise and nutrition.</p>
<p>Aerobic exercise is very important. An effort should be made to ensure the dog receives aerobic exercise three times a week. The ability to run freely on a farm is not adequate - the dog should be made to exercise. If the dog suffers arthritis or hip dysplasia, swimming is useful.</p>
<p>Endurance exercise is also important. The dog should be taken on a long walk at least once a week.</p>
<p>After exercising, it is important for the muscles to have time to heal, especially in older dogs. Therefore the dog should not exercise every day.</p>
<p>The University of Florida recommends a diet primarily made on 1 part pork, 2 parts tofu, 4 parts long brown rice, with additional carrots, spinach, bell pepper, broccoli and molassis (see link below).</p>
<p>Additional ingredients, fresh garlic, dry ground ginger, dry mustard and bone meal, provide anti-inflammatory effects. Because this disease is caused by the animal's own immune system, it is important not to allow the immune system to become fired up. Keeping inflammation to a minimum is very important. (This is why it is important to let the dog rest between exercise days).</p>
<p>The University of Florida also recommends a number of dietary supplements. Most can be found in a single pill, called Antiox-Q, available from [[Westlab Pharmacy]<a href="http://www.westlabpharmacy.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.westlabpharmacy.com/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>]. In addition to the pill, green tea and grape seed extract are recommended (however, never feed a dog grapes or raisins.)</p>
<p>Finally, U of Florida has found good results with two different medications used in combination: aminocaproic acid (EACA) and n-acetylcysteine (NAC). They found that in 80% of patients these medications have prevented progressions or even caused remission. Both of these medications are also provided by [[Westlab Pharmacy]<a href="http://www.westlabpharmacy.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.westlabpharmacy.com/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>]. (I am not yet sure if a prescription is necessary).</p>

<p>R.C.M.P. was spearheaded by Canadian film maverick, Frank Radford "Budge" Crawley and co-produced with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, British Broadcasting Corporation and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p>
<p>Unapologetically cold, grainy and raw, the show was very realistic and stood up well against other crime dramas on TV of the day. French-Canadian actor Gilles Pelletier portrayed Corporal Jacques Gagnier, whose sidekick Constable Bill Mitchell was played by English-Canadian actor Don Francks.</p>
<p>Crawley created the R.C.M.P. series in an attempt to fulfill his dream of sharing "the Canadian Way" with the rest of the world. While not a fan of American-style cinema, Crawley wished R.C.M.P. to sign with a U.S. television network. American networks at that time demanded full control over any shows they broadcast and R.C.M.P. ended up with only a paltry take in American syndication.</p>
<p>The show ran for one season and a prolific 39 episodes. Despite not becoming the spectacle Crawley promised, R.C.M.P. reruns garnered fans worldwide.</p>

<p>An Order to Show Cause is a court order directing any designated party to appear in court on such date and time<i>in order to</i> prove to a court why the court should not take action against the petitioned party.</p>
<p>For example, a person who believes that their privacy has been invaded in some substantial way can petition a court through the form of an Order to Show Cause--this is actually the name of the petition--to direct another person to appear in court and demonstrate--Show Cause--why a court should not stop that other person from continuing the invasion of privacy--assuming the Court finds an invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>Also, if a criminal defendant is alleged to have violated probation, a court may issue an order requiring the defendant to appear in court to "show cause" why the probation should not be revoked. If the defendant fails to appear, the court may then issue a warrant for his arrest.</p>

<p>65.94.189.45 16:17, 24 June 2006 (UTC) Montreal 's angular “défonce” warriors the Discord of a Forgotten Sketch, are tearing genres apart one by one. Combining styles with precision and chaos, just plain madness, slit your veins noise-jazzy-hardcore with a that of grind. They are innovative, with awaken new ideas and a live act that is sure to rank them among fan favourites in years to come.</p>
<p>They have shared the stage with acts such as Hot Cross, Cobra Noir, Electric Frankenstein, The Sainte-Catherines, the Expectorated Sequence, In Dying Days, Figure four, Maximum R N R, A Perfect Murder, North of America, Between the Buried and Me, From Autumn to Ashes, Daughters… they played the Pop Montreal festival twice, and appeared on the Pop Mtl's 2004 compilation. They have played many shows in Canada , and have crossed the borders to the USA twice. With a live performance that is sure to blow you down, and pull your eyes off. New Romance for Kids holds the first EP, 5 tracks of well structured chaos, clocking to 20 min. of intense jazzy drumming, strumming technical six strings, noisy bass and screamy vocals, a must for every fan of heavy music.</p>
<p>With extensive touring, you are sure to catch the band somewhere around your area in the year to come. The road ahead looks promising, noisy and damaged.</p>

<p>Miles Javes, referred to as Miles "J" by his peers and himself when speaking in the 3rd person was born in Fort Worth, Texas on September 13, 1981. Over the past 25 years Miles has led the life of a common simpleton with uncommon ideas and schools of thought. Miles Most often places value in close friends and coupons. Some of his accomplishments include cutting the grass up a hill with a push-mower at a young age, earning a BS in Computational Chemistry from the University of Texas in Austin, and coining such well-known phrases as "dropped my hat, time for sex", "dickle"(hybrid of a dime and a nickle), "thats not my problem", and fan favorite "deal with it". Miles' hobbies include enjoying a sweet sodee, applying for jobs on-line, not getting jobs that he applied for on-line, rollerblading, traveling, playing frisbee golf, hanging out with friends, playing with his dog Riley, checking out the latest smooth tunes, plotting, conspiring, watching the Stars play hockey, and sending in mail-in rebates. Some but not all of Miles' friends include Moley, Kerissa, Shawn, Nick, Angela, Lindsey, Zac, Renae, the Dallas Kids, various inanimate objects, Joy, and Jenny. Some but not all of his enemies include some members of his family, smog, cancer, and the general ignorance and stupidity of the common masses. Miles endorses such philosophies as clean air, economical cars, alternative fuels, small business, and courtesy. He is not currently involved in any projects but in the future plans to not put too much effort in to any one particular thing and to experience an untimely death at age 27.</p>

The most striking feature of the Revuebar was the huge brightly lit sign declaring it to be the "World Centre of Erotic Entertainment".</p>
<p>The name and control of the theatre (but crucially, not the property itself) was bought by Gerald Simi in 1997. Gradually the theatre's fortunes waned, with Simi cited rising rent demands from Raymond as the cause.</p>

<p>Andre Perugia was born in Nice, France in 1893 of Italian parentage. He trained in his father's workshop and at the age of 16, in 1909, he opened a shop in Paris where he sold handmade shoes and was planning to concentrate on design and creativity. He later moved to Rue Faubourg St. Honore, where all the fashion designers had their salons.</p>
<p>After World War I, he made shoes for fashion designer Paul Poiret, and it was through his association with the world-famous couturier that his success was assured.</p>
<p>Among his clients in the 20's were stars of the Folies Bergere and movie actresses who wanted shoes that epitomized the glamour of the stage -Josephine Baker and movie siren Gloria Swanson, silent movie star Pola Negri and Mistinguette – queen of the French vaudeville, whose legendary legs were inspiring artists fantasy and creativity.</p>
<p>Always eager to experiment with new materials, shapes and textures, Perugia continued to create shoes of startling originality throughout a 50 year association with I. Miller and then with Charles Jourdan.</p>
<p>Humor and originality were distinguishing his models. He was known to talk to his shoes, so he earned a reputation as an eccentric as well as a genius. He wrote a book "From Eve to Rita Hayworth" in which he said that the way to unveil a woman's personality was to study her feet.</p>
<p>Perugia made shoes in homage to several distinguished artists. His fish pump of 1931, made of overlaid kid with decorative "scales" is a tribute to George Braque, the French cubist artist. In 1950, he made a "homage to Picasso" sandal which seems to be floating in the air.</p>
<p>He worked for many fashion designers such as Jacques FATH and GIVENCHY. In the 30's he also made some witty shoes for Elsa SCHIAPARELLI. He retired in 1970 and died in 1977, aged 84.</p>

<p>Anus Babies - A fetal born baby being brought into the world through the anus. Anus Babies are rare occurrences but can happen when certain genes in the mans semen line up perfectly with a women's Collen Egg. All women have a Collen Egg but genes have to match up perfectly for the semen to have access into the egg and fertilize it. In order to fertilize it one must have Anal Intercourse. Also known as "Buttsex", "Doggystyle", and "Stink the Meat". In order to have an anal baby the genes have to match up with either gene A to gene N or gene A to gene L. Once the egg is fertilized the fetal baby will grow in the mothers Dorsum Womb. The womb on the mothers back. This is a big cause of what we call "hunchback". Even though an Anus Baby might sound fun and enjoyable it is quite the opposite. The top age of an Anus Baby is only 15 years old and they often have ugly brown skid-marks, also known as large birthmarks, caused by the Collen scraping them as they come out. The baby also widens the Collen immensely and you will never have anal pleasure again because it is widened so much. Another cause of your Anus being widened is having feces simply fall out. Due to this mothers of anus babies often have to wear diapers or have to have surgery to narrow the anus.</p>

<p>Anus Babies - A fetal born baby being brought into the world through the anus. Anus Babies are rare occurrences but can happen when certain genes in the mans semen line up perfectly with a women's Collen Egg.

Also known as "Buttsex", "Doggystyle", and "Stink the Meat". In order to have an anal baby the genes have to match up with either gene A to gene N or gene A to gene L.

<p>Losset is an uber character in a fictional video game called "Star Wars Galaxies." Losset's name comes from a latin root "Loss" which means literally "lose" and the word "et" which means you. Due to the latin combination of letters, the subject comes last in a word, therefore losset means "YOU LOSE"</p>
<p>Domar is a greek term from the roots DOM and AR. Dom is the root meaning "domination," while AR is the greek meaning for I am. Also AR is a term for the most powerful of the greek gods, Ardomeous, the most feared by all Greeks.</p>
<p>Therefore, had one seeked to understand the meaning of Losset Domar, it simply means You lose, I am domination. The two words Losset and Domar have not been recreated into one identifying name since the ancient days of the Greek and Roman Empires. Now that they are together again, those who oppose this "Losset" will face utter destruction on an inhuman scale.</p>
