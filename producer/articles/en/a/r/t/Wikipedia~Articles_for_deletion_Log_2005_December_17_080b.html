<li><b>Keep</b> and also have <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_game.html" title="Adventure game">Adventure game</a> as a separate category. Historically, Action and Adventure are different categories. Adventure games came first, and were text-only games - they don't exist anymore (at least not commercially). Some free games exist that are text only though, like <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angband_%28game%29.html" title="Angband (game)">Angband (game)</a> - THAT is adventure. Action game has graphics. Adventure game doesn't. Not historically. They are totally different games. I realise that some genres have combined, and so forth, but the fact that many gaming sites have 1 category for Action and a completely different category for Adventure suggests that they should be separate. Whether we should keep <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action-adventure_game.html" title="Action-adventure game">Action-adventure game</a> is another matter.

<li><b>Keep</b> this, keep action-adventure as a separate article. This isn't a very good article at the moment, but they're definitely not the same genre and even though the term action game was more popular in the past, it's still used (<a href="http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/671/671724p1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/671/671724p1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b> this article. An action game is something along the lines of Gradius or Final Fight. An action-adventure is something like Zelda.

<li><b>Comment</b> - thanks everyone for pointing out to me that action-adventure is its own category. I had just thought that it was a lazy way to describe adventure type games or action type games without giving them their own categories, since nowadays there are so few action games or adventure games. By the way, is there consensus that <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roguelike.html" title="Roguelike">roguelike</a> should be a sub-category of adventure? I personally can't see how it can be considered to be action. Does it really deserve its own category? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 13:18, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.

<li><b>Delete</b> This may become a controversial nomination. Was nominated before in May 2004 with no consensus. The article has undergone substantial changes but remains poorly sourced. I nominate on the grounds that this subject is ill suited to list format. Its focus inherently excludes most beneficial aspects of United States foreign policy. From the contentious talk page: <i>"Wise.. you're so naif, yes all US interventions have only one goal: US own wealth... and that's not only true since 1945... that's quite older (at least Gen. Butler sayd that).. you said: "But the United States introduced the world to free elections and democratic constitutions."... please read about the world, FoxNews and CNN are not telling you the truth... US never cares about if ther is or not free elections and constitutions."</i> I encourage other editors to scan the talk page as well as the article to set this in context. This article is definitionally skewed to exclude counterexamples to that opinion. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter's</a> Nobel Prize winning efforts in support of human rights and free elections cannot fit into this list, nor can the many instances of political asylum granted to students from <a href="../../../t/i/e/Tienanmen_Square_4382.html" title="Tienanmen Square">Tienanmen Square</a> and other freedom movements. I don't mean to whitewash United States history. Both sides deserve attention. Only a narrative format can treat the subject fairly. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 00:15, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I thought the common definition of "intervention" meant military or espionage action. If that's too narrow then how broad shall we go? If former United States President Jimmy Carter oversees a free election as a private citizen, is that a foreign intervention? When private universities in the United States divest their holdings in a country's industries for ethical reasons, is that foreign intervention? Is humanitarian foreign aid intervention? Do we count private donations as well as governmental ones? When members of the United States military on foreign deployment perform community service work overseas, is that foreign intervention? If so, do we confine this to major disasters like the East Asian tsunami or include smaller command sponsored projects? How about when a United States Navy ship on routine patrol saves the lives of a hundred Ecuadorians? When the United States grants asylum to one African woman who would otherwise be subject to clitoridectomy, is that a foreign intervention? Does it become foreign intervention when the number of refugees is greater? If so, what's the magic number? <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 05:04, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The U.S. is the most hated country in the world because everyone has a different reason to hate them. If they do not interfere they are criticised for doing nothing. If they step in then they are criticised for stepping in. Like it or not the U.S. will never be able to please the world and that is not likely to change, but that is hardly a reason to keep a redundant list. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> 06:34, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My understanding for why US is the most hated country in the world is because it is the most powerful country in the world. At any time in history the most powerful country was also the most hated (except in times when there were 2 or 3 of roughly equal power, in which case they shared the hatred). I believe that that is the main reason. Romans were hated during their empire, Russians during theirs (which they shared with USA), Egyptians (just have a look at the bible!), British, French, you name it. However, the *reasons* differ. Egyptians were hated for their slave trade, Romans for their orgies, Portugese for their piracy, British for their religious conversion, and so forth. But let's not forget that USA really are the most hated country in the world. No other country engenders such hatred. Are they also the most loved? I don't know. We could perhaps do a poll on that one. Might be. But its not just Arabs that hate USA. Something in the order of 90% of the world hates Americans. Just that Arabs hate them a lot worse than say Canadians. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 14:34, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Indifferent keep</b>. Given the votes so far, this will obviously be kept, either by actual consensus or at least by lack of consensus. And the list seems reasonable enough in annotated with some care. Mostly I just want to chime in in Zordrac's defense on his above vote (I've had some disagreements with him utterly unrelated to this, so take it as a gesture of good will): his argument about US being hated as most powerful country seems perfectly reasonable, and not dissimulative at all. I'm not sure that I actually agree with his position, but there's no reason to suppose he's setting up any kind of straw man, or anything else insincere. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 03:05, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Appears to be primarily nonsense. While the two external links do indeed go to things written by someone of this name, most of the rest appears to be false. I can't find any proof that Iqaluit State University exists, that Provis wrote a paper called Latin Americans in Canada: A Chance to Develop the North (supposedly about Mexicans living in the far north of Canada), that it was later the basis for a government study, that there's a company called Provis and Sons Drilling Ltd, and so forth.

<li><b>Keep</b>.I was just told about this from a friend who works with Pam through the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. I am not sure why this would be deleted. Besides two factual errors such as the Iqualuit State, should be Iqualuit City University. Besides that the only other error is that Provis and Sons Drilling Ltd was sold a few years back to Petro Canada. Ms. Provis’ work have been extremely important and influentional inside the department as well as in the Northern Development academic community.Powerinputreset 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I can't find a single mention of "Iqualuit City University", either — or indeed, any organisation which has both "Iqualuit" and "University" in its name. And even if "Provis and Sons" was sold "a few years back", there should still be mention of it somewhere. It certainly isn't mentioned in Petro Canada's <a href="http://www.petro-canada.ca/eng/media/10303.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.petro-canada.ca/eng/media/10303.htm" rel="nofollow">historical overview</a>, which mentions all manner of other aquisitions. And you'd think that someone who had been "extremely important and influentional" in an academic field would be referenced <i>somewhere</i> on the internet in relation to that field, but she isn't. Given that both Keep votes here have been made by new users with no contributions anywhere else, I'd consider it probable that they're both the hoaxer in disguise. (And anyway - even if all this content is all true, it hasn't meet the criteria of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, so should be removed unless reputable sources can be found.) -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 23:40, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>From what I understand, Iqualuit City University is not a separate institution. It is subunit of Nunavut Arctic College in which is in its first year of operation and is able to grant degrees through Brandon University. On the issue of the Petro Canada sale, Ill be honest I don’t know much about her husbands business, I just knows Pam Provis. Pam is in fact going to be presenting a paper at this years Aboriginal Policy Research Conference in which she is the keynote presenter. She has published multiple articles in the Journal of Indigenous Development and the International Migrant Development Journal.Powerinputreset 17 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Odd, then, that the <a href="http://www.nac.nu.ca" class="external text" title="http://www.nac.nu.ca" rel="nofollow">Nunavut Arctic College's website</a> doesn't mention it. The Brandon University website doesn't mention any connection, either. (Someone has since changed the article to refer to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_the_Arctic_34a4.html" title="University of the Arctic">University of the Arctic</a>, an institution in <i>Finland</i> — but <i>their</i> website doesn't mention Inqalit either). As for the journals — I can't find any evidence that either of them exist. (There's one reference to something called the <i>World</i> Journal of Indigenous Development, which was planned to be launched in Australia at the beginning of this year, but no subsequent mention of it.) Nor can I find anything connecting this "keynote speaker" to the Aboriginal Policy Research Conference, either at the next conference (not "this year", but in 2006) or the last conference (2002). (And this is still ignoring all the other problems, such as any mention of her supposed "bestseller" about Latin Americans in the Arctic.) -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 01:35, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a clear hoax. Besides the above criticisms, the article claims Ms.Provis is an academic at 2 universities and an "important theorist regarding bicameralism in the subnational Canadian context". Then the article points you to a BBC article which Ms.Provis submitted a comment for, in which she states that she is "studying development policy in university".

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am an inclusionist. To me it doesn't mean that we never delete <i>anything</i>. It means that we tend to keep more things than people described as deletionists.

<li>Well, saying "keep this because it fails to meet my standards" is a little odd.

<p>Please don't delete this article although the Fight Movies aren't big Hollywood films they do have a audience among indepedent film makers. Deleting this article will be like sending a message to all non-Hollywood film makers that just because the films weren't multimillion dollars hits they don't exist. I believe that all films regardless of how much money they make should be recognized.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> all. I'm probably one of the more inclusionist voters when it comes to actors, but the line has to be drawn somewhere. Let's face it, anyone who appears on TV at age 2 or younger is basically more of a prop than an "actor" per se anyway.

<li><b>Following up</b> It's too late at night for me to dig into this properly. Here's the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.05/zippies.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.05/zippies.html" rel="nofollow">Wired.com</a> article citing Fraser Clark and his use of the term. Apparently his use goes back to 1987.

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. I had heard of the hippies in the 60's.

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. Definitely a real term that was a buzzword in the British media for 15 minutes or so in the early 90s. IIRC, Fraser Clark also established the Megatripolis club night which was like a festival in a nightclub, and which was documented on a 3 CD set. Part of the new age/techno hippy movement of that time. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 14:51, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep title, obliterate content</b>. The text is complete nonsense, but the term is real, Thomas "Tin-earred Neologism Machine" Friedman notwithstanding: I remember the embarassing <i>Wired</i> magazine cover and their attempt at surfing the zeitgeist.

<li>This isn't a joke. The <i>New York Times</i> did a story on this Tennessee teenager who was forced by his parents to attend a camp to cure his homosexuality. For this reason, it shouldn't be speedied. However, there are concerns about privacy given that it identifies the guy's personal journal and would obviously allow him to be identified.

<li>Hopefully this page won't be deleted, I'm planning on adding more sections and filling them out, I wanted a place to chronicle the past of the suite. There is alot of information I was planning on adding, I'm new to Wikipedia and hadn't thouroughly read the policies but I can see how it could possibly qualify for deletion under the vanity rule. I didn't think of it at the names atime I started writing it because I wasn't doing it for myself, I've been asked by a lot of people to put a page for 709 so that there would be an easily accesible collection of all the information in one place. Please tell me if it will be deleted or not, I don't really want to write anymore if it is going to be deleted. -- Teknofreak642</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> For what it's worth, the suite (and members of it) have completely changed the physical appearance of the living area in question, influenced university policy from alcohol regulations to standards of behavior, and had a constant and resounding influence in all aspects of the dorm over the course of the last five years. Certainly they deserve as much of a right to existence as, say, Wikipedia's fraternity entries. Regarding the university's social life/community activities, you'd be hard pressed to find any group on campus with a more illustrious history. -PaxilFoley

<li>I noticed that one of the reasons for vanity entries not being allowed is that besides the first person, they are rarely contributed to by others. I decided that I would try and undertake the mission of documenting the 709 history, but I don't even come close to knowing everything about the suite and its history, I can gaurantee that if the 709 entree remains, numerous people will contribute to the entree. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeknofreak642_2a84.html" title="User:Teknofreak642">Teknofreak642</a> 12:00, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In order to comply with the guidlines about no orginal research, I am currently working on getting copies of the daily Collegian which has done a profile of how 709 has changed the Sylvan living area, also in the daily collegian is a comic strip about 709 which I am also working on getting to post on the entree.

<li><b>Keep.</b> This entry should absolutely not be deleted. Even though 709 is just one suite inside a building, the suite also represents the heart and soul of the building and the area. Everyone who lives or has lived in sylvan over the last 3 years knows 709. It is the one place you can go to take the edge off an otherwise meagre college existence. I give props to all those with the foresight to create something out of nothing and the fact that what they started has continued to a second generation is testament to their genius.

In June, they joined the Nokia Core Tour." I believe that the article is qualified based on these terms and if they can be proven.

<li><b>delete</b> or <b>rename</b> I may have seen the term used before in reference to future speculative events. But, I have just done a quick search and found a different description (of nanospheres as they are now rather than the far future)&gt;&gt; "Polymeric nanospheres can be simply defined as latex particles in nanoscale that are synthesized by polymerization or emulsification process. They have very uniform diameters in the range of 1 to 100 nm and extensive surface areas due to the small particle size in spite of their non-porosity. Although the technique to synthesis nanosphere has not long developing history, many works have been achieved in various fields." source: <a href="http://www.nanotech.or.kr/eng/lab2_01.php" class="external text" title="http://www.nanotech.or.kr/eng/lab2_01.php" rel="nofollow">What is a nanosphere?</a> - <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_rspct_e7d2.html" title="User:Max rspct">max rspct</a> <font size="1"><a href="../../../m/a/x/User_talk%7EMax_rspct_c799.html" title="User talk:Max rspct">leave a message</a></font> 15:35, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article shouldn't be deleted, because its relation to Whirlpool and the incidents that resulted in the creation of the site are very noteworthy. However in it's current form this article is horrible. The current article just looks like an add for the site. But a page about the whole fight between the whirlpool mods and travey leading to the creation of this website would be very notable -(unknownsoldier)--138.217.42.127 04:41, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do Not Delete - Saying Nobody cares who argued with who, IS an ignorant comment to make, especially when it may come from someone who is not even a member of Whirlpool Australian Broadband Discussion forums or even Coffee Lounge forums. Whirlpool used to include a coffee lounge and the Coffee Lounge Forums website is a spawn from many members of Whirlpool. The website eventually gained the permission from Simon Wright and the point of the entry is that this site became news when it was on the verge of being sued for copyright infringement. It was only through public discussion that the Coffee Lounge Forums website remains and it also remains a part of the extended Whirlpool Community.- AusLeo (Whirlpool Member)</p>
<p>Do Not Delete - Wikipedia is a world thing, not just an american website, therefore it should have entries about websites based in other countries allowed on it without people who have no idea about the website or history of it saying it shouldnt be on here because no one cares. Whirlpool who is the main webforum which Coffee Lounge Forums is a off topic part of it is the main website Australians use to find the best internet service for them. Whirlpool is also in the Australian media a lot as well. And I think for someone to say "nobody cares" who doesnt even know either website or what they are about is a little obnoxious dont you think? Ok sure the entry needs to be written in a more constructive manner and also with correct grammar and spelling and so on, but has no one ever heard the saying work in progress?-(toiletduck)-</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think that it has a lot of potential as a list. I think that it's a huge topic with many different aspects to explore. Right now, the <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">vaccine controversy</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_in_autism.html" title="Controversies in autism">controversies in autism</a> links offload the discussion from the primary pages and allow them to remain readable. I think that there could easily be homeopathic medicine controversy, chiropractic controversy, etc. This list could include links to the individual articles. Otherwise, I think that an ideal article which adequately addresses the many controversies in medicine would be many, many pages long. Basically, if we do it right it will have to be a list to accomodate the many necessary discussions. We might as well plan from the beginning! <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 21:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment<sup>2</sup></b>: I don't think homeopathy and chiropractic need their own controversy pages, because they are dangerous by nature (that needs to be in the main article). The article was started by Whaleto whose separate website promotes <i><b>very dangerous</b></i> pseudoscience/quackery, so this article will reflect that website. After reading JFW's comment above, I now know what a medical controversy is, as opposed to a sociomedical controversy; this article will definitely not talk about real controversies. --<a href="../../../c/d/n/User%7ECDN99_e864.html" title="User:CDN99">CDN99</a> 12:58, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: as per JFW, these are not the controversies within medicine, but the sociopolitical/media speculation/ignorance/rejection of <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence-based_medicine.html" title="Evidence-based medicine">EBM</a> and the scientific process. If a drug on more detailed analysis proves to have a hitherto unrecognised side effect, its not a 'controversy' but scientific development. If people would value a page on 'Cultural Controversies re Health' (aka misbeliefs/scaremongering/quackery) then good - probably quite an interesting sociological topic.
<ul>
<li>P.S. In the article 'Several high-profile cases have called into question the efficiency of the current evidence-based approach to deciding the value of medical practices' - is untrue, the issue is not the 'current evidence-based approach' (vs what, andecdotes or guess-work&#160;?) but rather whether it is accurately performed without bias (unintension or intensional): re issue of recent events &amp; COX-II, the suggestion was that some evidence may not have been disclosed, resulting in a failure to apply an 'evidence-based approach'.</li>
<li>P.P.S. further investigation is hinting that the COX-II in question may not have any greater risk that other COX-II or even the older group of <a href="../../../n/s/a/NSAIDs_d3bf.html" title="NSAIDs">NSAIDs</a> (they might all have some small risks, but what else is one to give people in chronic immobilising pain?).

<li><b>Delete.</b> There is no content developed enough to keep. It's like a list of 5 medical topics about which someone has criticized a doctor or doctors or a drug company or a medical system or... You could retitle it "random grumbling from a hospital waiting room." The problem is that not a single topic is developed into anything interesting and they have virtually nothing else in common. If the author actually put some work into developing any one of the topics as a separate article it would probably be worth keeping, but right now it is like a handfull of random gripes by someone who doesn't know very much about them, hasn't thought them through, and hasn't taken the trouble to understand both sides of any one of them. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 08:00, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Completely non-notable teacher. The article contains two apparent claims of notability: a claim that he won the Order of Canada, which appears to be a hoax, because I can't find a source for it, and a note that he is a member of the OFSAA hall of fame. While this appears to be true, a glance at the <a href="http://www.ofsaa.on.ca/wor/" class="external text" title="http://www.ofsaa.on.ca/wor/" rel="nofollow">list of members</a> comes up with a few hundred names; hardly an elite club.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use. This is the baseline consensus that I feel was reached at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>.

<li><b>Merge</b> as per Bobet. Excellent magazine.</li>
<li>Transfer. For those who don't know Vantage, it's hard to understand exactly why it's important for this to be independent. Putting it on the school's wikipedia entry means that the student magazine (independent -- and sometimes critical -- of administrators) is significantly undermined in the sense of truly representing the student viewpoint. Why it is being reviewed for vandalism I don't know. However, it would make sense to transfer the page to something like "Vantage Student Magazine" or "CSUS Vantage Magazine" because of the other Vantage's noted prior. In response to Bjelleklang, this magazine truly is quite notable. We have interviewed major corporate and technology figures (Macromedia Chairman, Apple's Executive Vice President for Design, etc.), and are planning to interview a major political figure. It is a 28 page glossy publication, with a supplementing website, etc. And we are working to supplement the page (it was actually written by a student, not the Editorial Board). Thus, it is worthy of its own page. Taylor F, Editor-in-Chief.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not so sure I agree. Interviewing some major figures does not automatically make you notable, and should IMO not be reason for inclusion. The magazine could be included on the entry of the school, which states that it is independent of the school administration, and that it has no limitations in regard of criticism towards the administration. I don't think that the magazine is notable enough to pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and it has no <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.vantage-magazine.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.vantage-magazine.com/" rel="nofollow">Alexa ratings</a>, so my opinion is that it is not notable enough to have it's own article. Coulde be mentioned on a disambiguation page of course, but should be included in the article about <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Springs_Uplands_School_8422.html" title="Crystal Springs Uplands School">Crystal Springs Uplands School</a> <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 01:27, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>DELETE</b> - so let me get this straight. They set up a fantasy football league, with a whopping great 10 teams, and then think its Wikipedia worthy? Well, listen, I've been running a football tipping competition since 1991 and we've had up to 40 people involved. We even put money in and you can win quite a lot if you win (note: this is legal where I live, so don't worry about that), and the way that we do it is unique as our scoring system is different and profound etc etc. Wait on, think I should make a Wikipedia article about that?

But given that a surname is a bit hard to track down using Google, I'd say its got enough to be worth an article.

If you replace India with Andhra (as it is a surname from Andhra as claimed in the article) <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Andem%22+%22name%22+andhra&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Andem%22+%22name%22+andhra&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, you get 20 hits of which hardly 5 have the surname. (btw, I did it for my surname for the same string and got 251 hits. My actual name alone within quotes gives 20 hits of which 18 are about me.) In a state that has 60 million people, "Andem" is but a spurious surname. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 17:17, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Surely Vikram Reddy Andem is notable, but Andem as a surname is not. William Andem is not even from India, so that Andem is different. btw, from the gogle search, it looks like ANDEM is a popular acronym. So, this article with this content should go and probly some other article on this name can come. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 05:58, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Retain</b>, subject is notworthy, jameskpolka (added on his behalf by StrangerInParadise, see below)</li>
<li><b>Retain</b>, Subject is a well known figure among a growing demographic of drug policy reformers across the globe. His contributions both on the political front and within the reform movement are certainly noteworthy today and will be even more so a hundred years from now. Considering the current criminalization of drugs has just reached its 91st anniversary, it's clearly an issue that has long term interest and consequences for the public and researchers in the future will find the biographical information on this candidate of great value.

<p><b>Arguments for retaining article Tim Meehan from StrangerInParadise</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events</b>
<ul>
<li>TM is a well-known figure within an emerging area of political endevor, specifically pro-cannabis Canadian politics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more</b>
<ul>
<li>Repeatedly published and mentioned in various Canadian newspapers</li>

</li>
<li><b>Verifiability -- Can all information in the article be independently verified now? (some say) 10 years from now?</b>
<ul>
<li>Yes on both counts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Expandability -- Will the article ever be more than a stub? Could the perfect article be written on this subject?</b>
<ul>
<li>Tim is still active in Canadian pro-cannabis activism, an area where developments are on-going.</li>
<li>Once prohibition of cannabis is repealed, who knows?</li>

<li><b>100 year test -- In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful?</b>
<ul>
<li>Anyone interested in the early history of the pro-cannabis movement in Canada, which presently is itself in a key point of struggle due to its proximity and historic ties with the United States, the principal driver in the global war on cannabis.

<li><b>Autobiography -- Has this been written by the subject or someone closely involved with the subject?</b>

<p>TM and his political and social work fundamentally pass the Hundred-Year test. While the last several Canadian federal governments have equivocated over both the decriminalization of marijuana for recreational use and the federal commitment to making marijuana legal and available for medical use, the direction of Canadian history and the will of the Canadian people are clear and obvious. The controversy here over including/deleting a TM article rests on TM's being five to ten years ahead of when the rest of the Canadian body politic will reach his same conclusions. But they will. The Wikipedia community would do well to recognize a political prophet and visionary now, thus educating the public now about a figure whose ideas will be mainstream ten years from now.</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> As Director of communications National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in Canada he <i>might</i> be notable. Eighteen of the top twenty items on the writings link merely reproduce his letters to the editor. The other two are short Canadian news stories that mention him in passing. The people who created this page should be improving it, not spamming the discussion with bids to keep. Link directly to his most important appearances in respected newspapers, leave out his letters, and list his achievements with your organization. Then maybe we can tell if he's notable.

<ul>
<li>Consensus doesn't require a vote; if the discussion dies prematurely, then in the lack of a clearly defined policy statement the results that have actually been applied here in practice stand as the consensus. And that consensus has consistently favoured the merged listpage solution — nobody, to date, has challenged that. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:42, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>In the past two months that this article has been live, no one has felt the need to expand to it at all. I am a student in Delaware and, imo, it is not noteworthy for Wikipedia (especially because there is no content). Perhaps someone would like to provide content for the article, but until that time I recommend that an admin <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../r/6/m/User%7ER6MaY89_7c88.html" title="User:R6MaY89">R6MaY89</a> 19:52, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a historic school, in fact the oldest school in Delaware established in 1748. <a href="http://www.state.de.us/sos/dpa/markers/ncc/WILMINGTON%20FRIENDS%20SCHOOL%20NC-107.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.de.us/sos/dpa/markers/ncc/WILMINGTON%20FRIENDS%20SCHOOL%20NC-107.shtml" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> very historic and unique school. Normally (at least lately due to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>) I would say merge something this short. But this a very unique institution which warrants its own article, and substantial expansion of the article. I'm thinking a couple centuries of history will provide ample material for expansion. According to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Deletion policy</a> nominations should not be used to deal with articles needing expansion. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 22:43, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that if someone is willing to make it into an informative article, it deserves to stay. But as long as it only contains 2 lines of content (year of origination and link to official site) it should not have an encyclopedia entry. If it is in fact the oldest school in Delaware, the article should mention it! As it is, there is no content. BTW, yes, I am the one who started the AfD.--<a href="../../../r/6/m/User%7ER6MaY89_7c88.html" title="User:R6MaY89">R6MaY89</a> 00:29, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand your point of view. I myself have suggested that we should make it policy to remove one/two-line sub-stubs (until they're properly written). However, current <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> makes clear, that "<i>A stub (but with potential)</i>" and "<i>Article needs a lot of improvement</i>" are not valid reason for nominating an article for deletion, and instead it is to be tagged for improvement. The policy may need to be changed, but an AFD is not the place to change policy. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:58, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The irony is that because <a href="../../../c/l/e/WP%7ECleanup_05ee.html" title="WP:Cleanup">WP:Cleanup</a> is so hopelessly backlogged, the best way to get attention to a borderline article that needs dramatic improvement... is to list it on Articles for deletion. Now the article gets dozens if not hundreds of eyeballs on a highly trafficked part of Wikipedia. Stick a cleanup tag on it and... it'll sit there, waiting. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 07:48, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree, this is really a problem. In my dream world we would take substubs and move them out of article space promptly. Maybe they could go to the new <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_dc78.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation">Wikipedia:Articles for creation</a>, so people could still see it, and make an real article out of it if they wish. The problem with using AFDs is we're writing many times more text in the AFD, then the article has. It's an absurdly ineffecient system (so many people, writing so much, about how to deal with so little). But, letting things sit in clean-up categories (as you said) isn't working either. A third way is needed, but I don't see much support for it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 08:41, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and further expand. I have added more about the history of the school and more could be added. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:44, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.

Voirin is a research assistant at a college. Although he assists someone who may be notable in her own right, I can't say that Voirin meets any Wikipedia notability standard.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> A notable topic. This is not a vanity page. I know the person behind this article-- I don't even even think that this person has ever met Mr. Voirin. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPincus_3972.html" title="User:Pincus">Pincus</a> 03:45, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Notability is in the eye of the beholder. Perhaps he is not notable to the users advocating deletion, but within environmentalist circles and here in southwest Florida, Voirin is notable. The criterion for inclusion of articles on wikipedia is verifiability, not necessarily notability, which is just way too subjective. The material is entirely verifiable and notable to enough people, so there is no reason to delete the article. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJMaxwell_e603.html" title="User:JMaxwell">JMaxwell</a> 06:31, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Yes, notability on Wikipedia is a de facto standard, not a de jure one. But there are precedents that can provide guidance. Because of the vote and explanation above, I did another search on Voirin to find out if I was missing anything significant, and especially to find documentation on the claimed notability "in environmentalist circles and...in southwest Florida."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the latter, the only reference I could find outside of New College of Florida articles/blurbs/advertising and Wikipedia mirrors is a <i>Sarasota Herald-Tribune</i> article [<a href="http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051122/COLUMNIST39/511220492/-1/COMMUNITY" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051122/COLUMNIST39/511220492/-1/COMMUNITY" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>] about college fundraisers. Voirin is mentioned in the "Young volunteers" section regarding an auction gift he gave. Are there any independent media references of significance? This would help his case for inclusion tremendously.</p>
<p>Regarding the former, he may indeed be noted to some extent in environmentalist circles, but there are hundreds of thousands, if not a million or more, people in south Florida alone who are as notable or more notable for what they do, or have done, in their respective circles. These people may be accountants, artists, executives, technologists, or practically anything else. These are the many people who simply do a job in a particular industry and do it well enough to be notable to some reasonable extent among a dozen, a hundred, or a thousand of their peers. Many, many people in the working world, and some students, are in this category. There are tens of millions of them in the U.S., an order of magnitude or two more in the world. Very few have articles on Wikipedia; very few, if any, should. If Voirin can be shown to have done anything more significant than the many millions discussed here, he might have a case for inclusion.

<dd>Verifiable in the Wikipedia sense that every claim made can be substantiated from trusted neutral secondary sources? Plus, my personal benchmar is "does this person get more relevant Google hits than I do?" Answer: no. I get just short of 5,000 and nearly 35,000 in the Usenet archive.

<p>i dont see why the page should be deleted. its pretty interesting. i am from louisiana and i have heard of the Ghetto Graduate camp, and they are on their way to the top. it would be foolish to delete their page. if someone deleted my page and wanted to make one AFTER all the fame, i wouldnt want them to have it because that is not true support.-Big B</p>

<p>This article is of a corporation that is not notable. Only primary sources (FTC pages, Better Business Bureau, and the company's website itself) have been used as sources to construct this article. Nothing of consequence ever seems to have been written about this company by third parties. This constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Further, the primary editors of this article seem to be the principals, and various people upset at the fact that the principals have edited the article. This article was put up for deletion in 2005, with no consensus <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1.800.Vending_2005_Archive_ad25.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/1.800.Vending/2005 Archive">here</a>.
