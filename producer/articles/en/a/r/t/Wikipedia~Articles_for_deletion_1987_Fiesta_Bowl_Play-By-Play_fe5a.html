<li><b>Keep</b> (and wikify) or <b>Merge/Redirect</b> WP:NOT paper, and this is not indiscriminate: The play-by-play of an important CFB game is not random, it's very selective. My only concern with merging is it might make the 1987 Fiesta Bowl article too long. Further, this type of information, if sourced, is valuable as it could contain links of players involved. If cleaned up and put into a template system (to be developed, but on my/WP:CFB to-do list (not official)) it could be well presented and organized and perhaps merged onto the 1987 Fiesta Bowl article. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 13:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (Cleanup and wikify) per WP:NOT paper. This is not indiscriminate information. It is detailed information that is part of a bigger picture. <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_Fiesta_Bowl_2d54.html" title="1987 Fiesta Bowl">1987 Fiesta Bowl</a> is written in summary style and refers to this article for more detailed information. If properly re-written, all the terminology can be explained/linked to appropriate articles as necessar and the player names can be wikilinked to their articles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 14:13, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response to the keep voters.</b> I don't think there's a single other football article with play by play like this. If we keep this, we may as well create play by play for every Super Bowl and every other championship game that's ever been played. A summary of major events (mostly, the scoring) is entirely appropriate. A play by play with excruciating detail should be left off Wikipedia, and linked as an external link if one is available. I emphasize again, ask yourself, do you want every single football article to look like this? I don't. (YechielMan) 129.98.212.72 02:06, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>(I request YechielMan sign his/her post while logged in please.) Yes, I do think every game worthy of an article should have play by play as a part (or sub-part, listed on another page) of that article. For completeness of the subject (See <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a> requirements, <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_criteria_6d12.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article criteria">Wikipedia:Featured article criteria</a>, specifically 1b) and as well as being a resource and complete encyclopedia. I do agree this needs cleanup, and this could be the precedent of whether the information should be on the main page or a "sub" page like this is acceptable. I think this AFD came before the system (ie, a template system and rules on how it should be done) is ready to handle the article in a proper manner. The information can be referenced and is valid information that contributes to the subject. I would content that a game that doesn't have a play by play couldn't even be considered a <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">good article</a>, but that may be extreme, since <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Down_2737.html" title="Fifth Down">Fifth Down</a> made it without it, but it likely couldn't make it to A or FA without it. The drive play-by-play that leads up to the fifth down would be critical for exhaustive completeness. The entire play by play would be important for a reader to get the flow of the game and understand how the scoring and position put the team in the situations they had. Is there a game article that's a FA? As far as I know, Fifth Down is the first (CFB) game article to make at least GA. I'm not aware of NFL games really though. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 03:36, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response to (YechielMan) 129.98.212.72</b> - the answer is "Yes". In an ideal world, any game which we cover with its own article would be written in summary style and would include links to other articles with a high level of detail. That could include pages like this play-by-play summary, rosters, photo-galleries on commons, etc. There is no harm to this level of detail. It is completely within policy. What needs to happen is it needs to be wikified and cleaned-up. If the article survives AfD, I will volunteer to clean it up. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 05:47, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
