<li><b>Keep</b> Not only are those lyrics copied all over the place, I'm pretty sure Bobby would only feel complimented by seeing the lyrics posted here; Let's point him to this page! Also, any fool with decent ears can quote them after hearing them, what is the harm in writing them (or part of them) down for once? I really don't see what the fuss is about. It is exactly by posting them here how you would make them 'belong' to those who wrote them. <a href="http://jult.net/txt/extern/westendgirls.htm" class="external text" title="http://jult.net/txt/extern/westendgirls.htm" rel="nofollow">West End Girls</a> &lt;- there, was that so hard?&#160;;-) JuliusThyssen 12:50, 20 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If a) Mr. Orlando is the sole owner of the copyright to the lyrics and b) can verifiably express his permission to post the lyrics on a Wikimedia project, then the lyrics <i>might</i> be appropriate for Wikisource (but not Wikipedia). Incidentally, not "any fool" can discern all of the lyrics in <i>West End Girls</i>. It wasn't until I read the article that I found out that what comes after <i>In a West End town</i> is <i>a dead end world</i> and not something completely different. And my ears are fine, thank you. <tt>:-)</tt><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 20:19, May 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So why again is the West End Girls page taken offline? Again, if I can post these lyrics the way I just did, anyone can, and Wikisource can too. I won't be sued for it. Wanna bet on it? By the way, I <i>did</i> hear what they were saying there in that track (seems my ears are better than yours then). The text <a href="http://jult.net/txt/extern/westendgirls.htm" class="external text" title="http://jult.net/txt/extern/westendgirls.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> is not the same as that of the page on wikipedia.195.64.95.116
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Wikipedia:Copyright</a> explains it all. "We won't get sued" is a terribly naïve attitude. Websites that have posted lyrics in the past have faced litigation; there's no reason to take the chance that Wikipedia <i>won't</i>. You won't be sued because <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=jult.net" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=jult.net" rel="nofollow">no one will notice</a>.

<ul>
<li>I don't think Alexa understands the internet very well. First of all, post a link to my page on West End Girls/Temp and you're done. Mine will still be considered "unnoticed", the viewer will notice, but Alexa won't, everybody happy. I have a great deal of respect for Orlando, and he knows that he should have thought of keeping his writing for and to himself before he made sure it would be yelled in my ears. If I hear something, I will post it on my site if I damn well please. They (Pet Shop Boys) should have kept their mouths shut if they didn't want that to happen. I still don't see what this has to do with copyrights, since I'm not copying anything, I'm reporting what I heard in free air. JuliusThyssen 10:50, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>My vote stands</s>. I must say that if anyone brought litigation against wikimedia, it would most likely not be over lyrics, and that they had better be suing all the other lyrics sites too, or we'll countersue.

<li>Well, if you want to vote for something that's contrary to well-established policy and that can't happen, that's your prerogative.

<li>There's nothing that says it can't happen under fair use.

<li>Comment: Wikisource is for original material, so this wouldn't be quite right there. I'm not as opposed to the idea of a lyrics wiki, but I'm not a lawyer, I don't know what the legality is; it seems like it would be a copyright violation at the end of the day- just because other sites are doing it doesn't mean it's legal. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a><a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 15:36, May 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Let me explain: We can use lyrics under fair use, provided that they're there for educational purposes only. This is how the other lyrics sites get away with it.

<li><a href="../../../i/a/n/IANAL_268a.html" title="IANAL">IANAL</a>, so I'm no expert either, but I think you have a rather strange interpretation of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair use</a>. By what I've read, pasting the <i>entire contents</i> of lyrics to songs by the thousands (as I assume you're advocating here) into articles wouldn't qualify as fair use, even if you use the "It's educational!" defense.

<li><b>Delete</b> as copyvio, but without prejudice as to whether a legitimate article about the song may be recreated. Though I have been unable to find any case law directly on point, I don't buy the fair use argument because the copying is too substantial and the argument for academic use too tenuous. At best it's right on the outer edge of fair use, and we should err on the side of caution because we really don't gain very much from being a lyrics depository. Re: "everyone else is doing it," that's hardly the best argument, particularly if you really look at the notices of some of these lyrics websites, they seem to be trying to shield themselves from contributory infringement claims by characterizing themselves as a mere venue for users to post lyrics without their intervention or supervision. Not exactly a confident endorsement. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 23:32, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
