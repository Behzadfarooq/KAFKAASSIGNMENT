<p>This one is strange...

But the slogans include 1940: "We Get Hard", 1945: "We're Getting Round", 1960: "Never Our Way to Go". They seem really unlikely, and they get no Google hits.

<li><b>Delete</b> as hoax, though possibly an unintentional one. This is unfortunate because I've always liked Aqua. Oh well. Apparently an MP3 from a similar band is going around mislabeled as an Aqua track... not a big surprise, that's happened to every song from Toybox, for example. Also seems unlikely that an album to be released so far in the future would have a complete tracklist already. Even on the very very slight chance that this is true, we should wait until it's more verifiable and less speculative. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:36, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Frankly, I do feel this article is near-useless and certainly cruft; it isn't even notable in the context of the game in which it appears.

Even given that, I'd have voted to merge this article (or just closed this AFD and merged it myself) if there was any content to merge.<br />

<li><s><b>Neutral</b> <u>As it stands</u> the stub is less than useful,</s> on that basis I do not disagree with the editors above. However, the concept bears promise as an expanded article. It needn't be original research: if you take a look at published sources such as older <a href="http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/reviews/1826/1/" class="external text" title="http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/reviews/1826/1/" rel="nofollow">Hardware Central</a> or newer <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20050603/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20050603/index.html" rel="nofollow">Tom's Hardware guide</a> you get an idea of the sort of <b>performance information</b> that could be consolidated here. There is no question that GHz is no longer a useful guide to processor speed, and there are so many software benchmarks that endusers have difficulty comparing them. Bringing these aspects to a single place is where a WP article can be helpful. And a completely different form of "AMD vs. Intel" article would be on their <b>legal rivalry</b> noted <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/10/06/HNamdinteldocs_1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/10/06/HNamdinteldocs_1.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 09:33, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your input. The AnandTech incident is a good reason for marshalling the expertise here to provide some needed education on the relative merits of performance/benchmark claims. On the lawsuit, i think it is the history of legal sparring over the years (ever since the 1986 suit over AMD building 286s) that makes it notable, not what may happen in the future. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 23:01, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Please Do Not Delete - Comment</b> I was providing information on my business to the international internet community, I searched many other business articles and used many of the same things that I found on their wiki pages. I did not think I was doing something incorrect by copying the templates and ideas of many other business wiki pages. If I have made a mistake, I would please love to know what it is so that I can rectify the problem immediately. I worked long and hard to find and verify all of the information that I put into this page. Please advise instead of deleting. I do not wish to offend or break any rules. Snak Oil IS the name of my most popular product. I do not think a product name would be grounds for deletion? I admittedley do not know what categories to put my business' wiki page under as it encompasses so much. How id the entry not encyclopedic? I have included everything on the subject except for my business's address, and product pricing (which even I beleive would be advertising, and thus; innapropriate). I was also not aware that a person making an entry was supposed to not enter all of their knowlege into the database upon editing a page if said information did not exist in the article. Was I mistaken? I have modified the article to adapt further to the rules as I understand them. All news articles are verifyable by any person by calling the companies that printed the articles or doing a search at the Springfield public library's news archives site. I would love some assistance please. I may be contacted at kryistina@yahoo.com if anyone would like to give me additional advice. - <a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryistina_0ba8.html" title="User:Kryistina">Kryistina</a> 21:39, 22 October 2005 (CST)

<li><b>Comment</b> Per my note below, in the BSG universe, the only other Battlestar to survive was the Pegasus. Unlike Star Trek, you are simply not going to see any other Battlestars appear except in dialogue. Further, unlike Star Trek, the shows have developed four (4) episodes where the Pegasus is the central element. As the only other Battlestar to survive the Cylons, this vessel is highly notable and the entry should be kept. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 06:23, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as the Battlestar Galactica lore, in contrast to Star Trek, only meets ONE other named ship -- the Pegasus, the only other Battlestar to survive the Cylon attack. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 05:50, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>So we won't create pages on Battlestars that are seen in flashbacks? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 13:40, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Battlestars that are featured in flashbacks are certainly not notable enough for a separate listing. Only two from the canon survived the Cylons: Galactica (which I don't believe anyone could argue should be deleted) and Pegasus, the topic under debate. Two, and only two, survived.
<ul>
<li>Only two are know to have survived <b>so far</b>. If the series lasts seven years who knows what the producers will come up with. The Galactica page should probably be deleted too, it is already full of content that is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 17:25, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

It had a diffrent name them but the lot was the site of some of America's most treasured early films. After the great depression, the studio closed." If the studios had a different name when it was supposedly most notable, that is the name we should use if it is verifiable.

<li><b>Delete</b> extremely wierd hoax article. Since much of the article deals with supposed Cherry Cola Studio shirts, and even specifically states that the shirts are valuable, this article may exist to support a collectables scam of some sort. Note also that a movie studio being called "Cherry Cola" in the 20s simply doesn't ring true. Cherry Coke is from the mid-80s, and studios from that era simply weren't named things like that. Though I'd genuinely like to know what the deal behind this article is, it's zero-Google level shows it's a hoax as written, so it must go. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 18:15, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm a huge film buff and I've never heard of this place, plus I agree it is unverifiable, and lack of reference in the IMDb is the key here.

Also, unless the Coca-Cola Company owns it, odds are such a place wouldn't be allowed to have the name "Cherry Cola" anyway since that's a registered trademark for Coke. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:17, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>,I can put an end to this discussion. This article is blatenly wrong. We were alerted that this type of thing may happen. Flyers have been showing up at local universities claiming to have "Origional Cherry Cola Studios Clothing" and they they will be avliable online. They aslo tell the same basic story as the article. A google brought us here. I sm co-owner of Cherry Cola Studios. (yes Virginia, there is a Cherry Cola Studios) Let me set this article straight. First - we dont make films and never have, Our business is to rent out high end video equipment mostly to local film students. We are a small A/V supply company, We do not create sets nor do we have uniforms and we do not provide crews of any kind. The building we are in was built in the late 1970's at the earliest and was a warehouse before we moved in. As far as we know, *no* films have ever been shot here. Also, we do not have a "gift shop" nor do we give tours They would be very short (Here is the office, here is the storage room, thanks for comming) We do not make clothes nor sell them and never have. Nor do we intend to. Also, Ebay has been notified that this most likely is some attempt to gather value for some worthless t-shirts by some college kid. We have not been in business since 1980 or whatever it said. We have been around just over three years. Please delete this article as it is not even *remoetly* acurate nor was it created or authorized by us. If you see an offer for cherry cola clothing on an auction site, please report it to the auction company. I hope this clears things up. BTW Skidoo... The Term "Cherry Cola" is not a trademark of Coke, but you were prob thinking of their trademark on "Cherry Coke" We apoligize for the inconvienence and we already have a lead on who the t-shirt pusher is. This article should be deleted without question. Thank you. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECman_1d2a.html" title="User:Cman">Cman</a> 24:22, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>A trolling attack on Wikipedia. Only one tiny nugget of information keeps this from being speedied, which is that it references a supposed method of trapping monkeys that has seen extensive usage over many decades as a metaphorical figure. However, this article does not cover the metaphorical usage (except employing to insult Wikipedia) and does not provide any citation for it as alleged fact.

<li><b>Delete</b> as nonsense. A coconut monkey is indeed a real thing though: a monkey figure carved out of several coconuts and widely available as novelties in tropical tourist shops and beach areas. A specific 3D coconut monkey is used as a mascot for PC Gamer magazine. When this article is deleted, a real article can easily take its place.

<li><b>Keep</b> at least as disambiguation perhaps? There seem to be three meanings of this phrase, all distinct. One is the idiomatic use reported (and now cleaned up to explain it AS an idiomatic use and include the similarity to the termite mound report), a second is the tourist shop novelty meaning, and the fact that monkeys are trained to throw coconuts down from trees to harvest them in South Asia is a third and more obvious real life meaning. There is also a well known mathematical problem involving monkeys and coconuts in its usual explanation. As for the mention of Wikipedia eating brains, judging from the fact that you all above seem unwilling to fix an article with minor problems, and describe simple humour as an "attack", and advocate taking a censorial approach to gentle mocking of Wikipedia that you would not take towards gentle mocking of Britannica, perhaps your sense of humour and of fairness has already been eaten? <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 142.177.112.2 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.177.112.2_20fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.177.112.2">contribs</a>) 12:53, 24 October 2005 (UTC).</small>

<li>It was not an "article with minor problems".

Even if it <i>was</i> "simple humour", the article's POV statement that "Since the monkey will not use his brain, the hunters will happily make good use it for him" would not be appropriate for Wikipedia. The comparison following between these monkeys and "any addict" is, to put it mildly, just fucking stupid, not to mention <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. The statement following <i>that</i>, directly comparing Wikipedia users to those monkeys who have already been judged to have more value as food than as living beings, is in no uncertain terms an attack and an insult.

I don't see how it would become psuedo science just because it's new or presents an alternative. But I think it may be psuedoscience in any case, if no one accepts it. Or perhaps because its pseudoscience, it's not accepted. Is that almost the entirety of the criteria? It appears that's how the word psuedoscience is used. No matter the degree of it, I suppose most believe it requires "no explanation" other than that it is "original research" with no credentialed scientists involved, nor interpreted at the time of a real experiment's completion, making it "psuedoscience".....</p>

<dd>It would be a hypothesis if never tested; a theory if at least one verification has been made. So, looks all hypothetical.</dd>
</dl>
<p>--24.167.40.92 20:43, 23 October 2005 (UTC)The problem is that the experiments that would have verified, parts, of it have already been done. My hypothesis so for is to be compatible with that knowledge, as if the hypothesis were decided before the experiment was done (and verified in this sense). Experiments, for example, include those about: Redshift of Distant Galaxies, Missing Mass Problem, and the Nature of Distant Galaxies.</p>
<p>--24.167.40.92 20:54, 23 October 2005 (UTC)However, I know that not all of it is proven yet, and some of it is not provable or disprovable, yet. So is it conjecture? Yes, because some of the things it predicts haven't been seen yet. It is it a theory? It "predicts" a few things which have already shown to be the case - but that was after the fact. I haven't discovered all of its predictions though. So with time, I may be able to find more ways as to how this can be verified or debunked.</p>

It did refer to an individual that was supposed to be a general, and had various activities up to the current date.

<li>Hilton Twins should be a redirect to Hilton sisters as the latter term easily wins on the Google duel test see <a href="http://cgi.sfu.ca/~gpeters/cgi-bin/pear/battle.php?word1=Hilton+sisters&amp;word2=Hilton+twins&amp;key=&amp;B1=Submit" class="external autonumber" title="http://cgi.sfu.ca/~gpeters/cgi-bin/pear/battle.php?word1=Hilton+sisters&amp;word2=Hilton+twins&amp;key=&amp;B1=Submit" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>

<p>At first glance, I don't know what this is supposed to be. Looks very haphazard. Could be a draft for some article that was meant to be in user namespace (as suggested by "/rough").

<dd>I took maybe a bit more time than a quick glance at it. (The external link was very helpful to help me make a first guess.) It's an article about a school (ry≈´) of <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjutsu.html" title="Ninjutsu">ninjutsu</a>, with the original article being <a href="../../../../ja/%E7%94%B2/%E8%B3%80/%E6%B5%81/%E7%94%B2%E8%B3%80%E6%B5%81.html" class="extiw" title="ja:Áî≤Ë≥ÄÊµÅ">ja:Áî≤Ë≥ÄÊµÅ</a> (K≈çka-ry≈´, K≈çga-ry≈´); it was probably machine-translated, explaining the hap-hazardness. According to the article <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja.html" title="Ninja">ninja</a>, the article should be titled <a href="../../../k/%C5%8D/g/K%C5%8Dga-ry%C5%AB.html" title="K≈çga-ry≈´">K≈çga-ry≈´</a>. The ‚Äú/rough‚Äù likely is a non-standard transliteration of ‚Äúry≈´‚Äù (major school).

<dd>Thinking about it a bit more, perhaps "/rough" does mean "rough draft". Perhaps the current title means ‚Äúa rough draft of an article on ‚ÄòKoga-ryu‚Äô‚Äù.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - Yes, it was a long time before it was completed, I was busy with other nominations and other non-wikipedia stuff. But you checked my contribs, so you should have known that I knew about the afd process. To be honest, I wasn't that bothered about someone creating the page, but was bothered over what you had to say about it. ie speedily remove the tage, and to evict me from the wikipedia house. Normally, if you find a broken afd listing, it's better complete the nomination, and then to put your argument rather than just posting some rash statements. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 13:49, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How has he complied? He even fails to note that this article was initially created by following the existing edit link on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_Smash_d091.html" title="Graphic Smash">Graphic Smash</a>. Stating <i>I think it was one time a part of the graphicsmash community, but I'm not too sure</i> shows he has not even bothered to read the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_Smash_d091.html" title="Graphic Smash">Graphic Smash</a>. He asks for notability without even checking the links in the article under the heading Awards. The reason Google does not show up much is that the web comics has moved home several times and also been a subscription comics in the past, thus less coverage. This is not impressive. Moreover I cannot see being unregistered is a disqualification anywhere. Can you? 85.164.86.246 19:51, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> - One of the main reasons for nominating it for deletion was the fact that I DID check the external links in the "awards" section. They're not awards, they're forum posts on webcomic toplists. Every webcomic ever has that. I'm also against the, "once appeared on some network = notability" stance. It's like giving every band who has ever been signed by the most minor of labels an article. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 13:45, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This comic is sufficiently established. Though the author moved it to his own site fairly recently, it was on Modern Tales.

<li>Duly noted. My vote remains unchanged and I still believe Hahnchen made a mistake on this one. I'm not fond of the deletionist attention webcomics have received lately, but this one strikes me as an error as opposed to a philosophical difference. ‚Äì<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 18:50, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - comics associated with Modern Tales and other professional webcomics syndicates are notable. The closing admin should also see <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_Webcomics_0e1f.html" title="User:Snowspinner/Webcomics">User:Snowspinner/Webcomics</a>, as I believe myself to be a subject expert on the matter of webcomics, which should be given due weight in closing this debate. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:45, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is Modern Tales really 100% professional? I see it has some free comics and some subscription comics, so it's hard to tell. That's why I think we should spell such things out in the guidelines--but we have to agree on them to use them. We shouldn't have to be experts to see that a comic is notable; this should be spelled out in the article. Incidentally, you might look at <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#The_role_of_expert_editors" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research#The role of expert editors</a> for Wikipedia policy on what expertise counts for; the answer is not a whole lot, unless reputable sources are cited. This is sometimes time-consuming (something I've experienced plenty on physics articles), but it makes the encyclopedia better. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 22:56, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And I would not pretend that my say-so should be taken as a valid source for content addition - but deletion debates are a different matter - subject experts ought be taken seriously when asserting notability of a subject, I would think. And yes, Modern Tales is a professional site - it is Joey Manley's business. A given MT artist may have other jobs, but MT in general is a professional operation, the contents of which are notable. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:00, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The site as a whole may be professional, but I would still want more information about the particular artist. It also depends on how many comics are on the site, and what its criteria are for inclusion. I don't know that within an AfD is the appropriate place to discuss such questions in detail‚Äîrather, the ongoing work at <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> is. Regarding expertise and deletion, if someone was deleting a physics article, I would put up a couple of links to places the concept was discussed in peer-reviewed journals. I realize that Modern Tales may be nearly the closest thing that exists to a peer-reviewed journal in webcomics, but I don't think it qualifies as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> in the same way under Wikipedia rules. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 23:08, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you want to have the discussion on <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>, fine, but it seems absurd to declare that notability issues that haven't been settled there are somehow invalid to discuss here - the article is up for deletion now. Do you propose to table the discussion until we have inclusion guidelines? As for Modern Tales, they are selected based on their merits by the editor of the particular site - in the case of Graphic Smash, that's <a href="../../../t/_/c/T_Campbell_3b51.html" title="T Campbell">T Campbell</a>. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:11, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your point is well taken. So why did this comic move? It seems to have moved from a hosting service that might very well have made it notable, to one that doesn't (unless it's in the top 25). Where we should consider it as being from depends on why it moved, how long it had been there, etc.--so what's the story? -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 23:35, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure yet - it's something I'm looking into. But I'd like to err on the side of caution here. My guess, though I'm not certain, is that erratic updating made it unsuitable for a professional operation like Graphic Smash. I don't know of any other cases of strips going down from notable syndicate to Keenspace offhand, which is itself kind of notable. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:39, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While most comics on Modern Tales are notable, I don't think the least read comic on Modern Tales is automatically notable. Same goes for a comic that may have experienced 15 seconds of fame with a brief association with the Graphic Smash site. Is every failed sitcom pilot notable? Is a band automatically notable if they sign to a major label but then their album tanks? My vote remains "delete." <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 23:47, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would think few would object to an article on every television series to have aired on network television, considering that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> explicitly advocates articles on every individual episode of some of them. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:50, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think my vote will have to remain as is, at least if you're right about the unsuitability due to updating irregularities; that would undermine the whole reason that Modern Tales would be a standard of notability in the first place. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 00:35, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd just like to say that my feelings on webcomic syndication and notability are already covered in <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>. I'm against the any membership to a syndicate = notability guideline as suggested. It would be the same as saying any signed band to the most minor of record labels would get an article. OK, GraphicSmash as an entity may be notable, but how notable are the individual comics? I reckon that most people would refer to the syndicate over a specific comic, on the lines of "I'm reading graphicSmash", over the specific comic. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 17:46, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You reckon completely and 100% wrong. I have never in my life heard of anyone refer to reading "Keenspot" or "Graphic Smash." <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:49, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Maybe that was a bad example phrase. But the point I am trying to make, is that graphic smash is way more notable than the individual comics that make it up, unlike say a record label. I doubt people would pay just to see 1 particular comic, but look at graphicsmash and say, "now, hey! There's a collection of not too bad comics that I wouldn't mind reading." Which is why I think that just because a comic has appeared on xxx syndicate, doesn't mean that it's notable. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 20:07, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>In my experience it is generally one or two comics that get people to make the purchase, and then they stumble upon more from that - for me it was <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digger.html" title="Digger">Digger</a> on Graphic Smash and <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narbonic.html" title="Narbonic">Narbonic</a> on Modern Tales. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 21:23, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have known people who've paid because of one comic, and found out about others that way. I started subscribing to Graphic Smash mainly for <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digger.html" title="Digger">Digger</a>, Killroy and Tina, and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fans_%28the_webcomic%29.html" title="Fans (the webcomic)">Fans (the webcomic)</a>, but I've been introduced to many other good comics through it.

<p>This is just extreme trivia. Whilst a small amount of trivia is interesting I really don't see how this list could be of any use to anybody.

<p>First of all...I gave permission to use the list if the source is cited, so deleting the source is not a good solution. Second...if it's currently in order of age (109 years 364 days, 109 years 358 days etc), why not just keep it in the order that it's in?</p>
<p>However, the biggest argument is, if you are going to list people aged 109, why not list the 870+ people aged 110+? <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 17:47, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>THERE ARE OVER 135,000 living people worldwide aged 100 and over. BY 2050 the number should be 4 million. Age 100 is not in itself notable, which is why age 110 has become the new standard.

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether being a centenarian makes a person notable or not (and I disagree with the assertion that it does, especially as it becomes more common with better medicine) is, I think, irrelevant to the discussion of a list of such people. Notability would matter regarding the individual articles about specific people, but a list isn't automatically worthy of being kept (or compiled to begin with) simply because many, most, or even all, of the listed items are deserving of articles on an individual basis. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 16:35, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, rename and reformat</b>. People over 100 years old are certainly encyclopedic, but "nearly supercentenarian" is not specific enough.

<li>You are missing the whole point. The U.S. currently has 50,000 centenarians, Japan has 25,000. Age 100 in itself is NOT NOTABLE. I think age 110 might be, but we don't even have a list of 110 or older (yet). So why is there a list of "almost 110" if no list of "110+". Second, "Almost supercentenarians" means "almost." What is almost? For my list, I defined the cutoff point as anyone within 90 days of reaching age 110 (or 75% of the way from age 109 to age 110), since some people like to "round up" ages. However, this copier has added in people aged less than 109.75 years, some as young as 107. Since only 6% of people aged 107 reach age 110, I certainly would NOT consider age 107 to be "almost" 110. Incidentally, Japan currently has 101 people aged 108 or over, living, not to mention the deceased. The number of people who died at age 108 or 109 worldwide can be estimated at 3,480 (assuming 50% death rates at age 108 and 109, based on validated list of 870 people reaching age 110).</li>
</ul>
<p>Then of course, maybe we could have a list of baseball pitchers who "almost" won 300 games, football teams that "almost" won the SuperBowl, people that "almost" died in the WTC. I decline to vote because I think a list in order of age wouldn't be too bad, but there should be at minimum source links and a consistent pattern of organization (either by age, by chronological order with an age minimum, or by alphabetical order with age minimum). <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 18:08, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment. One difference is that the list of people who are nearly centenarians is a list of famous people, plus there seems to be a minimum age point of 99 for that list. Consequently, the "list of people who are nearly supercentenarians" is mostly a list of people famous only for old age, with a few "famous" cases thrown in. My problem is not with the list per se, but user 65.93.29.176, who based on his massive time available, infatuation with stats, and immaturity (refusing to discuss issues with others, or to see both sides of an issue) suggests he is a teenager. The list, if kept, should be formatted according to a pre-set standard of who qualifies: age 109? Age 109.5? What is "nearly?" Second, shouldn't a "list of people who are supercentenarians" be tried first, to see whether it would float as a viable entity? Third, if kept, the list should either be formatted, as stated, by alphabetical order, chronological order, or by age (oldest first). The World Almanac lists tallest buildings in order of height, and highest mountains in order of height. Baseball's 300-game winners are listed in order of victories. The problem is not a list per se, but whether it is organized according to systematic criteria or no.172.159.204.208 19:13, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Does lack of fame make a vanity article?</p>
<p>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see WP:MUSIC). Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses are not "vanity" so long as the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional.</p>
<p>Please heed the rules of wikipedia before deleting. Thank You.Bostonjon 01:11, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment for Bostonjon</b>. Do not confuse 'lack of fame' with the condition of 'not being vain'. The subject of the article in question is displaying conceit (ie: 'A favorable and especially unduly high opinion of one's own abilities or worth') and this makes the article a 'vanity' article and, hence, eligible for deletion. <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddie.willers_4fa8.html" title="User:Eddie.willers">Eddie.willers</a> 01:17, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b>. The claim that this data is not easily verifiable is, in my opinion no reason to delete it. I for one have actually seen Mason "Spray" Stahl performing at several spoken word/hip-hop concerts in the Boston area. Your claims that information regarding Mason Stahl cannot be currently found on the web highlights the importance of this page on wikipedia. Stahl needs to have his name entered onto the web at sometime and somewhere and there is no better place but wikipedia to document the information regarding Mason Stahl. It does not seem fair to judge Mason Stahl's importance or significance on a google search for even if he did come up on google this does not mean that he is not important. I for one am quite sure that this page is accurate for I have actually seen Mason Stahl in performance and have read a book of his poetry. I strongly urge those considering the deletion of this page to heed my suggestions and acknowledge that while you may not have heard of Mason in your parts of the country he is known in and around the Boston area for his rapping and poetry.Bostonjon 15:25, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. Let me remind you that I have heard Mason "Spray" Stahl rap in concert before and I own his second album "Elimihate". I too am surprised that no hits come up for him on google, however, I agree with the articles assessment of him as an "emerging rapper" for he is beginning to gain notoriety in the Boston area. I would also like to make it clear that he is a poet and actually has a poetry book currently on sale in several Boston area independent bookshops. I think that his rapping alone should qualify him for a wikipedia page but if that cannot be agreed upon then his poetic works should easily make him a candidate for a page. I would like to finish by saying that many now famous poets went their whole lives without receiving due recognition and I feel that the wikipedia page on Mason Stahl is an accurate, fair, and necessary contribution to this encyclopedia.Bostonjon 16:06, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I am shocked to see that this page is being considered for deletion. I am from Dorchester, Massachusetts (a part of Boston) and can corroborate the fact that Mason "Spray" Stahl is a rising player in the Boston hip/hop scene. He has achieved a decent amount of notorioty among fans of hip/hip and poetry in the area and he is deserving of a page. I strongly urge those considering the deletion of this page to not do so since they obviously are not familiar with the Boston hip/hop music scene. "Spray" is undoubtedly an important part of the development of rap in the area and he should be recognized for his achievements.130.64.157.124 19:47, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. I just noticed that Spray Stahl had an entry on wikipedia and was thrilled. I've been following this guy forever, he's going to be huge someday. I saw that the article was up for deletion and that member "BostonJon" was the sole defender for this artists page. If you want to call him just an "artist". He's really a renaissance man. He does it all. Actually if you watch his documentary its cool because he during the credits he's actually the one rapping in that song "hate this". My friend burned me all his CDs, so I dont have any of the information per se, but I know that I could find it in time. Just don't delete this page yet and I'll try and find the info. Try and be understanding, if I put a page up about my band, 23 cents, you probably wouldn't find anything online at all except the four tracks we put on Kazaa. So, stay classy, and don't forget, even Jay-Z was an unknown once too, but that's the whole point of Wikipedia, to put more accessible information on the web...right? 130.64.157.66 19:52, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - <b>Above two votes obvious Sockpuppets.</b> After my notice that Bostonjon was still ballot-stuffing by making himself anonymous and typing in the same unfamiliar-with-Wikipedia style, he altered his style slightly (retaining of course abysmal spelling) and created two throwaway identities--<b>whose <i>only</i> contribution to Wikipedia are these votes</b>. Just like the two anonymous votes above, they were submitted just minutes apart. If you think the Wikipedia admins are dumb enough to fall for that, you're sorely mistaken. Rest assured, Bostonjon, if your chicanery does manage to fool somebody, I will immediately submit to AFD again.

<li>'"Keep"' Who cares about what this kid is doing to procrastinate? Its better than doing crack or beating up women and children. So Mason "Spray" wants to beef up his "street cred" by pushing his image on wikipedia, SO WHAT? You guys have been critizing him and BostonJon (PS, a "BlowJob" joke?), giving him all this crap. Well if he's such a loser for pumping Spray on wikipedia during his free time, then you guys are just as bad for trying to get him knocked off wikipedia. WHO CARES? Honestly, I have no idea whether or not he exists, and truthfully, I dont care. But BostonJon says he knows him, who's to say he doesn't? Just go with the flow, people, go with the flow. -Zeppelin1969 {I hate you people} <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.64.157.153 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.64.157.153_dbe6.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.64.157.153">contribs</a>) 02:20, 25 October 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is ridiculous. This entire argument is ridiculous. There is no evidence that Spray exists or does not exist. Because there is no evidence that "Spray" exists, excepting of course this article, we must chose to delete. Unless of course this is his breakout article, the first of many to follow which will create the embediment of support for this up and coming rapper, then the fact that there is no evidence that he does not exist takes precedence and we must choose to keep. If, however, this is merely an attempt to create a false buzz over an unspectacular act trying to make a name for himself and his lyrical accomplishments, we must decide to delete. But, since there is at least one, and most likely more, fan of Mason Stahl and his verbal assault on the current rap scene, as evidenced by the time spent on the creation and support of this page we must assume that Mason 'Spray" Stahl has done something of a meritorious nature, worthy of his supporter's time and effort, so we must, ultimately choose to keep. -JEA <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 131.122.49.113 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__131.122.49.113_0b4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 131.122.49.113">contribs</a>) 02:51, 25 October 2005.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> So he's unpopular as of yet. Does that mean his article should be deleted? So his 'Albums' were either self-produced or produced by a tiny company. Does that mean his article should be deleted?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I must say that many of you should be ashamed of how you are conducting this discussion. Most of the votes calling for the deletion of this article are not based on anything legitimate and are simply due to a personal vendetta against Mason Stahl. Some of you are criticizing his supporters because of their lack of knowledge regarding wikipedia conventions. Others are trying to marginalize him by poking fun at the fact that there is red eye in his picture. This behavior is immature and malicious. It is comments like those that intimidate some people from making contributions to wikipedia. We should all be grateful that this article was submitted and should hope for the expansion of this incredible resource. Every contribution works towards our goal of achieving greater understanding of the universe. To those who contributed this page, which I find no reason to question, I applaud you and to those of you who are trying to marginalize Mr. Stahl shame on you. It is my dream to one day see wikipedia become a fountain of information that will educate the world and lift us out of this shroud of ignorance that is responsible for the problems facing the world today. While a page concerning a rapper may seem insignificant to some we must approach this topic in an objective manner and realize that to many people throughout the globe rap is a powerful force that is capable of great change. I once again strongly urge all of you to vote to keep this page. Muzakman 16:48, 26 October 2005 (UTC) <small><b>Note: all user's edits save one in relation to article and this AFD</b></small>

<li><b>Keep!!</b> I also attend Tufts University, where Mason is well-known for his rhymes - nonnotable he definitely is NOT.

<li><b>Comment</b> i already voted keep, so i wont again. i also duplicated the page under Spray (rapper). you caught me. see, i really thought id be able to trick you. guess not. in any case, i agree (in principle) with muzakman. while i have my doubts that wikipedia will put an end to world hunger, prejudice, and hate, i do agree that the idea is to post useful information for others to read and learn about. the fact that you all dont know about spray is perfect reason to keep him on wikipedia. and the reason so many of the Keep votes are newcomers is beacuse in the boston area (particularly Tufts campus) he's well known, and theres a bit of a word-of-mouth campaign to save this page on pricniple. im not in the area right now (actually in europe), but i have some friends that are attending tufts and i did meet spray shortly before i left this year. hes real. whether or not there's other information on the internet, the stuff here is real. and thats why i duplicated it, becuase its deserves to stay up. i didnt expect the dupe to stay long, and i was right. egal. take care. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.83.63.14 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.83.63.14_235c.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.83.63.14">contribs</a>) 10:59, 27 October 2005 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am in total agreement with the person writing above. This page has even greater value than many other pages because it is (as far as I know) the only comprehensive source on information about Mason "Spray" Stahl. The argument that since no other information is easily found on Mr. Stahl we should choose to delete him is unsound and lacks any real logical foundation. Why, I ask you, would we want wikipedia to become simply a source that replicated information already available. We want wikipedia to become a source that that not only organizes, expands, and codifies information that is already available but also becomes a source for new developments in the realm of global information. Let me posit a scenario in which those who have voted to delete this page had found existing information about Mr. Stahl on the web. Would you then have deemed this page to be one of value to the wikipedia informational catalogue. You probably would have and that is where your logic (or lack thereof) fails me. Those sites would signal to you that he is notable because someone invested time to create and maintain those pages. Well then this wikipedia page should also be an indicator of Mr. Stahl's significance in the rap community because like any other webpage this wikipedia page too took some fan's time to create. This fan had the noble goal of making previously unknown information available to the entire world. To this fan I commend your efforts to help in the education of humanity. I also want to highlight the outpouring of support and discussion concerning this page by so many people which seems to illuminate the fact the Mr. Stahl does have a following and is therefore significant. This logic that since no other pages currently exist about a person/topic means it should be deemed insignificant is both a great injustice to goals of wikipedia and is a terrible policy to abide by. Was Emily Dickinson famous in her lifetime? No. She lived in ananomity and was only discovered posthumosly. With the advent of the internet I believed that the dissemination of information would help to prevent this from happening again. I urge you not to let a whole generation miss out on the enrichment and enjoyment that can be derived from knowing about and experiencing Mr. Stahl's work. I for one will fight to ensure that Mr. Stahls messages are spread throughout the world in this present day and I will commit myself to the struggle against the inequity that would befall both Mr. Stahl and the international community should he be silenced by his opponents.

<li>User:Arr34 asks, "Why, I ask you, would we want wikipedia to become simply a source that replicated information already available."

<p>Seems like vanity. By the article's own admit, this movie is in limited release and not something you'd put in an encyclopedia. Ifnord 14:09, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Contrary to what some people say, the Mischief Masters <i>do</i> exist and therefor deserve a spot in the Wikipedia. The Mischief Masters haven't reached national fame yet, but they're working very hard to do so by producing products like their movie A New Master. People who don't believe it should check their IMDB page. For further proof they could look at the biggest Dutch DVD site <i>DVD-home</i> since they devoted a artikel to the Masters. Doubters will see for themselves that there IS a movie made. The page is written in Dutch, but does contain screenshots. I do agree that there isn't a Mischeif Masters series since there is only one movie made with a second production coming.</p>
<p>The url to the article mentioned: <a href="http://www.dvd-home.nl/nieuws/oud2004.htm#8" class="external free" title="http://www.dvd-home.nl/nieuws/oud2004.htm#8" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvd-home.nl/nieuws/oud2004.htm#8</a> The Masters are displayed just above the "Augustus" (August) banner.</p>

I have no clue whether or not it's a good movie, but as it happens, that's completely irrelevant. Bottom line: it's a non-notable movie.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is actually a much better article than I expected it to be from the title. I expected a poopile of neologisms and insults based on individual players. Instead, it's a tight little glossary of the nomenclature used in these games. Terms like "mob", "buff", "con", "train" and the like are certianly used a lot and aren't particularly obvious. It could still use a little cleanup, specifically removing the words that are general internet/chat terms ("AFK") or general RPG terms ("NPC", "level", "class") or generally general terms in general ("WTB").

(Contestants on reality TV shows tend to be kept, but should an entry on an <i>otherwise unknown person on a planned reality TV show</i> be sent to AfD instead of getting speedily deleted? I think not.) <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 22:24, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We never keep anything based on potential future achievements. Otherwise, we'd be keeping articles on babies because they might win an Oscar or Nobel Prize someday. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:01, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if a baby was the unique focus of a progam designed to produce a future Nobel Prize winner, it would still be a speedy candidate? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:22, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are lots of those programs going on already. They're called overachieving parents. Seriously, this isn't <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laika.html" title="Laika">Laika</a> we're talking about here. This is some dude who kinda-sorta thinks it might be cool to make a game about his cat, but hasn't bothered to put up the Sourceforge page yet (or anything else, either, since Mooka Mookason gets 0 Google hits). Let's look at this piece-by-piece for a moment: Most games are notable, but not every one. Many game characters are notable, many are not. People/creaures on whom game characters are based are rarely notable (even <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Segali_d8aa.html" title="Mario Segali">Mario Segali</a> is barely a stub). But none of that even applies here because the game hasn't even been created yet, nor even started by the looks of things. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:07, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're saying that we shouldn't have the chance to double check. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:15, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In this case, there's nothing to check or double-check. The linked-to Sourceforge site doesn't exist, and Google shows zero results. Neither does Yahoo or AllTheWeb. I suppose that one could go to the library and look up Mooka Mookason in the card catalog, the Reader's Guide To Periodical Literature and the Encyclopaedia Brittanica too, but since I'm not in an absurdist mood today I'll skip that step and assume there's nothing about Mooka in there either. If any of this were in the least bit disputable, I'd agree with you. Currently I read 9 "speedy" votes and 7 "delete" votes, with nary a "keep" vote in site, even from yourself. A strong consensus already exists to delete, and further voting would be no more than an exercise in beaurocracy. In fact, come to think of it, WP policy actually discourages voting on AfDs if "consensus you agree with has already been formed". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:37, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>LOL I wrote that part, the reason I haven't said "delete" is because there is already a consensus to do so. We don't need any more votes, but also we don't need to rewrite the speedy policy just because this article happens to be about a real cat not a fictional one. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:46, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The absurdity of the situation isn't about real vs. fictional, but animal vs. human. I've written <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beautiful_Joe_6ee2.html" title="Beautiful Joe">an article about a dog</a>, so I know something in this area. If this article were about a human, it would be an easy uncontested speedy. Since it's a cat, it doesn't strictly fit the letter of the speedy criteria, but many feel it does fit the spirit, which is why there are more Speedy votes than Delete votes. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 01:04, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If articles which claim notability are speedy deleted without scrutiny, the system is broken. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:28, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...which leads us back to my original statement, that claims of notability can't be based on potential future achievements. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 02:12, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Mostly just finishing incomplete nomination. However, given that the entire content, once the external link and the mission statement from their website is removed, would be "Straight Way School in West Covina, California is an Islamic school and mosque on a single lot. Contact information is as follows: 1912 West Merced Ave West Covina, CA 91790", it seems to lack enough content to be worth keeping. Seems like Cleanup at the bare minimum.

<li>What does "being licensed" have to do with it? It is verifiable - that is the only criteria for this encyclopedia. WP is not the government.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:29, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If a school is licensed, information about it is collected, monitored, and verified by the government. The government is our reliable source in such a case. We need at an absolute minimum one reliable source of information. The school's web site, is not reliable or impartial. It's a private site. The complete lack of verifiable on information has already caused a problem with editing, since the school's claim to accept regardless of creed is highly dubious, yet we have no way of checking this. A licensed school would have any mandatory admission rules stated in its license (or charter), and we could check what that rule is. In this caes, the school can say anything, and we can't challenge it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 23:47, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That might be the case with claims or details about the school, but that has little, if anything to do with the existence of the article on WP itself (and the point of the AfD process). The website has photos, extensive information which is easily verifiable through a websearch and white page/yellow page listings. If you want to debate the inclusion of it's admission rules or other specifics is not a question appropriate to AfD which deals with the existence of the article itself.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:53, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This page appears to be a hoax by some bored kids. No hits on google for Surly Lake Canada. The external links provided lead to fake webpages. The article is full of meaningless details e.g. the town celebrates Christmas. The bored kids have asked for more time to prove their town exists, so I tagged it afd rather than speedy delete. Although according to them it only has 82 people, so may be non-notable even if real. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 09:02, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Again, give me more time. I will post proof. I spent lots of time writing up that page for our settlement and I don't want to do it again. Just let me have more time. Anyone who reads Wikipedia will be fine with it.</p>
<p>thanks J. Rainbow Jr.</p>

<li>Afd articles usually have a week's delay before the final deletion. This should give you enough time to make up some more webpages about your town <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a></li>

<li>This is such patent over-the-top nonsense. I can't decide whether my favourite part is the "Surly Lake Broadcasting Corporation" operating on a channel that doesn't exist on the television dial, the two hockey teams trading a pennant back and forth in a town that barely has the population to cobble <i>one</i> whole team together, the three-hour war on the Canadian government, or the civic events list that consists of Christmas, New Years and St. Patrick's Day (optional). Or maybe my favourite part is the website, where the photo of "our new beautifull town hall" clearly has <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trail%2C_British_Columbia_79f5.html" title="Trail, British Columbia">Trail</a> (which is in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>) written on the water tower. Or where the town receptionist's phone number has an exchange code that resolves to <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Battleford%2C_Saskatchewan_83c8.html" title="North Battleford, Saskatchewan">North Battleford</a>. I hereby deem this both a <b>speedy</b> and a "deleted protected page" until further notice. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 11:00, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This could be an interesting subject. I know people who went there, and supposedly Wooster didn't have nationals for decades because of a bequest from a former student that had been badly hazed that conditioned the money on no frats. I don't know the exact story, but it did lead to lots of oddities in Wooster Greek life, like no real houses (just halls in particular dorms, usually the bad ones). <a href="../../../a/2/k/User%7EA2Kafir_5330.html" title="User:A2Kafir">A2Kafir</a> 23:12, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Additional comment - the creator of the article, in the first deletion debate, notes that he made a trip to special collections to verify his facts. Which is to say, this article is the product of real work and real research. Yeah, there are more notable topics, and it could be formatted away from a list.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. The introduction doesn't establish the <i>point</i> of the article, except that a bunch of things are "mysterious," and it's just a list of fraternities with a few incidents of history thrown in. I would not be opposed to a shorter article that was about history, which cited sources for necessary facts about fraternities instead of listing them all. Honestly, this sort of seems to be a FAQ (or correction of common misconceptions, maybe) about the fraternities at the college, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection of information</a>.

<li><b>Comment (no vote)</b>. I was the person to nominate this article the first time. I go to this college. I am not a Greek student, but have no problem with Greeks. At the time, the reason why I nominated was because the article was both POV and unverified, and, at the time, it seemed like that wasn't going to change. I had no idea where the author had originally gotten his information. Those two problems were resolved during the first AfD debate. I personally have an appreciation for the article now, though there are still problem areas, but I am not voting; I think my attending the school and my interactions with greeks color my judgment too much. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 03:42, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> But my reason is that it's a non-notable theory. It's probably <i>not</i> original research. The two "references" say nothing about underwater megalithic structures. However, the article does cite <a href="http://www.martnemstrangeuniverse.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://www.martnemstrangeuniverse.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">a blog</a>, so unless 210.15.200.244 is Marty M, it's not original research. Although this is silly nonsense, this certainly could be an article if it should be shown that Marty M's theory was <i>widely</i> disseminated and had a <i>large</i> number of adherences. It would of course need to be rewritten and retitled from a neutral point of view. The fact though is that Google shows <i>no</i> pages linking to the blog article, and the blog article shows <i>no</i> reader comments. Googling on exact phrase "Underwater megalithic structures off US coast" isn't impressive either; 41 hits but most of them are to copies of the Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:09, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Please consider rewriting this article and keeping it. I have been a member of the forum Eastern US Weather for over a year. This group of netizens is a unique phenomenon that I believe should be included as a neologistic people-group phenomenon. I believe the article in question can be re-written and retained in Wikipedia or at least retained in one of your other wikipedian branches, such as the Wiktionary or in one of the other Wikis. Please consider my proposal. <a href="../../../j/e/b/User%7EJeb_09b9.html" title="User:Jeb">Jeb</a></li>

<p>mostly harmless fancruft, only "Zorin" is misspelled. Possible move to Zorin Indstries, but that should just be a redirect to the film, I would think. <a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a> 19:41, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Andrew Lenahan.
