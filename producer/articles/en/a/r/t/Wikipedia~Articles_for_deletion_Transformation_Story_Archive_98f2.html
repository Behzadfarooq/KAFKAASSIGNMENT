<p>nn, niche, inactive website, probably does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, alexa of 222,415 and very spammy article. Google for title phrase gets about 250 unique hits, and most are not about the said site. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Transformation+Story+Archive%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=250&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Transformation+Story+Archive%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=250&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 02:40, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, though the article does need cleanup. The website is of great historical significance <i>within</i> its niche. It's inactive now but when it first went up it was pretty much the only place to go to for transformation fiction on the Internet and it became a center of activity for the fandom. Looking over WP:WEB, it looks like it satisfies the third criterion - the webzine TSAT republishes content from there. (TSAT is independant of TSA, in case anyone asks - the name is a result of how the initialism "TSA" became shorthand for the entire genre). <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:51, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hey, I just noticed, what's with that Google link? It's got an <i>offset</i> of 250, not a total of 250 unique hits, and as a result it's only showing rather poor hits. Do this search instead: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Transformation+Story+Archive%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Transformation+Story+Archive%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and you'll see lots of references from other sources that are indeed about the site. A lot more than just 250 in total, too. I note from your user page and contributions that you're apparently on a campaign to seek out and delete non-notable stuff, and while there's nothing inherently wrong with that you should at least take more care that you're not misrepresenting your targets in the process. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:22, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> No, I did the google test right, I'm fairly certain. And you don't have to be such a jerk about it, let's hear from some other users about it. The google count is just a small part of why this should be deleted. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 04:19, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was trying not to sound jerky despite the annoyance I was feeling, so I apologize if it still came through like that. But I still think the Google link you posted in the AfD summary is misleading; it gives "Results 241 - 246 of about 11,000" whereas the example I posted above gives "Results 1 - 10 of about 11,000". It's not surprising that the 241st-most-relevant hit Google gives is going to be pretty sucky. Anyway, the page has had a total rewrite now and references have been added that even I didn't know about off the top of my head, hopefully that addresses some of the other aspects of WP:WEB. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 18:11, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> ... although the article's current state certainly doesn't reflect its ability to meet requirements. There are actually connetions to Austrian political drama, besides the niche value. I'll see what I can do; I've been searching for something outside my normal expertise to champion lately. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 06:38, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b> I doubt that any third-party independent sources can be found for this topic. On the other hand, if Serpent's Choice feels he needs more time to research, I have no objection to keeping with the understanding that it will be renominated if no sources can be found. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 07:02, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</s><b>Keep</b>, per the argument that non-trivial third-party press coverage is out there somewhere.

</ul>
<p><u>Update</u>-- I put in some research time and rebuilt the article from the ground up, doing away with a lot of the advertising-y feel and generally spamminess. I <i>think</i> at this point the article meets the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, although it is admittedly a difficult call. There are without question two confounding factors that make current documentation challenging. First, age is an issue. The TSA was most influential in the 1996-1998 period and has been inactive (although extant) since 2003. And second, the communities represented by the TSA (furry fandom, transgender, and transformation fetish) are poorly represented in print sources <i>now</i>, much less in 1996 or 1997. That the site maintains an Alexa rating of ~220k three years after the last update whatsoever is frankly a strong indication that it was a significant site in its prime. I do recognize, however, that the references are still shaky(eSCENE is itself defunct, but legitimately published in 1995-1997/8, with ISSNs for its annual publication). <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> recognizes that popular culture and fiction topics "may not be discussed in the same academic contexts" as other material; ezines and their ilk, especially with years of (web-)publication history are at least a reasonable step above "[p]ersonal websites, wikis, and posts on bulletin boards, Usenet and blogs". I'll see if more is available as time permits. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 09:37, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>/<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> restricts use of "bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs" and cautions against self-published sources "where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication ... includ[ing] personal websites, and books published by vanity presses". eSCENE had an established (and rotating) editor board. Likewise, both of the ezines referenced herein (Anthro and TSAT) have editorial control; these are not self-published sources, nor do they equate to content like personal websites (<i>e.g.</i> Geocities) or blogs. The FPÖ allegations can also probably be better documented by someone who speaks German (as an internal Austrian political issue ibn 1997-8, English-language coverage is essentially nonexistent). Not all articles can or should have citations from conventional news agencies because not all verifiable encyclopedic content is newsworthy and print-appropriate. What is expected from sourcing for an article of such a nature that is not present here at current? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 02:45, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ed, I'm not entirely sure what you're saying here, could you clarify? I'm taking your opinion to be that the subject doesn't warrant an article because the archive is <i>currently</i> defunct and has been superceded by other sources, which I don't think is relevant because the site has <i>historical</i> significance within the genre. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:58, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The connection to Austrian politics makes it noteworthy enough, in my opinion. If it really was the first site within its genre (admittedly a niche genre, but nevertheless), that adds to its significance. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 07:56, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, based on <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> et seq.'s version. I note that the site isn't defunct because the creator lost interest, there was a whole big thing. To my mind, that something is the first or oldest X is generally a strong argument in favor of notability. In addition, if the fact of the site was indeed a major element in a political campaign or platform, it probably received more than "passing mention" coverage of the sort mentioned at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.–<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalieber_db73.html" title="User:Calieber">♥ «Charles A.

<li><b>Keep</b>: site has historical significance for development of its genre, and arguably political history significance; it's is much improved after <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a>'s recent edits. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Henry_39b3.html" title="User:Jim Henry">Jim Henry</a> 21:31, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, it <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiant_onehead_609d.html" title="User talk:Giant onehead">appears</a> that he has left the project following a warning over <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivility</a> in another AFD. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 09:22, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Tough call, but there is a mention in a Salon story, as well as the article being more of a historical piece than one about a current site, so I think <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> isn't quite as appropriate as it could be.
