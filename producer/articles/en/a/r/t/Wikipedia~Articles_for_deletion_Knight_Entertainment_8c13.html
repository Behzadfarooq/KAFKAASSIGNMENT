<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I just made it late yeasterday, and I have yet to tell anyone about it due to the deletion ststus. I have yet to have anyone give me compelling reson why my article should not be allowed when some of the articles I have mentioned above are allowed? Most of the flash series you allow are just web sites. Knight Entertainment not only works with several differnt clients, more will be added upon the release of the 6 other projects currently in works. Those 6 were not listed because they are not a matter of fact until then. I also do not want to get accused of "promoting" them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give me a reason why the above articles were allowed to exist? If my site is an advertisement (I do not post any links to where to buy the DVD by the way. It is listed on over 30 web stores.) then the articles listed in my earlier comments are advertisments for their web sites. If there is no "stock" here, then why is there stock in articles that explain about web pages based on flash animation series? No one has dared to explain that to me. I have just as much stock if not more with an actual product.--<a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERcknight_de50.html" title="User:Rcknight">Rcknight</a> 20:23, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason is that (as explained <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Knight_entertainment_d377.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Knight entertainment">before</a>) the subject of the article is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">not notable</a> (NN). By the way your objection has been registered, there's no need to keep voting again and again. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 20:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So just making a web page is notable. (As in the examples I listed above.) But taking something in cyber space, and taking it to market in association with a variety of those notable web pages is not notable. I fail to see tha logic. Other DVD production are noted, and other flash series are noted, then why is a flash series taken to the DVD not notable? Of the 100's of flash animation, only 8 have made it to the DVD market. I am helping more to faciliate that need. --<a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERcknight_de50.html" title="User:Rcknight">Rcknight</a> 21:01, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I am still waiting for clearification on why my article is not notable, when it is more of a rare acomplishment then simply making a web page as sited articles listed above. In fact I am currently in talk with two of those flash animated series to aid them in the creation of DVD's prodcutions as well. Now if I--<a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERcknight_de50.html" title="User:Rcknight">Rcknight</a> 22:17, 3 November 2005 (UTC) were truly "promoting" or "advertising" I would have mentioned those facts, but I did not. If you are doing this just because I made it then delete it and i will have someone else create it, would that satisify your issues? I have noticed that the notion of advertisingment has not been used, but now it is a matter of not being noteable, when much more simple accomplishements have been noted. I keep stating my case because no one has yet to offer any compelling evidence to the contrary. It would take less time and effort for me to get someone to draw and create a flash series, and that would be notable. I have spent my time and efforts setting up a distribution network, DVD production editing studio, praphic arts design, and manufcaturing capaibilities to provide a cost effective way for underground series and productions a way for them to get their series to the main stream market. This is a far more complicated task then building a web site, and placing some flash animation on it. But my efforts are not notable. I still fail to see the logic in that, and have yet to hear otherwise from any of you. Then again I would doubt that any of you have a real concept of what it takes to get something to market in the mainstream media.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERcknight_de50.html" title="User:Rcknight">Rcknight</a>, lots of people here use other articles or previous decisions as precedent to stop their own advertising or non-notable pages from being deleted. It never works (in fact, it draws the attention of "deletionist" editors (like me?) and is thus counterproductive). Each Article for Deletion consideration is based on the article's own merits. The only way to avoid deletion of an article where people are generally anti is <i>not</i> to argue here, but instead to go back to the article and edit it to address the concerns. You have five days to do that between nomination and deletion, which is plenty of time to repair an article that looks like advertising or something non-notable. If it <i>is</i> either of those, you won't be able to clean it up and it <i>will</i> be deleted. If it isn't, you will easily reform the article and all will be well. But arguing - and especially arguing-by-exception - just won't work. ➨ <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">❝</a><b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">REDVERS</font></a></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redvers_11cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redvers">❞</a> 23:51, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
