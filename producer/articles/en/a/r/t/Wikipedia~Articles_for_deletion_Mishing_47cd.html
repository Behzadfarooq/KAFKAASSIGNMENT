<li><b>weak delete</b> The term pronounced "mish" is contraction of the word mission, an infrequently used slang term in the north of England. It has little importance in dialectic speech, now being used rarely and mostly amongst children of primary school age.

<li><b>KEEP IT</b>. In all seriousness, this isn't nonsense! Mishing is an actual pastime and an actual slang term used by Europeans. The article is accurate throughout and at the same time it's funny. The figures cited have a small margin of error and facts presented are indeed true.

<li>I seriously recommend that this webpage be kept. It provides an insight into a very weird (maybe wonderful?) world of a group of youths in the Liverpool Region of England. Having travelled to Ukraine on a visit to Kiev, (sorry, but i went to see the Eurovision Song Contest), I was informed of the phenomonon of "mishing". Apparently, the original three "Mishketeers", spread the phenomonon through a mutual appreciation of Liverpool Football Club with another small group of Ukrainian youths. However, in the Ukraine, mishing has more of an edge apparently. Mainly because you stand a risk of getting shot. Yours Sincerely, Bally
