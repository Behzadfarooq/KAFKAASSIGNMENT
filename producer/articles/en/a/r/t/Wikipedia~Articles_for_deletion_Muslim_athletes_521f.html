They cant included extra info, like birth date and field of proffesion, something that a article can do. I mean, take a look at <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_scholars.html" title="Islamic scholars">Islamic scholars</a>. A category will never achiev that kind of information. Further, why dont you go and delet and categories all other article here: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lists.html" title="List of lists">list of lists</a>. This is totaly unfair, why dont you take a grab att <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_jews.html" title="List of jews">List of jews</a> as well? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 04:35, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Muslim scholars is an entry way to other lists, some of which I worked on. If you want to create a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_Muslims_3b99.html" title="Category:Lists of Muslims">Category:Lists of Muslims</a> to replace it I'd be good with that. As the idea seems to be just delete Muslim lists I think this is essentially a form of bias. We have a fair amount of Muslims at Wikipedia, but not all that many so Muslim lists may not be as well-cared for. The idea that that makes them deleteworthy is silly. Or I'm way off here. Check with some at <a href="../../../m/u/s/Category%7EMuslim_Wikipedians_cc95.html" title="Category:Muslim Wikipedians">Category:Muslim Wikipedians</a> to get a sense of whether they want these or how they feel about it.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>-This is a ridiculously over the top delete effort that I think should never have happened. Even if some of these do deserve deletion there's no way all of them do. I've been here long enough that I get how intensely some hate/despise/loathe religion related lists, but they do serve a purpose. Policy on lists say lists are valid if the items are important to the topic or contributed to it in some way. To pick one I have on my watchlist, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christians_ec4d.html" title="List of Christians">List of Christians</a>, much of it is founders of several denominations too small have denominational lists of their own. Or important religious poets and missionaries of said faith. As well as being a link to other, often well made, lists. Things like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslim_scholars_2f20.html" title="List of Muslim scholars">List of Muslim scholars</a> is also clearly relevant to Islamic history. Side issue why doesn't anyone ever AfD the numerous lists that are actually stupid? (Although the original for Muslim athletes makes some sense except that I thought it was already deleted)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 06:01, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists and categories serve completely different functions. The ways that lists differ from categories include: 1) they allow the all-important redlinks, that let us know which articles still need to be written; and 2) they can be <i>annotated</i> with critical facts such as birth and death date, country of origin, single-line-summary, or whatever else might be pertinent. There is an enormous number of useful lists on Wikipedia which contain information you could never find by browsing a category. By the way I strongly suggest renaming Muslim athletes to List of Muslim athletes to be consistent. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 06:08, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> (Possibly Categorize or Paradigm Shift) Lists <i>are</i> helpful, but obviously there are many problems with incomplete research, verification, etc. Take, for example, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_atheists.html" title="List of atheists">List of atheists</a> (one I've followed more than the rest, mostly because of the volatile content constantly being edited) - first of all, there are many instances of people that are or were listed therein where the case is not particularly clear (a meandering blurb about uncertainty about the afterlife, and a ranting diatribe against organized religion, for example, do <i>not</i> necessarily indicate that the speaker is an atheist) and further, there seems to be a bit of confusion as to what constitutes a "major" atheist (usually an outspoken one who has made contributions to the cause). In short, there are too many false conclusions and misunderstandings, and not enough verification. <a href="../../../o/t/h/User%7EOthersider_e189.html" title="User:Othersider">Othersider</a> 07:50, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> it's fine as a list. It is useful.

<li><b>Keep</b> Though i can't see much significance in Muslim athletes but lists for muslim historians and philosophers must be kept. As for listing versus categorizing, in my opinion categorizing is better but unfortunately most people-related categories in wikipedia are very messy. Biographies are categorized according to date of birth, death, nationality, location, religion, university alumni,prizes,...etc. When categorizing an article -especially for a very notable person or someone with multi-talents- usually one or more categories are missed. However, same articles are not likely to be missed in specialized lists. Consider <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Bergson_5d10.html" title="Henri Bergson">Henri Bergson</a> as an example, a <i>Nobel laureate and not categorized in french writers or philosophers</i>!. Nevertheless, in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_people_3931.html" title="List of French people">List of French people</a>, Henri Bergson <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_people_3931.html#Philosophers" title="List of French people">appears as a french philosopher</a>. Also, as <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">User: Antandrus</a> previously stated, lists allow for red links. So, for now i support all lists.--<a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> 21:39, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hey dude. Check the history for "List of atheists" again, and very closely. Actually, I <i>did</i> remove the tag. Sorry, your "agenda" theory doesn't hold up. Removing notices "mid AFD" because they were never nominated "AFD" in the first place. Each article you nominate has to be given a separate AfD page - and you have to explain the merits of <i>each</i> nomination - and sorry, anger and want of vengeance because Muslim lists are nominated isn't good enough. It seems to be concensus that you actions here are an inappropriate violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, so I wouldn't make it worse by tampering with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>.

However, i would like to say that there was two (2) people that seriously considered voting down list of jews. Does that make it a little little little bit less bad?`</p>
<p>Ill try to trust the common sense of wikipedians a bit more in the future. I have had some ugly disputes with user:Zora over time, and since nobody seemed to care that i was right and she was wrong, i started to distrust people. I apologise. Feel free to remove any, some or all article on this AFD.</p>
<p>I also apologise for not being civil. I did brake WP:Point, but people broke the "do not remove afd tag" rule, and since people actualy did take my move seriously and voted on them, i perceived it as taken as a legit move. I would also like to point out that i added list of Jews after another user <b>suggested</b> it. That made me feel even more angry.</p>
<p>In short, a user suggested me to break wp:point, and another endorsed the inclusion. That made me confident that the move was accepted as legitimat. People trying to undo that against afd rules angered me and made me uncivil.</p>

No, im saying you are AFD lists on random basis, looks like you dont want to see lists, period.

At <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_lists_c1de.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured lists">Wikipedia:Featured lists</a> there are a few that involve religion or people. There is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Archbishops_of_Canterbury_a15c.html" title="List of Archbishops of Canterbury">List of Archbishops of Canterbury</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_popes.html" title="List of popes">List of popes</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_dd89.html" title="List of Presidents of the United States">List of Presidents of the United States</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_brain_tumor_patients.html" title="List of notable brain tumor patients">List of notable brain tumor patients</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_members_of_the_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_%28chronological%29_e786.html" title="List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame (chronological)">List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame (chronological)</a>, and a few others. There are some lists I've worked on that I think are more similar to the lists up for AfD here and are of fairly good quality. For example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Catholic_authors_b10e.html" title="List of Catholic authors">List of Catholic authors</a>.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>If this survives the request for deletion, I am at least reccomending we better organize the pages regarding Muslims. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a> page seems much better organized. Perhaps would could put all the lists onto the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html" title="List of Muslims">List of Muslims</a> page so they are much more accessible. The confusing linking structure through the current lists regarding Muslims makes the lists look like a disorganized and arbitrary. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 20:37, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We can discuss that on the talk page. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 20:55, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
