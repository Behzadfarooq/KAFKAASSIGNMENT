<dd>Since when is "a coherent reason" a requirement? Sorry to be a bit confrontational, but many of the arguments on this (and on the physics formulae afd above) can be resolved by a simple move, or even a sentence in the intro. In this case, the article could be moved to "List of formulas used to calculate pi," or the intro could be adjusted to make it more clear what the criteria for inclusion were. I definitely understand the impulse to delete, but I think it's very important to keep Wikipedia indexed. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 06:34, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Split/merge most into some other page(s)</b>. Mathematical numerical methods for approximating π are one category; physics and geometry are distinct. The former is clearly important per Gracenotes and relates (and partially restates) that section of the History page. <i>That</i> is a focused topic with clear inclusion criteria (or at least it <i>could be</i> if the intro described it as such). Maybe those parts of this page and the other one should be merged together into their own Numerical methods of approximating pi page? The physics/geometry parts of the page here see, weaker keep...more indiscriminate list-like. Area/volume/surface-area of many curvy-things involve π, what are the inclusion criteria? Appearance in relations among physical constants is a controlled class of equations, but geometry and "physics equations using it" (Coulomb's law, etc) gets less discriminating. No limit on what geometric shapes or physical relationships are included here. Coulomb's law is just a special case of inverse-squares that happens to have a constant involving π...<i>that constant</i> would be included in the "relations among physical constants". <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 09:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the more interesting things about <i>π</i> is that it figures in so many places, and equations which on their surface seem to have little to do with circles. This is a worthwhile supplement to the article on <i><a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">π</a></i> itself, and could not be merged with it without detracting from the article in chief's readability. In fact, my recommendation would be to move more equations out of the article in chief to this page. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's a small section and not inherently invalid. In fact, it's instructive to compare formulas of electromagnetism in SI and Gaussian units, to see how eliminating π in one place makes it pop up in another, like playing whack-a-mole. It could be helped by links leading to context. For example, the connection between the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the relevant theorem giving a similar relation between a function and its Fourier transform (thus the Heisenberg uncertainty principle follows automatically once you say that momentum is essentially the Fourier transform of position).--<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkOink_a997.html" title="User:OinkOink">OinkOink</a> 04:26, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> "Useful" in what way? I can understand how an article on pi, or even an article on the different ways to derive pi might be useful in understanding the constant and it's study through history. I've been trying, and I can't think of any circumstances where I'd have a use for a list of equations that included pi, just because they included pi. Unless it's doing a term paper of some sort on pi. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 03:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now.

<li>By way of addendum, since challenges have been made to a prior closing as an obvious consensus Keep, in further reviewing the article, I see useful references and links to articles about several of the formulas, a reference (more can be added), and a collection of equations that does not appear in the other pi-related articles. I also endorse the keep comments of Mets501 and DGG. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 04:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
