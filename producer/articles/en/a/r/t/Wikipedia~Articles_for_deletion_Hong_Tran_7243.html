<li><b>Delete</b> Tran seems like a talented, accomplished and admirable person, but she has no meaningful level of support or following, receiving roughly 5% of the vote in a party primary. She is a not a leader in the state of Washington. Her limited voting support seems to have been a protest against Cantwell, and not support for Tran specifically. At best, an article about Tran is of local interest, and not appropriate for Wikipedia (there is already an article about the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_United_States_Senate_election%2C_2006_94ce.html" title="Washington United States Senate election, 2006">Washington United States Senate election, 2006</a>, as well as an article about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Cantwell_801b.html" title="Maria Cantwell">Maria Cantwell</a>). --Nottingham 02:08, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep.</b> I have been the primary author of this article for the past few months. The deletion proposals seem to be in regard to the notability of the subject. Hong Tran was cited in multiple respected publications as Maria Cantwell's main challenger for the Democratic nomination, and was regarded as the standard bearer for the solidly anti-war contingent of the Democratic party in the primary. She recieved a considerable amount of press during the primary campaign, including mentions in multiple articles and one feature article in the Washington Times (in Washington, D.C.), a mention in the New York Times, articles in major newspapers throughout the state of Washington, and feature audio interviews on NPR as well as others. She received endorsements from the Democratic caucuses in four of the legislative districts in the state, including the sole endorsement in Cantwell's home district, the 32nd LD. She is the first Vietnamese-American to campaign for Senate in the state of Washington, and likely in the entire country, according to the Northwest Asian Weekly newspaper. She may continue to influence the outcome of this U.S. Senate election with her endorsement or lack of it, and any other words or actions during the general election, and she may also remain a public figure and run for another office. Hong Tran also passes the Google test, with about 16,800 hits for a search of ["hong tran" senate].</p>
<p>Both Nottingham in particular (Bobblehead as well) have put a lot of weight on the fact that Tran only got about 5% of the vote in her second-place finish in the primary. I have argued that the size of the vote alone does not determine the significance of a campaign or a candidate. Ralph Nader never even got 3% of the vote, yet was a notable presidential candidate. Neither raised or spent lots of money; both ran grassroots campaigns for the purposes of making statements about the political system, about the parties, to influence the political debate and party platforms, and to allow voters an avenue to express their conscience. Some people understand the significance of this; other people don't. I would consider a pro/con style insertion into the Hong Tran article where both sides of this could be heard (with propertly balanced language); I think this is a common way of dealing with these sorts of controversies in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the article has received <b>considerable</b> modifications (about 110 edits) since Nottingham began contributing five days ago on the morning of Sept. 19th (which also happens to be the day the primary election occurred, or the night before, in Washington state time). Bobblehead made this AfD request in response to ongoing "edit wars," mostly over was constitutes NPOV or relevant info. In response to what I consider uncivil treatment and improper edits, I have been attempting to seek neutral mediation for over the past few days. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalse_Prophet_d778.html" title="User:False Prophet">User: False Prophet</a> from the Mediation Cabal had accepted the case for mediation just prior to Bobblehead's AfD request. Assuming the AfD request ends up being evaluated, I will be posting a link here to my preferred version of the article, such that it will show some of the information and citations that have been either deleted or severely modified in the name of "NPOV", "Streamlining", significance, privacy, or any number of other reasons why this article has been trimmed. In some cases, supporting info has been trimmed away and then the original content subsequently deleted for lack of support.<a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 03:36, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Technically the AFD was submitted because the edit war was due to a question of notability of the subject. What better way to determine notability than send it through AFD? If it survives the AFD, then the subject is notable, if it doesn't survive, then the subject isn't notable. Either way, problem solved. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 06:52, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A large amount of the edit war was over disagreement over statements that were alleged NPOV problems. The article was supposedly in the process of being adjusted to better conform to NPOV, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards; I had been trying to work with Nottingham too cool off, set some ground rules, and seek mediation, while still recieving uncivil treatment such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Emcee_said_7" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Emcee_said_7" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where he says, "You have no sense of facts or standards, and you do not understand the difference between facts and opinion. . . Grow up, learn to read and learn basic academic standards." Your response to this was to put up the article for deletion, rather than noting Nottingham's uncivil statements, trying to defuse the situation, and seeking some external mediation.

<dd>And how does one characterize a 'joke candidate'? The WA Dem primary had a person named Mike the Mover that runs in whatever is the highest available position that year and another candidate whose campaign stump was the need to create habitable space stations to house the planet's growing population. Neither one of these candidates consider themseleves a 'joke candidate'. Both also get more hits via a google search than Hong Tran. Not that I think google searches are a good measure of notability or anything. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 06:23, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just because habitable space stations guy doesn't think he's a joke doesn't mean he's right! I think it's pretty clear that Hong Tran is hardly a joke candidate: she ha[s/d] a serious platform. Anyway, in the absence of a consensus policy on candidates, I think erring on the side of inclusion is pretty harmless. Indeed, the whole initiation of this debate -- Tran supporters and detractors fighting over facts about the campaign -- seems to indicate that there is more interest in Tran than, say, <a href="../../../u/s/-/US-54_a81a.html" title="US-54">US-54</a>. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 06:30, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Technically the high edit count is due to 2 overzealous editors.

<dd>The desire to group Hong Tran in with "joke" candidates like Michael Goodspaceguy Nelson and Mike the Mover is a fairly obvious stretch; I'm not sure why Bobblehead would still try to advance that theory. Someone who campaigns about the Iraq War, PATRIOT Act, free trade agreements, etc. is clearly a serious candidate compared to those whose voter pamphlet entries talk about space colonization or going to war with British Columbia, neither of which has to do with the Democratic party platform or anything else that is considered a significant issue in this election. There was also an entreaty from the Cantwell campaign to Hong Tran to have her join their campaign (which she interpreted as a job offer, based on the context of the call right after the other challenger Mark Wilson had been hired), and which all of the political commentators that I've seen have regarded as a "buy-out" offer (as they still regard the Wilson hire). This is further evidence of her political significance; I severely doubt that Cantwell offered jobs to Nelson or Mover.<a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 19:10, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also forgot to mention that Nelson and Mover both: had no campaign websites (albeit some almost uncommented blogs), reported no campaign contributions to the FEC, made no campaign appearances, gave no interviews, and had no feature articles on them in the press (local or national).

<dd><b>Comment</b> You earlier talked about Tran's "detractors". Who are her "detractors"? Who has made negative statements about Tran? I have expressed no opposition to her as a person. You now talk about "strong POVs". I do have a POV that she is "a talented, accomplished and admirable person" (I said that at the top of this page). I have never made any edits that say that she is not talented or lacks the ability to succeed in government. That isn't the issue. The issue is that she clearly isn't notable. She lost in a party primary in a landslide, by more than 85% of the vote. There is no evidence that she had special or unique support -- even the newspaper quote of a local Democrat who gave her a shared endorsement was "it wasn't a slap against Cantwell, but also it was kind of a feel-good vote, in that at least (people thought) 'I've said something about what's going on in Iraq' and stuff. It wasn't even about 'we shouldn't be there' but rather about how (the war) has been handled."! Notice that he didn't even mention anything about Tran. Tran's own campaign web site does even appear to have been updated since several weeks before the primary vote. She isn't a leader of the anti-Iraq War movement in the Democratic party. She simply filled the role of "not Cantwell" in the primary, and even in that role she barely received 5% of the vote. --Nottingham 20:50, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your continual references to Tran supporters as being in bad faith, being biased, being agenda-driven, &amp;c. &amp;c., and references to Tran as "not a serious candidate", "not the preferred candidate of WA voters", led me to believe you had a dog in the fight. I apologize for not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>. While I'm hardly an "inclusionist" when it comes to AfD (check my edits), I confess I am surprised that, instead of trying to resolve differences, you continually revert other editors (who are hardly blameless, of course), and then push to delete the entire article. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 20:55, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would agree that a lot of Nottingham's criticisms have been directed at me, even more than Hong Tran, and that the edit war seemed to be as much about winning/losing as it was about the interests of Wikipedia and its articles. I am not an innocent party to the edit war, but I don't think this is an appropriate direction for the dispute (as I mentioned, I was trying to seek mediation and defuse this). I do believe Nottingham's edits and deletions in the article themself evidence a strong POV, even if it was founded in something other than an evaluation of the candidate. Examples: adding, "Tran has not identified any Democratic candidates who are more electable than Cantwell, who won the Democratic primary with an overwhelming majority of 91% of the vote."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77225789" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77225789" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>; "Nevertheless, Democratic voters supported Cantwell overwhelmingly in the primary, with Cantwell receiving 91% of the vote, and Tran receiving less than 5%."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77262197" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77262197" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>; and repeatedly deleting the info box and date of birth, on the justification that is was necessary to protect the candidate's (and her husband's) privacy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77536548" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77536548" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77535455" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77535455" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> which had Nottingham edit summaries as follows:</dd>
<dd>"(Info box is repeated in bio. Should her husband, who to my knowledge is not a public figure, have his name listed on Wikipedia?)"</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> You said "I don't know what else to say about that." It seems that what you should be saying is "I'm sorry, I didn't know Wikipedia policy". From Wikipedia's own guidelines: "Wikipedia includes exact birthdates for some famous people, but including this information for most living people should be handled with caution. While many well-known living persons' exact birthdays are widely known and available to the public, the same is not always true for marginally notable people or non-public figures. With identity theft on the rise, it has become increasingly common for people to consider their exact date of birth to be private information. When in doubt about the notability of the person in question, or if the subject of a biography complains about the publication of his or her date of birth, err on the side of caution and simply list the year of birth rather than the exact date." See <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biographies_of_living_persons.html" title="Biographies of living persons">Biographies of living persons</a>. I had suggested that just Tran's age was appropriate instead of her birthday. That suggestion is in line with Wikipedia policy. You appear to make light of the issue of potential identity theft. However, I agree with Wikipedia's guidelines on this matter, and I follow them. Regardless, this has nothing to do with the AfD, although it is another example of how you ignore Wikipedia guidelines. --Nottingham 21:39, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I mentioned in the talk or edit summary, DOB is on the public secretary of state election filings, her husband's name is on the current campaign web page. Both are on this older campaign page:<a href="http://www.campaignsitebuilder.com/templates/displayfiles/tmpl26.asp?SiteID=1096&amp;PageID=17570&amp;Trial=false" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.campaignsitebuilder.com/templates/displayfiles/tmpl26.asp?SiteID=1096&amp;PageID=17570&amp;Trial=false" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Political candidates make themselves public figures and a lot of information is known about them. The reason I mentioned this is because the edit war that birthed this AfD has become relevant to the AfD debate itself, but I will agree to leave it to the interested reviewers to take a look at the edit history and talk page for the article in question from here on out.<a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 21:53, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The irony is amusing, as The Washington Times is a very conservative paper that likes tweaking Democrats (just like some liberal media like tweaking Republicans) by trying to create news when there is none. Regardless, The Washington Times article in question is the only article that has multiple references to Tran that appeared in a newspaper published outside the state of Washington. However, the article mentions nothing unique or notable about Tran except that her claim that she was not being treated fairly by the state and national Democratic parties, and that Tran is opposed to the Iraq War. The article even claims that voters for Tran appear to be making protest votes against Cantwell by voting for Tran, i.e., not voting for Tran because of Tran's own qualities. "But several voters here said they will issue a "protest" vote for Mrs. Tran, a lawyer with a nonprofit agency, to send a message they are frustrated with their senator." There already are Wikipedia articles on the election and on Cantwell. There is nothing notable about Tran that merits a Wikipedia article. --Nottingham 21:49, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

Yes, as that NY Times article had TWO instances of the name "Tran" in it, even though the article isn't about Tran (it was published BEFORE the primary, yet it was all about Cantwell's pending race with McGavick). I suppose my comment "The Washington Times article in question is the only article that has <b>multiple</b> references to Tran" should be modified slightly.

<dd>There are about half a dozen articles on the primary, all of which mention Tran prominently. BTW, it appears that the anti-war movement in WA supported a guy called Wilson more than Tran -- I guess we should expect a fight to delete him as well? <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 21:21, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Rebecca was trying to advise him on his multiple reversions on this article; Snottygobble was attempting to advise him about personal attacks on Rebecca and then on himself, after which Nottingham blanked his own talk page and then Snottygobble blocked him. Nottingham had made the most edits to this article in the last several days, and was a prime motivator for this AfD nomination. In my opinion, this supports my argument that this article/edit war should have been in a mediation process rather than submitted to AfD, and should be kept rather than deleted.<a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 08:41, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This page has become absurd. Bobblehead nominated the article for deletion, not me. Emcee has made many edits to the article in question for several weeks. Emcee has turned this page (the AfD) into a vendetta against me (not that it matters much, after all, it is just an Internet discussion with people who don't know each other). Emcee has carried on and on and on, including hearsay and false accusations of personal attacks, to the point where he/she has created the false impression that I started the AfD when in fact all I did was write a comment. Period. That's it. One comment. It was only after numerous comments by several people back and forth that I offered responses. Absurdity. This page is about deleting a page about a person who lost by more than 85% of the vote in a political primary, about whom there is nothing noteworthy, and it is a situation where the election itself has a page that references the person. This page is not about me, it is not about Emcee, it is not about Bobblehead. It is an AfD for the Hong Tran entry started by Bobblehead. That's all this page is for. I have made it clear on this page and the Tran entry and its Talk page that I respect Tran's talents, accomplishments, and character. However, those are not the issue. The issue is notability, and Tran is simply not notable. Incidentally, the Tran page itself as Emcee has edited it violates the spirit and arguably the strict letter of Wikipedia's own guidelines by revealing DOB and spouse's name. No one on this page even seemed to care about the privacy and safety of Tran or her husband, even though Wikipedia explicitly mentions this in its guidelines. But, there are far greater tragedies in the world that the existence of a article on a non-notable person.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I will leave it up to any interested readers to take a look at Nottingham's talk page (make sure to view the history, since he has already partially or completely blanked it in 3 times in recent days, including twice since his block was ended) and the edit history/talk page of the Hong Tran article where he encouraged deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Nottingham_said_2" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Nottingham_said_2" rel="nofollow">on Sept 22</a> and immediately prior to the edit-war-motivated request on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Emcee_said_7" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Emcee_said_7" rel="nofollow">Sept 25</a>. I never said that he submitted the AfD nomination himself, but that he was (I quote), "a prime motivator for this AfD nomination." I agree with Dennisthe2 that this history is a mess, and I assume most people don't have the time to dig through it all. I cited Nottingham's recent block and surrounding behavior because I believe it is a quick way for reviewers assess the credibility of his arguments. I would also like to note that although he is now restraining himself from direct personal attacks on others, I have witnessed no remorse for his previous actions, and the sarcasm that remains in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASnottygobble&amp;diff=78128219&amp;oldid=77832566#Hello.2C_my_friend" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASnottygobble&amp;diff=78128219&amp;oldid=77832566#Hello.2C_my_friend" rel="nofollow">his communications</a> with longstanding user and admin Snottygobble I do not believe are in line with community standards of respectful communication. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 00:16, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My concurrence was that the history of the Hong Tran article was a mess, due to the edit war. It was heavily redacted during the days leading up to the AfD request, which made it difficult for people to see what the article actually consisted of, and how much press she had gotten. I'm sure it's also difficult for people to sort through all the issues of the edit war itself, which is why it should have been in mediation instead. If you were saying something different than that, then I don't concur. I certainly don't concur with Nottingham's analysis of what you wrote -- just because you said you didn't have all the facts, I didn't conclude that you thought I had given inaccurate information. If you do, please specify, because I believe that everything I have said is accurate. I'm not dealing with Nottingham's allegations anymore at this point because I don't feel it is productive; I would be surprised if anyone who views his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nottingham&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nottingham&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">talk page history</a>, with it's repeated blanking of admin comments, would give his allegations any credit at this point. My contention was and is that this AfD never should have been nominated in the first place, because it was an edit war issue. In that sense, I agree with your second opinion (the switch to Strong Keep, because it is an edit war issue). I think it is appropriate for the AfD to end, as long as the article is kept; but there is no reason why another one should be started. I would expect that a second AfD would have similar results anyway. I also think that this AfD has shown that there is a significant number of people who think that Hong Tran has sufficent notability to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which is the technical basis upon which Bobblehead was submitting it, even if the practical purpose was to end the edit war. Anyhow, it seems that the whole purpose of AfD (since we are in the process, regardless of whether it was proper or not) is to reach consensus. I will propose <b>Keep</b>, with a scheduled re-evaluation after the Nov. 2008 U.S. Congressional elections. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 06:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

You appear obsessed with me, and I am raising complaints with Wikipedia about your Wikipedia stalking of me.

<li>It should be noted that regardless of an edit war over the article (which Emcee is as much to blame for as Nottingham) the AFD submission was about the lack of notability for Hong Tran outside of the Senate race. It should also be pointed out that the content in the Senate race portion of Tran's article is already covered in the Senate Race article and if that duplication is removed, there's nothing even remotely notable about her. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWashington_United_States_Senate_election%2C_2006&amp;diff=76799914&amp;oldid=76712383" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWashington_United_States_Senate_election%2C_2006&amp;diff=76799914&amp;oldid=76712383" rel="nofollow">proposed</a> on the Washington Senate race talk page prior to the start of the edit war that the article (and that of the other primary losers) be either turned into redirects to the Senate race or submitted for AFD. I'm also curious of the opinion of othes on how better to handle a content dispute that is based solely on the notability of the article subject than to send it through AFD? This isn't the first time an AFD has been sent through in the midst of an edit war and many of them have been deleted at the end of the AFD. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 16:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Emcee keeps making an AfD about the Hong Tran entry a discussion about me (Nottingham). That has grossly tainted the AfD process -- after Emcee's repeated mentioning of my name, a few comments came in as Keep that implicitly or explicitly mentioned me, clear evidence that the AfD process has been tainted by Emcee's repeated discussion of me on this page instead of the merits of the AfD subject itself. --Nottingham 12:15, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that Dennisthe2, who seems to be an active and neutral Wikipedia observer, has the right idea. Simply start a new AfD fresh. I will gladly not participate other than reprinting my original comment (see top of page; in brief, Hong Tran seems to be talented, accomplished, and admirable, but not notable and therefore the AfD should be deleted and redirected to the election entry). I suggest that Emcee participate in a new AfD without mentioning me at all. If Emcee would like to write 25 paragraphs on the new AfD, as long as they don't mention me, then he/she should do so. I told Dennisthe2 I had no concern with how he/she voted before and during his vote changes. That is clear public record. Nevertheless, I suggest to Emcee that Emcee should show more respect to Dennisthe2 and to other Wikipedia community members by treating the AfD as an AfD, and not make misleading comments about any person's stance to Keep, Delete or Abstain. Emcee is welcome, as far as I am concerned, to start a Wikipedia entry called "Why Nottingham is a Bad Person" or to put such entries on my User Page. I have no quarrel with that. However, I do not understand why Emcee has taken it up him/herself to apparently misrepresent Dennisthe2's opinion. Dennisthe2 has said his choice is Abstain. If he chooses to make his opinion known as Keep or Delete, I am sure he will do that. However, it seems inaccurate and misleading for anyone to quote his prior opinions of Delete and Keep. --Nottingham 12:15, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what benefit would come from an immediate restart of the AFD process. The mess that this AFD became is still fresh in the involved parties' minds and a restart will only extend the agony. I'm content to let this AFD run it's course (and probably end up in no consensus) and wait until after the November election to send it through AFD again. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 16:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't appear that most people evaluated this AfD based on the edit war or Nottingham's actions anyway. The only "Keepers" who even mentioned it are Roninbk (who mainly addressed the media coverage), and Sdedeo (who wasn't even addressing it in his initial "Keep" analysis). If anything, the edit war only biased reviewers unfairly against the article, as the first several viewers only got to see it in its highly redacted state (before Rebecca reverted it back to a semi-complete version). The last several reviewers all gave a "Keep" rating. Personally, I think re-sending through AfD in November would be an abuse of the deletion process; I'll leave it to the closing admin to weigh in on this. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 17:21, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Once again, Emcee continues in personal attacks on me, instead of discussing the AfD. Emcee talked about "Nottingham's actions anyway".

He/she consistently violates the spirit and letter of the Wikipedia guidelines with constant attacks on me on this page, and for turning an AfD into an attack page against me. --Nottingham 13:31, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I just want to point out Nottingham's use of the term NPOV above. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is a policy that applies to WP articles. Talk pages, AfDs, etc. are places where we express our own viewpoints on the article content and related issues. Saying that my contributions to an AfD page are non-NPOV is meaningless. Furthermore, I am absolutely not issuing any personal attacks against Nottingham; I have noted specific instances of uncivility and his blocks, and pointed people to his writings on various talk pages so that they can review them for themselves to help evaluate the credibility of his arguments. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 16:28, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> What are you talking about? NPOV is a common abbreviation that has nothing to do with Wikipedia. Wikipedia uses NPOV in the context of its guidelines. Regardless, Emcee has repeatedly made false, non-NPOV accusations against me up and down this page. Instead of it being an AfD, it has become Emcee's diatribe against me. Emcee has not stopped stalking me all over Wikipedia, and leaving messages all over Wikipedia about me. It is sad and pitiful. I offered a solution that Emcee start a page with a title such as "Reasons Why Nottingham is a Bad Person". Instead, Emcee persists in posting non-NPOV attacks on me instead of letting the AfD be an AfD. If this AfD is "Keep", then there should be another one, as per the suggestions above, right afterwards that should not include Emcee's editorializing about me and attacks on me. I am not the subject, the Tran article is. If the AfD is "Delete", then obviously there is no need for another AfD. --Nottingham 20:12, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
