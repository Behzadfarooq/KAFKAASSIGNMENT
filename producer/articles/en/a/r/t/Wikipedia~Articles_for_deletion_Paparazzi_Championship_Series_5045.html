<li><b>Comment</b> I've suggested on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Professional_wrestling#Episodic_style_articles_for_wrestling_shows.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Professional_wrestling#Episodic_style_articles_for_wrestling_shows.3F" rel="nofollow">WikiProject Professional wrestling talk page</a> that it would be a good idea to look at possible ways to provide some sort of episodic information on wrestling shows in general. Possibilities might range from year-in-review or month-in-review style articles to articles focussing on multi-week storylines (like this one). The hope is to find a way to provide episodic information for wrestling shows similar to episodic information for other television series, but without getting into match-by-match or show-by-show details. Whether or not this article is kept in the short term, in the long term I think it would be prudent to find some consensus on how to handle this sort of information to bring wrestling show plotlines and other television show plot lines closer together in how they are presented. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:44, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, one more thing. The reason to possibly keep would be because it is essentially a multi-episode synopsis of a notable television series. Since individual episode articles about notable television series appear to be generally accepted, you can reasonably argue that wrestling shows are essentially the same thing (only with more episodes per year). The flip side is that you might also argue that many of the episode articles for <i>other</i> types of television series should be deleted too. Either way, the main issue is one of being somewhat consistent in approaching how and what information about a television series to include in Wikipedia, and for wrestling shows what might eb a good, maintainable way to provide some of this sort of information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This was undoubtably talked about TNA angles done. You could also consider to the point of TNA's internet phenominom, as I'm sure if you look through Youtube files they are the most watched TNA segments. These skits will be talked about for years to come. Whenever Kevin Nash is brought up, people will remember his rise when he signed with WCW but his huge fall when he returned to WWE. However, Nash actually winning the fans back so late in his career will always be thought of. The PCS challenge specifically. And that is far, far more important that many tournaments listed. Besides, it's just plain fun! Why do you have to ruin it for others?Crispen Raw 06:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. As per the deletion of Smackdown Sprint, the PCS isn't that notable. Just because wrestling fans like it, doesn't mean it's notable enough for wiki. Put it on a wrestling wikipedia. Do you realize, if Wikipedia had every wrestling thing you liked on it... it would be flooded?

<li><b>Comment</b> The majority of the votes to keep have been ridiculous, unfounded, and based solely in opinion. Whether or not one enjoys TNA has absolutely no basis on whether or not this article should be deleted. Further, precedent (i.e., Smackdown! Sprint) clearly indicates that this and similar articles should be removed. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 00:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>To quote one of the policies, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_can_change_4d99.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus can change">Consensus can change</a>. While precedent is useful, there is a larger open question of handling articles regarding episodes and stories in television shows of <i>all</i> types. Some editors favor greatly reducing the amount of episodic information for all shows, while others apparently want additional storyline information available for certain types of shows such as wrestling shows, soap operas and reality shows. It's possible (or at least hopeful) that in the long term a reasonable consensus can be reached on handling information for all TV series across the board, and that the consensus will be to allow some (but not all) articles about plot lines or linked-episodes for regular weekly serials.</dd>
<dd>So personally I see this afd as a short term debate. Regardless of whether or not this article is kept, in the long term we'll probably need some more thorough guidelines for handling episodes, etc. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>: The reasoning for deletion is invalid. The "Smackdown Sprint" was just a series of matches to determine a number one contender. This was more of a tournament, albeit a very unusual one (which might warrant its presence alone). It was obviously more than just a storyline (like other tournaments), involved multiple pop culture and professional wrestling references, and will likely return in future years due to the positive response it has received. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContagiousTruth_ff41.html" title="User:ContagiousTruth">Clint</a> 23:12, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: While a lot of the keep responses seem to be "I like it", some make logical cases. Likewise, several of the delete responses are either "per nom" (for a description that includes a terrible comparison, imo), as well as an argument of non-notability. Notability here seems to be very subjective, as in the majority opinion it is notable, but there are a significant number of people arguing the contrary, with no real evidence either way. I think a bigger problem is establishing what qualifies as notable and why.... <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContagiousTruth_ff41.html" title="User:ContagiousTruth">Clint</a> 23:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Strong Keep: Keep it. It was a fun touranment and was very enjoyable to watch. It wasn't just wrestling. It was part comedy too and most wrestling fans enjoyed it, so that's all that matters right?</p>
