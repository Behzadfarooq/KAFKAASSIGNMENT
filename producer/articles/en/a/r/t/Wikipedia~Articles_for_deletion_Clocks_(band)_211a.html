<li><b>Comment</b> to all of above links and points. As I have said before, they haven't actually released anything yet have they? Yes, they may be signed to Island. Yes, that producer may be working with them at the moment â€“ but the point is, they haven't come out with anything tangible yet. All the links you provide are inconclusive or trivial (i.e. brief mentions, e.g. the BBC website mention). Do you have a link to the XFM playlist? As I say, if I could actually find anything that would equate to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> <b>and</b> they had released an album already, it would be a slightly different story. At present, they are an up-and-coming band. They will either attain the heights of notability or disappear without releasing a thing, such is the whim of the music industry. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">HoTep</a> 16:13, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes they have released something. If you would have read the article properly you would have seen that they released their debut single 'That Much Better' on 14th August 2006 and was available in major records shops <a href="http://www.roughtrade.com/site/shop_detail.lasso?search_type=sku&amp;sku=274432" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roughtrade.com/site/shop_detail.lasso?search_type=sku&amp;sku=274432" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> --Alexffc 16:43, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I did read it, thank you. And I read <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> where it says two <b>albums</b>.

<ul>
<li>I accept that point. How about the point mentioned above per item (3): "Has gone on a...<b>national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in reliable sources</b>." The band have already gone on one of these reported in many gig listing websites, and plan to go on another major tour of the UK in January/Febuary of this year <a href="http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/91677/Clocks.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/91677/Clocks.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=bandprofile.listAllShows&amp;friendid=92591312&amp;n=Clocks" class="external autonumber" title="http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=bandprofile.listAllShows&amp;friendid=92591312&amp;n=Clocks" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Would that warrant the article to be kept?--Alexffc 17:01, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would dispute that the tour already undergone is a national one. And, again, Wikipedia not being a crystal ball, articles which attest to its future notability are not acceptable. Besides, all the criterion at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> are extra to the central criterion which it must fulfill first.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> without prejudice to re-creation in a month or two. I would be minded to call to keep if there were <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for some of the claims made. Anyone can put their gigs on a website; a review in a publication such as the <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a> or a local newspaper (and Birmingham101.com is not a newspaper) would be far more persuasive. Similarly for entry on the Xfm playlist (which may or may not pass muster as <i>rotation</i> on a <i>national</i> station per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> - this is arguably spot plays on a London station.) Complete the tour, get a couple of published reviews, release a major-label single, and come back. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 18:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have found an article <a href="http://www.epsomguardian.co.uk/display.var.989197.0.0.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.epsomguardian.co.uk/display.var.989197.0.0.php" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> about Clocks published by the Epsom Guardian both in print and online which mentions the headline UK national tour last year (which was extremely similar to the UK national tour Clocks are about to embark on at the end of this month<a href="http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/91677/Clocks.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/91677/Clocks.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>) amongst other things. I do agree with your points but those things are extremely likely to happen in the near future with a tour coming up, songs being recorded and released, and the record company beginning a marketing campaign for the band which would probably include lots of published reviews and articles.--Alexffc 21:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I think people are falling into the trap of thinking that all possible information to verify a claim is available online. It isn't. If you were to go and read through the past few issues of the <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a> and those around October/November 2006, this debate would be settled immediately. Anyhow, I've found yet another reliable online source which is an interview with John Cornfield, which verifies <b>both</b> the signing to Island and the recording sessions with him <a href="http://www.sydec.be/Applications/InFocus/Articles/ID/f9eccd98-2f3a-44b6-b964-1cbdcf40d4ed/John+Cornfield+-+Sawmills+Recording+Studio/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sydec.be/Applications/InFocus/Articles/ID/f9eccd98-2f3a-44b6-b964-1cbdcf40d4ed/John+Cornfield+-+Sawmills+Recording+Studio/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <i>(look to the last paragraph of this interview)</i> (as does the link to his profile on his management's website <a href="http://www.dangerousmanagement.com/index.php?action=prod&amp;id=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dangerousmanagement.com/index.php?action=prod&amp;id=1" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>). <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">Jdwhite</a> 23:37, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just to clarify my stance, however, I feel the notability claim is justified from clause (3) of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines for touring and that the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Records_88d9.html" title="Island Records">Island Records</a> signing and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cornfield_35e0.html" title="John Cornfield">John Cornfield</a> sessions are supplimentary (although all-the-more reason to take the touring sources as credible and noteworthy). <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">Jdwhite</a> 03:09, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Jdwhite states that there has been non-trivial coverage in the NME. This is a reliable source, so is the Epsom Guardian. Adding details of these works <i>to the article</i> would be a significant help, as the onus of proof is on the person wishing to insert the information. That things are "extremely likely" to happen is insufficient to pass <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 11:23, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I've found audio from the <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibson.html" title="Gibson">Gibson</a> Guitars Promo Gig which includes a brief profile, short interview with the band and a clip of the single <a href="http://podcasts.aloud.com/aloud/aloud-podcast-003.mp3" class="external autonumber" title="http://podcasts.aloud.com/aloud/aloud-podcast-003.mp3" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> (near the end)--Alexffc 09:41, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I have spent some time collating points from this page and organising the Clocks (band) article, and I have cited references for most. This includes (most relevant to this debate) <b>verifiable sources</b> on the first <b>National UK tour</b> (in November 2006), <b>which is sufficient to fulfil the third criterion of notability for musical ensembles</b>. Also included are verifiable references for the band's signing to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Records_88d9.html" title="Island Records">Island Records</a> on a major record deal, the second UK tour, the current recording sessions with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cornfield_35e0.html" title="John Cornfield">John Cornfield</a>, together with information on notable gigs and interesting trivia/external links. <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">Jdwhite</a> 04:21, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, national tour, major label contract, media reviews in USA Today... i'm utterly stunned this is on afd. Clearly the nominator has never actually read <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and didnt even bother to do a simple google before nominating. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">â„¢</a> <span style="font-size:130%; background:yellow; border:1px solid black;">â˜¢</span> 20:58, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Are you referring to the USA Today blog where it is mentioned in a list (as obscure)? It isn't a review, unless I'm being incredibly stupid, please correct me.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hotep</a> 21:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The debate over whether the USAToday.com reference is a review or not (which it isn't) is largely academic since the article must surely qualify for inclusion by virtue of national touring <b>at the very least</b>. In any case, I believe 'Obscure' in context on an American journalist's article shouldn't be taken literally; presumably the entries for <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Pretty_Things_1c22.html" title="Dirty Pretty Things">Dirty Pretty Things</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Coxon_52ea.html" title="Graham Coxon">Graham Coxon</a> are included in his definition of 'obscure', as they are not widely known in the US. They are big players in the UK music scene. <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">Jdwhite</a> 21:50, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>OK, I'm from the UK, first of all. Second of all, you have done some great work to this article, I must admit. Thirdly, I'm still not convinced, but February, when the <i>real</i> tour (alledgedly) starts is not far away by which time the band <i>will</i> be notable beyond a doubt. Fourthly, I am becoming more and more ambivalent towards this article. I wish you luck.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hotep</a> 22:08, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
