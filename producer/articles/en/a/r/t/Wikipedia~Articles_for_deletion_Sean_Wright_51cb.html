<li>Taxman, after doing a bit of research into the guy I've found out that he is forever destined to be a smalltime self-publisher (about 2,500 copies in a printrun) with literary delusions. Constantly comparing himself to Michael Moorcock, Clive Barker, Stephen King, and JK Rowling, when it's obvious that a two year old's scribblings make more sense. He also writes reviews of his own books on the Amazon sites and spams book forums under numerous guises. His writing needs work, by the way. And bandages. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnor_Wolf_efa1.html" title="User:Connor Wolf">Connor Wolf</a> 11:07, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hang on a minute! This is a joke. This guy Connor Wolf started the Sean Wright Wikipedia page. Check out the history. He started it with all kinds of crap about Sean Wright. He continiues to hound Mr Wright, paw over his every word on his website. The guys an internet stalker. Amazingly, his buddy John Self (so called reviewer) not only continue to hound unprovoke Mr Wright, but they've started a hate campaign via <a href="http://www.jessejameson.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://www.jessejameson.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jessejameson.blogspot.com</a> and <a href="http://www.crapauthors.com" class="external free" title="http://www.crapauthors.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crapauthors.com</a>. This call for a deletion from two unstable characters such as Connor Wolf (Dave Briggs of Ely) and John Self (John Simpson from Belfast)who also run another <a href="http://www.palimpsest.org.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.palimpsest.org.uk" rel="nofollow">hate-filled and prejudice site</a> is highly questionable at best and just simply wrong at worst. Again, the facts are clear. Look at the history on wikipedia regarding this so-called deletion. Connor Wolf bagan this. Look at the other crap he has spouted about any reputable author connected with Sean Wright and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crowswing_Books_11b6.html" title="Crowswing Books">Crowswing Books</a>. This guys (John and Connor) are duping you. They spread shit wherever they can. Check them out!<br />
<br />
If this article is deleted (along with all the others that Connor Wolf is attempting delete in connection to Sean Wright and Crowswing) then the admin guys and girls are condoning a prejudice, dirty tricks campaign that began on Palimpsest.org.uk 21 months ago! These two guys need deleting from Wikipedia, not Sean Wright and Crowswing Books, or any other legitimate author connected with Crowswing. For God sake check out the facts!!! Wikipedia's reputation depends on it. The following authors are involved with Crowswing Books (who are NOT a vanity publisher, far from it). Many of these authors have long and notable publishing careers. Allen Ashley, Andrew Hook, Michael Mirolla, Gary Moeser, Lisa DuMond, Gary McMahon, Che Ballard, Jeff Gardiner, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Mills_3f04.html" title="Sam Mills">Sam Mills</a>, P. Grey, Sian Orthello, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Joyce_b28a.html" title="Graham Joyce">Graham Joyce</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Lane_490b.html" title="Joel Lane">Joel Lane</a>, John L.

If you take the time to check out these authors you WILL find that many have been nominated or won the World Fantasy Award, British Fantasy Award, or International Horror Guild Award. These are legitimate, reputable, verifiable awards. Do a bit of research - in the name of sanity and fair play.</li>

<li>Unsigned user above: If you were to look at the history of this page you will see that I did not create it at all. You are accusing me of being someone else, which is fine, but you should stick to the discussion at hand. This article is a vanity piece created from an unregistered user and all the other articles related to it also since they are promotional and not informative. I've taken a look into the authors you mention and the only one of any note was Ramsey Campbell, whom you have not published. Having explored the BFS site it appears to be nothing more than a hive for backslapping on ill-conceived fiction. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnor_Wolf_efa1.html" title="User:Connor Wolf">Connor Wolf</a> 22:00, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Considering YOU - Connor Wolf - began the Sean Wright page on Wikipedia, I find your argument rather hollow and confused. As can be seen from the list of edits and discussions, this article has developed in the spirit of neutrality. Check out the ealiest history to see that it was so. Connor Wolf lies through his canine teeth. Here's Connor's first attempted, referring EVERY review of Sean Wright's books over to one site - his site!!! at Palimpsest.org.uk [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sean_Wright&amp;oldid=21237683" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sean_Wright&amp;oldid=21237683" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><br />

<li>Unsigned user above: (who is, most likely, [Sean Wright]]) I <i>don't</i> have a site and I did not create this page; only edited it. So, for the last time, I am not the person you think I am. Believe me, I've read those reviews and - having only had experience of Jaarfindor - I can wholeheartedly agree with the people who wrote them. Try to understand, however, that although that site may have a campaign against you, Connor Wolf is not a member of it. Believe me, your writing is <i>that</i> bad that it's not unlikely other people will begin to question why you bother, like I did. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnor_Wolf_efa1.html" title="User:Connor Wolf">Connor Wolf</a> 08:17, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

He has also been caught, contrary to the Wikipedia rules, editing his own profile to make himself sound better than the reality.</p>
