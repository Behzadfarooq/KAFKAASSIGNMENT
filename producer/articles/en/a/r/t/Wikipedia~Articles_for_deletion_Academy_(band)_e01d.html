<p>Speedied as failing to assert notability, but contested. There seems to be a shortage of verifiable information, according to the author, who describes the band as "obscure". No vote. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 21:41, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are plenty of obscure topics worthy of encyclopediac articles, and I think this is one. <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_9f83.html" title="RCA">RCA</a> recording artist, that meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> by my estimation. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 21:58, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Parsssseltongue. Dekar 22:02, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is a guideline, not a policy (bwah!), and is moot any way since the article (including RCA label claim) fails actual non-negotiable policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The article itself acknowledges the obscurity and lack of information - And sorry, but this is unacceptable for an encyclopedia: <i>Little else is known about them aside from the fact that one song (their "Keep Quiet" one) carries with it alternate songwriting credits (usually the writing was credited to the band as a whole), crediting N. Fogarty, A. Briscoe, and S. Mayers. The aforementioned three are probably members of the band considering all of the band's material was self-written, but full names are completely unknown at this time. Further information is greatly appreciated.</i> Wikipedia is not a 80s music fanclub bulletin board <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:21, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, this isn't "a (sic) 80s music fanclub bulletin board", but <a href="http://www.nwoutpost.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=15195" class="external text" title="http://www.nwoutpost.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=15195" rel="nofollow">the board this thread comes from</a> is certainly one, and we have at least one person expressing an interest in having access to this information. Also, as I state in the aforelinked thread, there was that one other editor who was able to step in and provide a discography, so there IS some interest. May I also remind you that in the early - mid '80s, one album's worth of material could be as little as eight songs? Seeing as though the band recorded a total of six singles (which equals out to at least twelve songs as per the traditional definition of a single), the minimal total output of this band of 12 songs would equal out to one traditional eight-song album and one four-song mini-album.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I wouldn't create an article for another group I'm a fan of, Language, because I know they only recorded a five-song EP and released a couple of singles. That's a minimal total of seven songs, not enough to comprise a pre-CD era album. I might create one for the songwriter/leader of the group, Steven Hale, because of his involvement with other groups (including one whose lead singer, Debbie King, was Gang Of Four lead singer Jon King's sister), but I recognize that an article on Language wouldn't go anywhere. This isn't the case with Academy. I will be eliciting information and assistance from other, TRUE "80s music fanclub bulletin boards" (BTW, on a fansite forum community, people don't discuss groups in such a cut-and-dry manner), and I am confident I can get the required assistance. The article was deleted just one day after it was created. Give it (and me) some time to gather information. If you see the same information on it after a month, then feel free to say, "Ha, see? You couldn't gather up the proper amount of information, even after calling out the cavalry. NOW we can talk about deleting the article." But as for now, I say it deserves to have a stay of execution at the very least.

<li><b>Delete</b>: information seems correct, but fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. You have to do enough research first to show that the band is important enough to meet our guidelines, and then you can create the article. If you find such info, you can always come back and recreate it. If you have a good idea of what you'll find, but just need the source, then tell us. For now, it seems like you are only hoping that they <i>may</i> be more notable than it seems. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 05:01, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Might require some editing to conform writing standards, but to me seems to be ok as far <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is concerned. Released equivalent of 2 albums on major label. Probably also toured the UK, but I cannot confirm this. Information is very sparse. Wikipedia has heaps of articles on obscure topics. Brambo 09:13, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> due to lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. I tried searching for sources during the DRV and found nothing, though the word 'Academy' throws up a lot of false positives which makes it harder. Those interested in the subject may have better luck finding sources, which is why deletion of this article should not prejudice a sourced version. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 18:28, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
