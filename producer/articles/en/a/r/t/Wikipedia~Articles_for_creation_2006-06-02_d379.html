<p>At the young age of 5, Taylor Goot learned that he had a special ability for helping others. He began his infamous medical career at this early stage in his life when he saved his 10 year old brother, Trevor, from drowning and performed CPR that saved the youngster from certain death. Ever since, Taylor has devoted his life to the study of medicine and at 21 he became the youngest OB-GYN in the United States.</p>
<p>Taylor practiced medicine ever since graduation from Texas State Medical School and after winning the Nobel Prize for Astrophysics in 1998, 2 Purple Hearts, and an Academy Award for his original screenplay "Dr. Taylor I Am", he published his memories entitled "The Man Behind the Thin Layer of Flesh and Many tiny little Blood Vessels, Nerves, and Muscles" which immediately soared to the top of Oprah Winfrey's Book Club Best Seller List.</p>
<p>Dr. Taylor Goot retired from medical practice in early 2006 to spend his leisure time with his two live in life partners, Derek and Callie. He currently stays very active as president of N.A.T.O (National Anatomy Trading Organization) and Historian of M.E.N. with H.E.R.P.E.S. (Men that Encourage Nutrition with Healthy Eating are Responsibly Protecting Earth's Species).</p>

<p>Boxo is ground-breaking game that combines all the joys of childhood, but puts it into a setting that even adults can enjoy. The game requires a room in which little light can enter (basements are preferred.) Also needed are enough boxes to create forts within the room. To an extent, the boxes should convert the room practically into a maze. A standard basement may require anywhere between 150-200 boxes. The second requirement is a lot of toy balls. Nerf-type balls work perfectly. The amount needed will vary, but more than 30 are generally required. The last requirement for Boxo is one strobe light. The strobe light is set to a slow flicker rate so that it flashes just two or three times per second at most.</p>
<p>The number of people playing depends on the size of the basement. Typically, the players are divided into two teams and with complete darkness (the strobe light being the exception) the two teams begin to wage war on one another with all of the balls available. The only way in which a player can knock a wall of boxes over is by throwing balls at it. This means a player is not allowed to knock boxes over with any part of his/her body. A player may take any amount of hits he/she desires. The game ends when either hte boxes become too disorganized or one team submits to the other.</p>
<p>Boxo originated at Augustana College in Rock Island, IL, and has since spread to other states such as Michigan. It began in September 2005, and is still actively played.</p>
