<li><b>Keep</b> certainly suffers from POV and some inappropriate content, such as the contact me part, but the concept that there is an art/science to design and hence methods is certainly appropriate. Since this primarily focuses on the work of John Christopher Jones it may be more appropriate to move it an article of that name and reorg it to be more consistent with standards <a href="../../../j/_/e/User%7EJ_E_Bailey_09c3.html" title="User:J E Bailey">J E Bailey</a> 18:19, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This document is about design methods and starts with John Christopher Jones. It should not be deleted as it is an important topic of discussion. It is not "cult" or "partisan", but is a valid area to articulate. As for the e-mail, I have taken it down as it seems as if it is culturally not in keeping with Wikipedia <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesign_methods_ba2a.html" title="User:Design methods">User:design_methods</a> Thank you for the commentary. If you go to design methods, it has been expanded to discuss the development of design research and design studies as a response to the work of the original group from design methods. I disagree that the content should be broken up, and give this a chance. This page is not promoting any specific group, but trying to demonstrate the development of design methods. <b>Owen and HappyCamper, if you would let me know what to improve to bring it in line with what your vision of Wikipedia is, I would appreciate it.</b> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesign_methods_ba2a.html" title="User:Design methods">User:design_methods</a>

<li>Thank you Owen. I am all ears on how to improve Wikipedia. Do you have any constructive suggestions? <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_methods.html" title="Design methods">Design methods</a>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the article is missing a definition. What is "Design methods"? An organization? An idea? A methodology? Check out other articles here to see examples of how a defining paragraph should look like, or read <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>. Secondly, and more importantly, I find it amazing that a 3,000-word article about something that existed for 40 years wouldn't have <i>a single bit of criticism</i>. This is exactly what differentiates an encyclopedic entry from a sales pitch. (<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesign_methods_ba2a.html" title="User:Design methods">Design Methods</a> 17:41, 20 December 2005 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>Thank you Owen for the comments. I will clarify the definition of design methods and make sure it is known as a definition. I am all open for criticism, but also believe that the criticism should be followed by fixes, either by others (which I have invited others to do so) or by generalists who improve syntax. I think we all want to avoid terms like "fringe cult". Our collective goal should be to create a dynamic resource and assume contributors are trying to do the right thing and be specific on how to improve the content. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesign_methods_ba2a.html" title="User:Design methods">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDesign_methods_8006.html" title="User talk:Design methods"><big>☎</big></a>
<ul>
<li>You're still avoiding the issue. I wasn't talking about criticism of your article; I was talking about criticism of John Christopher Jones and his movement/cult/whatever it is (you still haven't defined it). If you tell us that in 40 years he and his ideas haven't received any criticism, then you've proven my claims. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 13:44, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am sorry if you think I am avoiding the issue. Please read the revised introduction. John Christopher Jones is not the issue as design methods is much larger than one person. He was an important founder of the idea of design methods and he did receive a share of criticism. If you read down the article, I have tried to discuss how design methods expanded and changed. <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_methods.html" title="Design methods">Design methods</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. <b><a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_methods.html" title="Design methods">Design methods</a> is a unique addition to Wikipedia. Not only does it establish a visible place for this important and evolving topic, it also contributes to the growing thought and demonstration of design as a critical discipline in developing meaningful products and services. Business concepts such as "innovation fulcrum" and "product life-cycle management" directly connect to the use of Design methods by current companies for both competitive advantage and human capital. And this practice is becoming more pervasive as the forces of economy and empathy converge.

<li><b>Delete</b> - this article is very misleading - it is at best an <i>essay</i> on a particular interpretation of design methods in the Western world. I might even suggest that we merge relevant portions of the article into others, but I lack the time to do so. Although generally well written, it is subtlely promoting a particular group formed in 1962. If the content is kept, it should be renamed to something appropriate which <i>specifically</i> highlights this. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 01:12, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
