<p><b>Delete</b> unless by the end of the AfD period some references are provided. Given the attention that local newspapers give to all kinds of trends and slang, if this is indeed notable there WILL be published information on this. If the author can't find any such published info, that means it isn't yet notable. The absence of published sources might not indicate non-notability in context where a language is seldom used for writing (Native American languages) or in areas with very low literacy rates. Neither of these conditions apply to English or the UK. I hope the author finds some citations (and changes the POV) since this sounds interesting, but as yet, it isn't Wiki-worthy. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 23:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZandarx_9cac.html" title="User:Zandarx">Zandarx</a> has not been entirely accurate. The article a) contains references and b) does not contain original thought. There is plenty of evidence of what is described in the article all over the internet, just not formally published articles. Where is the line drawn? I will happily link to personal websites and other such sources, but will this be frowned upon by people such as <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZandarx_9cac.html" title="User:Zandarx">Zandarx</a>? <a href="../../../2/0/4/User%7E204080.html" title="User:204080">204080</a> 23:09, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that websites are perfectly acceptable if they're not Wiki or mirror sites and if they're more than just personal blogs. My recommendation is to go for websites of newspapers or mags in the UK or with associated blogs. How about <b>Time Out <i>or</i></b> <i>The Guardian'</i> or one of the laddie mags? I **think** that will pass muster on Wikipedia, but really don't know. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 23:23, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The links to audio/visual sites such as Youtube or Bolt were there so users could hear examples of the work, with the out of time and out of tune acapellas that you had told me were my POV. The links to various pages within Mixstreet were to show the geographical locations of the DJs, which you had said need Citation, and also to show the software used by them, and their use of the logo as described in the article. The link to 'DJ Rankin's personal Bebo site was to show the large number of fans he has, another fact I gave that you said needed citation. I also linked to a couple of pages within 'DJ-Rankin.net', a site created by US based internet user who was struck by DJ Rankin's strange popularity considering the poor quality of his music. His site contains many accurate details and an FAQ regarding Chav DJ culture, which is why I linked to it. I hope now you will understand that although maybe not as reliable a source as you'd have liked, the information contained within these sites is proof enough of the facts I have stated in the article. <b>I am going to be away for a week, so would appreciate it if the article remained in place at least until my return when I will clear up any further claimed discrepancies.</b> <a href="../../../2/0/4/User%7E204080.html" title="User:204080">204080</a> 18:56, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
