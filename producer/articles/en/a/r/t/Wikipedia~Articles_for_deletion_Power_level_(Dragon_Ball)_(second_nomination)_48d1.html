<li>Ahahaha. See, here's the thing - DBZ will never even be able to compare to the popularity of Star Wars in any scenario. Star Wars is so unbelievably, immensely popular that someone made a Star Wars Jedi training school in Romania. All DBZ has is people putting on big plastic hair and fake Karategi and yelling Kamehameha. Ask someone what "The Force" is, chances are that they will know. Power level? Nope. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 18:04, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>You forgot about the continent of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>
<ul>
<li>No, I didn't. Star Wars has worldwide popularity, and I assure you that shows such as Star Wars and Star Trek are much bigger than DBZ in Asia. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 18:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>ALTtP, I think you are mistaking Popularity for Notability. This is still notable as Dragonball is a very popular universe. Therefore, the argument (albeit crude) is still accurate. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStayinAnon_a615.html" title="User:StayinAnon">StayinAnon</a> 19:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it's barely notable in the series. It's a simple plot device to say who's stronger than who, used for only one and a half arcs. Nothing would be different without it. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 20:03, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>The difference</b> between <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Force_%28Star_Wars%29_f4bd.html" title="The Force (Star Wars)">The Force (Star Wars)</a> and Power level (Dragon Ball) is "The Force", like the rest of Star Wars, is culturally significant while "Power Level" is not. You can see references to the concept in TV, films and music. There's books on the philosophy behind the concept and its parallels to different religions. And, more importantly, there's documentation of Lucas' inspiration for the concept... Not so much on "Power Level," is there? So, it isn't really fair to compare the two.--<a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohansen_aed8.html" title="User:Nohansen">Nohansen</a> 20:54, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. So much original research that nothing on the article can even verify that the subject actually exists in any form. Also, the list of all power levels in the series is completely unnecessary. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 02:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If some independant, fact-checked sources on the subject could be found, I would support stripping this down to a sourced stub, as from my limited understanding, the relative power levels of the characters are important to the customiseable card game and at least the early seasons of the DBZ anime (about a screen's worth, all of which must be sourced). Failing someone with the required interest willing to step up and do that, <b>delete</b>. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 04:10, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Per above. Also, since the power levels stop after a while, it really isn't possible to expand the article--<a href="../../../s/u/i/User%7ESUIT_2181.html" title="User:SUIT"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="gold"><b>SU</b></font><font color="silver"><b>IT</b></font></font></a> 05:07, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> There is no reason to delete this article the concept of ki scouters and power levels is a key part of Dragonball Z all the power levels are from reliable sources just because the power levels stop later in the series doesn't mean its not important. no reason to delete this. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 12:28, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's unverified research. That's a VERY good reason. And from what I hear, Daizenshū's power levels didn't have any input from Bird Studio or TOEI. Most of the content is guide content, and the other content is original research that no one seems to be interested in verifying. Hell, does anything on the article even show that the subject is real in Dragon Ball? No - not a single link, not a single source. None of the images even verify it. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 16:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> primarily due to OR concerns, although Wikipedia isn't an anime guide, just like it's not a game guide. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, although I can't believe I'm defending Dragon Ball. The concept is important enough to Dragon Ball to warrant a seperate article. The article implies there's an "official" book detailing this stuff, and the other information is taken from the manga or anime directly. Therefore, I think the article is sourceable and the OR can be gotten rid off, and the speculation can be hacked out. It's a cleanup case, not a delete case, let's give the kiddies a chance to fix it. And while I just <i>know</i> that this doesn't describe anyone around <i>here</i>, just as a note, let's not let personal dislike for the series taint our judgment, mmmkay? Or personal like, for that matter. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 15:28, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>How is it nonsense? its part of Dragonball Z its not a fan made term Akira Toriyama put it in there. So what if the Daizenshu didn't consult Toei or Bird Studio they didn't create dragonball Akira Toriyama did. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 20:57, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes that is true but this one does, there is no reason for this to be deleted it has the right information and has many other articles merged in.

<li>Why does this one warrant an article? Most of it is a guide. Can you give me a single reason why it is necessary that it has an article? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:06, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Its not a guide its half list and half article thats all. Its necesary because</li>
<li>1.its an important dragonball Z concept</li>
<li>2.Its not just on power levels it also has scouters and Ki/Chi mixed in</li>
<li>3.Its not overrun with fancruft or anything its a perfectally good article.</li>
<li>4.Is there any reason to delete it?</li>
<li>we could easily fix up the article instead of just deleting it. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 21:11, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is a guide. It is an anime guide on power levels. The rest of the content is original research. This has been at the AfD four times - first time it was deleted, but someone revived it without going through deletion review.</li>
<li>1. It's not important. It's just a detailed description of characters' powers. Is it necessary for us to know that some character has a power level of NINE THOUUUUUSAAAAAAND?</li>
<li>2. The Dragon Ball article can cover ki/chi.</li>
<li>3. It's not? 100% original research and anime guide cruft.</li>
<li>4. Yes. 100% original research and anime guide cruft. That's a GREAT reason to delete. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:25, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Its not all original research just look at the scouter part. Why would the Dragonball article cover Chi/KI its huge already KI/chi deserves its own page we just need to delete the fancruft. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 21:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Because it's guide content. Have you ever explained why it is necessary to know every single powere ever recorded in the entire series? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:46, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thats like saiying why its nesesary to list all the pokemon but we have them all listed. Its not like its listing any power levels that were not stated in the manga. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 21:48, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How are numbers more important than "characters" in a very popular franchise? Just give it up. You're just grasping for straws at this point. There are no possible references beyond basic "ki=energy=pl" things. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 21:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>what? I never said they were more important than the charecters. But they are important. They measure a charecter's power. Also its not just numbers it has scouters and Ki in there too! <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 21:55, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They are not important in the least. They're just a plot thing to show who's stronger than who used for one and a half arcs/sagas. The rest is unimportant also, and can be cut and placed elsewhere. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 21:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok so they may not be uber important but can't we just list them delete the repeditive stuff expand the scouter section and call it a reborn article? <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 22:01, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Also, if power levels are important, does that also mean that the base stats of each Pokémon are too? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:59, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>don't take this personally but thats just rediculus base stats of pokemon are completely random. There are 400-something pokemon but there are only 40 or so power levels max stated in dragonball. thats a huge difference. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 22:04, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They are not random. A Pikachu at level 1 has the same base stats as another Pikachu at level 1. The sun setting is about as random as Pokémon base stats. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well actually Pokemon Base stats are on some pages I think on manaphy and a few others. you know pokemon base stats wouldn't be so bad on those pages good idea. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 22:12, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Except that it is guide content. It is not necessary to know their base stats. That's content used for forming a great Pokémon team. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes but its a video game any information will probably help people play the game.

<dd>Ok let me explain this to you. many charecters like <a href="../../../n/a/p/Nappa.html" title="Nappa">Nappa</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeza.html" title="Freeza">Freeza</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Ginyu_b35c.html" title="Captain Ginyu">Captain Ginyu</a> cannot sense KI/Chi so they have scouters that let them see how strong charecters are via numbers. These concepts are interwoven with Ki/Chi MAJOR AND KEY concepts to Dragonball and Dragonball Z and GT. You also state that the list of Power levels should not be there. thats like not listing how fast a rocket can go (given that the number is recorded) or how many episodes are in an anime. Its not mega important info but at the same time it is not info that no one cares about it is enyclopedic and factual not a bunch of fanon garbage. The Daizenshu in fact consulted Akira Toriyama on the stuff they put in there it wasn't a bunch of Japanese Fanboys who decided to make a dragonball Z book. The Bottom line Power Levels are important and Factual and true. Period. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 23:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Power levels are important in showing the character's current power. If they did not exist, the only difference is that no characters would KNOW your power level. Are you implying that the plot would be different without the lack of power levels? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:56, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>did you just totally ignore the 7 lines of text up there? (no offense) The plot would be differnt without Powerlevels because powerlevels are bascially showing your chi/Ki They would know ki/Chi exists because if they didn't there wouldn't be any scouters. Powerlevels are not a complete plot device; they are there to let the reader how strong a charecter is in numeracal form. We should list them for the sake of completenes. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 00:01, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A CONVERSATION ABOUT POWER LEVELS IS NOT IMPORTANT. And no, we should NOT list them for the sake of completeness. Under your logic, everything that ever existed or ever could exist should be listed simply to make Wikipedia complete.

<dd>Ok forgeting the beforementioned conversation about powerlevels what is wrong with powerlevels they are in the manga and are a key part of DB and DBZ and DBGT they help the reader understand exactly how powerful a charecter is instead of "What powerful Chi/Ki" no they don't have a direct effect on the plot they help the reader. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 00:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
