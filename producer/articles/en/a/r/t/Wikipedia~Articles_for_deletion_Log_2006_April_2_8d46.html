<li>'<i>Delete <b>or</b></i> <b>Transwiki</b>. Although I believe that Image galeries have a place in Wikipedia, they need to be focused on a single topic rather than be a random collection of images associated with a place. This gallery would be similiar to a list like List of people, places, and things associated with Kerala. On the idea that wikipedia is not a repository of images, see the ongoing discusion at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_galleries_088b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not/galleries">Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not/galleries</a>. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 23:07, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>All the images are related to the atricle <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a>. Most of the images are bundled with writeups related to the image. The gallery was created oving to the already overcrowded article.The gallery does add qualitative value to the atricle to which it's attached.<a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPratheepps_2d32.html" title="User:Pratheepps">Pratheepps</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Commons is a Wikimedia project dedicated to media, especially photos, and it welcomes galleries. Provided the licenses for these photos are appropriate, Commons really welcomes this gallery. Wikipedia articles can link to Commons just as easily as they can link to other articles on Wikipedia, so the gallery will still be quite useful there. In addition, if the photos themselves are on Commons, then articles on Kerala in other Wikipedias can link to them (and the gallery) so the same photos and the same gallery become useful to many different projects. Take a look at galleries like <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" class="extiw" title="commons:Tokyo">Commons:Tokyo</a> (that's just one example). It's better on Commons than on the English Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 09:46, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: Cryptic, I know what the water feeling thing is about. Traditional navigators were so familiar with the sea and its swells and with their canoe that they could just sense (thru their bodies) what course the canoe was on - ie, they were subconciously keeping track of the swells, wave patterns, the noises the canoe was making and correcting the course and position in their minds. It makes sense actually - feeling with the hand is just an extension of this. I agree its Tongan and could be persuaded. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 06:47, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article contains the non-notable pranks that don't quite make it into <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> What, by definition, is notable? This, in itself, could be a debate argued for every article on Wikipedia. If we look at the supposedly notable website pranks listed in <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a>, a great ratio of them are rather techy/geeky web sites that probably tend to be visited frequently by the same folks who visit Wikipedia. (Certainly, WE'RE not the end-all-determiners-of-importance in the universe, as much as we would like to be!) The web is transient by nature, more so with these one-day internet pranks that we're trying to preserve for all posterity. If we choose to note any of these brief incidents, we should list them all. I advocate that we have a sampling of the most prominent pranks at <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a> and retain the rest at April 1, 2006 (Complete List).

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia isn't exactly hard-up for hard-drive space. The article is not hurting anyone and I've directed at least two dozen people there because they've specifically said to me, "Gee, I wish there was a place where I could see a list of all the April Fools jokes pulled today." In other words, the article is useful, harmless and it's hardly taking up space desperately needed for another article on obscure anime. Keep the article. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 200.77.30.205 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_200.77.30.205_a951.html" title="Special:Contributions/200.77.30.205">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep and Clean up</b> The thing is, I haven't (nor has anyone else) scoured this list to check to see if any of the items in here are notable.

I agree that after the process of determining notable pranks for April Fool's Day 2006, this page could be deleted if people feel it should be, but for now, I think it is important to keep. <a href="../../../z/e/b/User%7EZebov_acbd.html" title="User:Zebov">Zebov</a> 04:41, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not saying that any of the ones left are noteworthy, (though Im sure a few are) but that's not the point. I don't see the harm in keeping them on a seperate page forever, even if a million people didn't see something, a few may have and want a record kept of it. The Move Content isnt saying that a blogs joke should go between gamefaqs and slashdot, or even anywhere near it, but I don't think the blogs joke should disappear because not everyone in the world saw it or cared. There are plenty of articles on wikipedia that might not be viewed by more than 10 people ever. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be here. 68.1.59.30 05:18, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Comment</b> Since the consensus (much to my surprise) seems to be that all of these events are in fact worth keeping (does that equal "notable"?), perhaps a <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a> is order?

<li>Out of curiosity, why are you averse to it existing as a fork? Or in a "less notable pranks" section on the main article? It's not making anyone click on the unimportant pranks, just listing their existence, for anyone that may be interested. There are tons of articles that stretch out into infinity where only a few of the people that read them will ever delve into the wealth of knowledge they possess... I say if it fits, and any one person wants it on wikipedia, (which, I'm guessing each of these qualifies), and it doesn't violate any policies, it should stay.

<li>Alright, the forking certainly applies here, however, I don't think the repository of links does. That section specifies the links as detracting from the article, for example on an actors page where the page has 3 lines and then 18 links to fan sites on the actor. In this case the article is the collection of links. Even if you removed all of the links, the mere fact that a site had a hoax should gain it an entry of some importance if someone is willing to write it. The only difference between this page and the real page seems to be the popularity of the sites, and with the votes so far, I'd say a majority aren't happy with the current popularity cutoff.68.1.59.30 06:35, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the popularity part is the biggest issue, as I noted in my vote below no prior years specify the pranks as notable only, appparently any prank someone felt like listing was included. This year's list is much larger but this seems to be because this year has seen far more pranks than prior years. One example on this whole notable/non-notable thing: On the main page the entry about Yahoo! saying they were buying all of Web 2.0 is listed. On the complete list page it lists right under that same entry two Web 2.0 companies who went along with the prank and posted a fake news item on their websites that they were being bought by Yahoo! Personally I've not seen that type of collaboration much before (actually never personally) so I think it's highly notable. I could add it to the main page but the thing is: who decides what's notable and what's not? Maestro4k 06:43, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I like April Fool's jokes, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a massive collection of mostly non-notable links.

<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Keep</b>. The current version of the main page seems to have some Internet pranks listed that seem less significant than some of the ones of this ancillary page, judging by the apparent prominence of some of the web pages mentioned. I have no problem with a two-tier system of major pranks relating to well-known sites, companies, etc. (e.g. such-and-such being bought out by Yahoo!) with the rest relegated to the "complete list" page. However, I would strongly object to the idea of removing the complete list entirely. This is a very interesting document of the day's ephemera, many of which will no longer be viewable in the next day or two. A written record of what <i>was</i> out there on April 1, 2006 should be of continuing interest to people who encountered or perpetrated some of the pranks, with renewed interest as people gear up for April 1, 2007. Whether the listing is merged or retained on a separate page, further sorting of the long "uncategorized" section would be helpful, and probably not all that hard to accomplish. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> 08:58, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is just to follow up a bit on the discussion since I posted the above. I'll grant that what happened on a blog with 25 readers is less notable than, for example, Google Romance. I will further admit that I naively added a reference to the former before reading that one is not supposed to do that with one's one work. If a "complete" list (or as nearly complete as possible) is desirable, that one line belongs here anyway; if not, it should go. <b>However</b>, such a marginal case is not emblematic of everything that's been removed from the "notable" list and relegated to this one. I see, for example, that the NPR story about the fake product the iBod has been removed from the main page. If a five minute story on a national news program isn't notable, then nothing is. In addition, I have no doubt that many of the Internet references that didn't make the cut nevertheless were significant and of continuing interest to specific online communities. To suggest that this entire second entry is merely a link farm, based on the occasional reference to someone's blog, is a straw man argument. If it makes anyone feel any better, links can be removed to defeat any promotional purpose - but the list itself should be preserved as a historical document. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> 03:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

My solution would be to put the agreeably more notable ones at the top, possibly in bold or something. Giving them their own page however is ridiculous.

<li><b>Comment</b>: this is stupid. Firstly Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, which means it should include things that are likely to be noteworthy not only now but in the future too. Nobody in 5 years (or even minutes) time will care what some non-notable website did on April fools day 2006 - they will care what major sites and other media did. Secondly, it would be very interesting to see how many of the people voting have some relation to an entry on the page - I would suggest that the only way for the closing admin to fairly determine the outcome of this discussion is to only count votes from unbiased Wikipedians (i.e. registered users with a reasonable number of contributions) who have not added entries to the page concerned. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Johnson_b532.html" title="User:David Johnson">David Johnson</a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Johnson_8ad9.html" title="User talk:David Johnson"><b>T</b></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Johnson_662a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Johnson"><b>C</b></a>] 12:52, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>What evidence is there that it's being used as a promotion tool for websites? And how would being linked off of one single page on Wikipedia (that's likely not going to get very much traffic after a few weeks until next year) actually <i>benefit</i> a site? It'd take a lot more links from many pages to achieve any real benefits. Maestro4k 22:45, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course it's being used as a promotion tool - people are adding links to their own sites with for the sole purpose of increasing traffic to them. I've seen this enough times on Wikipedia to recognise when it's happening. Having your site linked from Wikipedia, even from a single page, can bring a lot more traffic and affect search engine rankings pretty dramatically. Go look for youself at voters' contributions and see how many have added to the article. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Johnson_b532.html" title="User:David Johnson">David Johnson</a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Johnson_8ad9.html" title="User talk:David Johnson"><b>T</b></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Johnson_662a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Johnson"><b>C</b></a>] 00:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personally I can't predict the future, so I don't know what sites will be notable 5 years from now, how do you? I'm quite certain that people of almost any past era would be quite surprised at what we find interesting about their societies today, and we should keep that in mind. I'm an amateur historian and when I've done research with primary and secondary sources in the past even the tiniest of details can be utterly fascinating. I'm not sure offhand if April Fool's Day was celebrated 100 years ago but if it was I would LOVE to know what types of pranks were pulled, even the minor ones. Just because it seems silly or trivial to you today does not mean it will be seen as silly, trivial or non-noteworthy in the future. Also, please remember Wikipedia's policy of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assuming Good Faith</a>. Suggesting that Keep voters are biased certainly isn't in the spirit of that policy. Maestro4k 22:53, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but there's a big difference between this and historial data: firstly there is not much data about April fools day 100 years ago - if there was, then you probably would only be interested in the notable stuff. Secondly, nobody will ever convince me that someone 100 years in the future will care what some website which was around for a few years without ever gaining popularity did on April fools day 2006. I'm also not saying that everyone voting keep is biased: I'm saying that a not-insignificant percentage of them are (and no doubt some delete voters too), as is clear from the number of unregistered and newly-created-with-no-contributions users voting. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Johnson_b532.html" title="User:David Johnson">David Johnson</a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Johnson_8ad9.html" title="User talk:David Johnson"><b>T</b></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Johnson_662a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Johnson"><b>C</b></a>] 09:51, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You missed a very key point in what I said -- we can't see the future, how do you, I or anyone else know what will be considered notable in the future? We don't, and can't without a time machine. To (futily) address your point about people in the future caring: you'd have likely been hard pressed to convince many people during Shakespeare's time that his plays were notable since they were designed as popular entertainment. Nowadays we consider them absolute classics but it's quite likely that Shakespeare himself never thought of them as such, time changes perceptions on things, even jokes. Finally I can't speak for any other newly registerd voters but I personally registered because I felt it was important to tie a name to my vote. I have edited several times in the past (mainly to correct grammatical errors and such) but never felt it was worth registering just for that. Even so I don't think any of the voters are voting because they're biased, astroturfing or trying to stuff the ballot (to mention all negatives suggested so far). I think they're voting what they feel is correct even if they disagree with my stance. Maestro4k 22:45, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Shakespeare's not a good example, since his plays attracted significant audiences during his time and he was well regarded, thus making him notable enough. In any case, Wikipedia's stance on issues like this are well known: if something isn't notable <i>now</i>, it doesn't get into Wikipedia. If and when something becomes notable, it can be included, but not before. To suggest that <i>nobody</i> here is making a biased vote is very naive: this happens a lot on Wikipedia and I have no doubt that plenty of the voters here have added links to sites they're involved with to the page (maybe some have even been directed here from those sites to vote for the page to be kept - this happens a lot too). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Johnson_b532.html" title="User:David Johnson">David Johnson</a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Johnson_8ad9.html" title="User talk:David Johnson"><b>T</b></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Johnson_662a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Johnson"><b>C</b></a>] 00:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - While this article is rather poorly written and in the POV of the original author, it certainly seems to be overkill to delete it. It's a relatively new article and at least one editor has added a significant section (albeit little better than what existed before). It should retain its current {{wikify}} tag, or maybe a cleanup tag, and let a few more people take a stab at fixing it. It certainly seems to contain enough kernels to warrant a good article, if an editor cares to take a stab at it.<a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluit_5f4e.html" title="User:Fluit">Fluit</a> 08:16, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Bigchoofer (along with a number of other users in the article's history) points out that this supposed exchange doesn't appear to be referenced anywhere on the Web; doing a Google search on the terms "American Energy Exchange" and "amenx" (their domain name) gives basically no results; it appears that this may actually be part of a scam. Even if the exchange is real, the article is written extremely poorly. <b>Delete</b> unless the existence of the exchange can be proven by something other than their own web site. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 11:04, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi, AMENX is definately a scam. It does not exist outside their own website and Wikipedia (and mirrors). I'm trying to get this link deleted, although i'd prefer to leave it as "this is a scam" to ensure that the google cache gets updated, i understand this may leave wikipedia exposed legally though. I know of 2 people who have lost collectively over $150k US to these people, and I am just trying to stop other people from being defrauded. What does it take to actually get this deletion actioned? A 30 sec phone call from anyone to the CFTC <a href="http://www.cftc.gov" class="external free" title="http://www.cftc.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cftc.gov</a> will confirm what i am saying. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 59.167.111.119 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_59.167.111.119_9458.html" title="Special:Contributions/59.167.111.119">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've made comments on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Archaeogeodesy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Archaeogeodesy" rel="nofollow">archaeogeodesy deletion discussion page</a> that are also relevant here. JzG, you miss the point that there is no evidence whatsoever that this is considered a non-serious or non-genuine field of study or that the AgA is a non-serious group. The AgA's co-written pamphlet is considered as serious by the British Library, who file it under 'occultism', not 'hoaxes', and by the Exeter University mathematics department, and its work is so considered by those who have attended its lectures. These lectures have not, as far as I am aware, been advertised on the internet - but so what? I can send scanned images of flyers advertising meetings, going back more than a decade, if anyone is interested. I don't think the AgA has ever been interested in basking in the academic or media limelight, and I think the idea that 'advertisement' is involved in this article, is way off the mark.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Also JzG, I don't think you have considered this properly if you genuinely believe I am a sockpuppet for James Q Jacobs!) <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeil_78b8.html" title="User:Neil">158-152-12-77</a> 22:54, 2 April 2006 (BST)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Whether it is serious or genuine is not the issue. This appears to be an esoteric and little-known field of study, which qualifies it as non-notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:25, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I stated at AfD/Archaeogeodesy that I think the study of ancient alignments (such as <a href="../../../l/e/y/Ley_lines.html" title="Ley lines">Ley lines</a>) is notable but the fact that there are two competing definitions for the term shows that it is too early to be included as an encyclopedia entry (some neologisms eventually become encylopedic but this is too early). The Association is a clearer case to my mind. Other than their own advocacy for the field of study, I could find no evidence they had attracted outside attention, so they are not notable or verifiable. Even a published critcism of them would give some independent verification of what their views are and why they are notable; or an article for followers of ancient mysteries that would discuss the association (either pro or con)--at this point it looks like they haven't made an impact in their field of interest. I think the vanity suggestion is also valid and it would be best if a future article were not written by the founder or leading proponent of the organization. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:28, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Seriousness</b>. Whether it's serious <b>has</b> been raised as an issue. I think it is an issue, because if it were a joke, this would be a legitimate reason for exclusion. The fact that it's serious is relevant in the context of a deletion discussion, although not in itself reason to include the article. <b>Competing definitions</b>. Well there are competing definitions of 'archaeogeodesy', not of the AgA. I don't quite understand your point about two competing definitions being reason to exclude either article. There are competing definitions of many many terms included in Wikipedia, including e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>. <b>Verifiability</b>. You are mistaken about the AgA being verifiable. You would have thought their authorship of a work carrying an ISBN and with copies lodged in libraries would be verification of their existence. That was published in 1992. Today in 2006 they can still be contacted through the publisher, Unpopular Books, although this takes about 2 weeks because many of the people involved are not especially into the internet. <b>Notability</b>. Your failure to find evidence that they have attracted outside attention is not evidence of the absence of evidence of notability. As I said, an AgA pamphlet is reviewed on an Exeter University website - which is surely evidence of attraction of outside interest, and it's even online too. (Unless someone is going to say the guy at Exeter is a secret member or agent of the AgA!) AgA work has also been mentioned in Neoist publications (e.g.<a href="http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/reaction/ReAction7a3.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/reaction/ReAction7a3.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>)and philosophical publications (e.g.<a href="http://sammelpunkt.philo.at:8080/archive/00000066/01/sthome.htm" class="external text" title="http://sammelpunkt.philo.at:8080/archive/00000066/01/sthome.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and, like I said, in the London Psychogeographical Association's newsletter. <b>Authorship</b>. I don't think there's an issue as to who writes the Wikipedia article. The issues are whether it is NPOV and accurate, and any article that doesn't meet these criteria should be <b>edited</b> until it does. If someone encounters the term 'archaeogeodesy' or hears of the AgA, why shouldn't they be able to look it up in Wikipedia? <b>Esoteric</b>. 'Esoteric' (or some people's opinion that something is esoteric) surely does not qualify something as 'non-notable'.</li>

<dd>Per Worldcat, only 6 libraries worldwide have this "book," which is actually a 31 page pamphlet. To me, an association is notable if it has notable members or has made an impact on its field. Having a single pamphlet produced 14 years ago does not suggest that the organization has ever been significant in its field. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:01, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not convinced that mention by the London psychgeographical society is evidence of notability either as that group was the joint published of the AgA,s pamphlet and has only published one other book on its own (also through Unpopular books). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:36, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You are mistaken. It sounds as though you didn't look in the <a href="http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-list" class="external text" title="http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-list" rel="nofollow">British Library's catalogue</a>, before stating that "there is no evidence" that they acknowledge the AgA's existence. The work's shelfmark at the British Library is HMNTS YK.1994.a.8349. The Dewey class number is 133 20. The system number is 008153514, and the organisation's name is clearly recorded in the relevant entry. Whether or not Mr Watkins's post is funded is irrelevant, and the word 'personal' is misleading. (His work is well known in the field of academic parapsychology). It is unclear what test exactly you believe publication by <a href="../../../u/n/p/Unpopular_Books_3453.html" title="Unpopular Books">Unpopular Books</a>, rather than by some other publisher, doesn't pass. They have been publishing books and pamphlets for about 25 years, by numerous authors, not limited to those mentioned on either their website or the relevant Wikipedia entry. Probably hundreds of thousands of copies have been distributed, all told, including of several titles stocked in numerous libraries. And by the way, for future reference, Worldcat is not a comprehensive source on how many libraries stock anything. All it states is how many libraries it is aware of. Of course, the detractors here (file under 'what I don't know, or know about, isn't important'?) have already made up their minds, so I'm not going to waste any more time. There's no point. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeil_78b8.html" title="User:Neil">158-152-12-77</a> 02:36, 9 April 2006 (BST)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sorry but some of you are under a misunderstanding. I am most definitely not an incarnation of James Q Jacobs - which should be clear from the Archaeogeodesy talk page. (JzG - I would really appreciate it if you considered my charge that you have made an error here). I have reverted away from Mr Jacobs's repeated self-promotional attempts to dominate the article by writing 90% of it as an advert for his own work. He is not the only person to use the term, and he does not 'own' this field. No-one does. The term is used also by the Archaeogeodetic Association, which co-wrote the 1992 pamphlet mentioned in the links (the 'Great Conjunction', <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1871593050</a>), and which has been classed under 'occultism' by the British library (for reasons best known to themselves) and reviewed on the web by an accomplished mathematician at Exeter university.</li>
</ul>
<p>My view is that for the moment there should be a short article simply listing the alternative definitions of the field (of which I am aware of two), linking to various works. Editors should then, in the fullness of time, create a lovely article that accurately summarises the scope and history of the field. Far from being invented by either Jacobs or the AgA, it dates back for more than a century. Big names for example are William Black, Alfred Watkins, and Guy Underwood. (Alexander Thom is mentioned in the article on 'ley lines' but, as far as I am aware, he confined his studies, where alignments were concerned, to much shorter ones than are studied in archaeogeodesy. Archaeogeodesy overlaps with, but is certainly not coterminous with, the study of leylines).</p>
<p>It is unfair to say that archaeogeodesy is not a serious field of study. This suggests it is merely the realm of hoaxers or people who seek to amuse themselves, which isn't true. I quite agree that the field attracts crackpots. In fact I think Mr Jacobs is a crackpot, but that's just my POV, and is no reason for deletion of an article on the <b>field</b>. In fact, it's no reason even to exclude mention of Jacobs's work. Other fields that attract crackpots include religion, evolutionary biology, psychology, etc.</p>
<p>If it was all a hoax, I think the proposal would be on stronger ground. But I don't think the idea can be seriously maintained by anyone who has read e.g. the 'Great Conjunction' pamphlet, or who has attended AgA lectures.</p>
<p>It is true that the field is fairly obscure and the term has been used only by a small number of authors...but this too is no good reason for deletion IMO.</p>
<p>AIUI, the term <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeoastronomy.html" title="Archaeoastronomy">archaeoastronomy</a> is fairly new - dating back maybe to the 1960s. It's a good name for a certain field of study which dates back much longer. If Wikipedia had existed in say 1975, when the term had been going for only about 15 years, and let's say it wasn't in very widespread use at that time, would there have been good reason to delete an article on it? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Let's just have a short NPOV article for the time being...and if anyone tries to 'own' it, take what measures are necessary to prevent that from happening.</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I know there are people interested in the alignments of ancient sites (such as <a href="../../../l/e/y/Ley_lines.html" title="Ley lines">Ley lines</a>). However, the fact that there are two competing definitions suggests that the term is too new to be encyclopedic. Can you offer any examples other than the association's pamphlet that the term is in widespread use (at least among practitioners)? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:20, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>No, it is not in widespread use, in the sense of being used by a large number of people, although the association does have members on four continents. Bear in mind that they do not share Mr Jacobs's approach, and coined the term without any desire to own the field, or indeed to own any field. Nobody has made any attempt to monopolise the archaeogeodesy page by referring at great length to the AgA. (If anyone does do so, I'll oppose it the same way I opposed Mr Jacobs's efforts to do so, and for the same reasons). A good comparison would be the use of the term 'archaeoastronomy'. It is meant to be NPOV. 'Leyline' is a more loaded term, and for most practitioners carries connotations of 'energy lines' etc., whereas 'archaeogeodesy' refers just to alignments, and is meant to be basically plain and objective. It does not carry any implied interpretation. Indeed it doesn't even imply the view that alignments actually exist!&#160;:-) You say it's too new, but it's been around for more than 15 years. <a href="../../../1/5/8/User%7E158-152-12-77.html" title="User:158-152-12-77">158-152-12-77</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/8/User_talk%7E158-152-12-77.html" title="User talk:158-152-12-77">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_158-152-12-77_ef59.html" title="Special:Contributions/158-152-12-77">contribs</a>) 11:19, 3 April 2006 (BST)</li>

<dd>One key difference is that archeoastronomy gets 350,000 ghits and archaeogeodesy gets around 600, of which fewer than 150 appear to be unique, and the list is dominated by Wikipedia mirrors and Jacobs' own astroturfing. I note that most of your edits are either to this subject or linking it to other articles, this is not often a good sign. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:16, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To me, the fact that there is no settled definition of the term means it is too new; new being relative, of course. A term like <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proteome.html" title="Proteome">proteome</a> is probably under 5 years old but has been adopted by thousands of biologists and covered in multiple peer-reviewed journals, and has a single definition. The fact that archaeogeodesy does not have an agreed-upon definition after 15 years suggests that the number of people involved in the debate is too small and/or the findings too obscure for a definition to crystallize, which to me suggests a lack of <b>encyclopedic</b> notability. However I said weak delete because I am open to including the topic provided some independent source (apart from the AgA) can be cited. The fact that a small number of people have coined a new word to describe their field of interest, no matter how serious-minded they are, does not confer encyclopedic notability unless other people start to notice. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:12, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thatcher131 - you say that "the fact that archaeogeodesy does not have an agreed-upon definition after 15 years suggests that the number of people involved in the debate is too small and/or the findings too obscure for a definition to crystallize". This is not so. See for example 'mathematics', which also does not have an agreed upon definition. Or many other terms. I also don't know what 'debate' you are referring to. There isn't any 'debate' on what the term should mean. There are just different people using it different ways.</dd>

<dd>JzG - are you going to apologise for stating, as if it were a fact, in the text with which you opened this deletion discussion, that I am a sockpuppet for Mr Jacobs? You were not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" rel="nofollow">assuming good faith</a> on my part. Nor can you have seriously considered the contributions to the talk pages etc. And when I say that, I <b>am</b> assuming your own good faith, because I don't believe someone who had seriously considered those contributions, could reach the conclusion that you did. If your statement as an admin is allowed to stand - namely the accusation that I am a sockpuppet for Jacobs - then there just is no point in my continuing to take part in this discussion. If you want to see a list of my contributions BTW, don't just check the ones I made since setting up '158-152-12-77' as a user name. Also look at those I made from that IP before I did so, beginning in Jan 2004: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=158.152.12.77" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=158.152.12.77" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You will see that your statement that most of my edits are either to this article, or linking it to other articles, is incorrect. But then I'm not on trial, am I, any more than you are? It is onerous that I have to correct statements of which the falsehood is easily verifiable.</dd>

<dd>I disagree that verifiability has been established. We have one 31-page pamphlet published jointly by the AgA and the LPA (which itself only has one other publication and which Matthew Watkins calls <a href="http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/" class="external text" title="http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/" rel="nofollow"><i>elusive</i></a>); and we have Watkins' site itself, who is an "honorary research assistant" whose web site is hosted at Exeter and whose research interests are certainly non-traditional and eclectic to say the least. You mention <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Watkins_8623.html" title="Alfred Watkins">Alfred Watkins</a> for example; what did he call these alignments (and did he actually diferentiate between Ley lines and these longer alignments as you do)? It's possible the field is old but the terminology is too new to be widely accepted, in which case it should be filed under the most common current terminology. While I do not doubt your sincerity, generally I think there is a lack of verifiability here. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:48, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Several issues of the LPA's newsletter are online. I can't see the relevance of whether Matthew Watkins's interests are traditional or non-traditional. He currently only holds a lowly post at the university of Exeter, but he has done noteworthy work in physics (e.g. study of retro-PK using the internet) and published a number of academic papers, and at least one book (possibly more). Did you see the references to AgA work in the other sources I referred to, on the other deletion-debate page? The AgA has been referred to in Neoist publications (e.g.<a href="http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/reaction/ReAction7a3.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/reaction/ReAction7a3.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>)and philosophical publications (e.g.<a href="http://sammelpunkt.philo.at:8080/archive/00000066/01/sthome.htm" class="external text" title="http://sammelpunkt.philo.at:8080/archive/00000066/01/sthome.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>
<p>The way to contact the AgA (other than using personal connections) is to go through the publisher. The pamphlet was not published jointly by the AgA and the LPA. It was authored by them. The publisher was Unpopular Books, which has published books in a number of different fields, including politics.</p>
<p>It's not merely 'possible' that the field of archaeogeodesy (or whatever we want to call it - i.e. long-distance alignments of ancient sites) is old. It's a fact. I have listed the names of three big authors above.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeil_78b8.html" title="User:Neil">158-152-12-77</a> 18:50, 3 April 2006 (BST)</p>
<p>Sorry - I missed your question about Alfred Watkins. No, he didn't differentiate terminologically, but he did study alignments of different lengths. Bear in mind that the '<a href="../../../g/e/o/Geodesy.html" title="Geodesy">geodesy</a>' part of 'archaeogeodesy' is basically about making measurements on the earth's surface, and conceiving of the shape of that surface, <b>taking into account its curvature</b> (using a spherical model, and in some contexts, a spheroidal model). See in particular what geodesists call the 'principal' and 'inverse' geodetic problems, referred to in the geodesy article. (This terminology is standard). People making alignments over long distances have got to have some sort of appreciation of these problems. Which begs the question, of course, as to whether anyone made such alignments in ancient times. I'm not sure how much you know about the field, but some of the work by Alexander Thom (a professor of engineering) on archaeoastronomy appeared first in a statistics journal, and a fair amount of the AgA's work is also statistical.</p>
<p>If you put a 1m-wide stone half a mile from another, it makes very little appreciable difference whether you take into account the curvature of the earth or not. If you do it over a distance of 500 miles, it does make a difference. At any rate, when you're talking short-distance sight-lines, there isn't the data to support an opinion as to whether or nor the curvature of the earth was taken into account. The distances are too short. So that's one of the reasons why long-distance alignments are seen as a separate field, or sub-field, or whatever you want to call it. None of what I've just said is controversial. Whether such alignments exist, of course, is.</p>
<p>I should also mention that many leyhunters don't think there's any case for believing that long-distance alignments exist. E.g. Paul Devereux and the 'Ley Hunter' magazine crew. They think the idea is kooky. It conflicts with their 'paradigms'. But they still accept the distinction. I haven't come across any author who doesn't.</p>
<p>Oh, and the lines have got to be straight. Various authors talk of wiggly lines, 'dragon' lines, lines tracing pictures, and so on. Questions concerning these, or their existence or otherwise, are not included in the subject-matter of archaeogeodesy, for the simple reason that geodesy isn't involved.</p>
<p>I don't know what you would suggest as the comon current terminology to take the place of archaeogeodesy. I'm afraid leylines is a very loaded term, and is insufficiently specific.</p>

<p>DELETE. James Q. Jacobs here. Get rid of the slander against me. Someone is unwilling to have any history of archaeogeodesy posted on this page, and continually vandalizes the content. I would prefer to have the page deleted because of the conduct of the person who will not allow any history of this research to be posted, and uses the page to slander me.</p>
<p>Archaeo- is a combining form meaning ancient. Therefore, archaeogeodesy means "ancient geodesy." Geodesy is a known science and not available for redefinition by ley hunters or followers of some unscientific and much criticized author. Geodesy is science, a very large science encompassing surveying and cartography, and hundreds of thousands of professionals worldwide. Ancient geodesy encompassed all geodesy in prehistory; all navigation, surveying, measure and representation of the earth, and map making.</p>
<p>Archaeogeodesy is the specialized area of scientific study I defined. I have worked on this research for 20 years. I am an anthropologist and archaeologist, and an academic instructor. I attained 4.0 GPAs in undergraduate study at two institutions and graduated summa cum laude. I have taught college anthropology, archaeology, education, mathematics, and computer information systems. But, call me whatever you wish. I was one of the first people creating Wikipedia, when it was worth the effort. Now it has devolved into this sort of banality! I can't even fix typos or capitalizations any longer w/o someone reverting to the previous errors. Why bother.</p>
<p>Archaeogeodesy has nothing to do with occultism, the ley line concept, or other new age ideation. From the discussion above, it is obvious that geodesy is being confused with new-age pseudoscience. If someone used the word "archaeogeodetic" once in 1992, fine--Let them write a book about it if they wish. But printing the word once does not justify erasing a history of serious scientific study. Nonetheless, at this point I vote DELETE the slander.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr Jacobs appears not to want an article on this subject unless he owns it. A "<i>history of serious scientific study</i>" indeed! His version was 90% devoted to his own work, and he was even caught out vandalising the AgA page, trying to advertise his work. The marks (US: grades) he got when he was a student are irrelevant. It was his continued reversion to a self-promotional version that led to the calls for semi-protection and the alert on the admin announcements page.</li>

<li>Yes, ok we invented the sport. But we are trying to create publicity for it because its only known where we live. Surely other recently invented sports such as snowboarding had to go through this sort of process too, and look how far they have gone. What have you got to lose if it stays online anyway, its not as if it isn't played by people. It is a popular game where we live, and if given the opportunity I know it can go far.

<p>A non-notable periodical with a short history (fewer than 10 issues) and limited distribution (fewer than a dozen outlets) in local market (Albany, New York). I edited the article for NPOV a couple of weeks ago with request for someone to make a case for notability. No one did.

<dd>Wake up? Yes please. Simple maths will do the trick. I'm stunned to see that people are so blinded by Intelligent Designs wild and completely unproven guess of a single designing entity that they are unwilling to accept that picking a specific number (like the 1) in a completely unknown scenario is the most unlikely choice. <b>Always</b>. Simple maths will lead to the conclusion that IF you accept that designing entitites exist at all, that then there must have been more than one.</dd>
<dd>All these "nonsense!" (without ANY further explanations, ever) comments here are providing the impression that Intelligent Design gets accepted as the sole, valid "designing theory" on Wikipedia. Again, "ONE designing entitity" is nothing but a wild guess, "more than one designing entity" is a thesis that any calculus of probabilty confirms. --Twiw 20:36, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Blinded by Intelligent Design? Who are you talking to? Intelligent Design is a total crock. Multiple Designers is Multiple Crock. No matter how precisely you add up nonsense, it is still nonsense.

<dd><b>comment</b> multiple designers is maybe as plausable a hypothesis as a single designer. My main criticism with the article is the maths which tries to prove there must be one or more. Flawed on two counts, one its circular, the distribution of number of creators has been chosen to show theres more than one, choose a different distribution and you would get different probabilities, (this of course assumes that its even possible to have a disrtibution of designers. Which only possible if there is multiple universes). Its also flawed by an argument involving limits to infinity. The maths also seems to be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> as I can't find this mentioned elsewhere.</dd>

<li><b>Dont Delete</b>, look at the number of posts, not the number of members on forums. The admins deleted anyone who hadn't logged on in the past month, so that means 13,000 active members, more than most. Not to mention the fact it is a rapidly expanding site, expanding into many new games at a fairly fast rate. I looked at some of their statistics, and they are growing quite fast. I agree that each of their sub-sites should not have a Wiki page, but their main umbrella organization should. Rifleman000 21:40, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>After considering the above points I've come to the conclusion that I'm not going to be able to satisfy the criteria of the site. As the author I no longer hold an objection to this entry being deleted. --Waroftheworlds52 18:37, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Waroftheworlds52 did not create this entry for any reason other than a reference to the site, who's popularity is growing rapidly, NOT as an advertisement. MagicalTrevor</p>
<p><b>Keep.</b>User MagicalTrevor's statement is correct. This wikipedia entry was intended as a site reference and not an advertisement for the site. Furthermore, as proof of Ctrl-click.com's notability, it is the 7th result produced by the PageRank technology when searching for the query Ctrl-click on Google- <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ctrl-click&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ctrl-click&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ctrl-click&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=</a> . I realise this comment perhaps does not mirror my earlier sentiments but in the light of the recent comment by MagicalTrevor I felt it best to verify his statement. I would also like to point out that there is now a link to the ctrl-click.com collection of podcasts found via Apple Computer's iTunes software- surely the site is of some not if it produces podcasts worthy enough of a music download service which has recently sold over 1 billion tracks?--Waroftheworlds52 19:11, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

The variety of "natural" "healing" referred to here is Gerson "therapy" which consists largely of pouring coffee up your bottom an eating crushed fruit.

There is a hint of what is wrong with this, and a collection of other articles started by John in his comment above - the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> is a prominent and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> resource, but what John offers here - not in support of the article but in an attack on me and a class of editors and reputable professionals - is what <i>somebody else</i> is <i>said</i> to have <i>said</i> in the NYT. The tropes involved do circulate, the latter looks like rubbish to me, even based on last week's clinics, but the 85% one was tracked down by David Sackett to a conversation involving Archie Cochrane in New Zealand (if I recall correctly) and reported and examined on the evidence-based-health mailing list at jisc.ac.uk (formerly mailbase.ac.uk). Far from being true, it turns out to be inverted, with examination of the evidence base for the primary intervention in common significant conditions showing a clearly evidenced basis in around 85%! And all of that is entirely irrelevant to the afd, being simply an attack by <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">User:Whaleto</a> using whatever unreliable anecdotes he finds to breach <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.

<li><b>Wider Comment</b>. Stifle blanked the copyvio content in this article, Ombudsman has now reverted it, and removed the copyvio tag with no discussion here or on the article discussion page and providing no indication of a licence for this to be published here. In the several links to largely irrelevant afd discussions that <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">User:Whaleto</a> provided, there are edits by Ombudsman of other people's comments, and an edit of the discussion after the closing. Clearly the request on a closed discussion lacks the force of a direct order backed up by locking the database record, but all fo these acts seem to me to be objectionable, and part of a pattern of behaviour which has persisted despite periodic comments and exasperation by various other editors at least as long as I have known of Ombudsman. Is the contribution of the trio of Whaleto, Ombudsman and the anonymous IP address user calling himself "The Original Invisible Anon at 86.10.231.219" sufficient to outweigh the effort required to fix this sort of entry and the disruption caused by such behaviour and edits? <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 02:40, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A Zelda-based manga. Seems to be internet only - Less than 1,000 Google hits for quote "Bad Zelda", the bulk of which seem to be simply the term, and not about this manga.

<li><b>Keep</b>: This is one of only two Zelda hentais in existance. It's lack of circulation. It is indeed drawn in the manga style, so calling it that is appropriate. The reason for the lack of circulation is that it is originally written in french. 'Bad Zelda' is the english name it goes by. I am unsure of what the french translation would be, but that explains why it has not shown up on engines. Possibly a mirroring en francais article can be made. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 04:25, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There's some misunderstanding here. The first release of this software was nearly a year ago. The first "1.0" release was less than a week ago.<a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?diva" class="external autonumber" title="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?diva" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> This is also one of the most highly anticipated new pieces of software for open source platforms this year. Those who are using Unix and Linux for video editing are anxiously following this project. Existing project, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kino_%28software%29.html" title="Kino (software)">Kino</a> already has a page, so I'm not sure on what basis we would remove this one. BTW: I have nothing to do with the project, nor the article. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 03:27, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The first "release" in July 2005 was a "demo". The current release # is 0.0.1, which implies a "pre-release" — according to the Diva site, "The project is still in the early stages of development but we encourage you to try it out and get back to us with your comments." This is not a production release. Too early to have an article. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 03:37, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, I was wrong, sorry. Like I said, I'm not associated with the project. Yes, it's 0.0.1 and the Novell site I pointed to wasn't really helpful, as it was a non-functional flash-based demo. It's still a very important piece of software for Linux that many people have been anticipating. The digg article is highly ranked. <a href="http://digg.com/linux_unix/First_version_of_the_Diva_Video_Editor_has_been_released" class="external autonumber" title="http://digg.com/linux_unix/First_version_of_the_Diva_Video_Editor_has_been_released" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> It's also open source software. <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaim.html" title="Gaim">gaim</a> had an article here long before it was 1.0. Linux would have, but that was pre-Wikipedia. Firefox <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mozilla_Firefox&amp;oldid=832487" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mozilla_Firefox&amp;oldid=832487" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> had an article a year and a half prior to 1.0. Open source software is often widely used prior to 1.0, where proprietary software almost never is. The real question is: <b>how notable is this software</b>. As someone who knows some indie film makers, I can tell you that the lack of decent video editing for Linux has been a serious problem, and that diva has been widely anticipated for just that reason. It's a niche market, but among that niche, this is a bomb-shell. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 12:05, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: My company's software <a href="../../../f/o/r/FORscene_15e9.html" title="FORscene">FORscene</a> was thought non-notable in the AfD, even though it has been the subject of dozens of press articles and it has been used in the post-production of many broadcast programmes. And it won the Royal Television Society Award for best advance in post-production technology last December. So I'm looking for some consistency here. My personal view is that a lot of interesting software is deemed non-notable. The proposed new software guidelines may improve the situation.

<li><b>Comment</b> This page, which is essentially a list, contains many names of people who have no Wikipedia articles and have no source citations to show either that they positions they are said to hold, or that they have attended Rutgers and graduated in the year they are said to have graduate.

<p>How can you delete?- this is source based research as defined by Wikipedia rules <i>"However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia."</i> If it needs editing please give direction. I have responded to your comments already regarding blue links. I have also edited out personal analysis. Thx P. H. Betancourt-author</p>

<p>This is not to say that the article rises to the full quality standards of a "good" Wikipedia article. Not yet anyway.</p>
<p>I'm just saying that it is as good as many other articles. It still needs further work but I think that could be tagged as {needs cleanup} instead of {candidate for deletion}.</p>

In retrospect, I see that my original response to <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyre_122f.html" title="User:Gyre">Alex</a>'s criticism missed the point of his criticism. I thought he was suggesting that it was a bad idea to try to adapt to global warming. I see from the comments of others that the point is that Wikipedia should not have "how-to" instruction manuals. The article is not and was never intended to be a "how-to" instruction manual and <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyre_122f.html" title="User:Gyre">Alex</a> was wrong in characterizing it as such.</p>

<dd>Your criticism of the raison d'etre for this article sounds very POV to me. It is not the intent of the article to argue against global warming or even against mitigation of global warming.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>If global warming is a fact and if the world is unable to mitigate it quickly enough, there will be significant effects on the environment.

<dd>If these "doomsday scenarios" do come to pass, how will mankind survive? Those are the points that this article is meant address.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There is significant evidence that the world is being very slow to address global warming and that current attempts won't decrease the generation of CO2 quickly enough. Some people argue that irreparable damage has already been done and that temperatures will rise. From their POV, the only question is how much they will rise and whether we can stop them from rising even further.</dd>
</dl>
<p>IPCC Working Group II makes the following observations:</p>
<p>1) Adaptation is a necessary strategy at all scales to complement climate change mitigation Efforts.</p>
<p>2) Those with the least resources have the least capacity to adapt and are the most vulnerable</p>
<p>3) Adaptation, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sustainable_development.html" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a>, and enhancement of equity can be mutually reinforcing</p>

<p>No it doesn't. Read the article again. The proscription against "instruction manuals" is about "how-to" manuals primarily for individuals (tutorials, cookbooks, etc.).

<p>I think it is extremely POV to assert that the article cannot adapt to wiki standards. The original article was admittedly a stub and perhaps should have been labelled as such. I don't know if it is OR (original research?). Somebody else wrote the text. I do know that there is an IPCC report on Adaptation so the methods in that report would not constitute OR. It is no more a how-to article than the article on Mitigation is.

I hadn't realized that this had been suggested as a fork from <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitigation_of_global_warming.html" title="Mitigation of global warming">Mitigation of global warming</a>, either.

<p>Yes, it would seem redundant of <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitigation_of_global_warming.html" title="Mitigation of global warming">Mitigation of global warming</a>. That's where the original text was pulled from (at the suggestion of people on <a href="../../../m/i/t/Talk%7EMitigation_of_global_warming_04e4.html" title="Talk:Mitigation of global warming">Talk:Mitigation of global warming</a>).</p>
<p>No, it's not an instruction manual. Read the article again, please.</p>
<p>No, it's not original research (at least not by me). If there is OR in it, we can pull it out. There is a reputable source for the general topic and that is the IPCC report cited in the article and above. I cannot certify at this time that every item in the article can be sourced in the IPCC report but that's an argument for deleting parts of the article not the article itself. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 00:52, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All of the above comments are missing the point of the article. I admit that I contributed to this by not immediately challenging the characterization of this article as a "survival guide". Thus, the above comments seem to be based on the idea that this is a "how-to" guide. It is, sort of. It is a "how to guide" for policymakers and, as such, is describing policy alternatives that can be implemented at all scales from personal to national to regional and international. As such, it is the same type of article as <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitigation_of_global_warming.html" title="Mitigation of global warming">Mitigation of global warming</a>. All we're doing is separating out "Mitigation" from "Adaptation".</p>
<p>Please re-read the article. While some of the topics may seem like "how-to survive global warming" for individuals, at least half of the recommended measures are things that only corporations and governments can do (e.g. damming glacial moraines, weather control and increasing the capacity of stormwater systems).</p>
<p>Also, please read the discussion on [[Talk:Mitigation of global warming] about separating that article into two articles which is exactly what I have done in creating this article. I have already expanded the original article beyond the original stub text that was extracted from <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitigation_of_global_warming.html" title="Mitigation of global warming">Mitigation of global warming</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, please note that the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) specifically calls out Adaptation as being a necessary complement to Mitigation. (see references in my response to the original deletion recommendation by <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyre_122f.html" title="User:Gyre">Alex</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 00:28, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I agree. I am mining the IPCC report for material. Perhaps the creation of this article was premature. One of the writers on the Talk page for <a href="../../../m/i/t/Talk%7EMitigation_of_global_warming_04e4.html" title="Talk:Mitigation of global warming">Mitigation of global warming</a> said that he was waiting for the section to be further developed before creating this article.

</ul>
<p>I am continually frustrated by this kind of comment. The topic is encyclopedic although the article in its current form may not be.</p>
<p>I think that one contribution to Montco's POV is the following text in the article:</p>
<p>"If global warming is a fact and if the world is unable to mitigate it quickly enough, there will be significant effects on the environment. We cannot be pollyannaish and assume that global warming can and will be stopped. We must be prepared for the possibility that the predicted temperature rises will happen and that the expected climate changes will occur. If these "doomsday scenarios" do come to pass, how will mankind survive?</p>
<p>There is significant evidence that the world is being very slow to address global warming and that current attempts won't decrease the generation of CO2 quickly enough. Some people argue that irreparable damage has already been done and that temperatures will rise. From their POV, the only question is how much they will rise and whether we can stop them from rising even further."</p>
<p>I stand behind the ideas in the text but I suspect the wording sounds unencylopedic. I have deleted it from the article and will eventually put back something more encyclopedic.</p>

<li><b>Keep but cleanup</b>. The topic is encyclopedic, even if the current presentation needs a lot of work to reach encyclopedic standards. The topic used to be part of <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitigation_of_global_warming.html" title="Mitigation of global warming">Mitigation of global warming</a>, but the talk page comments there favored splitting off the adaptation portions, which Richard took it upon himself to do. The article should (and more or less does) focus on the role of adaptation within existing government-level strategies and recommendations for dealing with global warming. In this sense it is (or should be) a discussion of an important part of the political actions planned and taken in response to global warming, and not, as some people have suggested, a personal how-to manual. As an aside, might I suggest to Richard that it is not necessary to provide lengthy rebuttals to every negative comment made here. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 09:53, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
