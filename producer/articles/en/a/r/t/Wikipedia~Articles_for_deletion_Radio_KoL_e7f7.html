<p>Ok, so it gets a few thousand Google hits, but this is an internet radio station. I doubt it is notable. The article itself is quite poor, and needs cleanup, and the fact it includes a list of (presumably) forum user names isn't very promising. Internet radio stations generally aren't notable and I think this one isn't notable enough for it's own article. As it is part of a MMORPG, I think it should be <b>merged</b> in to <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a> or <b>deleted</b>. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 02:41, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>If you wish to improve the article now is the best time. I don't think the fact it is not ran on the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a> site is relevant, it is the KoL station and hence is best placed in the KoL article, otherwise I can't see the encyclopaedic notability. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 02:58, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This radiostation is extremely notable. We have a lot of poor stubs on webstations and I don't know why you decided to choose this particular article. I'll quote myself one more time. "I could explain in many ways, why the station is notable, I'd just say it's THE ONLY radiostation based around a MMORPG, not even Everquest has something similar. It works 24 hours a day, all djs are people who play the game and they waste up to 4 hours a day on the radio. A truly notable radiostation.". <i>radio "kingdom of loathing"</i> gets 5000 hits. The station is fully independent from the KoL, it is not part of the game and it's real, working and popular radiostation. It shouldn't be merged, but rather stay on it's own. Please research before proposing such ridiculous deletion requests. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 04:33, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd hardly say it was ridiculous. Web stations generally aren't notable, I did some research, and nothing came my way to show why this is notable. If this stays, the show articles should definetly go, or be merged. As you are the writer, i'd say strong keep is a bit POV, because its a 'Keep' at best. I'm perfectly justified in listing this VfD. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 16:48, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Your Google search is unfair, and brings up too many Kingdom of Loathing results. The search "Radio" "Kingdom of Loathing" brings up the same amount, although less than 5,000 hits is hardly notability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>needs revision</b>, if it's a popular radio station, then it's a popular radio station. The language is poor though, so I say keep&amp;revise. <a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel86</a> 05:27, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> No better than any of the millions of Internet radio stations.

<ul>
<li>Exactly. Furthermore, this station isn't one of the most popular ones - None of Shoutcast's front page stations have an article, bar Virgin Radio, as it is an FM feed. The fact Radio KoL only has 200 slots on a 24kbps mono stream means it could never be as notable as any of those stations - Why should this be an exception? The fact it is the only known MMORPG station is irrelevant, it can be explained in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 01:30, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>So how many radiostations can you name that have 24/7 of live shows, without replays or hour-long music sequences. I bet only a few. If there is one web-based radiostation that deserves its own article, it's that one. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 04:54, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shoutcast.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, theres a lot there with five times or more the listeners of Radio KoL. To my knowledge, only stations like <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digitally_Imported_eccf.html" title="Digitally Imported">Digitally Imported</a> deserve an article. Thats on Wikipedia and it is one of few that deserve inclusion. If this survives theres no way you can VfD any station with more than 120 listeners, which is just above what KoL had when I checked last night. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 17:18, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You know, these with thousands of listeners are commercial radiostations. As far as indie radios go, they couldn't be much more popular than rkol. However I was not talking about popularity here. You could have a bland dj-less top 40 radiostation, and it could be very popular. Or you could have an adfree radiostation with ~20 djs, each having his/her own unique personality, working for free, playing music that you won't hear anywhere else. Which of these deserves an article more? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 18:15, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The notable one, which is the Top 40 radio station with a lot of popular. A lot of those stations are not commercial. I've worked for non-commercial, 'indie' stations more popular than 'KoL'.

</li>
<li>I think this situation should be handled in the same way that any other article would. It is possible that someone might search of the phrase "Radio KoL". Would this search go to the appropriate page if it was merged with the "Kingdom of Loathing" page? If so, maybe they should be merged. <a href="../../../y/a/w/User%7EYawgm8th_36e0.html" title="User:Yawgm8th">yawgm8th</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>needs revision</b>. RKoL is unique. I don't really feel that comparisons to other streaming radio stations is fair, since it's not remarkable for being a radio station, but rather for being the only MMO-related, player run station. It's like comparing <a href="../../../k/o/e/Koeberg.html" title="Koeberg">Koeberg</a> to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_nuclear_reactors.html#United_States_of_America" title="List of nuclear reactors">a lot of the US reactors</a>. The only reason Koeberg has an article while they don't is because Koeberg is <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>'s only commercial Nuke power plant. Same with RKoL, it's the only MMO station. And yes I am a South African KoL player <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynkronos_6af1.html" title="User:Synkronos">Synkronos</a> 13:09, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>(Above user has 10 edits, of which 5 are to the KoL page.)</i> Being the only commercial nuclear power station in South Africa is a convergence of three general qualities - there are loads of commercial power stations, loads of nuclear power stations, and loads of power stations in South Africa, but only one which is all three. "MMORPG-connected", however, is verging on the trivial. OK, there are lots of radio stations, and lots of Internet sites. Most netradio operations are run by amateurs with no experience of broadcasting for real, so "player-run" doesn't really say anything. But while there are lots of MMORPGs, there are few things which you can say are MMORPG-related. It's like saying I'm notable for being the only DJ on my small station to recycle TV presentation elements from the 1980s on a music quiz show (which I do, to great effect). <a href="../../../1/3/1/User%7E131.251.0.8.html" title="User:131.251.0.8">131.251.0.8</a> 15:28, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC) (This is me forgetting to sign in first. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 15:36, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly <b>merge</b>. I have edited the entry at great length - and yes, this is the first time I've contributed to Wikipedia, but hopefully that does not count against me in some nebulous manner (considering the <i>point</i> of a wiki is for people with knowledge of an article to edit it, even if it's the first time they've done so or even stumbled upon the page.) Hopefully the new entry describes the uniqueness of the station a bit better. That being said, I don't believe there's a problem with making it a sub-section of <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a> as long as that does not obstruct a search for <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_KoL_eaa6.html" title="Radio KoL">Radio KoL</a> - and the personality pages that have popped up should <i>definitely</i> be sub-sections of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_KoL_eaa6.html" title="Radio KoL">Radio KoL</a>. 155.41.112.1 15:44, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I understand the use of four tildes as a signature, and used that originally. However, I wished to indicate that I did have a name beyond an IP address, so I assumed a change that would still point to the IP but with different link text was valid.

<li><b>Request for Clarification</b>. Is that bar set similarly high for games? If so, I am curious why Kingdom of Loathing itself ranks worthy of an article but its radio station doesn't rank worthy of a sub-article (since this user voted for deletion and not merge). <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaplo3k_142a.html" title="User:Haplo3k">Haplo3k</a> 02:20, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>This would be based on <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a>'s claims that the station doesn't belong in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a>, which I think it does. As for games, they are published material, but again games get deleted often if they aren't notable. In this case the MMORPG is just about above the line of notability, but 'just another internet radio station' isn't notable. The fact it is the only one attached to a MMORPG doesn't change that fact. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:36, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> On Shoutcast.com, Radio KoL is currently ranked 323 by number of listeners. Even with their capacity filled the station could not enter the top 200. This removes any suggestion of 'popular radio station', because by wide standards, it isn't 'up there' with the notable stations. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:43, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I was under the impression that sometimes things are notable because they are unique, no matter how popular they are. Radio KoL caters to a specific group of people, and is the first internet radio station to be created with that purpose. There's no way we could increase our listener numbers without losing our individuality (not to mention the fact that we couldn't afford it). The reason I, and others, think that Radio KoL is worthy of note (whether as article or subarticle) is <i>because</i> of this uniqueness. I completely understand that this is a slippery slope, that you don't want to be forced to include every internet radio station with 5 listeners that pops up claiming to be unique - but please note that I am arguing here <i>against votes for deletion</i> and completely support a merge. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaplo3k_142a.html" title="User:Haplo3k">Haplo3k</a> 17:06, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The above was a note to counter 'keep' comments suggesting it is a popular radio station. Increasing the capacity would be irrelevant, the station listener number fluctuates inbetween 100 and 130 daily. As for uniqueness, everything that is unique does not warrant an article. Stations for online gaming (MMORPG goes under that on a wider scale) are common - a lot of clans have small stations, like Radio KoL. None are notable. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 18:33, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow, 323. It is actually much higher than I expected. Certainly very high for a non-commercial station. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 18:49, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Most of those in front of you aren't commercial. Theres about 75 commercial stations in the top 300, i'd estimate. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:29, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for several reasons. 1) It's pretty notable 2) So that the individual show/DJ articles can have someplace to be merged to and 3) if merged into the main KoL article it would eventually be merged right back out when that gets too big. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 20:58, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd like you to explain the notability more. How is it any more notable than any other random 150 listener internet station? The argument presented is that it is the only MMORPG station, which contradicts the argument for not merging that it isn't an MMORPG station directly. It doesn't seem to be any more notable than your typical clan station or IRC radio. As for the article getting too big, that doesn't seem to be the case. The individual DJ articles can easily go into <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a> under a Radio KoL section. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 21:33, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge or keep</b>, prefer "keep", based on size. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:27, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I voted to merge the DJs and content writers to this article, but after reading a few more days of postings and asking some friends with interest in MMORPGs or independent broadcasting, I still think RKoL is sufficiently pioneering to be worth keeping an article. In a year or two, there will be dozens of these, and most won't have notability worth WP inclusion, but RKoL seems to have begun something more significant (technologically and socially) than "your typical clan station" or radio-game-chat. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:30, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge or Keep</b> -- If kept, it needs some work. For starters the specific DJ names should be removed, and some note of the station's interactive nature with respect to the game should be included. The inclusion of DJ names makes this sound less like a presentation of interesting information so much as self-congratulatory back patting. If that's the point, then <a href="http://www.everything2.com" class="external text" title="http://www.everything2.com" rel="nofollow">e2</a> might be a better place for this. As a DJ on said radio station, I feel it's unique enough to warrant its own article, but only if it's written in a way that explains why it's unique (24/7 live staffing, its interactive nature, the back-and-forth with the game, etc.), but I don't really have an issue with merging it either. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChungkuo_4112.html" title="User:Chungkuo">Chungkuo</a> 15:38, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As mentioned, user is biased for station as is a member. I'm looking forward to adding the two hundred or so stations more notable than KoL.<a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:53, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"More notable" in which sense: innovation, listener count, Google hits, or what? I agree with Chungkuo that the most noteworthy bits need to be added or expanded so the article establishes the notability that some voters don't see, but how many of those "two hundred or so" stations have done some substantially new thing like RKoL seems to have done? I write this as someone not associated with KoL or RKoL, and as someone who doesn't do any similar form of online gaming.</li>
