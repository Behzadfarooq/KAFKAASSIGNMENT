That doesn't mean they aren't verifiable, of course, but I'd expect to find something. An article that claims the existence of a dialect, I think, should be deleted if no citations can be provided to validate the claim. However, I'm not familiar with this topic, so I don't know what may or may not exist in the academic literature. I'd say leave it with the unreferenced notice, put up a factual accuracy dispute notice if you challenge its validity, and start looking for some sources one way or the other. If it really is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>, and there's some research to back that up, then it should be relisted on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfD</a>. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 08:49, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I can confirm that official sites in Hawai'i use the spelling of the Hawai'ian language for Hawai'ian words. The official State of Hawai`i website at <a href="http://www.hawaii.gov/portal/" class="external free" title="http://www.hawaii.gov/portal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hawaii.gov/portal/</a> uses the spelling Hawai`i. The article has been around for a long time and seems well-researched. Note, however, that a Google search for "Hawaiian English" will turn up a lot of bilingual Hawaiian-to-English dictionaries rather than a description of the standard English spoken and written in Hawai'i. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 08:59, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Here's what I just added to the stub/article's talk page. It quotes from the constitution to show that essential points of the stub/article are obviously FALSE. According to Wikipedia policies, the burden to verify is on those who want to keep, not on those who want to remove. Agent X 09:27, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"OFFICIAL LANGUAGES</p>
<p>Section 4. English and Hawaiian shall be the official languages of Hawaii, except that Hawaiian shall be required for public acts and transactions <i>only as provided by law</i>. [Add Const Con 1978 and election Nov 7, 1978]" (italic added for emphasis)</p>
<p>1. As correctly noted above by Bugmuncher, there is NO SUCH THING as "Hawaiian English" in "The Constitution of the State of Hawaii". It is "English", NOT "Hawaiian English", that is an official language of the State of Hawaii. The stub/article makes a FALSE statement and misrepresents the law.</p>
<p>2. Hawaiian language is NEVER REQUIRED in any State of Hawaii activities UNLESS specifically "provided by law". There are NO STATE LAWS requiring the use of Hawaiian language. The stub/article makes another FALSE statement, and again misrepresents the law.</p>
<p>3. The mere optional use of a macron and an opening single quote (so-called <i>`okina</i>), by certain enthusiasts (zealots), does NOT create a "dialect" of English.</p>
<p>4. The claim that use of the two marks is preferred by the majority of Hawaii's people is the DELUSION of an "okina lunatic".</p>
<p>5. The stub/article uses the word "Standard" to describe "Hawaiian English". There is NO SUCH THING as "Standard Hawaiian English". Where are the alleged "standards"? Where are they published? Who has the authority to fabricate such "standards"?</p>
<p>6. The stub/article has NOT ONE reference, and NOT ONE citation. According to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_Sources_cbb8.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing Sources">Wikipedia:Citing Sources</a>, "any material that is challenged and has no source may be removed by any editor". According to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, "The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to keep the material, not on those seeking to remove it."</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Okay, really, you could have just linked the talk page. However, from reading this, uh, diatribe, it seems to me like there's some POV pushing going on here. Anyway, let me throw out a few academic references that I skimmed, courtesy of <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a>. Standard English and Student Bodies: Institutionalizing Race and Literacy in Hawai'i (Young, M., 2002; College English 64:4) addresses the way the pidgin and ASE have clashed up until now, with some specific information on the varying uses of it in the culture. There's also the ancient The English Dialect of Hawaii (Reinecke, J. E., &amp; Tokimasa, A., 1934; American Speech 9:1) which does, however, seem to address the creole more specifically. English Patterns in Hawaii (Odo, C., 1970; American Speech 45:3/4) talks about Hawaiian English specifically. Just by looking at JSTOR's results, it seems that what academic literature there is a bit old and may well be talking about <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii_Creole_English_d53d.html" title="Hawaii Creole English">Hawaii Creole English</a> instead. Perhaps this article ought to be redirected there instead of deleted? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreelanceWizard_3a94.html" title="User talk:FreelanceWizard">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FreelanceWizard_60d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/FreelanceWizard">contribs</a>)  on 10:09, August 6, 2006.

<li>The above comment is unsigned, so it's not clear who to address. Anyway, pointing out that certain statements in an encyclopedia article are false is a community service, not "POV pushing". Note that the article/stub clearly attempts to distinguish "Hawaiian English" from "Hawaiian Pidgin". So the suggestion to redirect to "Hawaii Creole English" does not fly.

<li><b>Delete unless completely rewritten before the AFD is over</b>. Hawaiian English exists, of course, but it is not a written standard distinct from American English, as the article implies. Hawaiian English is the variety of American English <i>spoken</i> in Hawaii; to some extent it overlaps with acrolectal <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian_Creole_English_78e5.html" title="Hawaiian Creole English">Hawaiian Creole English</a>. I'm sure plenty can be said about how the Hawaiian accent differs from <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_American_db80.html" title="General American">General American</a> and what the lexical differences are, provided reliable sources are cited. If the article is rewritten based on those sources, I'll change my vote. But the current version of the article is rubbish and should be deleted. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 10:17, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete unless completely rewritten before the AFD is over</b>. Does the user who nominated for deletion get to vote? If not, ignore my vote. Otherwise, I second the comments of user Angr. The existing main text, which has been around for about 2 years now, is factually incorrect. When the clearly false statements are removed, there's next to nothing left.
<p>I have lived in Hawaii for about 50 years. Do any of you find my writing to constitute a "standard dialect" of "Hawaiian English"? If I had not told you that I've lived in Hawaii for 50 years, would you have known, from my written English, that I have?</p>
<p>Hawaii is very diverse linguistically. Diversity wreaks havoc on "standardness". Our statewide community is one of the most racially mixed, economically mixed, socially mixed, educationally mixed, and linguistically mixed, in the USA. We have over 800,000 short-term visitors (tourists) per year, nearly equalling our total population. A significant portion of our residents are military personnel and families who move on to their next assignment after a few years here. We have significant continuous immigration from around the world, and many locally born-and-raised people move away as adults because the <i>median</i> cost for a house is over $600,000 and most of us can't afford that. In such a dynamic, transient, and diverse population, you don't get a "standard" dialect of anything. If you search long enough, you might be able to find books that make almost any claims that you want to "verify". But just because something got published, that doesn't guarantee that it's claims are true. Anyway, if one of you people who want to keep the "Hawaiian English" article manages to write up an intelligent piece that does not make clearly false claims, that will be okay with me. But the current "rubbish", as Angr correctly described it, must be DELETED. Agent X 11:55, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Half-page entry on ppg 463-4, covering distinctive features, vocabulary, local usage (like giving directions: "Go <i>ewa</i> one block, turn <i>makai</i> at the traffic light, go two blocks Diamond Head, and you'll find the place on the <i>mauka</i> side of the street"). And before you ask, there are separate entries for "Hawaii", "Hawaiian", "Hawaii Creole English", AND "Hawaii Pidgin English", so no, they're no confusing "Hawaiian English" with anything else. And the nom's ranting about the <a href="../../../o/k/i/Okina.html" title="Okina">okina</a> is contradicted by the "Hawaiian" article, where it describes the glottal stop "where some have /k/, marked in technical writing by a reverse inverted apostrophe (’) and in general usage by an ordinary apostrophe (') (<i>mu’umu’u</i> or <i>mu'umu'u</i> for <i>mukumuku</i>, a loose-fitting woman's dress)..."

<ul>
<li>To Calton --- You call The Constitution of the State of Hawaii a "weird tangent". It's quoted above. You should try reading the discussion, with comprehension, before opening your mouth. You should also read the article nominated for deletion. As you can see, if you actually read the relevant discussion above, I seconded the comments of Angr, who pointed out that a dialect is spoken language, as opposed to written. It is the writer of the Hawaiian English article, not me, who has claimed that the use of okinas in WRITING has created a dialect of American English. In asking if anyone finds my writing to constitute a "standard dialect" of "Hawaiian English", I am pointing out that nobody can. Apparently that was "over your head". As for your comment about glottal stops, you are demonstrating profound ignorance. The stuff you quoted relates to Hawaiian, NOT to Hawaiian English. In the historical development of the Hawaiian phonemes, Proto Polynesian <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">*k</span> is reflected as Hawaiian <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʔ/</span>. Diachronic sound changes do not take place instantly throughout the lexicon, some words are like stragglers, and some simply resist a sound change even though the change affects nearly every other word in the language. That's why there are some variant forms, like <i>mukumuku</i> and <i>mu`umu`u</i>. The older form has <i>k</i>, the newer form has glottal stop. But again, your quote is totally irrelevant to Hawaiian English, and it demonstrates that you don't know what you're talking about. If you are interested in Hawaiian phonology, check out my contributions to the <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian_language.html" title="Hawaiian language">Hawaiian language</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian_phonology.html" title="Hawaiian phonology">Hawaiian phonology</a> pages. When I first contributed to the Hawaiian language page, before having a user account, I put in a citation. It was the first and only citation in the article. Every single citation that's in the article now was put in by me. As for the use of directional expressions, like "mauka" or "makai", it's not something that everyone has to use. I've been speaking English in Hawaii for about 50 years, and I don't use "mauka" or "makai". Some people do. But the usage of "some people" does not make it "standard" for all speakers. When I speak Hawaiian (not "Hawaiian English"), which I speak fluently, then I use <i>ma uka</i> and <i>ma kai</i>, or <i>i uka</i> and <i>i kai</i>, or <i>ā uka</i> and <i>ā kai</i>, as appropriate in a given context. But I don't use those expressions when I speak English, which is my first language. The mere usage of four directional expressions, by a subset of people (who are probably trying too hard to show that they are "local"), is not very significant, and is not enough to justify an encyclopedia article on a "dialect". A dialect is characterized by speech behavior which is automatic and generally beyond the conscious control of the speaker, as opposed to optional, conscious selections of lexical items and expressions.

What the Constitution of the State of Hawaii -- or the constitution of any state -- has to to do with the recognition of a dialect is, well, nothing whatsoever.</li>
<li><i>Every single citation that's in the article now was put in by me.</i> Some advice: if you're going to write something untrue, try not to do so with things that are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hawaiian_English&amp;diff=69112367&amp;oldid=67974411" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hawaiian_English&amp;diff=69112367&amp;oldid=67974411" rel="nofollow">easily checked</a>. Makes it easy to catch you, don't you know.</li>
<li><i>A dialect is characterized by speech behavior which is automatic...</i> You have a source for this definition, other than your nether regions? And how, exactly, does it apply here? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:34, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maybe a disambiguation page can help. The 3 expressions "Hawaiian Pidgin (English)", "Hawaiian Creole English", and "Hawaiian English", can be easily confused by people who have not previously considered technical linguistic terminology such as "pidgin" (not originally a first language for anyone), versus "creole" (a pidgin which has become a first language for at least some people), versus a U.S.-State-reckoned geographical variety of English ("Hawaii English", "Oregon English", "Arizona English", etc.). I would not be surprised if some publications have used the phrase "Hawaiian English" to mean the same thing as "Hawaiian Creole English" or "Hawaiian Pidgin", rather than to mean "the first-language English of people raised in the U.S. State of Hawaii, which is not creole (nor pidgin)". Perhaps there could be an article titled something like "English in Hawaii". Such an article could point out the simultaneous co-existence of many different Englishes in Hawaii, along with many other languages, and discuss the influences of those languages on "Englishes spoken in Hawaii". Since Hawaii has tourists from all 50 U.S. states, off-and-on all year long, every year, every different State-reckoned English is constantly being spoken in Hawaii. We also have Japanese-accented English, Filipino-accented English, Thai-accented English, etc., etc. However, supporting published sources may be lacking for such an article. Perhaps the only one of the different "Englishes of Hawaii" that has enough published discussion to support an encyclopedia article is the pidgin/creole. If <b>redirect</b> means that the current "Hawaiian English" stub/article will be eliminated, then that's okay with me. Agent X 15:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
