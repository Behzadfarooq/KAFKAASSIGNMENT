<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). For those interested my vote count shows 9 to delete, 5 to keep which is short of a two-thirds majority anyway. Furthermore, there is agreement that "Jumping the couch" is a neologism, but the keep voters are arguing that <i>this</i> neologism is notable for some reason, and have backed it up with some evidence. Second, there is at least one delete vote which wants part of the article moved to <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumping_the_shark.html" title="Jumping the shark">Jumping the shark</a>, this would probably require at least a redirect to be left behind to remain GFDL compliant. I also get the impression that many of the complaints to this article is that it is awfully similar to the more common "Jumping the Shark" phrase. I would like to point out that my closing of this debate as a "keep" does <i>not</i> mean that it's impossible to merge this article with something else if anybody will be <b><a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a></b> and do it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:26, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Jumping the shark" is not a neologism, whereas "jumping the couch" is. Also, the examples used are highly POV. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 14:59, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This particular neologism is getting a fair amount of press coverage, and gets far more hits than indicated above.

<li><b>Delete</b> At this point, I can't consider this a term so much as it is a current media joke: it's a pun-- the equivallent of having an article about a quip that Letterman said last night in his monologue. It might catch on as <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a> but even if it did, this article would only serve as a dictionary definition followed by POV examples. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarkingdoc_2a20.html" title="User:Barkingdoc">BarkingDoc</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and for three reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The assertion that this article's topic is "not notable," especially when that assertion is not backed up with evidence or argument, is no reason to delete this entry. There are many entries in Wikipedia that most people would not consider notable. That gives us no reason to delete those entries, however. Wikipedia aspires to be a collection of all human knowledge, whether that knowledge is notable or not. Indeed, perhaps the more esoteric an entry is, the more useful it is; it serves a purpose that is likely not served elsewhere on the web.</li>
<li>That the article is allegedly POV is absolutely no reason to delete it. If it's POV, then alter it so that it's neutral. Many people believe the entry on President Bush is POV. Does that give us a reason to delete that article, though? An article's non-neutrality is no reason, by itself, to delete the article.</li>
<li>The fact that this entry has been referenced by another website, and a significant one at that, is further proof that this entry is serving a useful purpose. Shouldn't we be doing everything to make sure that Wikipedia is a popular and frequently used reference source? Deleting this article would be doing precisely the opposite.</li>

<li><b>Comment on the last post</b> - In reply to your points
<ol>
<li>The pressure should be on the <i>keep</i> camp to prove notabilty. NOT on the <i>delete</i> camp to prove non-notabilty. Proving notabilty (if notable) should be a lot easier, anyway.</li>
<li>I agree here. POV article should be edited, no deleted. Non-notable articles should be deleted.</li>
<li>I personally wouldn't consider being linked to by one site (even a major one) proof that the article is notable. However, I can understand that others would. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a>)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b>. Curious. Why should the burden of proof be on the "keep" camp? Because of the open-endedness of the Wikipedia project, it seems to me only natural that the burden of proof for non-notability should be on the "delete" camp.
