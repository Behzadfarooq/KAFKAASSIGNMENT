<li><b>Delete</b> While this event was sad, but the fact is, it is a one missing persons case. One. Uno. Thousands and thousands of people go missing each year, and just because this one person goes missing they instantly get a long page about them. What about all of the others? Where is their page? It can't just be me who thinks that the only reason this page exists is because person was a white teenage suburbanite. I would bet anything that if this happened in another country, or if this person was another race. I don't see this as even one bit fair. Where are the other missing people's wiki sites? It's simply not just, and I find it intresting that this person was seen leaving, not being dragged out kicking and screaming, but leaving under her own will. And so I ask once again, why have this page here, why have this pie in all of the other missing person's face here? Delete this, and prevent Wikipedia from becoming a sensationalist media network <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChange1211_cdfe.html" title="User:Change1211">Change1211</a> 00:28, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I do fail to see how this is a recent news article, as it was almost a year ago. And also, yes, there was another case like this one. I am also not saying that either page earned the attention they recieved. And shouldn't there be a page about the sensationalist American media, not stated in an unrelated article. And about the Elizabeth Smart case. First, she was abducted, she didn't leave willingly with three males out of a bar. And second, it's very uncommon for these stories to have a happy ending, so I'm in favor of keeping the Elizabeth Smart page. Bottom line, if it wasn't for all of the media attention, which is the main aspect of this page, then the page wouldn't even exist. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChange1211_cdfe.html" title="User:Change1211">Change1211</a> 02:04, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Sigh. Think of it this way. Is Holloway a subject that a significant enough number of people could seek information about? Given the amount of media attention that you so clearly loathe (and I also loathe), the answer is undoubtedly YES.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just because she probably <i>shouldn't</i> be notable doesn't mean she isn't. Good rule of thumb: if somebody is at the center of a media frenzy, they probably are notable.

<dd>Actually, that isn't following the same logic. George Bush already has an article so an item like that would simply be added to it. It wouldn't require a separate article. There is only one article about the Natalee Holloway disappearance so anything regarding that (Natalee herself, media attention, etc.) all belongs in the article you are so ardently trying to remove. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 04:48, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I feel that this needs to be kept up since it was a media blitz story of the last year. Although there are thousands of missing people happening each year, there are the few cases the media picks up and runs with. It may not be very worthy of space but remember this has become apart of history, as stupid as it may sound. I have to agree with Mr. Lefty on this one and say that if we delete this one, then why not delete <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Smart_ac0a.html" title="Elizabeth Smart">Elizabeth Smart</a> or <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Hoffa_c99c.html" title="Jimmy Hoffa">Jimmy Hoffa</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_A._Mutch_62e6.html" title="Thomas A.

<li><b>Keep</b> if I'm here in a very distant cold country, and back in the day I said "who the heck is Natalee Holloway, and why are Americans raising that much noise about her?" in the exact same context as I'd say that about, say, Elian Gonzales, it probably indicates that there was enough media noise and we, the unknowing foreigners, just <i>may</i> be interested to know what the <i>heck</i> that noise was all about.

<li>It, like many of our other wikineologisms, has however been used as explanation of the logic behind a speedy keep---if not a justification, per se---and as a reason for withdrawal of AfDs by the nominator. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 14:36, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Should speedy keeps that have been closed as such be re-opened, then? How about articles that have been deleted with people using <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">WP:BALLS</a> as a reason, should they be restored? I know these are absurd things to suggest, but I'm not convinced that an absolute rejection of essays and/or summerized common arguements in AfDs is the best way to go. Regardless of our differing takes on wikilogisms, however, is there anything in this AfD that requires it to not be a speedy keep? <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 15:13, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wouldn't protest, actually. We should certainly have some speedy keep criteria, and we in fact <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">do have some</a>. But when people quote divisive essays like <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">WP:BALLS</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>, and <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> in an attempt to sway an AfD, it's no good, and no AfD should be closed with those in mind. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 15:17, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The media attention provides a level of notability above many other missing people's cases. Plus this has made her something of a symbol for missing people, too. Wikipedia does "breaking news"-based articles all the time. Later, when and if she's located, I could see this being rolled into another article.

<li><b>Keep</b>, with one thing in mind. I believe that this story, due to the amount of media exposure it recieved and continues to recieve deserves its own page. However, all of the sub-pages on this topic should be merged into it, with the distant possible exception of the Van Der Sloot family page, although I would be in favor of merging that too. There is no reason to have individual pages for Natalee's parents, or the police officials in the case. The only notoriety for those people comes from this one incidident, and the disappearance of one woman is not historically important enough to warrant a tree of articles. Perhaps this article should be renamed "Dissapearance of Natalee Holloway", and all other articles merged. We also need to consider the possibility that this story will become an unsolved mystery forever, and not an emerging news article.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - by leaps and bounds. We're not in the business of second guessing what much of the world thinks is important and noteworthy. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:29, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
