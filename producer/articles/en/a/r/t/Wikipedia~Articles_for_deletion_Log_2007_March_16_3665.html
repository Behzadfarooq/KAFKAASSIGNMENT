<dd><b>Merge will not work</b> because the resulting article would then be self-contradictory and would be utterly confusing. Let me give you an example: the Total Chaos article talks about using the undo button and capturing creatures but those features don't even exist in Chaos: Wizard War I. Every game produced by Team Chaos has its own unique features, flaws, quirks, monsters, spells, method of customisation and so on. Merging just won't work because the subjects of the articles are different. GreatGianaSister 06:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> the article needs work, and that's for sure. But don't delete it, it's too much to Merge, and seems to big to condense well after reading swiftly through it.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Every article on wikipedia needs improvement, including this one. So improve it! I find it totally hilarious that Marasmusine has lost his temper and proposed to delete the article when Team Chaos just released a major new game at Christmastime, is mentioned on various Amiga news sites in the last 90 days and Team Chaos is in this month's issue of Amiga Future Magazine which currently seems to be winning the "Best Amiga Magazine" poll on Amiga.org. Smooth move Marasmusine. GreatGianaSister 06:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My proposal is a merge, not a delete; since you wouldn't allow the merge proposal tag to stay up for even a day (along with other maintaince tags and even this CfD tag), that's why I've brought it to Articles for Discussion.</dd>
<dd>Let me make my proposal again; the entirity of the Team Chaos page talks about the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Chaos_2f18.html" title="Total Chaos">Total Chaos</a> series of games (and provides no references for Team Chaos themselves). Why not merge that information into the Total Chaos article? It's not uncommon to have a single page represent a series of games; <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/Sangokushi.html" title="Sangokushi">Sangokushi</a></i> for example. The Team Chaos article shows that the games have the same basic gameplay, but with each iteration improving on the graphics and features, so should be resonably easy to set up (especially if the 'Rules of the game' section is trimmed down.) <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 07:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> This should never have been listed for delection. User is holding a grudge. Merge is inappropriate and would produce mass incongruity. SuperfrogJumps 09:08, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect per nom. There is no real need for this article when the parent article not only exists but would be significantly improved by the inclusion of content from this one. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 10:46, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Because the nominator is confused. Next subject: The merge idea is stupid because Chaos: Return of the Wizards has different rules than Total Chaos which also has different rules from Chaos: WWII which also has different rules from the next game they make. StoneGiant 12:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well when the bulk of the article is a table that says 'The entire Total Chaos series', with each successive game having 'significant new features' over the last, and there's a paragraph that even outlines the common gameplay it's pretty easy to see how I might have got 'confused' over thinking that the Total Chaos series was a series of similar computer games. I'll also note that all the independent references only refer to <i>Total Chaos: Battle at the Frontier of Time</i>; There's nothing about any of the other games (Unless that Retro Gamer review is one of the other Total Chaos games), or about Team Chaos themselves. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 14:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - A redirect with a couple of merged facts is probably warranted though. All of the secondary material available is about Total Chaos, there's not much about Team Chaos itself.

<dd>I don't have any problem with the archived interview. I've arranged the external links into subject (and removed the dead link to the 'home page' and the google search results link.) There's plenty of reference there suitable for the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Chaos_2f18.html" title="Total Chaos">Total Chaos</a> page, but still not much to justify a seperate Team Chaos article. I'm not sure about the notability of the references.</dd>
<dd>I've also raised an issue on <a href="../../../t/o/t/Talk%7ETotal_Chaos_b4d9.html" title="Talk:Total Chaos">Talk:Total Chaos</a>; if that page not ment to represent the whole series of games (and not just one game) why does the infobox show release dates from 1986 to the present (and the opening sentence confirms this)?

<dd>The <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Chaos_2f18.html" title="Total Chaos">Total Chaos</a> article is meant to be about the Total Chaos series of games <b>only</b>. It is <b>not</b> meant to be about Chaos: Wizard War II (which I noticed you deleted the link out of the article) nor is it meant to be about Chaos: Return of the Wizards. The problem is that if we cram in those extra games then it sounds simple and easy doesn't it? But then ... you come to realize that the whole article then needs to be rewritten with lots of IF-THEN statements or other form of comments mucking up the article such as "This paragraph does not apply to Chaos: Wizard War II" or "blahblahblah except in Chaos: Wizard War II in which case yadayadayada". I sure as hell am not going to try to go through and fix all that, if it is even possible. StoneGiant 12:03, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I'm somewhat unsure of this article. Sure, the 114th Congress will happen, but it won't start until 2015.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see any reason to create this stub so far in advance. We might want to get rid of the other future Congress stubs too.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It would be against common sense to delete it if maybe it was sooner, but 8 years away is a long time.

<p>The result was <b>KEEP</b>. Since nomination, the article has been somewhat rewritten to remove the attack tone. The article is certainly referenced. Is the person notable? I would say that being notorious is not the same as being notable, but that argument was not made. Most every commentor conceded his notability. Does the article violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>? In my view it does not, being rigorously referenced. I did not even count the votes because of the many puppets, but base the close strictly on strength of argument, which falls to the Keep view in my opinion. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 13:05, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Massive, well-referenced attack page. The history is filled with too many anon edits to accurately sort out, but in its current state this article is in dire violation of BLP.

<dd>To begin with, this article is basically libel bait. Over the past two hours I've seen editors add and subtract personal information, baseless speculation, and random accusations. The tone of this article is nowhere near <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia standards for neutrality</a>. I don't much care if the content is credible, my concern is that this is a biography tailored for the sole reason of disparaging its subject. Wikipedia is not a vehicle for character assassination, and the massive involvement by various blogs is detrimental to building any sort of encyclopedic article. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 03:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Serin is actually fairly well known among those discussing the housing bubble online. His blog has an Alexa ranking of 46,633, and has 130 pages linking in. I do agree that the page appears to violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and should be rewritten. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 03:27, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As a Realtor, and having followed the Casey Serin story since early October, and doing a good amount of reasearch on public records regarding his transactions, I believe the Casey Serin article is fair, accurate and unbiased as of 20:22 PST USA on 03/15/2007. There is considerable interest in the Mainstream Media about the story of Casey Serin, and the legal ramifications of his real estate transactions. Removing this article would be a disservice to Wikipedia, considering all the work and research that has gone into its creation. It is not an attack page. Instead, it is a well-researched and documented page that is important, regarding current real estate lending practices in the USA.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or revise to be consistent with NPOV/BLP policies and protect from further edits. The page seems designed to humiliate and harass the subject. Since its inception, it has included offensive or insulting references to Serin's religion, nationality, marriage, family relationships, and appearance - none of which seem particularly relevant. I also question the repeated posting of his family members' names, photographs, and contact information. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESaranary_c55d.html" title="User:Saranary">Saranary</a> 03:48, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think an article on Casey Serin should exist, but to claim that the article in its current form is unbiased is laughable. Do neutral encyclopedia articles contain phrases like "Visitors to his blog are usually surprised at his smug comments, where it's obvious he doesn't believe he has done anything wrong, and that he deserves a lifestyle which includes several luxuries he can't afford to pay" and "Serin's personal eccentricities: his habitually unkempt haircut, his carrying a murse (which he refers to as his "man bag"), and his obsession with juicing"? Like I said, I believe an article on Casey Serin should exist, but only if it adheres to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 03:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(edit conflict) Right now its little more than a liability. Serin's story is interesting, but not because of him as a person. Journalist coverage indeed used him as a "posterboy" to illustrate the volatile and absurd state of the real estate market. In a surprising (and not a little narcissistic) twist, Serin embraced this image, and created a blog. All of the negative comments, the structure, research, and defacement of his article are the result of this circus. There are hundreds of speculators who are in debt because of stupid business decision, singling Sarin out to illustrate the phenomenon is simply a poor basis for establishing a fair biography. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 04:06, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree there's nothing inherently notable about Serin, except that other people have decided to talk about him. I guess that makes him the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> of real estate --- famous for being famous. But if people are talking about him, that makes him notable, even if by more objective standards he's not unusual. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 04:15, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Depends, do claims of dubious notoriety trump the BLP/NPOV requirements of neutrality and doing no harm? Plenty of people were talking about Brian Peppers at one point, yet his article was little more than a freakshow. I'd rank Serin's claim of notability somewhere above Peppers' and quite a ways below Paris Hilton's. Hilton, at least, has a widely documented public image and a mainstream modelling/acting career. Serin has a series of technologically adept bloggers who actively maintain a clearly outlined smear campaign. I sure as hell wouldn't want to monitor this article for impropriety if it is kept, I'd go insane after a day's worth of back-and-forth edits! ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 04:30, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, but edit out certain parts</b>* The entire story is pretty much verifiable, it is the tone that is the problem. Please note that this problem did not exist until Serin asked for it to be edited on his blog. Until then, it was very neutral and informative.

<dd>Then we edit it to neutrality. Considering that Serin is relatively famous and an very telling example of the subprime meltdown, which is a very hot and current topic in the US, the article should be kept. I dont have a problem editing it down to a more neutral tone, but much of what was on there prior was a stub entry, last I had seen it before this mess. In addition, we cant blame all the edits on exurban. Serin opened up his blog to unmoderated comments for a few hours once, and the vehement posted was NOTHING like we're seeing here.

<li><b>Keep</b>; Serin has made himself a public figure through his media appearances and has developed some notoriety, particularly within the housing bubble blogs. I believe his story is significant enough, as an exemplar of property speculation, to merit inclusion. I'd note that article has actually *improved* in tone and reliability since Serin drew attention to it. Some mixed feelings though: there are NPOV problems, particularly within the Criticisms section; it does rely heavily on citations to Serin's own blog, not a reliable source for any statement not qualified with "Serin claims"; it will continue to be a target for vandalism given that both Serin and Exurban Nation have directed readers to it. --Jkew 17:24, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>"Keep". Again, Casey's story has been published in numerous major media outlets and is well known within the real-estate community. As for NOPV, I agree, it needs work in this area but when you have the subject providing information such as "Yes, I committed mortgage fraud." in an audio interview it is hard to not make the article seem as a bit biased against him when he has admitted on many occasions to have committed illegal acts and most people have built in negative feelings towards those who are un-remoseful about committing crimes and openly talk about it. While the article itself may be neutral, it, understandably, may feel un-neutral given that many people will find his actions and lack of remorse for those actions to be morally reprehensible and he has a distinct lack of any effort to rectify them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.96.236.92_c553.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.96.236.92">71.96.236.92</a> (talk) 17:31, 16 March 2007 (UTC).</small> <small>— 71.96.236.92 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.96.236.92_c553.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.96.236.92">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree it will take work to keep this one encyclopedic, but I suspect that is common of pages for persons with many detractors. I don't think it is Wikipedia that is "granting notability" to Serin. It is that with all the easy lending the media and the blogosphere are predisposed to put a face and a name to this phenomenon. Serin just came along to fit that bill and the bloggers and then the media picked up on it. I have been trying to make a case that we should ratchet down some of the personal content, but wasn't getting anyone backing me up and didn't want to get into an edit war. I think the discussion that needs to happen (where?) is what should be in- and out-of bounds for this article as a bio of a living person. If we can come to some consensus on the ground rules, it will make it easier to edit and police the page. As it is there are differing opinions about how much of his family's details are appropriate given his explicit request to keep them out of it. --<a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeVortex_215f.html" title="User:JakeVortex">Jake</a> 21:37, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

This was his intention to cause so much havoc that Wiki would be utterly comfused and be forced to remove or seriously edit the page in a way that would completely omit the facts. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.226.136.208_2e60.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.226.136.208">70.226.136.208</a> (talk) 04:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC).</small> <small>— User:70.226.136.208 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7E70.226.136.208_6539.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:70.226.136.208">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> If he were just some guy who lost money on real estate, then there would be nothing to write. Casey Serin is notable not for his failed investments, but for the incredible level of detail he provides while talking about them. It's not just a blog; he has posted screenshots and scans of legal and financial documents that most people consider extremely private. The houses are relevant only to the extent that they make the exhibitionism interesting. If we have articles for porn stars, then it certainly makes sense to have one for him, for about the same reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As far as what the article should say, and what references should be acceptable: this is a strange situation. Serin freely admits (on his blog, of course) to things that would be libelous if you accused someone of them. The anti-self-published guidelines on <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> are written to prevent Wikipedia from propagating someone's self-promotion. They don't seem to mention what to do about self-defamation. 24.91.135.162 04:46, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Whether or not the current article is any good is irrelevant to question of whether an article should exist at all. Serin's name often comes up in real estate discussions without any explanation of who he is. People are just expected to know, and if they don't they may come here looking for information. They should find something, even if it's just a stub. 205.212.74.143 05:21, 17 March 2007 (UTC) <small>— User:205.212.74.143 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7E205.212.74.143_8e38.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:205.212.74.143">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The original grounds for deletion are that this page is an attack page. Wikipedia defines an attack page: "A Wikipedia article, page or image created for the sole purpose of disparaging its subject is an attack page." (<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttack_page_c5ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Attack page">Wikipedia:Attack_page</a>). This page was created as a factual, non-disparaging stub based on the USA Today article on Casey. Therefore, it does not meet the definition of an attack page, and the original grounds for deletion are invalid. --Billgordon1099 17:24, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I'm going to go with the poster above who notes that most of Serin's own entries are essentially self-defamatory. Serin admits to multiple acts of fraud, foolishness and self-delusion. Also, there are users who may appear to be single purpose IP's only due to the nature of the modern internet. My ISP uses DHCP, and resets the leases every 24 hours, plus, i wander between work, home and my mobile card, so i pop in and out of 3 Class A networks on a routine basis. Add in the fact, we are using NAT and it becomes very hard to predict what my IP is going to be. I don't login to Wikipedia, because, i want to be anonymous. I worked very hard just creating a table of entries of real estate deals done by Serin, and, i hate seeing it messed with. That table is essential to understanding what went on. YOu can see a slow movement, and then suddenly, a flurry of deals done as the cashback window was closing. Sadly, he blew much of his cash on a foolish house purchase in dallas. Which almost makes him an object of pathos. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.163.166.151_0da8.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.163.166.151">71.163.166.151</a> (talk) 20:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC).</small><small>— 71.163.166.151 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.163.166.151_0da8.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.163.166.151">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> While we will need to keep an eye on it this article should be retained. Serin has been quite widely covered in the media and his activities do illustrate the machinations that go on in housing markets all rouund the world.

<li>I'll change my vote to <b>Keep, but monitor closely for policy violations.</b> While this article has been greatly improved since it went up for deletion, it's still primarily sourced from blogs and needs more attention. Several editors here and on the article's talk page argue that this is permissible because Serin's own words indict or condemn him; I disagree. Let Serin's words convict him <i>on his own blog</i>, and include only those facts which can be substantiated by reliable third-party sources in the article. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESaranary_c55d.html" title="User:Saranary">Saranary</a> 00:13, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The article had BLP issues similar to the version of <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_Serin_0344.html" title="Casey Serin">Casey Serin</a> that was nominated for deletion -- speculation on Fortuny's mental illness, gossip about his childhood and college career, and inclusion of personal details like contact information and family members' names. Like the current version of <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_Serin_0344.html" title="Casey Serin">Casey Serin</a>, it mostly used blogposts for sources. <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Fortuny_5023.html" title="Jason Fortuny">Jason Fortuny</a> was initially deleted, and then merged with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_privacy.html" title="Internet privacy">Internet privacy</a>. 129.186.205.84 20:16, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Original Research. <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">All material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable, published source</a>. Extensive fancruft - Concerns about problems with the article have been discussed on Talk:Project Quicksilver before. The article <i>was</i> tagged over a year ago for lack of references/sources, but then the article's creator soon removed the tag without adding a single reference. The tag was replaced, but removed again. Since then no attempt has been made to fix any of the problems with the article, although I don't believe they can be fixed, so deletion is long overdue.</p>
<p>I also oppose merging into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Invisible_Man_%282000_TV_series%29_1bde.html" title="The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)">The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)</a>, as the problems of violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> will still apply.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article is an amazing piece of work, with excellent detail! Unfortunately, it seems that all of this information can quickly be gathered by watching the only reference, Episode 1 of Season 2. This makes this article completely not-useful on Wikipedia, but more importantly, this article offers no value to Wikipedia (ie, there is almost nobody who will ever care). It is not, as said in the guideline, "worthy of being noted", Maaaaybbeee if this article was a collection of information from various episodes, all of which were well referenced... then I would change this to a weak delete. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 04:15, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. A television episode is a <i>primary source</i>, and citing information from it would violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Any information would need to cite a reliable, published source. Saikokira 06:21, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Let's not go overboard on avoiding primary sources. To quote <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html#Primary_and_secondary_sources" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution#Primary and secondary sources</a>: "Edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge." It doesn't require a specialist to quote lines from a TV show. On the other hand, creating a chapter-length article out of such material is an outrageous abuse of this idea. That's why I believe using a few of the most important statements from this article, backed up by specific episode/scene citations, can be of use to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Invisible_Man_%282000_TV_series%29_1bde.html" title="The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)">The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)</a>. But I can understand if folks don't want to support this. It would be useful if the editor(s) who have been so insistent on keeping this material would do the work and boil this article down to an essence worth including. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 16:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't understand why this tragic story does not meet notability. Mr. Welch played at Disneyland. I have no idea how many fans he had, but he had the typical musician's webpage. We should look at the totality of this story. I was very surprised that people objected to this story, considering how many Wikipedia articles are on entertainers not that well known to the typical person.</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. 1) Somebody's myspace page is not a reputable source, 2) The coroner's link is to the coroner's office home page, not to the report on Welch. Even if the report says what the article claims, that means that only two lines of the whole article are sourced by that, 3) The <i>Shreveport Times</i> link is to the obituaries. Obituaries of non-public figures say (for the most part) what the family wants them to say; they are not reliably fact-checked, and most importantly 4) even if the sourcing of this article were perfect in every respect . . . this person is NOT notable. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 19:30, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Mailing list that doesn't seem to be notable. Googling the title, I only get 17 unique google hits, which includes several Wikipedia-related hits.

<p>"Advertisement masquerading as an article". The "article" does not establish notability other than it being a brand of whey protein, and the information used to asert notability is unsourced, or is simply an advertising slogan used by the manufacturer itself about it's own product. This advertisment has two product images - one that is only weakly related to the main article topic; and two corporate links - to a company that does not have a Wikipedia article. Much of the information is <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, and what information is sourced is attributed to the companies own (self-published) website - not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> by Wikipedia standards. In fact there is not a single <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> quoted in this article at all. Note that no other brand of <a href="../../../w/h/e/Whey_protein.html" title="Whey protein">whey protein</a> has it's own Wikipedia entry - despite there being about 40 other brands on the market. The non-corporate links that have been included in this advertisement are general whey protein links and can be transferred over to the main whey protein article once it's deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> Like I tried to explain to the single purpose account sockpuppet who started this afd (see his user page and edit history) the current version of the article was arrived at after a long discussion. It previously appeared like this:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Designer_Whey_Protein&amp;oldid=71196889" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Designer_Whey_Protein&amp;oldid=71196889" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (That version was written almost entirely by myself, so there is no bias here) But in order to become neutral we changed it and moved a critique of biological value to the biological value article. Here's some sources to establish notability:<a href="http://www.npicenter.com/anm/templates/newsATemp.aspx?articleid=16335&amp;zoneid=161" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npicenter.com/anm/templates/newsATemp.aspx?articleid=16335&amp;zoneid=161" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://www.npicenter.com/anm/templates/newsATemp.aspx?articleid=16046&amp;zoneid=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npicenter.com/anm/templates/newsATemp.aspx?articleid=16046&amp;zoneid=9" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/next/des.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/next/des.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> A google search of "Designer Whey Protein" yields 106,000 results so I can find more. See the talk page this version of the article was thought out in much more detail than it would appear. Although some more detail would be useful, I'll add some in the coming days. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 13:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If you have sources for the article they belong there, and not here on the AfD. That said, those sources still are not reliable secondary sources. One of them is an advertisement, the other two appear to be press releases written by the company itself. The one reference actually in the article is culled from the company's website and while informational does not satify <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. You may have done a good job in eliminating some of the POV issues that plagued the article's early incarnations but the problem is that it still reads like an advert and lacks reliable attribution. Unfortunately it does not meet inclusion criteria and I have to say <b>delete</b> it. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:11, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - After much consideration, I think this information should be used in a article on NEXT Proteins - the company that manufactures this product (see <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twinlab.html" title="Twinlab">Twinlab</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/MuscleTech_b61b.html" title="MuscleTech">MuscleTech</a> or <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experimental_and_Applied_Sciences_d54c.html" title="Experimental and Applied Sciences">EAS</a>). I've worked on this article in the past, but in all honesty, I'd be hard-pressed to tell a new editor why this article even exists other than to plug a product that is not really unique or notable in any way - as most of the notability comes from the fact that it contains whey protein. I'd also b hard-pressed to provide any verifiable information on this product outside of the manufacturers or distributors own website (the links provided above look like press releases by the NEXT Proteins) <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYankees76_f29c.html" title="User:Yankees76">Yankees76</a> 16:06, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>A website/newsletter that doesn't seem to have been subject of a secondary article. It doesn't seem to meet <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. The only secondary "reference" listed in the article is a link to a website which contains the following text: "The Crown Prosecution Service (Claimant) -V- South East Surrey Youth Court (Defendant) And X (Interested Party) [2005] EWHC 2929 (Admin), brought to our attention by Andrew Keogh, editor of CrimeLine." That doesn't anywhere meet WP:ATT. <b>Delete</b> as lacking any secondary coverage and failing WP:ATT. (I haven't found any sources while googling, but note that it is excessively difficult to Google as "crimeline" is used for about a million things.) <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 05:19, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

In adding the secondary reference, I had added it under the presumtion that CrimeLine had been referenced in a document to the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Commons_41bc.html" title="House of Commons">House of Commons</a>. The editor, Andrew Keogh, is himself a prominant attorney in Great Britain and a seperate Wikipedia project which is based on the website.

<li><b>Delete</b> for lack of notability. The only media mentions of Crimeline I could find referred to the RTE television programme in Ireland. The assertion in the article that "the website has been used by the British government" does not hold water. The link actually goes to a memorandum presented by the Law Society (the governing body of UK solicitors) before a Select Committee of the House of Commons, not to anything produced by the Government, and the observation it is used to support is a bland one (that old legislation and new legislation sometimes don't mix too well). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 10:05, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The Fisher article (part3) has two paragraphs on it, the other online papers seem to be single sentence mentions (note that the Hayles link is broken and I don't have access to the book, so I can't attest to the extent that it is covered in those sources).

<li>Either <b>keep</b> or attach to the article <a href="../../../m/e/z/Mez.html" title="Mez">Mez</a>. mez' mezangelle is a canonical subject in electronic literature criticism (N. Katherine Hayles, Rita Raley and others). It is odd that Wikipedia wants to delete this article while it keeps countless articles on b- or c-level porn actors, for example. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantsin_15d9.html" title="User:Cantsin">cantsin</a> 15:54, 20 March 2007</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- I've enjoyed the work of Mez for about nine years through seminal and influential online poetics communities. Mez to my understanding is a virtual construction and, as such, directly and critically engages with core issues at the intersection of internet culture, identity, and poetics. To question the legitimacy of Mez is to question the legitimacy of art itself. Of course such questioning comes naturally to many but I hope and pray we are not led by the many when the many choose to appeal solely to idiocy and ignorance within each of us. I've seen some nastiness wrt to poetics and poets before in the wikipedia community and I'm frankly tired of it.

It's not, in fact, a difficult and concealed persuasion attempt: in a weird "A" is sublimated a podalic ["doggy-style"] intercourse (so homosexuals are not displeased). These images we all have seen are put either in form of stickers, usually nearby cars (see image 1), or as a brand logo with various size on shirts and trousers (see image 2)</dd>

It is ancillary to the main article <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz_8720.html" title="A Canticle for Leibowitz">A Canticle for Leibowitz</a>; it belongs in a breakout article to keep the main from becoming too technical for the casual reader, not to mention meaningless to someone who has not yet read the novel.

<p>I am absolutely certain that this is either a hoax, wishful thinking, or a misunderstanding. I can find absolutely no evidence that this film is being made - given that this film would be a major release, this is somewhat surprising. Even IMDB, which only requires the merest rumour to create an articles, does not have a page for this film. Unless evidence of this film's existence can be produced, this article must be deleted (the film would have to be in production by now, given the long process of making animated features). <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 08:29, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps I didn't phrase the reasons clearly.

The Russian references comment's purpose is to demonstrate this. Faustus 12:24, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Community consensus has consistently kept Playboy Playmates as notable, over several years and a fair number of nominations. That's what stuck the criterion in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>. Nothing has recently occurred to significantly change that. They have a good bit of structure (just look at that category I linked - subcats, templates, lists...). There are quite a lot of them; nominating them is likely to be disruptive due to sheer numbers if nothing else. Going after them one at a time does seem as if it could be trying to make a point. I may have missed something - is there a directive from Jimbo that Playmates are out? Has there been any similar precedent? If nothing like that has occurred, I wouldn't recommend a campaign. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 19:11, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If you do as has been suggested and put 25, 50, 100, etc. Playmates and Pets up for deletion then you are creating a large disturbance to the encyclopedia in general. Although, if you take up the discussion at <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_f7cd.html" title="WP:PORN">WP:PORN</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> and then come to a decision, that would produce minimal disturbance. Then whatever decision was reached could be carried out. Additionally, mass deletion votes are inherently hard to handle and slog through because when people put up more than a couple pages for deletion, the voters have to slog through each article and most will say something like "I think articles A, C, and G should be deleted but articles B, D-F, and H-Z should be kept due to...." Then the person who closes the AFD has to write down all the article titles, and count each vote for each one. It's just a mess. I also do not suggest carrying out that campaign, as AnonEMouse said. <span style="font-family:monospace;"><a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a></span>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:14, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">POINT</a> can't be that porn mags are not independent and reliable sources for non-porn subjects, because this is not a non-porn subject. No, your <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">POINT</a> appears to be that a model's appearance in a porn mag is not reliable evidence of a model's appearance in a porn mag, since it is these appearances which establish her notability. I guess you're saying we need a reliable secondary source-- the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Britannica</a> maybe-- which states that a particular model appeared in such-and-such a porn mag, because her actual appearance in such-and-such a porn mag is not reliable evidence of her appearance in such-and-such a porn mag. So we have secondary sources in the external links section which document her appearances. Ah, but those sources-- even though they are appropriate for non-porn subjects-- are not reliable when they deal with porn subjects.

<li>Calm please, calm. Epbr123 hasn't followed through on the threat to nominate hundreds of Playmate articles, my long spiel was restricted to that. Nominating a dozen pornographic model or performer articles is certainly a trend, but not on that level of disruption. This is a legitimate area, but not the most cited area in the encyclopedia, and at least some of the nominations do seem to be generally supported and warranted. He's also not citing God's law as a reason for deletion. (!). I don't agree with the apparently tautological premise that porn mags are not reliable because they deal with porn (!) but I'm willing to assume good faith in general. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC) I'm also impressed by his willingness to change his own mind at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Alicia_Rhodes_%282nd_nomination%29_19e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alicia Rhodes (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alicia Rhodes (2nd nomination)</a>. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - If this is truely recreated material, then it would qualify for speedy deletion. When I removed the PROD notice due to the objection on the talk page, I looked for a previous AFD, but did not find one. (It could easily have been AFDed under a different name.) If you know where this was previously deleted and could show a link to it, particularly to a previous AFD, then this could potentially be speedied, saving the trouble of waiting out the AFD time. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 15:36, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Found it at Anarcho-Skinhead. It was deleted by PROD back in December. Unfortuneately, PROD deletions set no precedence for recreation. PROD is for uncontroversial deletions only. A single protest, before or after deletion, and it's no longer uncontroversial. PRODed articles have no prohibition against recreation either, as recreation can be considered a protest against the deletion. Given all that, this will need to proceed through this AFD to the end if it is to establish that it really should not exist on the project. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 16:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparently no such snake exists. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontchav_896a.html" title="User:Montchav">Montchav</a> 19:21, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The original authour wrote the following on the page, after getting rid of the AFD tag - --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontchav_896a.html" title="User:Montchav">Montchav</a> 14:29, 14 March 2007 (UTC):</p>
<p>The author removed this page because it was targeted for removal by someone calling himself Montchav who erroneously believes Black Racers either don't exist or do not exist in Florida. The photos were taken by a Florida naturalist who has identified the snakes as Black Racers—a fully recognized snake species. He wrote a 100% accurate article and kept it brief thus allowing room for other contributions. Simply checking the Audubon Guides he mentioned would have clarified this for Montchav. In my opinion the whole concept of Wikipedia does not rise beyond the level of writing as a hobby and this treatment proves that to be the case. The term encylopedia is being misused.</p>
<p>The original author also wrote: The issue is settled. Someone doesn't believe the creature in question actually exists so it has been recommended for deletion. Facts are not apparently important so let's just delete it speedily. The author/naturalist votes to delete it. The article is too serious for your interpretation of an encyclopedia. Let us not waste time. Funny story—in coming additions I planned to include information about Black Racers not hibernating in Florida. I have already encountered one this pre spring—apparently it was an illusion. Delete the article!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> but <b>rename</b> to Black Racer and generalize. Too many google hits from too many reliable sources (umass biology dept., etc.) for this to be a hoax article.

<p>There is no article. There is nothing to discuss. Before User Montchav recommended something for deletion a little research should have been done. Is this how people research articles? That calls their credibility as well as the credibility of Wikipedia into question. We could debate classifying Black Racers into sub species such as Everglades Black Racer, Eastern Black Racer, Florida Black Racer, Southern Black Racer etc but for a person who claims the role of an editor to simply say "Apparently no such snake exists" is astonishing. When I first began considering Wikipedia I ran across an article about President Zimpher of the University of Cincinnati. Horrible things were said about this decent person and I followed to see what would happen and how long it would take to make corrections. Before I began submitting edits and articles I tested the waters with a few harmless and facetious additions and observed the process. I was satisfied that the concept could work but this idea of listing something you know absolutely nothing about as an article for deletion has changed my opinion. In my opinion, Wikipedia is close to the old idea that a broken clock is correct twice a day. Such a clock is worthless and dusting and polishing such a broken timepiece is pointless. Delete the article! --Neilnat Get rid of that junk!!--74.104.224.214 22:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

From what I can glean, this may be the same snake, but I'm not a herpetologist, and would defer to experts whether a keep or merge is in order. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 16:28, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As pointed out above the southern black racer is a real snake. I do not believe that the <i>Florida Black Racer</i> is a made-up or imaginary snake but rather a local colloquialism to refer to the same snake. As such the best course of action would probably be to merge any attributable information to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coluber_constrictor_priapus.html" title="Coluber constrictor priapus">Coluber constrictor priapus</a> as suggested by <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a>. There also exists an <i>Everglades racer</i> Coluber constrictor paludicola without an article that may be a more correct choice for a redirect, but without any info on that snake or knowing for sure which the term "Florida Black Racer" actually refers to. In the meantime, <b>keep</b> this article until it can be decided where it should be merged to. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coluber_constrictor_priapus.html" title="Coluber constrictor priapus">Coluber constrictor priapus</a> (which is even more stubby than this one) and <b>redirect</b>. It appears not to be a hoax; however, it needs more sources to comply with <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. Sources are almost certainly available, and editors should work to find them. This article should not be deleted at this time.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Upon re-reading the author's screeds, I found references to Audubon guide sources that were apparently mentioned somewhere. So I re-read the article more carefully, and did find passing references to them. I guess that shows that we all should probably read more carefully. &#160;:) In any case, I formatted them properly in the article, and now it not only passes <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> (which it probably always did, if sorta informally), it even looks like it passes! &#160;:) ≈≈<b><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a></b>≈≈<a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarolfrog_b5b5.html" title="User talk:Carolfrog">♦тос♦</a> 03:03, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It would be inappropriate to delete this article based solely on the author's request to delete it. In my opinion it doesn't qualify for deletion under CSD G7. The article subject is notable and encyclopedic, and the author licensed his contributions under the <a href="../../../g/d/f/GDFL_cdb5.html" title="GDFL">GDFL</a>. S/he cannot now withdraw the information s/he added to the database. The article will make a good starting point for an encyclopedic and necessary Wikipedia article on the Black Racer, under whatever title it comes to rest. ≈≈<b><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a></b>≈≈<a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarolfrog_b5b5.html" title="User talk:Carolfrog">♦тос♦</a> 04:36, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>, I guess. Not an easy one, and the problem that other users haved edited the article (which excludes it from <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G7" title="WP:CSD">CSD G7</a>) made this a tricky close.

<li><b>comment</b> The <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic_energy.html" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> of the particle changes in a free fall (e.g. when particle "drops" its kinetic energy increaes). So from Newton's POV (and so also from POV of <i>non relativistic</i> classical mechanics) there was a need for an assumption of some kind of "<i>gravitational attractive force</i>" F=dE/dx (where E is this kinetic energy and x is distance) that could be responsible for this change of kinetic energy of the free falling particle. To keep the conservation of energy intact this energy has been assumed to be delivered form a source called "potential energy of the particle". And that's why it has been assumed in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtonian_physics.html" title="Newtonian physics">Newtonian physics</a> and non relativistic <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_mechanics.html" title="Classical mechanics">classical mechanics</a> that the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of the particle is constant. In relativistic physics since the energy of the free falling particle doesn't change despite its changing kinetic energy (see Landau) there is no need for an assumption of any "<i>gravitational attractive force</i>" nor any "potential energy". That's why we say now that Einstein eliminated "<i>gravitational attractive force</i>" form physics. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 15:50, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - You did not write "kinetic energy" above, but instead wrote "total energy". You are going to have to learn that if your writing is subject to misinterpretation, the fault is yours and not the reader's. BTW - You still have a goof in the above as you wrote that the "energy of the free falling particle does not change despite its changing kinetic energy", yet the point of your write-up is that the change in <i>c</i> (as determined by a distant observer) keeps the kinetic energy constant in general relativity. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 16:51, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - What do you mean <i>You did not write "kinetic energy" above</i>? I just started my last comment from <i>The <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic_energy.html" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> of the particle ...</i>. When I write "kinetic energy" I mean "kinetic energy", when I write "total energy" I mean "total energy". While the idea of "kinetic energy" is almost the same in Newtonian and relativistic physics, the idea of "total energy" is obviously different in relativity since in Newtonian physics it used to be "kinetic energy" plus "potential energy", the latter being usually "negative". The "potential energy" lost its meaning in relativity where "total energy" is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/a/d/cad4c110a310f6e78728237399d48381.png" alt="E=mc^2\sqrt{g_{00}}" />. Could you explain more clearly what you mean by "<i>keeps the kinetic energy constant in general relativity</i>" since in relativity the <i>total energy</i> is constant. The "kinetic energy" isn't constant in neither physics unless in the reference frame of the free falling particle when it is a trivial zero. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 20:55, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - Interesting goof on my part, as you are correct that Newtonian physics lack any rest energy, and kinetic energy does not include that. My point remains that energy is conserved (locally) in any case. More important is that your question to linas can only be valid if potential energy is excluded, but there was nothing in the question to make that clear. You keep approaching things from your own perculiar POV, and have no respect for the knowledge base or the needs of others. More specifically to this case, you seem to think that the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitational_attraction.html" title="Gravitational attraction">gravitational attraction</a> article should be a pro-GR rant instead of an informative review of the topic itself. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 21:14, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I'm just trying to explain gravitation based on the "needs of others" which I hope is as simple explanation as possible so it could be understood by a high school student. That's why I use just derivatives and not the tensor calculus which would turn off most people. However, as Einstein said, while everything should be made as simple as possible (and luckily physics is simple, even simpler than Newton's) the math shouldn't be made any simpler than possible. So I think I made it the simplest possible. If you can make it any simpler you are welcome to modify my stuff but I don't think that keeping old Newtonian stuff would do anybody any good. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 21:57, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>additional comment</b> - You seem to be one of the guys on the other side of the issue who understands the issue. So you might be able to turn the whole consensus from 9:1 (as it stands now) to 0:10 (as it should be if everybody understood clearly what the issue is). So I should probably explain the issue more clearly. But I had a feeling that I did it already in the "gravitational attraction" page and no one was interested enough to read it all. So if we could discuss, after reading the page, what are the real objections (not just "troll Jim pushing again his POV") I'd have an opportunity to clarify them and explain while in this case Jim's POV is also POV of the hard science that is taught in all universieties around the world, unfortunately only to graduate physics students. And I'd like it to be taught to high school students as well since they are perfectly well capable of understanding this hard science POV, when it is properly explained to them. So if I make dydactical errors, as you seem to suggest, please point thosse errors to me and we may clarify them. One isse that you pointed to already is "<a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_energy.html" title="Total energy">total energy</a>". However I also modified this page to fit the contemporary state of affairs and it was reverted to some non <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invariant_%28physics%29.html" title="Invariant (physics)">invariant</a> nonsens as well. So I just concentrate on the most important issue in my opinion, which is the faith in gravitational attraction. This faith has persisted already for over 300 years, and it is outdated for almost 100 years, but despite that it is taught to high school students around the world, as <i><b>good enough for them</b></i>. Which then it has all the features of a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_religion.html" title="State religion">state religion</a> (in this case even a <i>world religion</i>). It is tauht with a hope that when those students are interested in the <i><b>truth</b></i> then they may study physics and learn <i>in due time</i> what the truth is. Apparently they never do as it is shown by this consensus of educated people, most likely graduated from many high schools, and some even graduate students in physics at Harvard University. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 09:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect to gravitation</b> —<a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_fish_a481.html" title="User:Flying fish">Flying fish</a> 23:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC) Just seeing the statement in the first sentence that "gravitational attraction is a myth" was enough to convince me that this is an example of someone pushing their own (probably nearly unique) POV. The inverse square law holds in everyday life, and is a great approximation to nature at the energies and in the fields that humans are accustomed to. As others have pointed out, the fact that you don't fly off into space is evidence that "something" is pulling you down. Whether that something is some kind of inverse square law, or quantum gravity, or the result of some field equations doesn't matter, in ordinary human life we observe that we are attracted to the Earth. Arguments about what general relativity means should take place on GR pages, not on a page designed to attack the normal understanding of gravitation. As a final point, consider someone creating a page called "Earth's Geography" and stating in the lead sentence that "the idea that the Earth is round is a myth. It's actually a bumpy elipsoid". Even if the point is true it's badly representing the normal person's worldview.</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - Your example with a round Earth is about <i>approximation</i> while sentence about <i>gravitational attraction</i> is about something not existing at all. It seems that almost a century after the <i>gravitational attraction</i> disppeared from physics the high school students might finally start reading encyclopedia's articles that tell them the same thing that physics students learn in their gravitation courses and to learn how gravitation really works instead of believing a nearly century old story. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 21:31, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - Science is about approximation and model building. The model of 1/r**2 attraction works very well (wihthin measurement uncertainties) for almost everything everyone does. Should we change the first sentence of "proton" to "The existance of protons is a myth! In reality the proton is a bound state of three quarks of individual color". (Of course in perturbative field theory "quarks" don't exist either, they're just excitations out of the vacuum, so one can go even further...) We teach high school physics students about friction - but "friction is a myth"! It's really an integral of electromagnetic interactions between atoms (uh oh) on each of the adjacent surfaces.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Models are used constantly in physics. Condensed matter physicists talk about "depletion forces" (really electromagnetic), electronics designers talk about the AC current through a capacitor (electrons don't actually flow), we even talk about electrons "flowing" even though individual electrons bounce all over the place in the wire, and don't really go in orderly circles through the loop. The model of gravitational attraction due a to 1/r**2 force is an exceedingly good model for everyday life, is VERY important in the history physics, and is a great teaching tool. If you want people to learn about general relativity then include a link to it on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">Gravitation</a> (I assume it's there already), and mention that the 1/r**2 force law represents the old way of thinking about it.

<li><b>response</b> - I did what you advise long time ago, and it was removed by someone who believes (without any proof so far, but he believes it is going to be proved in future) that <i>masses attract each other through empty space</i> and a sentence to this effect still opens, untouched, the "<a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">Gravitation</a>" page. That's why I stopped editing for a while (as <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feynman.html" title="Feynman">Feynman</a> advised "<i>no argument will convince the idiot</i>" <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wlodekj/sci/Feynman.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/wlodekj/sci/Feynman.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>) but then it occured to me that I may create a page about <i>gravitational attraction</i> and clarify this issue according to knowledge delivered by <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">reliable sources</a>. It might have the advantage that idiots can't blank it since it would make an act of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a> according to Wikipedia's policy. Now you and <a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> did just that and additionally you think that high school students should be shielded from contmporary knowledge about <i>gravitational attraction</i>. Apparently you believe that shielding brings them a lot of good. EMS even thinks that admitting that relativity is real might blow people minds (<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimJast_0eed.html#Teaching_gravitation" title="User talk:JimJast">which he saw happening</a>). So you guys think that telling the truth as we know it is bad and Wikipedia should protect inocent high school students from learing truth about the real world and do it through an administrative action. However it is probably against Wikipedia's policy and for sure against policy of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albus_Dumbledore_087b.html" title="Albus Dumbledore">Prof. Dumbledore</a> who maintained that the best way to improve society is to tell the truth as it is known. The simple reason behind such policy is that one can't predict the results of the lies that people are fed with, for noble purposes, and sometimes those lies backfire and then one regrets that those people were ever lied to.</li>

It might have ben an attempt to raise the flagging popularity of the <a href="../../../r/u/l/Ruling_party.html" title="Ruling party">ruling party</a> with the voters. One doctor whose patient died after the surgery has been accused of assasination by the Minister of Justice (even before the trial) and jailed after a squad of police, popularly known as <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja_Turtles_6547.html" title="Ninja Turtles">Ninja Turtles</a> for their gear, made a spectacular arrest at the hospital for patients to enjoy. However the noble idea of creating a "perfect tool" for improving hospital statistics backfired by refusal of some Polish doctors to perform surgeries, which the Government didn't foreseen. They meant well and yet the bad doctors turned the best intentions into a disaster for Polish people who now have difficulties with having surgeries since 20 years in jail is too big a risk for those cowardly doctors. Unfortunately there is no death penelty in Poland so 20 years for assasination is max the governmant can afford but the Government is working on improving Polish Constitution that would be more like in Texas. So soon if a patient dies so does his doctor. Apparently, Polish Government might assume that it "<i>is an exceedingly good model for everyday life, [...] and is a great teaching tool</i>" to teach doctors.</dd>

And then your only defense is "<i>well, I lied, since I thought that you are idiots and can't bear the truth since it might blow your minds</i>". And this is a very weak defense. So if you can document the fact that three quarks together is a myth, say it. It is BTW what Feynman always did. When he knew that something isn't true he said so and then he explained what model we may use to work with it anyway. Because science is not about models, as you say, but suprizingly enough it is abobut finding what is false. Which can be done in all relevant cases through experiments. That's why we already know, and are sure of, a lot of myth. By an important <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemological</a> rule we can find what is true only when it is just oposite to a myth that we already proved false. And unfortunately there are many possible things opposite to a given myth. That's why to find truth is so difficult but luckily not impossible in principle.</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> Science is not the search for truth. There are no certitudes in science, only theories and models. Further, since you mentioned Feynman let me quote from page 3 of the Feynman lectures on gravitation: "First of all there is the fact that the attraction follows an inverse-square law... Then there is the fact that the force is proportional to the masses of the objects." Then later on the same page: "we first define the mass as the inertia of the object, which we measure by applying known forces and measuring the acceleration. Then we measure <b>the attraction due to gravitation</b>, for example, by weighing, and compare the results." (emphasis mine). I think this ought to settle this matter.<a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_fish_a481.html" title="User:Flying fish">Flying fish</a> 14:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>response</b> - You say <i>"Science is not the search for truth"</i>, making an impression that maybe I said that it is. I said: "<i>science is [...] about finding what is false"</i>. Of course <i>finding what is false</i> is not the same as <i>the search for truth</i> since as you agreed <i>there are no certitudes in science</i>. So we agree on this point. Then as it turns out we agree also on a point that <i>The inverse square law holds in everyday life, and is a great approximation to nature ...</i> which you said yourself. So your example with Feynman is about a model that Feynamn explains and which is an <i>approximation to nature</i>. It is all independent of what Einstein discovered, since as Feynman says in section 7-8 (Gravity and relativity) of <i>The Fenman lectures on physics</i> "<i>In spite of all the excitement it created, Newton's law of gravitation is not correct!</i>" (exclamation is Feynman's). Now my POV is that we shouldn't present to high school students something about which we already know that it is <i>false</i>, which contrary to <i>truth</i> can be discovered by science and it's even the purpose of science to find what is false. Because we don't want to live in the world of illusions as lived the people of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Ages_1e14.html" title="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a>. So my purpose is to show to the high school students how easy it is to understand Einstein's gravitation (and if I didn't do it well enough you are welcome to help), and so they don't need to <i>believe</i> that the <i>gravitational attraction</i> is real. They should know that it is not real (as far as we know) because this knowledge makes them capable of discovering something on their own in physics. While this opportunity will be taken away form most of them when from the earliest years they are going to believe in <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legends.html" title="Urban legends">urban legends</a> which <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">Newtonian gravitation</a> claerly is as Feynman confirms. We differ then only in POV on the educational policy. The education of most people taking part in this debate is an evidence that the present policy on teaching gravitation starting from Newton's theory is wrong. IMO it should start from stating clearly that there is no such thing as <i>gravitational attraction</i>, how it is simulated (which as you can see from the disputed page, thanks to Landau, takes less than 45 minutes to explain) and only then, when students comprehend the physics of the real world, explaining how simpy we can solve problems involving gravitation with Newton's equations. Otherwise we create mentally challenged individuals who might believe that the real world can't be understood. And later in life have problems with explaining many cosmological puzzles since faith in gravitational attraction affects their clear judgment. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 18:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I just see a need to explain at least what this physics isn't and why. At least to high school students who might not yet have their own prejudices about it and could learn physics as understood by physicists and not those who understand only the simplified <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtonian_physics.html" title="Newtonian physics">Newtonian physics</a>. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 23:43, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect to gravitation</b>. The article is very problematic:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. It doesn't make any sense that people who want to read about the gravitational force would need to understand general relativity first. It would be a very non-standard pedagogical approach.
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b> Apparently this non standard pedagogical approach is urgently needed since relativity is around already for about a century and as demonstratef by this voting list a lot of intelligent people still don't understand it and some don't even know the simplest things about it. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 16:39, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. The article includes many mistakes. For example, the text claims that gravitational force exists when the body "is prevented from its free movement" and that it doesn't exist when the body is free to move. With or without general relativity, this statement is wrong.
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b> This POV is wrong according to your POV but it is right according to POV of any textbook on general relativity. So to be fair you might say that opinions are divided, and yours aren't supported by any relible source yet since reliable sources support general relativity's POV. Even the autors that you quoted in discussion with me admit that they don't know yet how to prove their POV so they say that existence of <i>attractive force</i> is just their hypothesis. General relativity's POV, on the other hand, has been confirmed by all experiments up to date. Which makes pretty clear choice for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 16:39, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>3. The main claim of the article that "gravitational attraction is a myth" isn't the only existing interpretation of Einstein's equations, and maybe not even the dominant one. I tried to fix the article, included a reference to a textbook, provided additional discussion and references on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGravitational_attraction_236e.html" title="Talk:Gravitational attraction">Talk:Gravitational attraction</a>, but <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">User:JimJast</a> reverted the changes and removed the reference, violating many Wikipedia policies just in order to keep his POV as the only way to look at the subject. The whole article has a very POV-ish style. It seems like it's the only reason why <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">User:JimJast</a> created this fork, after his ideas weren't accepted in existing articles on gravitation. <a href="../../../y/e/v/User%7EYevgeny_Kats_56fb.html" title="User:Yevgeny Kats">Yevgeny Kats</a> 00:23, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> Wikipedia policy is to promote present knowledge (coming from reliable sources). Presenting stuff that even its authors consider to be hypotheses that are going to be proved sometime in the future is not something that should be necessarily placed in an encyclopedia. It is however proper for page like "other hypohteses" (since they aren't even theories yet, if you understand the difference). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 16:39, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment, Possible Delete</b> Being the person who recommended this be checked for COI, I am not looking for deletion. However, I wonder if deletion is the only way to keep this article from being fluff, as there are too many Ars members, writers, and staff who are willing to take all negative information out of the article in the interest of promoting the site. As for Ars being notable due to postings on Slashdot, that makes no sense. Slashdot posts a lot of garbage from anyone willing to submit stories summaried from other sites. For the record, Warrens is taking this opportunity to claim that I am a sock puppet. Considering the manner of my edits, which are far different than the edits of other people, no less talented (of course), I find it hard to believe that he actually believes that. Of course, when much of your life has been spent protecting an article, you may lose perspective. I would be happy to identify any and all edits that I made to the article, ending sometime last summer (I gave up).--216.227.57.119 11:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Umm, hello? "Anon editors" weren't the only ones trying to restore the criticism section (a section of similar sort is in the Slashdot article, and doesn't get attacked all the time). In fact, there was maybe only one other "anon" editor besides me that I can remember. And it wasn't bad mouthing. It was sourced criticism, mostly not added by me (though I did try to add sources for those who demanded it). BTW, offtopic, but is that an MST3K nick?

<dd>Since all the "criticism" was totally retarded (insofar as it was substantially fabricated and consistently unsupported) it was not unreasonable to remove it. Articles about extant web pages are in any case generally worthless; if you want to know what Ars Technica's about, stick the frigging URL into your web browser and take a look. You don't need an "encyclopaedia" entry about it. Articles like this one seem only to cater to those lunatics who believe that if it's not on Wikipedia <i>it doesn't exist</i>. Such articles can only ever be fluff, because there's nothing substantive to say. At least Slashdot is somewhat notable, due to the way it functions as a DoS tool. <a href="../../../d/r/p/User%7EDrPizza_7344.html" title="User:DrPizza">DrPizza</a> 11:17, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> A walk through the article's history since April 2005 reveals what its main problem was all along: the propensity of Ars Technica partisans to treat an encyclopedia article as if Wikipedia is <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">a webspace provider</a>. Several <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> editors have it on their watchlists now, so those few who still try to revert it to its former corrupted condition find their intentions frustrated very quickly. <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthaenara_c5c7.html" title="User:Athaenara"><span style="font-family: Edwardian Script ITC; font-size: 14pt">— Athænara</span></a> <a href="../../../a/t/h/User_talk%7EAthaenara_36d9.html" title="User talk:Athaenara"><small>✉</small></a> 10:20, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> While it probably would have been ideal for delldot to do a bit of research before listing the article for AFD I'm of the opinion it was a fair move. Articles should establish the notability of their topic indepedently of anything else. Articles which fail completely to do so are the ones at fault when they are listed for deletion, not the editors who list them. Editors IMHO should not be expected to do independent research on the subject of an article outside of what is already in the article when listing an article for deletion (even if it is usually wise). This is doubly the case when the article is of a resonable size and has existed for a resonable period of time. If a clearly noteable topic is listed for deletion because the editor was unaware it was a noteable topic because the article failed completely to establish that; it usually has the beneficial effect of making people aware that an article is in dire straits (although this should definitely never be even of slightest consideration in listing an article for deletion). Point being, this is the way wikipedia is supposed to work... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 14:26, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Since there appears to be no notability standard for schools and the <i>de facto</i> standard seems to be to make an article for all schools, or at least high schools, I do not see why this specific article should be removed.

<li><b>Follow-up Comment</b> - There is still no official announcement. MLB previously announced plans for a network in 04, but then abandoned them for a proposed network with Fox, before this DirecTV discussion begun. The NBA and Time Warner announced a joint sports network in 2002, but that didn't materialize either.

<li>Received award says who? Which award? I am surprized how can one vote without getting chance to check facts. Let me spell for other lazy voters here: "Emily Nuchols"+montenegro gives Big Fat Zero google hits. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 21:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No need to get hostile now is there. <i>If</i> you would have checked the article's history you would have seen that I was the person who added most of the references AND noted that a reference for that award was still missing. So much for calling me a lazy editor, thank you very much. We differ in view on how to treat articles like this, so much is clear. I suggest we give the article at least a few days/weeks before outright deleting it. And for stuff like this, Google just might be the worst of ways to check if the statement is correct. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li>Well, none of the permutations of the award she received ("Hyde Bron(s/z)ing award", combinations of Montenegro/-gran president/-ial award, etc.) turn up any links. From the first diff: "Her beauty and charm is infectuous." Sounds like something a bored classmate would write. Finally, from the second diff, the addition of a completely unrelated link (which appears to be about an art exhibit) as a reference seems like an attempt to manipulate the system. Thus, in my opinion, a probable hoax. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoTolo_8040.html" title="User:MarcoTolo">MarcoTolo</a> 00:09, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

Has some kind of structure indicated by indenting but I can't figure out what the indenting means. Has dates (years) but doesn't indicate what the dates are (probably date of source but not stated). Source not indicated. Tagged for cleanup since September 2005.

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is small. It is not because of its length that it is to be deleted. But such a small (un-informative) article as this, is not needed in Wikipedia. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia which is informative and contains relevant topics. Topics such as this is not worthy enough to be in Wikipedia. DynaMed is in no way relevant. It appears to me that Leebo here is trying to promote a home company to bring in profits for them. This is not right. Since you are so persistent to promote this company i will soon get you a link to a site that is meant to support only advertisments. You can do what you like there and there will be no one to stop you. Please do not waste WIkipedia space/ user time / your time arguing.

<li><b>keep</b> your point about article size is relevant, but saying "an article on the death of a celebrity who died like fifty years ago" isn't particularly I don't think.

<li>The section of the death of elvis, controversy and "elvis lives" could be a seperate article it if wanted, and should be, as the elvis article is huge, and there is no controversy or suspicion with James Brown's passing so yes "according to my logic" if there is something surrounding a death that is more than the death (huge controversy, conspiracy, massive outpour of support from around the globe, great cultural change etc) then a seperate article could be created, unless the death is the only reason the person is notable at all, that is. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 21:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The version of this site (as nominated) wasn't the military usage, which is a later change within the last couple of days, but some patent nonsense regarding the number e "E day is celebrated on the 2.71th day of the year" etc. The version of the page as it currently stands is undoubtedly valid. <font face="verdana"><a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>Irides</b></font><font color="darkviolet"><b>centi</b></font></a></font> 20:01, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs improvement, but its subject is <i>the</i> original infinite series. Bad titles are not a deletion criterion for articles; anyway, a virtual synonym would be Quadrature of the parabola, which has piles of further references on Google/Books/Scholar.

<li><b>Comment</b>. One sentence, a value, and 5 references/notes? I still say it's not notable, but, even if it is, it's a substub with notes, and should be combined with the other geometric series.

<li><b>Merge/Delete</b> - I know where this comes from; this series was summed by Archimedes with respect to approximating values.

<ul>
<li>I see. I will still say '<i>keep</i>, since I see it as notable in Japan. However, I am wondering what should we do for Japanese based porn stars, since In japan, there's no such thing as "independent"? I am asking this not mainly for this article, but for future references. This is because everything in Japan has no such thing as independent, and even referencing Gundam, if not from approval from Sunrise/bandai, can onyl be done in "similarities" method. I am not saying I am blaming this on Wikipedia, but whether we should accomodate Japan's many unwritten rules that dominates their business (which they have a habit on, such as the restriction on HP in cars, which can't be higher then 280), or whether we let Japanese people knows that this is Wikipedia's policy. On a sidenote, is this good idea to delete relevant pages on Japan, for example? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Leung_a0b3.html" title="User:George Leung">George Leung</a> 20:37, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I just want to make sure you know what I mean by independant. If a non-pornographic magazine featured an article on a porn star, that would count as independant coverage and would establish her notability. For example, Jenna Jameson is a very notable porn star as she regurlarly appears in non-pornographic newspapers. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 20:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you want to make a proper argument for keeping that will hold water, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to demonstrate that this person has been documented in depth in multiple published works by people independent of Yulia Nova. Currently, the article cites no such sources, it only pointing to the subject's own web site, and you haven't cited any in this AFD discussion either. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The independence requirement is that the sources be <i>independent of the subject xyrself and of each other</i>, as explained at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. In other words, it excludes autobiographies, advertising, press releases, and so forth. It doesn't exclude biographies written by other people, although such biographies may be excluded for being unreliable (as the potted biographies that accompany picture sets in pornographic magazines notoriously are). The important thing is not where this person's pictures have appeared, because that provides no source material for an encyclopaedia article. The important thing is how much is reliably and independently documented about this person's life and work in already published material. It has yet to be demonstrated that anything at all has been. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I guess the problem is the difference of culture between Japan and here, and how they will as impotant and what not. Oh well, AFD still have 4 days left, so we will see.

She was also the subject of a minor news item when her photographer lobbied against Google.

<li>So you do agree that appearing in porn mags and porn sites does not establish notability? <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 01:38, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No. I think it depends on the magazines and/or movies, and the context. The larger the circulation, the more the magazine or movie contributes to that person's notability. Thus, being in an internationally distributed magazine and/or pornographic movie (such as Playboy, Voluptuous, etc) would contribute to a person's notability the same as an internationally distributed movie would. If they were in a movie that had significant impact or circulation in their country, then they are obviously notable. If you had bothered to look, you'd know that WP:ALLORNOTHING is an <i>invalid argument</i>. In summary, everything contributes to notability... <i>even pornographic works</i>. However, the impact depends on their circulation and acclaim. —<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDisavian_f80f.html" title="User talk:Disavian"><sup>talk</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Disavian_e056.html" title="Special:Contributions/Disavian"><sub>contribs</sub></a>) 05:59, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> this is the weirdest high school article I've ever seen. It's essentially an article about high school sports at Dodgeville, and apparently the article was started after information was moved from an article with a name something like "Dodgeville school sports", but I can't find that original article on Wikipedia, even as a redirect page (was it at the losing end of some old deletion decision?). If the single editor who's put so much time and effort into this indends to keep up the massive (34 kilobyte) ongoing collection of school sports coverage, I don't really have a problem with it, so long as he cleans up after himself (or herself) after graduation. I'm sure the school's received local sports coverage, so the article should be notable. But the information should go into the original name -- something to do with sports needs to be in that name. Right now it's misleading. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The four schools in the District play under the same sports banner so the High School teams represent the District as well as the School. All School Districts, as government establishments, are inherently notable. The article, as <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> rightly says, needs cleaning up but that is an editorial matter; AfD is not a clean up squad. Coach Wilson needs to be considered separately.

Actually, I'm not so sure it's a developing pattern so much as an ongoing one. After WP:SCHOOLS went down in flames, perhaps we should create another proposed guideline on school notability, accepting high schools and school districts and coming up with something on other schools. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 20:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I can't say I've seen too many articles where I would recommend trimming down material, but this article is top-heavy with sports minutiae.

<dd>I read your essay and found it very interesting. I still disagree, though. The main guideline for notability, at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> gives the primary criterion for notability: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject." Regardless of how notable a secondary school is to its students (and I am not arguing that a school does not play a significant role in one's life), nearly none of them are featured in non-trivial works. My grandmother is extremely notable and important to the members of my family, but she certainly is not notable enough to merit an encyclopedia article. The article in question has only one independent source: the first two are merely directories, the next three are created by the school itself, and the one semi-independent source is from the local town paper. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> 16:55, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, WP:N is a guideline, and a heavily disputed one at that, not a policy. Just because an article does not meet the particular criterion you quote, it should not be deleted. If we deleted everything that was not "the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works" then we would delete a large portion of the articles on Wikipedia and lose much information for the sake of the dogmatism and inflexibility of a handful of deletionists who seem to believe that it is better to shrink Wikipedia than to expand it. I'd be the first to say that there is a lot of junk on Wikipedia - utterly pointless rubbish that deserves to be deleted. But I do not think that even the most fanatical deletionist could claim with any credibility that an article about a school was pointless rubbish. And I tire of saying that lack of sources is not a reason for deletion - if its existence is verifiable, which a school's blatantly is, then it is perfectly acceptable to keep it, even as a stub (which, as I also tire of reiterating, is a perfectly acceptable form of article). Incidentally, I fear you didn't read my essay properly - your grandmother is notable <i>to a few members of your family</i>, not to thousands of current and former pupils and to the local community as a school is - I thought I made that point quite clearly with the house analogy. I really wish people would direct their efforts towards what genuinely needs to be deleted and not what a disputed guideline says might be deleted. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:57, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you want to be technical about "guidelines vs. policies", we're in a weird place. The official <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> lists as a reason for deletion: "Subject fails to meet the relevant <a href="../../../i/n/c/Template%7EIncGuide_0522.html" title="Template:IncGuide">notability guideline</a>." So we have an official policy which points to a "heavily disputed" policy. I'm not trying to be "dogmatic and inflexible" here, I just don't know that Wikipedia is the proper place for a school to keep detailed records of its sports program. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume good faith</a>, please. If we really must have a stub article about every single secondary school on the face of the earth, so be it. Just make it a stub without piles of crufty sports trivia, please. To borrow from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hodgman_e95e.html" title="John Hodgman">John Hodgman</a>, for further details on sports, please consult <i>every other aspect of our culture</i>. As for my grandmother, you don't know how big my family is. If my extended family included thousands of people, would she then merit an article? Finally, lack of sources is definitively a reason for deletion. Just the ability to verify that something exists is not enough to make that something article-worthy. Every single citizen of the United States verifiably exists, but certainly not all are worthy of an article. This is why we have notability guidelines, and why it is an official policy that those topics which are not notable are subject to deletion. If there is a "large portion" of Wikipedia which needs to be deleted due to being unsourced, then it should be deleted, not used as an <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">argument to keep other stuff</a>. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> 20:11, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me begin by saying I wrote this article some time ago but now realize it to be unworthy of its own article. It's poorly written and fancrufty, and most of the characters who have held the position don't have an article and if they do they'll probably be trimmed and redirected as well. Also, I am including the articles that redirect there, Speaker of the Sun and Speaker of the Sun and Stars. <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="darkblue">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="lightblue">Day349</font></a></b></i> 20:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Contested prod (I'd added it). This is a neologism of sorts which claims notability but is unreferenced. Google, as I'm sure you can imagine in this situation, isn't much use, since "iMike" seems to yield results about a microphone for Apple products and various Apple fans called Michael. Certainly nothing about a film or an internet fad that I can see. I had originally considered speedying it as an attack page, but "Mike" is a sufficiently common name that it's probably not designed to insult one particular person. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:05, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If this was indeed featured in several Canadian films, and spawned an "internet fad," then there should be some readily-available internet sources. But no matter the combination of words and minus-words I used on Google, I still could find nothing. If the author provides some sources before the end of this AfD, I might change my mind. But for now, this article fails <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, and seems to be a non-notable <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> to boot. Given the number of chatroom and social-network usernames that "iMike" turned up in on Google, I agree with the nominator that this is probably a hoax attack page of some sort. ≈≈<b><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a></b>≈≈<a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarolfrog_b5b5.html" title="User talk:Carolfrog">♦тос♦</a> 04:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article about a Dutch web forum which has been sourceless for about 1.5 years. No sources listed in the article and the forum as of 1/2 year ago only had 500-some members according to the last AFD (link <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_POLINCO_bce4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/POLINCO">here</a>).

<li><b>Follow-on comment</b>. For anyone following this who might be more interested in actually addressing Wikipedia polices on military medal winners than in just hurling around insults at fellow editors, you may want to consider bringing up the subject at the talk page of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Prveious discussions viewbale in that talk page's archives indicate a sentiment than an award such as the Medal of Honor would satisfy notability, but that "lesser" awards would not. But if anyone thinks there is a legitimate case to be made for those "lesser" awards being sufficient for notability, then that talk page might be a good place to do so. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 22:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Really? How? There are three "references". One is a paid obituary. The other two actually make absolutely no mention of him in any way.

<li><b>Comment</b>. So what if he's surely notable in Monroe, LA? That seems to be an argument you use frequently in defense of biographies of disputed notability: that the subject is notable in <i>their</i> corner of the world. But that argument flies directly in the face of actual Wikipedia guidelines, namely that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">notability, for Wikipeida's purposes, is NOT subjective</a>. Quoting the guideline: "Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether 'the world' has judged a topic to be notable". Note that it says "the world", not "the subject's home town". The military medals are a more objective issue, at least. But if we're going to say those satisify the notability requirement, then it should be in the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines. (and we should be prepared to accept a flood of new biographies that currently are not acceptable). <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 20:56, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says politicians are notable when they "have held international, national or statewide/provincewide office, and members and former members of a national, state or provincial legislatures. (or) Major local political figures who have received significant press coverage. Just being an elected local official does not guarantee notability." He was elected to 5 4-year terms on the school board, and according to his obituary held a few other important local board positions... so if there had been significant local press coverage of this local politician during his active lifetime, would that be sufficient? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 23:44, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>If</i> such significant prese sources, acceptable to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, could be cited, then absolutely. That would meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines. I'd just note here that the author has a history of creating biography articles of people who do not seem to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and using as his primary sources things (such as the person's paid obituary or the author's personal e-mail exchanges with the inidividual) that are not acceptable per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. He's been asked not to do this, but so far, seems undeterred in the practice. So in my opinion, there didn't seem to be much reason to expect differently with this article. If he would like to claim, though, that this article is an exception, and that indeed in <i>this</i> case, such <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>-acceptable sources are available and that he intends to cite them, I'd assume the good faith of such claims and change my vote. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 00:07, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
