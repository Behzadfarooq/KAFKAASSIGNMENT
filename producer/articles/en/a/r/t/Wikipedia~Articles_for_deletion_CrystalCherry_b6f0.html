<p>Looks like a vanity page to me. Only 489 Google hits - the majority unrelated with the rest consisting of either this person's own sites or message board postings. Does not meet guidlines at WP:MUSIC and I can find no reference at allmusic.com or amazon.com. The article claims that this person is dead - I am unable to find any reference to this online, even on the sites listed (possible hoax?). <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Shaped_Box_3207.html" title="User:Kurt Shaped Box">Kurt Shaped Box</a> 23:24, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - A clear an obvious vanity page and hoax. Claims to be signed to Arista records, and yet the record company's website has no mention of her, and Googling them both produces just the Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick04_a2be.html" title="User:Nick04">Nick04</a> 05:25, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree - the article DOES sound like a page of vanity and was not written in a neutral tone either.

<p><strike>*<b>Neutral</b> but clean up! The article is a complete mess, and looks more like a news/blogpage, but with some work it could be kept.

<li>Keep, I to my understanding, when someone doesn't perform well with a major record company and they are huge like Arista, selling of their contract is something likely to happen. Why would someone who only sold 98 copies have their own arista page.

<li>Please note that someone using this IP has already previously 'voted' above <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/CrystalCherry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=26317833" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/CrystalCherry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=26317833" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and was also responsible for adding the false rumours of this person's death to the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=CrystalCherry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=26300601" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=CrystalCherry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=26300601" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - also note the contradictory nature of the two edits.

<li>It is highly feasible that this is indeed a publicity stunt. First the "hacking" of God knows what that CrystalCherry is fuming about the kiss with Aaron Carter or something, then the death hoax. This is a cry of desperation on CrystalCherry's part. Probably a way to "win sympathy" - let's call it - so her 'albums' will sell more. As far as I know, Amazon doesn't even have her albums on auction. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahlen_660b.html" title="User:Kahlen">Kahlen</a> 07:32, 30 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What "sympathy"? What "albums"? I don't think she has any albums out there that can be bought except online, at her website. Google would have turned up at least a few hits for at least one of them - and believe me, I checked and cross-checked them all. Any "American Idol" contestant deserves a Wiki entry more than this thing.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 07:51, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete as soon as possible</b>. Vanity page all the way. The person that did this page is also updating other pages with pointless info about CrystalCherry. Look at this - <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Brooke+Anne+Burns%22&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Brooke+Anne+Burns%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Brooke+Anne+Burns%22&amp;meta=</a> - the five hits I got for "Brooke Anne Burns" - the full name of this person, all of them relate either to her death or stem from Wikipedia itself. No other sites reference her - professionally speaking - she doesn't exist in the music world. Also - Wiki says she has done "voice work for movies" - well, the IMDB lists no Brooke Anne Burns - the only Brooke Burns it has is the sort-of famous actress - not this one. <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 07:01, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I see what you mean. Actually, I don't see a clear reason why this article should be kept. Notable artist? Up and coming? I beg to differ! <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahlen_660b.html" title="User:Kahlen">Kahlen</a> 07:32, 30 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>CrystalCherry (the user) should have put all the info from her article on her user page. That way at least it would be kept online in some format. You don't see a clear reason of why this article should be kept because there is not a single reason why it shouldn't be deleted right now.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. I am a Wikipedia admin and this article is near the top of my list of AfD debates to review next. But because of the length of this debate I am allowing it more time. <s>The article's current contents are useless. It only gives her name and says that she has a website. That's not asserting any notability.</s> I personally don't know CrystalCherry - I have never heard of her - so I have to take the article at face value. <s>She may well be a really famous actress, but the article doesn't reflect that. So therefore it should be drastically rewritten, or else deleted.</s> Even if it is deleted it can be recreated later with better content. (I also usually view a large number of "keep" votes from new users such as this as a sock puppetry effort, but that may just be cynicism.) <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 18:22, 30 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article's contents seem to have changed either during the time I wrote my vote or after it. It now includes considerably more information. Still, my comments about this article being soon to be reviewed, and the allegation to sock puppetry, still remain. If this debate is not closed by another admin first, I will review it myself, and consider every user who has only contributed to this debate as a possible sock puppet. The most likely result is "no consenus". <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 18:26, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>None of the information presented in the article 'as-is' checks out. There are no references to this person anywhere online outside the pages she and her spamming friends have created.

<li>I don't believe that photo has anything to do with CrystalCherry, actually. I am pretty sure I've seen it before, a looong time before this pointless "hacked cell phone"-"released pictures" crap. I think the photo looked just enough like Cherry that she "adapted" it as if it was her in the picture, in order to cause more "controversy". That's why user "CrystalCherry" kept adding a huge version of that same photo to the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Carter_516e.html" title="Aaron Carter">Aaron Carter</a> article.

<li>Listen to how you talk Vulturell, my daughter was hacked back in june, what you are talking about is moronic. You want to call my daughter a liar so bad, you just don't have any evidence. You should be ashamed. But i doubt you have any. I can't wait until someone with real power and can prevent you from ruinging my daughters article.
