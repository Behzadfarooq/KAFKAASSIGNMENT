<p>Deletion was requested by an anonymous editor (who, on the balance of evidence, I assume to be Amesbury herself.) The situation is that the subject is a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgendered.html" title="Transgendered">transgendered</a> woman who is primarily notable for two <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_40.html" title="Top 40">Top 40</a> hit singles that <i>predate</i> her gender transition. The anon editor three times attempted to rewrite the article to eliminate any acknowledgement of the transgender issue while still retaining credit for the songs, even though the songs are verifiably credited to a performer named "Bill" rather than Barbara. <a href="http://www.1050chum.com/index_chumcharts.aspx?artist=9256" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1050chum.com/index_chumcharts.aspx?artist=9256" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>She then requested deletion when she was advised that the article could not simply pretend that she was known as Barbara at the time the songs charted, and thus the only options are either to acknowledge that she was once known as Bill, or to delete the article altogether since the songs are the main reason she's notable enough for an article in the first place.</p>
<p>Thus, my questions are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the subject of an article have the right to dictate what Wikipedia can or cannot write about her, if the dispute has more to do with personal image management than accuracy?</li>
<li>If so, then how else can Wikipedia handle the topic, given that we quite rightly <i>should</i> have an article on any performer who has had verifiable Top 40 hits?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a procedural nomination because the request was made — personally, however, I do <b>not</b> favour deletion: the subject is legitimately notable and Wikipedia isn't doing its job if notable subjects can't be on here. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>.

<li>Personally, I agree...but a deletion request was made by the editor in question, so I complied procedurally. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:54, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, notable performer. But perhaps you made her a promise you could not keep when you told her either the article acknowledges Bill or gets deleted? <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHollyAm_2189.html" title="User:HollyAm">HollyAm</a> 03:11, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see how there are any other options...if Bill goes, the songs go too, and if the songs go, her entire basis for being notable enough to <i>have</i> a Wikipedia article goes with them. So there's simply no way this article can realistically be kept without the name Bill in it. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 03:25, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are right, but the version of the article up for deletion keeps the Bill references, so there is really no reason for anyone to vote for deletion. And I just got the feeling that she thinks it can be deleted just like that. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHollyAm_2189.html" title="User:HollyAm">HollyAm</a> 04:14, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now. If I were you I'd leave a comment for the anonymous editor. I think admin would honor a verified request from the real Barbara Amesbury. Until then we really don't know if it's her or someone else. I mean it's <i>possible</i> that the real Barbara is proud of the article and this anonymous person has a personal grudge against her or is a random bigot. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 06:54, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article shouldn't be deleted just because the subject doesn't want it to be known that she's trans (if indeed the subject is the person who requested deletion) -- if somebody is out, they're out. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 08:30, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: couldn't the article be moved to "Bill Amesbury" and Barbara not be mentioned? The name that the songs were recorded under is the important one. This is assuming it's actually her. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 13:59, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wait a minute. Are there any reliable sources establishing that Bill and Barbara Amesbury are the same person? It's not that I doubt it, but I don't think we can legitimately include this in the article without citing a reputable source, and the only sources I can find are <a href="http://www.queermusicheritage.com/oct2002s.html" class="external text" title="http://www.queermusicheritage.com/oct2002s.html" rel="nofollow">a queer radio show playlist</a> and <a href="http://bodzie.freeservers.com/history/feb.html" class="external text" title="http://bodzie.freeservers.com/history/feb.html" rel="nofollow">a freeservers website</a>. <a href="http://trooper.com/default.php?cat=gallery&amp;subcat=178" class="external text" title="http://trooper.com/default.php?cat=gallery&amp;subcat=178" rel="nofollow">Another website</a> credits the song itself to Bill Amesbury but adds, "Written by Barbara Amesbury," implying that they are <i>not</i> the same person. So I vote we <b>move</b> this to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Amesbury_8d0e.html" title="Bill Amesbury">Bill Amesbury</a>, who is certainly notable, and <b>excise references to Barbara unless a reliable source is cited</b>, in which case I would be in favor of <b>keeping</b> the article. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMae</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Bill is Barbara; the writing credits on her songs were changed from Bill to Barbara after her name changed (which is an entirely normal thing — a songwriter who changes his or her name <i>always</i> has the option of having their past songwriting credits recredited to the new name.) The <i>performing</i> credit remained as Bill, however, because a male singing voice is a lot harder to gloss over. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:00, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
