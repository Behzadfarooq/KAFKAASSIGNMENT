<p>my message to Wirbelwind&#160;:</p>
<p><i>Hi, Wirbelwind... I would like to have very clear indications as to how I can improve my article on this french metal group, since I notice you've come to visit us&#160;:-)</i> I would very much like to avoid suppression, as I am now working, as a musicologist (I am a doctor in musicology, name Isabelle Servant))on young metal groups in France (but very much noticeable, as I think Artefact is, with its two albums...) Did you have the time to judge fairly their music? ( a number of samples and some titles are at the bottom of the page) if so, then you are very dedicated, thank you But I must say I am <b>quite surprised</b> you never wrote anything on the talk page, which is the first thing wikipedians are supposed to do when they disapprove of anything this talk page on Artefact(band) is here&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Artefact_%28band%29&amp;action=edit" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Artefact_%28band%29&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Artefact_%28band%29&amp;action=edit</a> By any means, show me any page where a fair debate can take place, thank you and read you soon I hope</p>

<p>I must add what I mean by "very clear indications"&#160;: indications that do not refer to a general page of recommendations (which pages I have read and reread) but speak of the subject itself--<a href="../../../o/r/d/User%7EOrdocello_3964.html" title="User:Ordocello">Ordocello</a> 10:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict) You should re-read <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> if you haven't already, because there really is a lot of things needing to be wikified. For example, album names are supposed to be italicized, not bolded. "French" in the first sentence should be capitalized. There are way too many bolded words. Statements such as where the name came from, and who influenced them, should be cited. There shouldn't be any original research either, so you can't just write down what you think. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALL</a>, meaning you shouldn't include information so far ahead, especially if it's a year away, in 2008. There's no references and no note on why they're notable. Just because they released two CDs does not make them notable. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. External links only link to their website (twice), and a French wiki.</dd>
<dd>P.S. Posting after 40 minutes is not exactly patient. I'm not home at a computer all day, and I'm fairly sure most people here who volunteer on wikipedia don't. --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirbelwind_a23d.html" title="User:Wirbelwind">Wirbelwind<small>ヴィルヴェルヴィント</small></a>&#160;(<a href="../../../w/i/r/User_talk%7EWirbelwind_25ad.html" title="User talk:Wirbelwind">talk</a>) 22:14, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah&#160;!! thank you so much in coming. Wirbel wind, neither am I behind my computer all day,I am a musician and have tons of work to do everyday. I am relatively new in french Wikipedia, and completely new in your english version, I am a volunteer, too,I do'nt care a bit about other motives than contributing so please, do explain things. And you have done it, very satisfactorily. But,please pardon me if I believe that perhaps you would not have said anything, had I not expressed myself.<br />
now to your advice&#160;: first lines are only formal, OK, for the rest I question the choice of this page for your critics, because a great many pages describing black metal groups are quite on this model, and those groups are not more notable, so...? is there another reason, or you simply passed here and lo<br />
notability: I had judged that two CDs (not auto produced) AND a third prize in the greatest metal festival in the world, Wacken Open Air, were sufficient signs, if other contributors could say what they think, thanks to you<br />
I don't understand "statement should be cited": do you mean "quoted"?<br />
I shall attend as well as possible, anyway<br />
especially in finding how to present external sources (but later, since I amnot behind my computer all day long&#160;:-) )--<a href="../../../o/r/d/User%7EOrdocello_3964.html" title="User:Ordocello">Ordocello</a> 22:30, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're welcome. Mmm, black metal is probably ok, but the influences should be cited/referenced. It means someone official (or at least notable) said that the band is influenced by those people, and the list didn't come from an unpublished source. Two CDs in itself is not notable, however, third prize in Wacken Open Air might be notable, but it has to be cited. Meaning, show mainstream news or official sites that show they won 3rd place. --<a href="../../../w/i/r/User%7EWirbelwind_a23d.html" title="User:Wirbelwind">Wirbelwind<small>ヴィルヴェルヴィント</small></a>&#160;(<a href="../../../w/i/r/User_talk%7EWirbelwind_25ad.html" title="User talk:Wirbelwind">talk</a>) 23:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hello again... as for Wacken battle, I see what you mean, but I did put an internal link, and Artefact is cited in their page. So I thought that could do. I'll think about it, thanks--<a href="../../../o/r/d/User%7EOrdocello_3964.html" title="User:Ordocello">Ordocello</a> 10:37, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>layout is a mess (many blank lines etc, improper paragraphs</li>
<li>Provide a proper discography</li>
<li>Album tracklistings should go into separate articles</li>
<li>there are also weasel words, pov issues, incorrect grammar</li>
<li>Incorrect use of references/ external links</li>

<dd>thanks for the answer&#160;:<br />

2) I don't get what a proper discography is,according to you... that's a genuine question, tell me...<br />
3) OK<br />
4) incorrections&#160;: please help and correct<br />
4) ref/internal links&#160;: OK I'll do that as well (providing a link would be nice)<br />
