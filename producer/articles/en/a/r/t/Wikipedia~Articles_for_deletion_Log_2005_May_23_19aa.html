<li><b>Delete</b>, do not redirect. The function of a redirect is to guide users who might type a keyword in to the article. San Francisco only has one school district.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've been thinking of making this into a redirect to the unified district--there are several California counties that have a single unified district. This is part of a fairly large project-in-progress, and the name of this article is part of a pattern "List of school districts in X county" intended to make it easy for the lists to be located by a person with only a minimal understanding of the underlying school system. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:43, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Comment - one item doesn't a list make. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGentgeen_2e43.html" title="User:Gentgeen">Gentgeen</a> 02:50, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually a useful list can even contain zero items. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:41, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Alright, I'll ask it: How can a useful list contain zero items? <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 20:56, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It can hold a place in a category or a list of lists, by its existence dispelling the possibility that its omission is an oversight. This could sometimes be useful owing to the very fluid nature of Wikipedia development.</li>
<li>This is one reason why I'd prefer this article not to be deleted, even though it comprises only one item. The omission from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_school_districts_in_California_by_county_e034.html" title="Lists of school districts in California by county">Lists of school districts in California by county</a> of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_school_districts_in_San_Francisco_County%2C_California_4649.html" title="List of school districts in San Francisco County, California">List of school districts in San Francisco County, California</a> might seem rather odd. I could replace it with a direct link to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Unified_School_District_1764.html" title="San Francisco Unified School District">San Francisco Unified School District</a>, but to me that seems less elegant. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:06, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Since the article is part of a "list of lists" that is titled "Lists of school districts in California by county" I agree that it would seem strange to omit San Francisco county even if that particular list only has one item. This page should be judged on how it helps a user of Wikipedia, not on the content of a single article. It serves a valid purpose, just as do redirect pages and dismbiguation pages. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 21:30, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Part of a series.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>By strict vote count, I get 13 "delete" (1 anon discounted), 13 "keep" (2 anon or unsigned discounted), 6 "redirect", 2 "transwiki" and 4 that abstained or were too ambiguous to call. The article was expanded some during the discussion period but did not fundamentally change in tone or topic.</p>
<p>There were two suggested redirect targets - both presented fairly early in the discussion. Those arguing to redirect to a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> page did not support the retention of any of the current content. Those supporting a redirect to <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">beauty</a> were mixed.</p>
<p>Re-reading the current version, I find myself agreeing with the argument that even after expansion the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> content is nothing more than a dictionary definition - that is, a discussion of the definition, origins and usage of a word or phrase. I personally see very little possibility of further expansion. I can find no evidence that the term "beautiful people" (as described in this article) is a recognized concept or class in sociology.</p>
<p>I am going to call this one as a "no concensus" which defaults to keep for now.</p>
<p>Switching hats, I am now going to act as an ordinary editor and <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> in merging this with <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">beauty</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A lot of these votes seem to miss the point. "Beautiful people" aren't people who are endowed with beauty.

<dd>Comment: I got it, Grutness. The term derives from the 1960's, when it was a term for the "groovy" people. It was an in-group term by the Flower Power set. The beautiful people inevitably included the Carnaby Street folks. In the 1970's, the in-group flower child term got extended over to fashionistas and the "hip" of NYC. Anyway, from there it just got to be the "insiders" and "the chosen by the Bohemians," and from there "the perfection of cool." It could be discussed, but the problem is in writing about it <i>with references</i> and not just folk etymology and pop culture. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:26, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would <b>keep</b> the article but it does need to be expanded to be more than a dictionary definition. The term "<a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">Hippie</a>" could also be a dictdef but, as written, the Wikipedia article on that term provides more insight into the word than a dictionary would be expected to provide. Although the term "beautiful people" is not as significant to the culture of the period as "hippie," it still could be more than a dictdef. And in my mind, while moving the article to Wicktionary may make sense if the article stays as it is, moving it to <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">Beauty</a> makes no sense because the term is not really about "beauty" notwithstanding the word "beautiful." <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 22:33, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: as per the deletion policy and general consensus on Wikipedia. Unless the article demonstrates that this particular high school is significant among high schools, it has no identity and cannot be discussed. Every donut shop "affects thousands of lives," as does every phone book, every traffic light, etc. Rows of things performing identical functions are not responsible for nor creditable with the individual experiences of that function. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:20, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>That may be your opinion and you are entitled to it, but at least in Illinois applying the word "common" to IB programs would be a real stretch. And as long as we are stating opinions, I think to put a school stub on VfD <b>two minutes</b> after it is created is absolutely ridiculous. The whole purpose of any stub is to create an article. Regardless of whether a school should be "notable" to get an article, I would venture to say (again, only my opinion) that most people who are voting to delete are doing so on the content of the stub without any investigation of the "notability" of the school. Give it time to develop, IMO. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 14:39, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I teach at the school - and in fact began this article on 5/22/05, then posted a link to it on my webpage asking my students (those from the advanced placement and IB program mentioned in the article) to improve upon it. They have begun to do so already. The school is significant within the Cincinnati area and within Ohio - just having been named #1 fund-raising school in the nation for Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma (raising over $35,000 this year) and having a student score a perfect 2400 on the recent SAT. The article needs improvement, yes, but not deletion. As a rookie, I am thoroughly open to advice - particlarly from the user who mentioned that the article title was incorrect. Just checked the BEEEFSTEW page and understand a bit better.

Still, they have a near <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Trier_High_School_240f.html" title="New Trier High School">New Trier High School</a>-like status, (which is <i>exactly</i> why my aunt &amp; uncle shelled out big bucks to live in that district).

All votes to keep should be ignored since the article at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_High_School_5364.html" title="Princeton High School">Princeton High School</a> has to be a disambig page.

<li><b>Merge</b> a very cut down version. The article gives no suggestion that this school has no influence outside of the immediate geographical area, and no suggestion that it achieves anything else that a thousand other schools don't, so padding it out with lists of sports clubs doesn't make it worth keeping on its own at the moment, and there is no suggestion that it can be expanded usefully.

<li>It is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_languages_by_total_speakers.html#Summary_table" title="List of languages by total speakers">estimated</a> that there are 335.5 million native speakers of English. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_2000_Census_11d2.html" title="United States 2000 Census">2000 US Census</a> estimates 281 million United States citizens. It further states that 47 million of the respondents do not speak English at home, leaving some 234 million English speakers in the United States. Now I realize that speaking English at home is not an indication of native speakerhood, but the majority of those people are going to be native speakers. That's a big chunk of the English native speakers. Therefore, I would expect viewpoints on English Wikipedia to have an American bias, if only because a majority of the users are likely American.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I made a brief attempt to clean up some of the POV. Surya Das is fairly well known among American Buddhists, and although I am not particularly a fan of his writing, we have read one of his books in my group (a different American Buddhist tradition). I left the "neutrality" tag, but would be happy to see it come down. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 17:42, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I really find this hard to believe. His book "Awakening the Buddha Within" carries blurbs by Jon Kabat-Zinn, Thich Nhat Hanh, Sharon Salzberg, and Ken Wilbur -- that's practically a who's-who of American Buddhism (ok, maybe not Wilbur). If you're an American Buddhist, you've heard of the guy. I've said already that I'm not a big fan, but notable he certainly is. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 17:17, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Although I agree its an infomercial, Wikipedia needs more information on Buddhism and its leaders. If an article is biased then someone should fix it not delete the entire article.

<li>The 4chan crowd is extremely unlikely to give up on this one, folks- already they're calling for setting up "WRRRRRRRRRYYYYY" etc. Just leave it be. Trust me on this- if you start into a "delete vs. create new entry" war, you'll loose- because they'll either recruit people to make new pages, or just write a script to do their side of it (and run it through proxy networks, of which they know all about for getting into Japan-only websites etc), and you'll have to "vote" on each one, or delete them by hand. They may even start defacing other pages en-masse. Right, you'll win that one. Oh, and believe it or not, the origins of memes are pretty funny sometimes. Just ignore it, for chrissakes (it's actually quite amusing how up-in-arms you're all getting about it- find something better to do, please).

<dd>Well in that case you might as well throw out all the Egyptian chronologies and king lists which at best are only accurate to +/-5 years and at worst could be centuries out. In fact in the case of Egypt there are 3 different chronologies that have been reconstructed because nobody can agree on how long each pharaoh reigned and when a battle took place. Since margins of errors have been given on all the dates, the Greek chronology is no different to the ones used for Egypt. In fact the traditional Greek chronology is considerably more accurate than the Egyptian because every ancient historian agreed that 1183 BC was the date the Trojan War ended and 1103 BC was the date of the Dorian decent into the Peloponnese. --<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyrosargyrou_666e.html" title="User:Argyrosargyrou">Argyrosargyrou</a> 18:11, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You do understand, don't you, that the problem here is not with a scholarly dating of Greek legendary events, but that these are <i>legendary dates</i> deduced solely from literary evidence? The dating for Egyptians comes from modern archeology. Modern archeology also indicates that the Trojan War, whatever it was, was probably 800-900 BC. The dates you have here, though, include the gods, etc., and come entirely from legendary speculation. Jerome is a great authority on a lot of things, and he's a saint and one of the brightest men in history, but he wasn't an archeologist. That's why this material shouldn't be presented as fact and should be put in the cosmology section of the Greek myth article. Modern scholars don't even agree on how and what the Greek gods were in origin, whether they were cthonian gods, hero cults, or nature gods, much less how and when each migrated into the Greek isles. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:09, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This nomination is the result of the personal academic and religious bigotry of DreamGuy who wants to censor this article because it does not fit in with his prejudices and misconceptions of Greek history and mythology.

<li>This needs a deal of thought. This is <i>a</i> mythical chronology (since others could be constructed from the legends), but 'according to whom?' A case can perhas be made that this is a fair record of Jerome's suggestions, if so, fair enough, but rename it 'Jerome's mythical chronology', and remove anything that goes beyond Jerome (as original research). The comparison with Egyptology is patently false: the Egyptian dates are a reporting of current scholarly ideas about real history. This article cites no secondary literature - so unless it is simply a record of Jerome's work then it ought to be deleted as original research. In short a) <b>Rename</b> and clean-up – as Jerome’s work b) <b>or delete</b> as original research c) <b>or cite</b> mainstream scholars who also adopt this chronology (but I doubt that’s possible).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(t)</a> 19:14, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Since Jerome used multiple sources including Eusebius, Castor, Diodorus and Apollodorus it is not actualy his chorology. Technically the chronology in question is referred to as the "Traditional Chronology" and was not exclusive to Jerome. I have already cited mainstream scholars who use this chronology within the margin of error including Michael Wood, Alden A. Mosshammer, and J. C. Stobart. Jerome's main source was Eusebius who he translated into Latin and there are more dates and reigns in Eusebius Preparation of the Gospel where he also cites Tatian. Eusebius main source was Diodorus Siculus who wrote a complete history from the time of the Gods up until about 50 BC. Diodorus considered the Gods to have been real people who were once kings of Greece. Almost every modern scholar agrees with the 1183 BC date for the end of the Trojan War and an 1450 BC date for Minos I of Crete.--<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyrosargyrou_666e.html" title="User:Argyrosargyrou">Argyrosargyrou</a> 19:46, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> the comparison to the Usher speculation is not appropriate - precisely because that is clearly designated as <i>Usher's</i> theory/research. This, however, is drawn from a number of ancient sources (although principally Eusebius/Jerome). Unless it is a generally accepted scholarly timeframe (and verifiably such), then it is by definition original research compiled from ancient sources. Further, were Greek myths narrated by the ancients with a consistent and discernable timeline in mind? - Or is that not a highly a dubious theory in itself? I say again, as interesting as this is, this needs labelled as someone's reconstruction (if you can reconstruct history from myths) or deleted. (And if we are combing archaeology with interpretations of the authorial intention of mythic literature then we <i>are</i> doing original research.) --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(t)</a> 00:37, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: The creator of this page claims the nomination is due to "personal academic and religious bigotry". This is absolute nonsense. The problem with this is it's all unsourced dates for which the creator assembled willy nilly without references. In fact the article makes no sense at all, as these are straight mythical events with no historical veracity. Assigning dates to them completely unsourced as if they have real meaning is nonsense. I also highly suspect that the creator of the page is a well-known netkook who thinks these events actually happened in history. The "religious bigotry" line apparently refers to his religious beliefs, as otherwise the comment makes no sense. And I wish people wouldn't vote on this unless they take a step back and look at the overall picture of what the article is doing: Giving ridiculously useless dates to events that never happened. What kind of encyclopedia lets people wander onto this information as if it was really real? <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 07:27, May 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Last comment: dates for mythology or even fictional events are not the problem <i>per se</i> (see Starwars etc.). The problem is whose dates are these? Starwars dates exist (consistently?) in the mind &amp; work of Lucas. These dates relate to myths retold and recreated in disparate cultural situations over centuries. Do these narrators share an imagined timeline? Unless they are in the mind of one named author (Homer, Eusebius etc) and titled as such, or are reporting an accepted framework of modern scholarship – then they are original research. Citing different sources for different ‘events’ will not do – as their selection and amalgamation would still be idiosyncratic and original research. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(t)</a> 09:16, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> or <b>Rewrite</b>. I share Doc's mixed feelings. I do not think the article should be deleted, but only because of what I see as its potential. Obviously no one is claiming that these are accurate dates of real historical events. The article is related to mythology, not history. As a chronology of mythological events, I think it can be of great use to any scholar researching Greek mythology. This is because <i>myths</i> are not (just) meaningful in and of themselves, but because they are part of a larger body of literature (i.e. <i>mythology</i>), which has an underlying logic. The temporal relationship between mythic events is one clue to that underlying logic (the chronology in which the myths actually came to exist, to be told, to be written down, i.e. the chronology of literary events, is another matter — these <i>are</i> historical events and provide a whole other angle to analyzing mythology, equally valid, but different from the chronology of <i>mythical</i> events). However, in my own experience people within a culture may have widely varying views of the temporal frame of their myths — they may differ as to the order of events; they may differ as to whether the events occured in sequence or are all different ways of talking about the same moment in their "history;" or they may relegate myths to some ahistorical/nontemporal time. I do not know enough about Greek mythology and the literary and historical study of Greek mythology to know which, if any, of these possibilities applies to Greek mythology. I <b>do</b> know, though, that an article such as this must (1) be as clear as possible about who/what the source is for this chronology; when that source was composed/when its author lived; and an account of the historical context in which the author of this source lived, which gives clues as to how this chronology may have been used. Moreover, if there are differing chronologies, or among Greek writers wholely different views about the temporality of the myths, these views must also be represented. And of course, all properly sourced. Such an article will be worth far more than the "dates in Star Wars" article (which really just give us some insight into George Lucas's creative process); it will be a useful link to the article on Greek mythology, giving, or sparking, some insight into ancient Hellenic culture. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 14:53, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I do not believe VFD is the right appropriate place to debate whether or not an RFC should be deleted based on whether or not it was certified within the 48 hour time limit. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 09:18, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with Zzyzx11. We should open an RFC on RFC procedure. I've attempted this in the past but it seems most people don't really care what happens to an uncertified RFC (and before I started cleanup duty there, they were kept for months). <b>Speedy delete</b>, imho, per RFC procedure. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:58, May 23, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The question is whether or not there was a certification. In addition, there is the matter of the current RfAr against jguk, in which this RfC could play a part. I think it would currently be irresponsible to delete it; I think it would only be recreated in the future. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">Smoddy</a> <a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmoddy_5430.html" title="User talk:Smoddy">(Rabbit and pork)</a> 10:23, 23 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>According to RfC procedure, an uncertified complaint is to be speedily deleted, but I'm sure the arbitrators can still view it if appropriate (although I am not an admin, the capability to undelete implies that the RfC must persist in some way). I don't think this complaint would serve to bolster jguk's case, but he could reference it (or Lulu could do so as well, given that he has apparently entered an appearance on the RfAr docket). <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 12:02, 23 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Whig - it was certified (by Lulu). His certification put off others from certifying it (leaving them to endorse it). It has now been certified by a third person. There is still a dispute, what is the problem with keeping it? <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 12:25, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any admin or arbcom can review a deleted page as needed. This RFC was obviously not certified by two different users within 48 hours (as RFC procedure indicates). One certification is by Lulu herself and is obviously a cheap joke, and Susvolans's certification is from a week later. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:32, May 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Whether or not admins or arbcomm members can, it is important for the transparency of the arbitration process that such a page is not deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_Is_No_Cabal_17da.html" title="There Is No Cabal">There Is No Cabal</a>. If Lulu had not certified the RFC, others would have done, I have no doubt. I don't see Lulu's certification as being a "cheap joke", but rather agreeing with jguk's summary. If that was not the case, he should strike it out and another 48 hours should be allowed for certification. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">Smoddy</a> <a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmoddy_5430.html" title="User talk:Smoddy">(Rabbit and pork)</a> 12:39, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINMC_f912.html" title="WP:TINMC">there is</a>. Anyway - <i>if lulu had not certified, others would have</i> is speculative, and is contradicted by the fact that they haven't. It's common for more than two people to certify an RFC, after all. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 14:50, May 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, another user (Susvolans) has since certified the RfC, and I did check with another user that he would certify the RfC before I posted it - in the event, and no doubt because it was already certified (by Lulu), he chose to endorse the RfC rather than certify it.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a>, the exact policy on user disputes on RFC is the following: Two people must certify the dispute by documenting their individual efforts, provide evidence that those efforts have failed to produce change, and sign the comment page within 48 hours after the RFC dispute was created. Otherwise, it is to be <i>speedy deleted</i> (unless the subject has explicitly requested it to be retained). The question here is whether Lulu counts as the second person to certify his own RFC. Clearly, Susvolans signed well after the two day deadline. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 22:38, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>What may be considered a related issue is the fact that one cannot file Arbitration against oneself (both Snowspinner and Xiong have attempted such, and were rejected).

<li>Arbitration is not RFC. Lulu certified that jguk's account was accurate.

Once you've locked in an "invalid" certification, wait more than 48 hours and VfD it.

<p>If Google was setting the standards for which articles should stay and which should be deleted, wikipedia would be a very sad place. The article was started 1 hour ago and should be edited, not deleted. Pernille76</p>
<p>Pernille, I'm sorry, but your friend Eyolf (and I'll grant you the benefit of the doubt in assuming that you yourself aren't Eyolf making a vanity page) doesn't seem to be <i>notable</i>. Running a website = big deal; millions of people run websites. What makes this Bob Dylan-centric website different from all other Bob Dylan-centric websites, of which there are hundreds? What else has he done? It's true that Google isn't the be-all and end-all of notability - I put up a page for my family's piano tuner, because it turns out he did notable and significant things in his life.

<p>The article is trivially short and seems unexpandable. It contains only such trivia as "Snæbjörn is not a common name in Iceland.", a dicdef, and the amount of people bearing the name.</p>
<p>This was the subject of an <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Sn%C3%A6bj%C3%B6rn_old_c556.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Snæbjörn/old">earlier VfD</a> which yielded no consensus since several people suggested <i>transwiki</i> or <i>merge</i>.

<li>Comment: VfD is not for getting rid of articles. VfD is for deliberating on whether an article has or has not violated the deletion policy. It is not an insult or punishment for an article to be listed here.

<li>Well then, why don't you reword it to make it more 'encyclopaedic'. You're right in admitting that your 'Singaporean law is a little iffy'. You should not recommend articles for deletion when you know nothing about the subject. The quotes are taken directly from the Singapore Statutes online. There is nothing iffy about any of the information given. Kindly remove this article from consideration for deletion as soon as possible.165.21.154.8 16:24, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, I was less than clear with my wording. My concern with the legality was whether it is legal to quote such large sections, which arguably have Singaporean copyright. I believe in some countries that is the case. I was saying about the encyclopedicness – is that a word? – of the entry that it would be encyclopedic if it were included in an article such as <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_in_Singapore_36c6.html" title="Homosexuality in Singapore">Homosexuality in Singapore</a>, but, on its own, it is not encyclopedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think that <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soil_erosion.html" title="Soil erosion">Soil erosion</a> would be a good redirect.

<p>"Virtual device" is not a term I've ever seen outside Wikipedia. Windows does have something called a "virtual device driver" (which is probably worth an article) but it's a completely different concept.</p>
<p>The files described in the article actually do exist, but they're called "special files" on Unix, and "device files" on DOS and Windows. Special/device files are actually a bigger topic, because they can represent both real and imaginary devices. But OS designers have never seen the need for a separate name for imaginary devices files. And even if they did, they wouldn't use the word "virtual" -- /dev/null isn't a virtualization of a real device, it's a pure software concept.</p>
<p>This article is now redundant with <a href="../../../d/e/v/Device_file.html" title="Device file">Device file</a> and needs to go away. <i>It should not become a redirect</i> -- that would perpetuate a creative usage that only exists in the mind of the author. ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 20:48, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b>. This is no neologism, but a term with a very, very long pedigree in UNIX and UNIX-like systems (just like it says in the article). Actually it probably even predates widespread use of UNIX. <a href="http://www.xyweb.com/rfc/rfc0740.html" class="external text" title="http://www.xyweb.com/rfc/rfc0740.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is an example of a RFC document produced by what was to become IETF, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc740" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc740">RFC 740</a>, dated 1977, that uses the term in a commonplace manner, assuming that the reader understands what it means (and yes, we do). The relationship between virtual devices and special files is that virtual devices (like real devices) are implemented in UNIX using the special file mechanism. The article is wrong but the concept does exist and is distinct from special files. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:40, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I was wrong to claim that the term was never used before. But "virtual device" doesn't mean the same thing in that RFC that it does in the article. In the RFC, they're talking about a "virtual terminal", which is a software emulation (a virtualizaton) of a real-world device. In <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_device.html" title="Virtual device">virtual device</a>, "virtual" is used much more loosely, because none of the devices discussed exist outside of software -- you can't go to the computer store and buy a data sink! In other words, "virtual" is just a synonym for "pseudo". I challenge you to find another document where "virtual device" is used to mean "pseudodevice". ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 01:34, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The things actually described in this article are not virtual devices. Linux calls them (character devices with major number 1) "memory devices", for example.

There <i>are</i> things known as virtual devices, and indeed they are (most commonly) the things provided by virtual device drivers. (It's a shame that Wikipedia conflates virtual device driver with <a href="../../../v/x/d/VxD_f36d.html" title="VxD">VxD</a>, because that's wrong. Not all VxDs are virtual device drivers, and not all virtual device drivers are VxDs.

<p>I would like to use this article as an example of a type of article which should be deleted. Ross Flitney was formerly a youth goalkeeper at Fulham F.C., he was released on May 23 after making no appearances for the club. Being a reserve player, let alone an ex-reserve player, for a premier league side should not make a person encyclopedic by any stretch of the imagination. Just from the era of the Premier League there could be literally 1000s of virtual sub-stubs like this. At this time of the season dozens of players will be released by Premiership clubs who clearly will not play at that level at any point in the immediate future. I am essentially requesting permission to delete all articles relating to footballers who are released by Premier League sides who have no Premier League experience, although I do not see why these players have articles in the first place.</p>

Are we talking about youth players who have never played, or are we talking about players who have played for other clubs prior to joining a premiership team and have made appearances outside of the top division?

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is substantial evidence that the genocides commited by the Turks in the years between 1908 and 1923 (Armenian, Hellenic, Assyrian and others) are a fact, involving the extermination and deportation of millions. The fact that after decades of a fruitless denial, Turkey still cannot come to grips with these facts, does not make it reasonable not to present them or consider them disputable. A genocide does not have to be recognised by its perpetrators to actually be a genocide.--<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpryom_5aa9.html" title="User:Spryom">Spryom</a> 12:19, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The articles of US and British newspapers of that period confirm the genocide that took place in Minor Asia and resulted to the extermination of all non christians. Please keep this page. Mark Tomson. USA</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is an excellent factual contribution providing information on a Gewnocide that has been hidden for too long because it is denied by the perpetrators, the Turks, who now are trying to remove it. It is a fact that probably a minimum of 1 million Greeks were murdered in a systematic act of genocide, and that fact should never be forgotten. In order to check facts, one only has to check census figures collected by the Ottoma\n Empire for minirities. Only the heads of households were counted. Where are those hundreds of thousands of heads of households now? Where are their families? Denying the facts of genocide permits genocide to be committed. This Genocide is a fact, as was the Genocide of the Armenians, now recognised by more countries each year, in spite of the insistance by Turkey that it never happened. To not have this article would be to politicise Wikipedia. For an introduction to this subject read a book written by a contemporary witness, US Ambassador Henry Morgenthau, read 'The Blight of Asia', available to read online and in bookstores.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The turks are responsible for the Armenian, Greek and Syrian Genocide and the EU is starting to press forward with this issue.. it seems that turkish propaganda is playing a detremental role. Until this very day churches are confiscated. By deleting this article, means that were are giving in to barbarism and lies. Hopefully this is not what wikipedia is about.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think this is a well written article. The Turks should come to terms with their own history and stop being stubborn about it. Germany is a great example of a country that has repented for their sins. The European Union are pressing Turkey for this issue and also to have relations with Armenia. What are Turks afraid of anyway, true free ethnic equality?</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The topic is noteworthy in spite of the obvious problems with the current content. Whether the article content is accurate or POV should not drive the deletion decision. Those can be fixed via editing and fact checking. The debate surrounding the historical facts is relevant and there is content available to fix this article's content. Having an article about this topic is appropriate. My only reservations are about the chances of this article successfully reaching NPOV status.

<li><strike><b>Keep</b>. (Note that I <i>am not</i> a sockpuppet). I posted a blurb to the article's talk page before it was VfD'ed, but I'll post again here. The article as it stands now is a POV rant with major factual inaccuracies/distortions. I had suggested renaming to a less-inflammatory title or merging with other articles, but facts that I can find are scattered through several other Greek/Greece/Turkey/Turkish articles. It is a historical fact that Greek people were forcibly removed from Turkey, just like Turks were forcibly removed from Greece, Armenians from Turkey, etc. Pretty much every ethinc/national group in that region has been on the top and the bottom of the hierarchy at one time or another. All of these events are pretty important, if little-known, historical facts (read anything about the region by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_D._Kaplan_ed3d.html" title="Robert D. Kaplan">Robert D. Kaplan</a> for some great predictions). They helped lead to WWI and WWII... may lead to WWIII. The entire family of articles about Balkan history needs a ton of work, but I don't know nearly enough to do anything. Sadly, most of the people who do know enough seem to be from the region, so they bring a strong POV to editing. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a> 22:20, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</strike> (changed my vote to delete) <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a> 14:12, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Learn a little bit about Turkey and Turks...Most of the people living in Turkey who identify themselves as Turk are not ethnically Turkish. How anybody claim that Turks in Turkey are ethnically Turk? We are so mixed up. Armenian/Greek/Kurd/Arab/Turk/Caucasian...etc.They mixed up for centuries...The states in Anatolia during the 13th and 14th century were Byzantinum, basically Christian, then most of them converted to Islam due to the political and business reasons...Don't you see: We are same except religion...I travelled extensively in Greece, I love Greece and Greek people..I never had any bad experience in Greece, and when I shut my ears, everybody look like the people you can run accross anywhere in Turkey. Leave this hatred propaganda...We fought because of religion difference, the war ended 90 years ago, and Greek army was defeated. Leave it behind...Come and see Turkey, have Turkish friends...enjoy peace! -<a href="../../../y/c/e/User%7EYce_5bbf.html" title="User:Yce">Cansın</a> 19.08, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear Cansin, there is no hatred propaganda. Greece and Turkey will be neighbouring forever. It would be a major step towards peace though, to help Turkey stop the denial approach of history and recognise the genocides. History always speaks about the past. Leaving it behind is forgetting history, which is not the right choice. In what concerns your references to Byzantium and Anatolia, well, this is your personal pov and I do not agree. The Ottomans were quite tolerant with other religions and ethnic tribes. The Young Turks however, were not tolerant. 20th century, that's when Anatolia stopped being a "mixed up" (multiethnic I would describe it) area.--<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpryom_5aa9.html" title="User:Spryom">Spryom</a> 07:40, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
