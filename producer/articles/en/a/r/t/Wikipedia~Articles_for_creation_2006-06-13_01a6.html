It was rescued by the arts and crafts architect Norman Jewson in the 1920s after a century of neglect. With a thousand years of history, there is a rare collection of painted cloths as well as various period outbuildings including a court house, tithe barn and grist mill.</p>

<p>Richard Collier was born in Dallas Texas to a family of then four including his older brother, his older sister, and his two parents. At a young age he moved to Colonial Heights, VA, and was exposed to the simple life of a virginian. Just as he had settled down he was moved, once again, to Longwood, FL. He lived out his eventful high school years in a house on Homer St. After high school he wore, for the first time, a chipmunk suit and traveled down the road to a local 7-11 and scared away little children. Because of this, his family decided to send him away to a prestigous medical facility located in Boston Mass. Many studies are centered around him and his many quirks. It has been discovered that though he prefers the chipmunk outfit, he looks better with swimfins and a rubber tu-tu. His greatest desire is to be the trusty sidekick of a famous superhero, and to write a 1000 page Romance Novel entitled THE BUTTERFLY. He was moved to a facility in North Attleboro, Mass. during the early 21st Century where his current intrests include clay pots and video games.</p>

<p><b>Johnnie Walters</b> was one of CKCO-TV's Most popular personalities. He hosted "THE JOHNNIE WALTERS SHOW" which I believe started in 1975(?)&amp; ran till the early '80s.It was on weekday mornings &amp; was an hour long. It featured Various guests-Celebrities pitching their latest TV show/Movie etc,an Exercise segment,Horoscopes &amp; a Cooking segment as well(?). He also hosted "TRIVIA COMPANY" on CKCO TV From the early to late '80s.This show was a half hour game show type program which featured him going out on the street asking various people on the street various Trivia questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>There was also a later version which appeared on CFPL TV (London)in the early '90s.It also was a half hour program that aired on early Sunday evenings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnnie_Walters_9a0f.html" title="Johnnie Walters">Johnnie Walters</a> also was an occasional fill in Weatherman on the 11 p.m. edition of the local CKCO TV news.He looked GREAT in the Classic traditonal CKCO TV RED Jacket!</p>
<p>Born in Canada, Walters made the rounds hosting local shows on TV stations in various US cities, developing his unique style. According to Dave Thomas' book, "SCTV: Behind The Scenes", Walters hosted a show in St. Louis, MO. called "Dialling For Dollars", which was spoofed on the satire show.</p>
<p>Walters paid his dues, then came to CKCO, Kitchener a seasoned pro, his first attempt there being "Horoscope Dollars," a very low-budget show, featuring Walters actually calling residents at random (before call display) with a money question, the correct answer to which depended on them viewing that particular show. Some of the best moments came during the the time spent dialling and waiting for numbers to connect, as he engaged in informal banter with offscreen crew and organist Hap Swathrich.</p>
<p>He had a GREAT sense of Humour &amp; stood out from the rest of the News personalities!!!</p>
<p>WHERE IS JOHNNIE WALTERS NOW???? He's sorely Missed. Always looking for classic TV show episodes of his shows!</p>

<p>Victoria Lautman is a commentator in Chicago’s world of arts, culture, and the humanities. As founder, host, and executive-producer of Writers on the Record with Victoria Lautman, Victoria created a popular author-interview series, which is also a three-pronged, multi-media brand unique to Chicago, comprising a monthly column in Chicago magazine, a free, audience-attended interview at the Lookingglass Theatre, and a simultaneous broadcast on 98.7WFMT Radio. The series was inaugurated in September 2004, and has drawn major national and international authors to Chicago, including Edward P. Jones, Louise Erdrich, Frank McCourt, Michael Cunningham, and Susan Orlean, among many others.</p>
<p>Prior to conceiving and founding this free, public series, Victoria was a featured host and contributor on Chicago Public Radio for two decades, beginning as a free-lance arts reviewer while in her twenties. These accessible, humorous, and insightful reviews proved popular and eventually led to Victoria’s own arts and culture magazine program, "Artistic License", which aired for eight years. When a new daily magazine, "848", started up, Victoria signed on as a regular interviewer and contributor on a wide variety of subjects, including not only arts and culture but also medicine, education, and other complex issues. Her personal essays on day-to-day life were a regular feature of the program.</p>
<p>Victoria has been Chicago Editor for Metropolitan Home Magazine, Art &amp; Auction, Architectural Record, and HG. She’s also been a frequent contributor to the Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine, and has written for Interview, Elle Décor, Architectural Digest, USA Today, The Chicago Sun-Times, and the Chicago Reader. Her best-selling art book, "The New Tattoo," from Abbeville Press, was first published in 1994.</p>
<p>Victoria has also been a regular contributor to Chicago PBS affiliate WTTW-Ch. 11's Emmy award-winning programs "Artbeat Chicago" and "Chicago Tonight"; a segment host and producer on WBBM-Ch. 2’s award-winning magazine show, "Eye On Chicago"; and, a regular culture correspondent for WMAQ-Ch. 5’s afternoon news report.</p>
<p>Victoria has an M.A. in Art History from George Washington University, and a B.A. in Anthropology and Art History from the University of New Mexico. She also attended Merton College at Oxford University for archeological field training, and spent one summer digging through Bronze Age garbage in the Scottish Hebrides.</p>

<p>In 1894 machine gun inventor Sir Hiram Maxim turned his hand to heavier than air flight. Near Bexley, south of London, England, he built a temporary aerodrome in which he constructed a large steam powered biplane. Complete with a thousand pound water tube boiler and 300 horsepower engine, this incongruous monster was trundled out onto guideways and launched into flight.</p>
<p>While the guideways prevented free flight, the aircraft did take to its wings with three passengers for one thousand feet and as much as its guides would let it. The machine crashed at the end of its journey.</p>

Steam Helicopter: "The flying Steam Shovel"</p>
<p>In 1904, not content to sit back and watch the new century drift in, a railway engineer named Gagnon decided to speed it in with a rotary wing vehicle. After several months of tinkering in his Rossland, BC, workshop Gagnon unveiled his work of art. It was immediatey christened the "Flying Steam Shovel." Once steam had been raised and Gagnon esconsced in the cockpit, he took to the air. Alas, as with most early flight pioneers, the problem of flight controls had yet to be solved, and Gagnon unceremoniously crashed.</p>

<p>61.0.7.241 05:13, 12 June 2006 (UTC) I NEVER RISKED MY SOUL i risked my own self yet i was never rewarded i risked it by being truthful &amp; i risked it by not being fearful</p>
<p>i risked my emotions i risked it by liking them i risked it by trusting them &amp; i risked it by cherishing them</p>
<p>i risked my time i risked it while having fun i risked it while knowing the real run &amp; i risked it while sitting with them in the sun</p>
<p>i risked my mind i risked it by explaining to them i risked it by thinking of them &amp; i risked it by preferring them</p>
<p>i risked my heart i risked it by sharing with them i risked it by caring for them &amp; i risked it by unknowing them</p>
<p>i expected so much out of them yet i could accept nothing for they offered to me the opposites of good</p>
<p>i looked at my god it trusted in me &amp; so did i i had not lost my faith</p>
<p>i had not lost my heart i had not lost my mind i had not lost my time i had not lost my emotions</p>
<p>i realised, i had not lost my self i recollected everything &amp; set out on a journey &amp; dreaming, &amp; dreaming, &amp; dreaming</p>
<p>now, i ceased listening to my mind &amp; peeped into my heart, my faith, my god i went on &amp; on to find someone kind</p>
<p>i met with many on my way they are still with me &amp; follow their say she understands me the other helps me</p>
<p>while the rest accompany me few just make my day yet i haven't stopped dreaming because i'm now searching someone to believe in again</p>
<p>someone who makes me laugh &amp; allows me to cry someone who is accountable someone who is stimulating</p>
<p>someone who is thoughtful someone who is variety-full now, someone appropriate will play the role because now, i'm ready to risk my soul...</p>

<p>I am Chris Fisher and I am the lead singer and I also play guitar and percussion. I spent my younger years playing drums throughout high school and college. I went to college at the State University of NY at New Paltz and majored in business administration. I transferred to New Paltz with an Associates Degree from Columbia Greene Community College. Funny thing, they built a performing arts builidng there the year after I graduated.</p>
<p>At New Paltz I took a few performance classes but never could seem to get into learning theory. As do a lot of musicians I played in various cover bands before I formed Conehead Buddha as an original project.</p>
<p>If you've seen us live, you know that we sometimes throw in a cover tune (or bits and pieces of one) now andthen when the mood strikes us. Ever since the band began in 1993, people have been yelling out for Lynyrd Skynyrd at our shows. Don't hold your breath, but someday we're gonna pull out a Freebird extended jam and shut those hecklers up for good.</p>

<p>Every simple convex closed curve in R^2 has at least four vertices.</p>
<p>In other words, every convex curve, has at least 4 points where the rate of change of local curvature, Ks reaches zero.</p>
<p>i.e. for a simple closed convex paramaterized curve, gamma(t), dKs/dt=0 at at least 4 points on the curve</p>
<p>Two examples: In the case of a circle, which has constant curvature at every point, dKs/dt= 0 at every point and every point is a vertex, and thus the curve has an infinite number of vertices. thus the number of vertices &gt; 4</p>
<p>In the case of an ellipse of the form x^2/(a^2)+ y^2/(b^2)=1, there are only 4 vertices, occuring at the points of maximum and minimum curvature, ie at (x,y)= (a,0), (-a,0), (0,b) and (0,-b). thus the number of vertices is =4</p>

<p>The <b>Mercator School of Management (MSM)</b> (<a href="http://www.msm.uni-due.de" class="external free" title="http://www.msm.uni-due.de" rel="nofollow">http://www.msm.uni-due.de</a>) (the faculty of business administration of the University of Duisburg-Essen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) is a classic business school located in Duisburg with a clear focus on business administration. It involves twelve chairs of different business administration disciplines. Each of the three pillars of the <b>MSM</b> combines four of those chairs in a research department. Those central research areas are “Accounting and Finance”, “Technology and Operations Management”, and “Management and Marketing”, each of which is also responsible for a specialized master program of the same name.</p>
<p>In addition, the mainly service-oriented chairs have been combined in the Department of “Managerial Economics”, which presents the educating foundation of the <b>Mercator School of Management</b>. Next to the three chairs of Economics, it includes chairs of East Asia Studies covering the areas of Japan/Korea and China, a chair of Business Education and Didactics and the fields of Management Science and Business Law.</p>
<p>The programs offered by the <b>Mercator School of Management</b> are entirely consecutive and follow international standards. They are conform to ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) guidelines to guarantee that credits earned abroad or at the <b>MSM</b> can easily be taken into account. The accredited Bachelor of Science in Business Administration offers A-level/Abitur graduates a first professional degree with a broad theoretical foundation. It conveys basic qualifications like presentation or discussion techniques and gives students the opportunity to specialize in various fields of business administration. Case studies and computer-based company plan simulations complete the six semester Bachelor program.</p>
<p>After having earned an honor’s degree in the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (or a comparable program), students can choose from four alternative Master programs of four semesters each. The internationalized General Management Track allows students to specialize in one field from each of the three business administration departments mentioned above. Furthermore, it obliges students to spend a semester in the USA, Japan, China or Hong Kong. The Master programs are organized by the three business administration departments and prepare students for a profession in the respective company fields or for an academic career by combining extensive studies with a demanding theoretical foundation. In the future, graduates may apply for a two-year Ph.D. program in the respective departments after their Master degree.</p>

<p>Mangalasserril malika -Kollam-Kerala</p>
<p>Mangalasserril…one of the biggest of nair families in Travancore ,would have been simply another Nair tharavadu until one of Great great grand fathers (karanavars)Pappu pillai,who was the contemporary of Anizham Thirunal Marthanda varma -The founder of modern Travancore ,decided to be strategic. He sided with the Marthanda varma, then a minuscule but ambitious Raja of Venad, against the Raja of Desinganad,(Kollam) where the tharavad are located,when the former attacked the latter to form Travancore.</p>
<p>Was it a strategy –Did he estimate Thundering victory for Marthanda varma?.. glory for Venad…extention of this small state located in and around Thiruvananthapuram, to Kollam, then to Chempakasserry, Kayamkulam, Kottayam, Thekkumkur,Vadakkumkoor and up to the pealry gates of Cochin forcing the Raja there to a friendship treaty?…</p>
<p>What would have happened if things got the other way round?…Would not the Raja of Desinganad( Kollam) have banished the whole Mangalasserril clan Like Marthanda varma did with the Ettu veettil pillai's?… Thankfully, his strategy worked and thus sprang the fame of mangalasseril clan….The thankful Maharaja bestowed acres of land and heaped the Karanavar with love and gold… Bestowed the title of Raajyalaxmy to the women of the family who are said to have graciously donated every bit of gold for the war struck and cash stripped Marthanda varma…with facts and figures as endorsed by historians ( see Thiruvitamkur charitram Chapter 2 By P .Sankunny menon) The battle of Kureepuzha,was decisive and today that is where Mangalasserril stands tall ,as big as a palace with its main Malika which is build in traditional two storied structure with lots and lots of wodden pillars adorning it, with two adjacent nalukettu structures with long verandahs, vadakkini, thekkini ,padinjattini and kizhakkini the north,south ,west and east corridors, sorrounding the two majestic nadumuttams(central courtyard) and pathaya pura(granery), thevarapura (prayer house) ,Kulappura ( bathing rooms with a big Pond) and so on and on…</p>
<p>It was a model house for many who loved Kerala architecture, ...simply stupendous to be as joint family Rao bahadur Mangalasserril Kesavan Nair added a new edifice to the existing Malika and two nalukettu's. It is ,looking back today, simply beyond belief that such magnificience ever could be done. Visitors have simply got awestruck. It is a treasure house of rich architecture and resplendent glory of the past.</p>

<p>84.32.166.124 09:20, 12 June 2006 (UTC) Formed back in late 1995, Sitra started out as a Trio. The only members then were Udi Dunayer, as drummer, and Hagai Pano and Nir Arazi as guitarists. The goal was to play pure, back-to-the-roots heavy metal.</p>
<p>Soon after, we began searching for a basist (naturally), and eventually met Sagy Tal, whom then joined, and became Sitra's bass player. With him came his close friends - Omer Mor, who plays the keyboards, and Einav Drimer, who took place as the singer.</p>
<p>The formation was then complete and the music began to flow at high rates. As the two guitarists and drummer coming from pure Thrash and Heavy Metal background, that latest staff addition brought a strong Black and Doom Metal influence, a milestone in the establishment of our style. After long hard work, we decided to record a song in the studio. Thus evolved "You - I", in May, 1997.</p>
<p>We then performed in several occasions and based our reputation among the underground metal scene, along with setting new standards to our on-stage live abilities.The feelings of those nights gave birth to 2 more studio-recorded songs: "Nevermore" and "The end of M.E" (late July, 1997). We then decided that we want to put more music on disc, but the cost of doing that in the studio was out of our reach. Praise Cakewalk... We realized that we can actually record our stuff on our own, at a reasonable quality, a possibility to distribute the music to all (metal) music lovers. Of course it took us a while to reach a good quality of recording, but we finally found a way (which is implemented nowadays).</p>
<p>So, we recorded "B.S.E" and "Of future for my past". After that wonderful era, our lives became much busier, because of the army service, work and studies of each of the band members, and that affected a lot our band's activities.</p>
<p>Not long after that Einav Drimer, our singer, lost interest in metal (!?) and left us. Seems tragic, doesn't it? ...But nothing could stop us. We went on recording "Is 'us' Dead?", (Sagy as vocalist) and began other recording projects, which were not finished upuntill today...</p>
<p>Lately, We've added a new band member - Spike Caballero. He's our new singer, and he brings high new ablities, which add something new to our style. This is a turning point in the bands life, and we really believe that we will conquer new grounds now. We are now performing whenever there is a good opportunity to to so, and plan to record some new songs soon. So, if we look at the future, it is bright, but one thing is even clearer - our love for music and music-making will last forevermore!</p>

<p>Dale Dumont hs been credited as starting the national socialist revolution. Even though his actions may not within the public sphere of knowledge. Dale's gang of youths believed that due to his birthday, he was infact the son of the devil. Some argue that Dale beleived these claims to be true. Dale started these gangs because his extreme hate for people of the Jewish faith. Dale believed that Judiaism was infact the spawn of pure evil. Dale can be quoted as saying "I really hate those Jewish bastards, with their large noses and so forth. What I really hate is that you cannot spot the difference between a pure white man and the evil ridden body of a Jewish whore of Babylon". Dale also was a massive fan of salami, he believed it to be the food of the gods. Because of Dale’s intense love for salami, he started a salami appreciation club. It is rumoured that many famous celebrities from the day were members but there has never been an official record of it’s members. The clubs was open to anyone who loved salami, unless you were Jewish, black or an unattractive Asian.</p>

<p>It is believed that a Jewish man raped his mother when Dale Dumont was just a boy. According to legend, Dale at age four he was forced to watch a Jewish man sodomise his mother on the dinner table. This caused an extreme hate of the Jewish community and Dale was unable to ever eat a meal at a table again. Mythology dictates that from this day on, Dale always ate his meals from a chair with his meal resting on his lap.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that Dale Dumont once saw a Jewish man eat a snail, he was horrified. He couldn’t believe that someone was low enough to eat a snail. This increased his hate for the Jewish people.</p>
<p>However, other sources claim that this snail eating man was in fact a French man and Dale Dumont was an idiot.</p>

<p>Dale died on a tropical island when a coconut fell on his head. Later followers claim that there was a negro in the tree and he threw a coconut at poor Dale. Dale's death was celebrated by the Jewish community. Strangely, a black political spokesman described Dale’s death as “A bad, bad thing cause I love coconuts and I can’t believe they would hurt anyone, even if he was a son of a bitch Jewish hating bastard”.</p>

<p>The 49th Tour de France was won by a first time competiter Felice Gimondi by 2 min 40 sec. This was the first tour since 1959 that Jacques Anquetil didn't win (but he didn't compete in the race either).As a result, Raymond Pouildor was predicted to win the race easily with some people (including Anquetil) believing that the course was designed for him to win. The race started in Cologne on the 22nd June with spriner Rik van Looy winning the first stage but Gimondi took control of the race early winning the third stage and keeping the race under control after the win</p>

<p>218.215.133.123 13:20, 12 June 2006 (UTC) This form of attack was perfected by the battle worn Australian Divisions in the Great War. The attacks taken by the British commanders were seen as cold-blooded murder to say the least so the larakin nature of the 'Aussie' forces took hold and prospered. This informal command was never mentioned officially and frowned upon by British counterparts. A party would move forward with complete surprise and would 'convince' the enemy to surrender. Many prisoners were taken and much ground gained in this fashion. Although successful, as the eventual victory was gained with the use of the British 'old fashioned' tactics, the tactics perfected during the war were avoided and original tactics fine-tuned.</p>

<p>These four guys from Durban, South Africa have been pumping out a spine chilling breed of positive and progressive energetic hardcore since 1998. They are South Africa's first, longest running, and most influential hardcore band. Many local bands cite Crossingpoint as an influence and inspiartion. Today the band are best described as playing a passionate and often brutal synthesis of metal and punk with a positive, relevant message.</p>
<p>In a world where heavy music is slowly being embraced by a wider audience, many bands have watered down their message to suit the listener. Where it used to be about an uncompromising message in response to societal problems, these days it seems to mostly be about the sound, with any sort of message being secondary. Crossingpoint have stayed true to their roots by playing creative, energy-driven music with a message that demands application. It's hard to go to a crossingpoint show and leave unchanged. Whether you're screaming your lungs out with the band or following their lyrics on their lyric sheets handed out before each show, theirs is a power and a passion that few bands consistently achieve.</p>
<p>Crossingpoint recorded &amp; released their self-titled album independently in october 2004. All stops have been pulled out in terms of its recording, production and presentation. In what is a first for a South African band, it comes as an eye catching 6 panel 'digipak' package!</p>
<p>Real change happens in the minds and hearts of individuals who can go on to affect others. Crossingpoint's urgent and honest message deals with issues such as sexism, loyalty and personal responsibility, and is aimed at reaching the individual in a thoughtful and inspiring way.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-13_01a6.html" title="Edit section: Bellevue House">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bellevue House</span></h2>
<p>Bellevue House is a National Historic Site of Canada, located in Kingston, Ontario, which was occupied for a brief period by Canada's first Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Sir John A. MacDonald. The site is maintained and funded by Parks Canada.</p>
<p>Bellevue House was built in the early 1840s for Charles Hales, a successful Kingston grocer. Asymmetrical in shape, it is an outstanding example of Italianate Villa architecture, constrasting greatly with the more prominent Georgian limestone buildings of Kingston.</p>
<p>In letters, MacDonald nicknamed the house "Tea Caddy Castle" and "Pekoe Pagoda." Macdonald rented the house, motivated by the chronic ill-health of his wife, Isabella, which is now thought to have been Tuberculosis. He wrote of the "...complete quiet and seclusion of the house, which is completely surrounded by trees and has a fresh breeze ever blowing on it from Lake Ontario..." that, he hoped, would bring about an improvement in her condition. However, their stay, beginning in 1848, was brief, and Isabella's health showed no great signs of improvement. Macdonald himself was increasingly troubled by financial concerns and in September 1849, the couple moved again to more modest accomodation in downtown Kingston.</p>
<p>The property itself is quite large and picturesque, boasting a magnificent garden as well as an apple orchard. Although the property is still the same width, it is considerably smaller in length than in the 1840s; originally the property extended from what is now Union Street down to the shore of Lake Ontario. In addition, it used to provide a much more genuine <i>belle vue</i> (French for beautiful view) of the lake.</p>
<p>Today, as a National Historic Site of Canada since 1967 (it was occupied privately until this time), Bellevue House is a popular tourist destination. A modern reconstruction of the carriage house (which was destroyed in the 1950s) serves as a visitor's centre, as well as the location for all administration of the site. The house itself is furnished with 1840s period items, although only a few items in the house actually belonged to Sir John A. MacDonald; these items include a baby cradle and a set of books. During the summer, the house itself is staffed by several employees dressed in 1840s period costume, and the grounds are maintained by gardeners in period costume, using solely tools of the era (such as using only a scythe to cut the grass, etc.). Tours and information are offered in both French and English.</p>

<p>James Thorne is one of the UK's top Snowboarders and the Holder of the European Acid Drop Record.</p>
<p>James was born the 18th of November 1982, in Norfolk.</p>
<p>James started riding in 1995 aged 12, while on holiday, when he swapped his skis for a snowboard. Lessons in Norwich with Chris and Andy followed and from then on every spare moment was spent practicing. When James was 14, Andy, the then owner of "Revolutions" Snowboard shop in Norwich, recommend him to Westbeach who were looking to sponsor a new rider.</p>
<p>In 1998 he attended his first Brits in Saas Fee, where as a Junior Man he showed promise achieving 5/14 in the Slalom, 7/9 in the Big Air and 8/12 in the Half Pipe.</p>
<p>Then it was back to Trowse every Monday, Thursday and Saturday, to hone his skills on Dendex. Age 15 James was placed second in the Junior Men’s BSA National Points Series.</p>
<p>Studies overtook the following year, but at 17 he was back at the Brits and ripping it up in Norwich, where he helped formulate the first "Farmer's Jam" in 2000, and establish a Skate Park in nearby Wymondham.</p>
<p>2001 saw James at the Junior World Snowboarding Championships and conquering the Trowse Rainbow Rail. James had always looked on competitions as a way of honing his snowboarding skills and they soon became a pathway to a great social life, forming friendships with the likes of Stu Edwards and Dom Harrington.</p>
<p>From 1999 to 2003 James competed in over 20 Dryslope Competitions accruing a total of 10 wins, 12 seconds and 3 thirds.</p>
<p>After working hard, and getting a bunch of GCSE's and an Art Foundation from Norwich Art School, summer '01 saw James working at "Revolutions" and "Snowfit" in Norwich to get some cash together for a snow season in Serre Che. His time on the snow paid off and results at the Brit Games in Mayerhofen reflected his new skills. First time in Men’s secured 6/13 in Big Air, 9/12 in Half Pipe and the coveted 'Lord of the Rails' title.</p>
<p>Sponsorship from Burton followed, then back to Dry Slope and summer work at an Insurance Brokers to pay for a winter season in Mammoth, CA in 2003. He returned to storm the Brits in Deux Alpes in '03, his dedication rewarded.</p>
<p>In 2003 James began working for the TSA in Castleford. He was a demonstrator at the Daily Mail Ski and Snowboard Show and also took the Aim Series British Indoor Championship Titles in Big Air and Slopestyle. At the Union Awards '03, James came second in the Best Male and Best Rookie categories and Burton took Best UK Team.</p>
<p>James returned to Mammoth for the beginning of the '03/'04 season, intending to train hard for the Euro competitions. He took part in the Burton European Open and registered for the Fabulous Tournament. Unfortunately, whilst riding in Livigno in Feb ‘04, James dropped off a path onto a road and broke his ankle.</p>
<p>James returned to Snowboarding quickly and was soon to be seen ripping up the board tests, coaching at the McNab Snowboard Camps and shooting with Dan Milner. His return to the scene was marked by his successfully defending the Aim Series British Indoor Slopestyle Title and joining the Burton World Tour as part of the National Team, just 7 months after his accident. In October James was invited to the Red Bull Rail Storm in Glasgow, where he won several prizes in the Am Jam.</p>
<p>In December 04, after returning to Mammoth, James came second in an Open Heat of the Volcom Peanut Butter and Rail Jam. When he returned to take part in the finals in 2005, he blew the competition away, and rode of with the title and $2000!</p>
<p>James spent June and July of 2005 at the Board tests and teaching at the Just4Girls and McNab camps. At The Daily Mail Show a nasty fall left James with two fractured ribs. His experience with injury the year before meant that he soon recovered and was an integral part of the UK team at the 2005 Red Bull Rail Storm in Trafalgar Square, London. James also MC'd the Burton Black Metal tour of the UK indoor slopes.</p>
<p>James was also involved with an extras agency, which led to appearances in 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' and in two music videos - 'Teardrops' by the Sugababes and the re-release of 'Pump Up The Jam'.</p>
<p>James worked hard at filming in 2005, completing a banging section for the first Hungerpain film, and shooting two tricks for the 2005 Methodology DVD.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2005 James decided to become a full time professional. The Norfolk Ski Club recognised James's achievements and services to the club by awarding him an Honorary Life Membership.</p>
<p>James traveled to Laax once again in March 2006 to take part in the Orange Brits. His streamline/thermal outfit helped him to a respactable fourth place in the Boardercross!</p>
<p>But most impressively, James won the newly introduced Acid Drop Event that was the climax of the Brits, making him 'King of the Orange Airtime'. He jumped an amazing 10 meters from a crane into a 9 meter quater pipe. It has to be seen to be believed, so check out the video on www.orangebrits.com. It earnt him a new European record!</p>
<p>In March James also came second at the Wild Girls On Snow demo night, a charity event in aid of Breast Cancer in Klosters.</p>
<p>He was a member of the Hungerpain Team who came third in the Protest Jib-Vid competition in Tignes. Check out the fantastic video at www.jib-vid.com.</p>
<p>James is currently touring Europe in his VW camper. His magazine coverage and appearances on film have showcased his unique style both in boarding and in fashion!</p>

<p>84.13.225.7 16:10, 12 June 2006 (UTC) Singer songwriter Charlie Landsborough has eventually achieved recognition after struggling for nearly three decades. He worked as a teacher, amongst other things as he continued to write and perform on a semi-pro basis but by 1984 began to feel that his ambitions might not materialise.</p>
<p>However, one song in particular was to transform his life. Charlie wrote What Colour is the Wind which tells the story of a young blind child's attempts to envision the world. As a result of Gerry Anderson playing the track on radio in Northern Ireland, the song came to the notice of chat show host Pat Kenny in Dublin, who invited Charlie to perform on his immensely popular Kenny Show Live (RTE January 1995). The programme received its biggest ever response following Charlie's appearance, and a week later Charlie's album, also called What Colour is the Wind was suddenly at number one in the Irish album charts, removing Garth Brooks from the top spot and fighting off fierce competition from both Celine Dion and The Chieftans. This was a dream come true for Charlie and since then he has gone from strength to strength and is now one of the all-time biggest selling artists in Irish music history.</p>
<p>Following the album's success in Ireland, Charlie appeared on several TV shows in the UK. In particular, his performance on GMTV and the now, much missed, BBC Pebble Mill Live prompted record numbers of enquiries to the shows.</p>
<p>Since then, Charlie has released a further ten albums and has now sold in excess of 700,000 units. This has given him a further two number ones in the Irish Pop Charts and most of his albums have topped the British country charts.</p>
<p>One of Charlie's most successful albums Still Can't Say Goodbye was recorded in Nashville in 1999 with Producer Jim Rooney who has also worked on albums for Nanci Griffith and Iris de Ment. The record went to number 38 in the British pop charts and resulted in Charlie winning the BMCA Best Male Vocalist (2000) for the third year in succession, and the Southern Country Award for best album. The recording of this album was followed by Granada TV for their documentary The Road to Nashville (October 1999). Other highlights of Charlie's Nashville trip were three appearances on the Grand Ole Opry.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since 1985 Charlie has toured the UK and Eire twice a year building up a large following for his live work. He has performed at most major concert halls and theatres including London Palladium, Labatts Apollo, Birmingham Symphony Hall, Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Belfast Opera House, Belfast Waterfront and Dublin's National Concert Hall.</p>
<p>The arrival of the new millennium heralded a busy year for Charlie. He made his first trip to Australia on a promotional tour. In addition to his UK and Irish tours, Charlie was invited to perform at the prestigious Albert Dock Festival in Liverpool where the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra accompanied him and his band. He played to a sell-out crowd of over 4,000 and this must rank as on of the highlights of Charlie's career.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>2001 saw a big move for Charlie as he changed both management and record label. The first release from Telstar Records was Once in a While, an album of covers from some of Charlie's favourite writers.</p>
<p>In September 2001 Charlie and his band played their first concert tour of Australia and New Zealand. The tour exceeded everyone's expectations and was very well received and as a result plans are being made for a more extensive tour in the future.</p>
<p>2002 saw the release of Charlie's album Movin' On, a collection of sixteen self-penned compositions. This was Charlie's first album of his original songs since Further Down the Road. Movin' On flew to the top of the mid-price album charts within two weeks of release, amid glowing reviews from the musical press.</p>
<p>Following the release of the album in July, Charlie appeared extensively on TV and radio throughout the British Isles, including the notable appearance at the closing of the Special Olympics in Dublin, where he sang his song Special to thousands of athletes from all over Europe.</p>
<p>The year ended with a highly successful 40 night tour of the British Isles. The response to this has been so strong that the majority of the dates have already been re-booked for 2003.</p>
<p>In view of the success of 2002, coupled with the interest generated, many new doors are being opened, promising an exciting year ahead for Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie's songwriting blends easy on the ear, folk, country, ballads and blues with a strong and often personal lyric content, mixed with his wit and repartee, this has led to a winning formula which has made an impact on so many professionals and fans alike. His successful songs have led to his work being covered by several artists inluding Jack Jones, Pat Boone, Foster and Allen, George Hamilton IV and Daniel O'Donnell.</p>

<p><br />
Autobiography I was born on the 26th October 1941 the youngest of eleven children. To escape the bombing my mother was taken to Wrexham, returning to merseyside after I was born. My mam's name was Aggie and I was christened Charles Alexander after my dad. My beloved brothers and sisters are Harry, Derek, Arthur, Jack, Dot, Sylvia, Doreen and Joyce.</p>
<p>I was reared in the dockland area of Birkenhead and the view from our front window was a mixture of docks, dumps, railway lines, oil factories and the coal wharf. It sounds grim but my childhood was far from that. Surrounded by a loving family, animals and of course music my early years were extremely happy. My brothers were all sailors and apart from the guitars and all the music, they brought home gifts from all around the world. I remember sitting enchanted by the scent of the wood in a guitar brought from Spain, my imagination afire at the sight of a small canoe carved by natives of West Africa, pistols with real revolving chambers from the US and getting my first pair of dungarees from Canada. Small wonder I so eagerly awaited the return of each brother from another trip.</p>
<p>Pictured above from left to right - Arthur, Derek and Harry (Charlie's brothers). Pictured above is Jack, another of Charlie's brothers.</p>
<p>Our house was always full of animals and apart from dogs and cats we also kept chickens in the back and at one time a duck. There was also birds - budgies, canaries and finches and a very special gift of a monkey smuggled in by my brother Harry. This little delight with the unimaginative name of Jacko made me very popular with schoolfriends. These things apart, my brother Jack, a sort of scouse St. Francis, was always bringing home assorted four-legged waifs and strays. That house is now earmarked for demolition and I climbed in recently to have a last look round for old time sake. In my mind it had seemed so much bigger. In reality it was very small and I was amazed to think how it could have been a home to so many people and animals.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I was always surrounded by music and my dad told me I used to sing myself to sleep when I was about three. He was a ballad singer billed locally as the Silver Voiced Tenor and one of my earliest recollections is of sitting on his knee at a 'do' and duetting with him on You Take The Tables And I'll Take The Chairs. My mother's favourites were Gracie Fields and Hank Williams - now there's a combination. My brothers of course were returning from their voyages with the first guitars I'd ever seen and wonderful country music from such artists as Hank Williams, Jimmy Rodgers, Ferlin Husky and Montana Slim. They'd often arrive home with a group of friends and a crate of beer and I'd sit enthralled as they laughed and sang the hours away.</p>
<p>At Primary School I had blonde shoulder length hair (yes long hair even then) for a while my dreams fluctuated between being a great footballer or a great artist (see picture!). The long hair had been cropped at the time of this picture - I think the result of a basin-cut (so called because you put a basin on the head and cut round it, in the days when you couldn't afford a barber) from my brother Arthur.</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
At the age of about fourteen when I was in Grammer School my brother surprised me one day trying to play the guitar - I think I'd managed the first few notes of the Harry Lime theme. He ignored my self-consciousness and showed me a couple of chords. I was hooked! I'd sit up 'til late playing Hank, Elvis, Jimmy Rodgers, etc. Of course my education began to suffer and my headmaster, the kindly Mr. King, later commented that I'd had a good academic future ahead of me until I'd discovered that 'damn banjo'. Thank God for that 'damn banjo'.</p>
<p>Disenchanted somewhat with the world in the wake of my mam's death when I was only twelve I left school early and made minor excursions into the work place. I worked as an apprentice telephone engineer, on the railways, in the flour mills and wound up trying to be one of the lads. To be accepted with any sort of prestige among my peers meant either being a hard case or a theif. I'm ashamed to say I tried both, with pretty disastrous consequences - I wound up in Walton Gaol for a couple of months. My honest, upright and caring family were stunned. I suppose I was looking for attention.</p>
<p>I remember the day I was driven to court on a coach along with a few others. I sat in handcuffs and over the radio they played Don't by Elvis and Every Time We Say Goodbye by the lovely Ella. I was hoping there was not some deep significance in the titles.</p>
<p>Fortunately I was given probation and suitably chastened by the whole ordeal I returned home to my thankful and forgiving family.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I was soon bored with my situation however and decided that for excitement I, like my brothers before me, must travel. Finding the Navy Office closed I joined the Army without informing any of my family. My sisters were in tears but armed with my guitar and a D.A. hairstyle I set off to Wales to do my training. I then applied for a posting in Hong Kong and with typical army logic found myself in West Germany. I made many great friends (some of whom I now meet up with on my travels) and started to play in bands with such exotic names as the Rockavons and the Onions.</p>
<p>One abiding memory of my army days was of the Cuban missile crisis. Being only thirty miles from the border I was convinced that within a short space of time I would be dead. After going into N.A.T.O. camps the scene of frenzied activity. When I got back to our camp what did I find? Our lads were padding around polishing floors and locker knobs for an inspection the next day. Was I relieved when the Russian vessels turned!</p>
<p>After four enjoyable years I grew a little bored and bought myself out. My army record states that I am intelligent, reliable and a good runner! Not a very distinguished career eh! Still I had learned German and how to drink with the Scottish, the Irish and the Geordies etc. without falling over.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After leaving the army I was back in Birkenhead and jobless. I left for Coventry and after a short stint as a postman I decided to return to Germany. I arrived in Dortmund with the equivenent of about half a crown to my name, to audition for a band called Chicago Sect. I'd been singing country songs and ballads around the pubs back home and of course knew very little about Tamla Motown, Rock etc. The band were not impressed at my ignorance as I shook my head at each song they suggested. Just as it looked like I'd have to hitch back home someone asked if I knew any Ray Charles. I knew Georgia! I sang it and was in. Thanks Hoagy Carmichael!</p>
<p>I was in Dortmund for about nine months during which time I married Thelma who had been a dream of mine since I'd first seen her as a teenager in Birkenhead. I'd been in Dortmund supposedly saving for our future but sad to say I'd had a marvellous time but returned home skint. Thelma bought my suit for the wedding on a cheque from her mother and she and our two witnesses (all that were present apart from the priest) paid for our drink, etc. We celebrated unknown to anyone in the local pub Murphys.</p>
<p>Once I was married I became a little more responsible and although I played with the local bands I worked a variety of jobs during the day. At various times I was a grocery store manager, driver, navvy, quality control engineer (bluffed my way in) and finally a teacher. All the time my dreams were of music.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>During my teaching years I began to write to try and fulfil my ambition of being a proffesional singer and to bring about the musical recognition I sought. Ironically I began to make a name as a writer and my singing was overlooked. However through my songs I began to meet people who have since become great friends to me. People like George Hamilton IV, Daniel O'Donnell and of course Foster and Allen. Tony Allen it was who first invited me to Ireland and I've been going there ever since. I love the heady mix of joy and melancholy, anarchy and reverence, the humour, the music, the people and of course the odd pint of Guiness!</p>
<p>So I'd arrived in 1994 thinking that all my efforts had been largely in vain and questioning God about giving me musical talents and yet seemingly thwarting my every move. When I surrendered my will to Him, He stepped in swiftly and powerfully and with the help of Gerry Anderson, Pat Kenny, numerous Irish DJs and the Irish people and of course Ritz Records my dreams began to be realised.</p>
<p>With the continued support of all the marvellous people we have met all around England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, namely you, I am sure it will be. God bless you and thank you for everything you have done for me and my family, Thelma, Charlie Jnr, Allan and Jamie. Yours, Charlie.</p>

<p>The legendary (?) Special Affect album, made possible by the creative talents of Marty Sorenson (Bass), Al Jourgensen (Guitar), Franke [sic] Nardiello (vocals), and Harry Rushakoff (Drums) (of Concrete Blonde!) with guest/backup vocals by somebody named Minerva. Formerly known as The Untouchables, Special Affect were formed in Chicago, 1979 by musicians Frankie Nardiello, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jourgensen_2e0b.html" title="Al Jourgensen">Al Jourgensen</a>, Marty Sorenson, and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Rushakoff_14d5.html" title="Harry Rushakoff">Harry Rushakoff</a>. Their sound could be categorized as glam-punk, with elements of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New-wave.html" title="New-wave">new-wave</a> music thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jourgensen_2e0b.html" title="Al Jourgensen">Al Jourgensen</a> met Frankie Nardiello while attending the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_Of_Chicago_39c0.html" title="University Of Chicago">University Of Chicago</a> in 1979. He eventually replaced their old guitar player, even though Frankie originally did not want to hire Al because he looked like a hippie (he also auditioned for the band by running through some <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> licks). They self-released Too Much Soft Living in 1980, supposedly billed as a movie soundtrack (though this is most likely not the case). The group obtained a cult following in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> around 1980-1981, which prompted a move there to possibly gain a larger fanbase. It failed, and the group parted ways in 1981.</p>
<p>Frankie went on to form The Drowning Craze in 1981 (which folded in 1982, though they did obtain a following in the UK) and later went on to gain fame as Groovie Mann in 1987 with his band <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Life_With_The_Thrill_Kill_Kult_2d64.html" title="My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult">My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult</a>, whom is still active and performing today. <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jourgensen_2e0b.html" title="Al Jourgensen">Al Jourgensen</a> went on to form the platinum award-selling hard rock act <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_%28band%29.html" title="Ministry (band)">Ministry</a> (as well as multiple side-projects), whom also is still actively performing today. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Rushakoff_14d5.html" title="Harry Rushakoff">Harry Rushakoff</a> went on to become the drummer for alternative-rock act Concrete Blonde.</p>

<p>It is a two state protocol for maintaining cache coherency in a multiprocessor environment, In a snooping system, all caches on the bus monitor (or snoop) the bus to determine if they have a copy of the block of data that is requested on the bus. Every cache has a copy of the sharing status of every block of physical memory it has. Multiple copies of a document in a multiprocessing environment typically can be read without any coherence problems; however, a processor must have exclusive access to the bus in order to write.</p>
<p>There are two types of snooping protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li>write-invalidate: the processor that is writing data causes copies in the caches of all other processors in the system to be rendered invalid before it changes its local copy. The local machine does this by sending an invalidation signal over the bus, which causes all of the other caches to check for a copy of the invalidated file. Once the cache copies have been invalidated, the data on the local machine can be updated until another processor requests it.</li>
<li>write-update: the processor that is writing the data broadcasts the new data over the bus (without issuing the invalidation signal). All caches that contain copies of the data are then updated. This scheme differs from write-invalidate in that it does not create only one local copy for writes.</li>
</ul>

<p>By Michael Herbert,</p>
<p>The Working Class Movement Library is a national collection of the history of labour movement in Britain, founded in the mid-1950s by Ruth and Edmund Frow, whose personal and political partnership lasted for over 40 years and led to the creation of this unique and wonderful archive.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-13_01a6.html" title="Edit section: How The Library Began">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How The Library Began</span></h3>
<p>Eddie Frow was born in Lincolnshire in 1906, the son of tenant farmer. After leaving school he became a toolmaker in the engineering industry. In 1924 he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and in subsequent years lost many jobs because of his political and trade union activity. During the Depression he was active in the unemployed workers movement in Salford and served four months in Strangeways prison after being badly beaten up by police after leading a march to Salford Town Hall in October 1931, an event that Walter Greenwood included in his novel Love On The Dole and which also featured in the film (somewhat differently from the reality) He found work again on his release, became a leading member of the engineering union and was eventually elected as the full-time Secretary for the Manchester District, a position he held for just under ten years, retiring in 1971.</p>
<p>Ruth Frow was born in 1922 and served in the RAF during the war, going into teaching afterwards. She joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1945 whilst canvassing amongst Kent miners during the general election. In the 1950s and 1960s she was active in the peace movement as well as the National Union of Teachers. Ruth finished her teaching career in 1980 as deputy head of a large comprehensive school in Manchester.</p>
<p>Ruth and Eddie first met at a Communist Party school in 1953 and soon merged their lives - and their respective book collections. They began collecting material on the history of the trade union, radical and labour movement, travelling the country in their holidays in a 1937 Morris van and later a caravan, which on each trip they filled with books and pamphlets barely leaving room for themselves to get in.</p>
<p>The result of these journeys was that their house in Old Trafford became treasure trove , with bookshelves in every room as well as banners, emblems, prints and much else all meticulously catalogued by Ruth and Eddie, although they could often locate a volume with bothering to look it up so well acquainted were they . They also began writing books, pamphlets, and articles and were in great demand as lecturers, as well as being active in the Society for the Study of Labour History. News of their library spread and many researchers made their way to Old Trafford, their studies fuelled by regular cups of coffee and Ruth’s home-made buns.</p>

<p>By 1987 the house was full to overflowing. Fortunately at this point Salford City Council offered to provide a new home for the library, together with full-time library staff, and later that year the entire collection moved to Jubilee House, (a former nurses home opened in 1901) which is situated on the Crescent opposite Salford University. In the seventeen years since the collection has continued to grow and rarely a week goes by without some new material being donated. Often a donor will arrive unannounced with a bag full of wonderful archive material that may have been in a family for several generations. The ceramics trade union CATU has recently agreed to house some of its important archive at the library.</p>
<p>Eddie died in May 1997, just short of his 91st birthday, and he is still much loved and greatly missed. His obituary appeared in the Morning Star, The Guardian, The Times, The Independent and even (this would have amused him) the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>The library collection begins in the 1790s, a fascinating period when, in the wake of the American and French revolutions, ideas of democracy and liberty reverberated across Europe. The library has a whole room devoted to Tom Paine, whose book The Rights of Man is one of the founding documents of the British radical tradition.</p>
<p>The rest of the collection covers the two hundred years since and includes collections on trade unions, Chartism, the suffrage movement of the early 1900s and the “second wave” of feminism in the 1970s, Socialist organisations of every hue, the Co-operative movement, Ireland and the Irish in Britain, anti-fascism, peace movements such as the No Conscription Fellowship and CND as well international issues such as the Spanish Civil War and Vietnam War.</p>
<p>As well as tens of thousands of books and pamphlets – some of them unique to the library - the collection also includes banners, posters, pottery, leaflets, newspapers, journals, prints, photographs, videos, LPs and CDs, furniture, union emblems and many other items which document and illuminate the story of the struggle of working people over many decades for social, economic and political justice.</p>
<p>Whilst there are other labour movement historical collection in Britain the library is unique both for the broad range of the collection and the scarce nature of some of the holdings, some of which cannot even be found in the British Library. The library is particular strong in ephemeral material such as tens of thousands of radical pamphlets from the 1790s onwards. Jonathan Miller was filmed in the library for instance for his recent BBC TV series A Brief History of Disbelief, examining rare secularist pamphlets by Thomas Paine, Richard Carlile, George Jacob Holyoake, and Charles Bradlaugh.</p>

<p>The library has an expanding Friends organisation comprising individuals and trade unions who give financial help to support the library’s activities. We have been very fortunate in attracting a growing band of Volunteers who give up some of their own time to carry out work in the library. There are many tasks still to be done in the collection, which far exceed the time available to the two full-time members of staff. The Volunteers are carrying out vital work as sorting, listing and cataloguing material and writing material for the website, which is a key source of reference information on the collection. and includes an online book catalogue.</p>
<p>The library has been a Trust since the early 1970s. The Trustees comprise both academics and those from a trade union or educational background. The Management Committee meets regularly to plan and implement the strategic development of the library as a resource. We have started producing a quarterly newsletter Shelf Life which is sent to Friends and others and secured funding to produce a CDRom aimed at schools entitled Children of the Industrial Revolution (a free copy was sent to every school in Salford) We also hold regular events such a drama production by Mikron Theatre on the history of Clarion Cycling Club and Open Days for the public.</p>

<p>Friends of the library have filmed and edited a 25 minute DVD about the library, made by volunteers who work in the TV industry , which tells the story of how the library was founded by Ruth and Eddie. As well as including archive footage of interviews with Ruth and Eddie from 1987 and 1991 it also features interviews with staff, volunteers and readers. The DVD has been professionally filmed and edited while the commentary has been done by Christopher Eccleston, the Salford-born actor who has worked extensively in film and TV in the past decade, including taking the role of Dr Who in the BBC TV series. It wa smade by John Crumpton and Faisal Quereshi. The DVD is used publicise the library and help raise money.</p>
<p>The library welcomes researchers and visitors. Please phone first to book an appointment as staff time is limited. We also welcome donations of printed material and archive collections.</p>

<p>[[ This is the part of the area which the Waodoni live. These tribal people became famous for killing the 5 missionaries there in 1956. The 5 were, Nate saint, Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, Ed McCully and Roger Youderian. There has been 2 movies made which represent this story they are, Beyond the Gates of Splendor, and End of the Spear. After killing the 5 men Nate Saint's sister (Rachel) and son (Steve Saint) went to live with them to show them that God loves them so they could go to Heaven. After many years of living among them most of the tribe has become Christians, or God Followers as they would say. Steve Saint and Mincaye (one of the Waodonis who murdered his Father) currently have been traveling the United States sharing their testimony. Steve and his Aunt Rachel forgave them and loved them, and now the tribe is a peace loving tribe, however there are still many tribes within the Waodoni who still kill foreigners on the spot.

<p>It was a cold Halloween night in 1963 when six year old Michael Audrey Myers brutally murdered his 17-year-old sister, Judith Margaret Myers. He was sentenced to the Smith's Grove-Warren County Sanitarium for his brutal crime. There, he remained locked away and dormant for 15 years.</p>
<p>But on October 30, 1978, things are about to change. While being transferred for a court date, a 21-year-old Michael Myers steals a car and escapes Smith's Grove. He returns to his quiet hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, where he follows three young women.</p>
<p>Seventeen-year-old Laurie Strode is a quiet bookworm, preferring babysitting over parties. As she goes about her school day, she finds her mind playing tricks on her. Her friends, Annie and Lynda, are busy thinking about the fun of Halloween night.</p>
<p>That evening, Laurie and Annie are babysitting across the street from each other. Laurie has to keep an eye on comic-loving Tommy Doyle, while Annie watches "little Lindsey Wallace," obsessed with the television. Little do they know, Michael Myers has come home to kill. Carefully, he murders Annie first, followed by Lynda and her boyfriend Bob.</p>
<p>Their only hope is Dr. Loomis, Michael's childhood psychiatrist who has followed Michael's trail back to Haddonfield. Loomis enlists the help of town sheriff Leigh Brackett, who happens to be Annie's father. The duo search the streets, but the bogeyman is close to his prize for the night: Laurie!</p>
<p>A pulsing finale will have horror fans screaming as Michael stalks innocent Laurie, praying that Dr. Loomis will rescue her. He is the only one who knows just what Michael is - pure evil.</p>
<p>The movie ends w/ Micheal being shot six times and falling out of a window. When Dr.Loomis looks out the window, he does not see Micheal. Micheal has escaped and is on the loose again.</p>

<p>Note: This movie picks up almost exactly where the first movie ended. Picking up right where the first HALLOWEEN left off, HALLOWEEN II continues the story of the night HE came home. The notorious Michael Myers is still alive. Dr. Loomis, shouting "I shot him six times...I shot him in the heart..." tries to convince town sheriff Brackett that the monster is still on the loose. Meanwhile, seventeen year old Laurie Strode has been taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>After Loomis and Brackett find a trail that leads to the local elementary school, Marion Chambers (the nurse who accompanied Dr. Loomis in the first film) informs Dr. Loomis that by order of the governor, he is to return to Smith's Grove, and leave Myers for the police.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Myers has been on a rampage at the hospital. Killing each victim slowly, Myers makes his way through Mr. Garrett, the night watchman, Bud the ambulance driver, nurses Jill, Karen, Janet, and Mrs. Alves, and even the drunken Dr. Mixter. Laurie is left alone in the hospital with Jimmy, an orderly who has taken interest in the young woman.</p>
<p>An exciting finale fills the end of this sequel with suspense much like the first film. A dramatic secret is revealed about Laurie Strode's family history leading to an explosive final scene in the hospital operating room.</p>

<p>HALLOWEEN III Season of the Witch takes a break from the Michael Myers storyline and concentrates on a small California town called Santa Mira. There, a large mask-making company called Silver Shamrock has opened up, selling popular Halloween masks to the entire country's children. Their advertising covers the media with rhymes, set to the tune of "London Bridge is Falling Down," which chant "Two more days 'til Halloween, Halloween, Halloween..."</p>
<p>Dr. Dan Challis, a local doctor, stumbles on a plot to bring about the end of human kind. He, along with Ellie, a young woman who's father was recently killed, travel inside the factory, where they meet Cochran, an old irish goon who has stolen a rock from Stonehenge, which causes mutations in the person who wears a Silver Shamrock mask! So tonight, on the most deadly Halloween ever, children across the nation will be watching Silver Shamrock commercials, which cause the mutations - their only hope is Dr. Challis and Ellie!</p>
<p>However, Cochran captures both Ellie and Challis. The doctor is well aware of the devestation of Cochran's plot...so he escapes and with the help of Ellie, he leaves the control center exploding in bursts of flames. He races to get help and to stop the commercials from airing. But, Cochran will have the final Halloween trick of the night.</p>

<p>It's been a decade since Michael Myers had his last killing spree in Haddonfield. But tonight, October 31st, 1988, that's going to change - it's Halloween again!</p>
<p>While being transferred from the Ridgemont Maximum Security Hospital, Michael Myers, who's been sleeping dormant in a coma for the last ten years, awakens when he hears that he has a neice. Meanwhile, back in Haddonfield, Myers' niece Jamie Lloyd (daughter of [supposedly] deceased Laurie Strode) is having nightmares about her evil uncle. Her step-sister, Rachel Corruthers, takes her out trick-or-treating, but instead of finding a night of fun, they find Michael Myers!</p>
<p>But Dr. Loomis also survived the explosion of the second film. He tracks Michael back home, enlisting the help of Sheriff Ben Meeker. Together, they shelter Jamie in Meeker's not-too-safe house. Myers makes his way in, taking his revenge on victims Kelly, Deputy Logan, and Brady. Jamie escapes to the local schoolhouse, but her fiendish uncle is hot on her track. A high-paced finale leaves Myers buried in hell. As everyone begins to calm down from the night, a scream is heard from the upstairs of the Corruthers' house - the evil has only started!</p>

<p>If you thought a mineshaft could stop The Shape at the end of the previous film, think again! Michael managed to crawl out of the mine, and takes refuge with a hermit. A year later, October 31st arrives, and Jamie Lloyd, his niece, is having nightmares about him. She seems to now have a telepathic bond with her evil uncle. She is able to tell Dr. Loomis when and where he will strike next. However, it's always too late...Michael is back, and chops his way through a valued family member, as well as Jamie's friends Tina and Sam, along with their boyfriends, some irritating cops, and a few others who get in the way.</p>
<p>The finale takes Dr. Loomis and Jamie to the old Myers' house, where the pair set a trap for Jamie's evil uncle. Finally, Loomis physically beats Myers to the ground. The police take Myers into custody, but a mysterious stranger, dressed in black, leads to the most mysterious HALLOWEEN ending ever!</p>

<p>For seventeen years, the town of Haddonfield, Illinois has been haunted by a night when evil roamed the street. Everyone knows his name. Now, everyone will know the truth!</p>
<p>It's now six years since the last Halloween celebration in Haddonfield. Michael Myers, his niece Jamie, and the mysterious Man in Black all disappeared after the explosive end of Part 5. Everyone assumes them all to be dead...but actually, Jamie has been captured by the Man In Black, who has her impregnated. The baby arrives on Halloween eve, and a kind woman named Mary helps Jamie and her baby escape. However, MichaelMyers is close behind her, and Jamie dies shortly into the movie, gutted with farm machinery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tommy Doyle (the child Laurie Strode sat for in the first film) has his eye on a family who's moved into the old Myers house. Tommy has become obsessed with Michael Myers. After hearing Jamie screaming for help on a radio show, Tommy finds her baby and hides him. The people living in the Myers' house are relatives of Laurie Strode...included is Kara Strode, and her illegitimate son, Danny - who "hears the voice" that Michael heard. Michael stalks each of the Strodes, trying to get to Jamie's baby. Across the street, Tommy reveals that Michael has been cursed with Thorn, where a young man must wipe out his entire family for the good of civilization. The plot takes a turn when the Man in Black reveals himself to be a major character. He has been experimenting with pure evil all these years...and kept it all secret at the Smith's Grove sanitarium. Tommy and Dr. Loomis follow this madman to the sanitarium, where an all-out battle occurs with Michael. It is revealed that some form of genetic research has been happening at Smith's Grove, with test tubes and DNA charts lying around. The film concludes with everyone getting out safe, except for Loomis, who walks back inside to "take care of unfinished business."</p>

<p>It's been twenty years since Laurie Strode escaped her brother's wrath. Now, it's time for one hell of a family reunion.</p>
<p>She changed her name. Her face. Her life. Living in the small town of Summer Glen, California, Keri Tate (Jamie Lee Curtis) runs the prestigious Hillcrest Academy.

<p>In Illinois, Marion (Loomis' nurse from the original film) finds files related to Laurie Strode stolen - by the Shape! Making his way cross country, Myers tracks his sister to Summer Glen. There, Keri isn't dealing with the anniversary well. She's an alcoholic who can't even be helped by her lover/school counselor Will (Adam Arkin).

<p>The nurses at Grace Anderson Sanitarium tell stories of patient Laurie Strode. She's the sister of the murderous legend Michael Myers - and 3 years ago, she thought she had destroyed her sibling for good. She was wrong - dead wrong. After killing an innocent man, she was locked away and hasn't spoken a word since. The staff believes her to be suicidal - they've caught her on the roof before. But Michael Myers has other plans for Laurie...</p>
<p>Back in the sleepy town of Haddonfield, Illinois, Freddie Harris, an ambitious entrepreneur, is ready to make some money with his new "reality" Internet event called Dangertainment. He's recruited six local college students to take part in his webcast. The "danger" arises when the students find out they have been picked to spend the night in the childhood home of Michael Myers. After an initial interview at the Haddonfield Inn, the students think they're all set for whatever scares come their way - and ready to reap the scholarship benefits Freddie is offering!</p>
<p>Halloween arrives and the group prepares to enter the run-down house. There's Sara, a psychology major who's rather reserved. Her friend Jen Danzig is hoping her Dangertainment debut will lead to fame in broadcasting. There's Rudy Grimes, a student of culinary arts who's pretty handy with a knife. Bill Woodlake is a law student more interested in women than books. Jim Morgan is a music major rebel in leather and Donna Chang is a beautiful but smart skeptic. The cameras are on and the broadcast is live as the group sets out to explore the secrets of the Myers house. Outside in the garage-based control room, Freddie and his assistant Nora are ready for some Halloween fun of their own. But what the group doesn't know is that Michael Myers has come home - and he's ready to clean house!</p>

He is also has recruited a dominatrix family called the Hutchingsons to provide dominatrix services. Grant Hutchinson Dubbed The King of the Portugese Breakfest has been quetion on mnay differnt counts of prostitution. Since Gus has an inside connection in the York Region Police Department no charges have been laid. This crime family is slightly dangerous but more so perverse and incestuous. Nick is know for his long lanky arms and they should be considered weapons to innocent by-standers</p>

<p>One of 16 children, Daniel is the man who defined the idea of "computers for the sake of loving computers". While working in the mid 1970's at the Candian Wheat Board's main office in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Daniel convinced them to place computers at everyone's desk - and not to just have a single mainframe in each department as was common in that era.</p>
<p>What the Board expected, after installing hundreds of computers, was less comminication amongst employees. What happened, remarkably, was more communication...165% more by measurement. Even though employees could stay at their desks to do their calculations, predictions, and statistics, they would discuss business and computation much more often while standing around the water cooler. And with the scientific community's creation of e-mail, they found out how to talk and pass information over the computer systems (which was revolutionary back then).</p>
<p>Daniel constantly pushed the envelope, convincing other companies in Winnipeg to add computers to every desk, and eventually bringing the idea to the United States.</p>
<p>He currently resides in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and Yuma, Arizona.</p>

<p>Divine Nightmare was formed in late 2003 by Jason McMurtrey (Blood Legacy) to convey to the world his ability to write music outside of the doom metal mold. After looking for a singer to fulfill vocal duties he turned to Mark Clausen from the band Long Since Dark. After completing most the work for their debut album 'Sorrows Of Dark' Jason Enlisted brother Jon to do drum duties. The line up now complete Divine Nightmare continues to win fans and forge ahead with a distinct brand of metal music that is filled with melodies and a low growl from the heavy handed guitar playing of Jason McMurtrey. Atmospheric in nature Divine Nightmare is the very essence of the name itself, Living inside haunted, tortured dreams. Jason's songwriting puts you into the emotions and feeling of these nighttime stories with the ease of a blue velvet glove wrapped tight around an iron fist. Divine Nightmare is the full time project of Jason McMurtrey that will always remain true to it's fans and deciples of the dream. Currently the band is writing and ready to record their next nightmare, 'The Cold Light Of Dawn'. Jason McMurtrey was also the driving source behind the band "Blood Legacy" which had a prominant 10 year career.</p>

<p>Organocatalysis is catalysis of a chemical reaction by the use of a small organic molecule (typically &lt;500 Daltons). It is an emerging field within synthetic chemical science, currently under intensive study.</p>
<p>Traditionally, catalysis has been achieved by either enzymes (macromolecular proteinaceous substances, often naturally occurring), transition metals or transition metal complexes. Many such substances are known to catalyse reactions of many types, for many different substrates. The use of small organic molecules (organocatalysts) to facillitate synthetic chemical steps is only just beginning to be exploited, despite being known for many years.</p>
<p>Examples of organocatalysts include; the naturally occuring amino acid, (L)-proline; cinchona alkaloids  ; various synthetic imidazolidinones.</p>
<p>Organocatalysis is 'greener' than traditional catalysis as no heavy metal wastes must be purified from chemical products or disposed. They are also more simple to manipulate than transition metal complexes, which tend to be unstable to air or moisture.</p>
<p>Current notable researchers in the field of organocatalysis include Profs. D. MacMillan (CalTech/Princeton, US), B. List (Max-Planck-Institut, Muelheim, Germany) and K.A. JØrgensen (Århus, Denmark).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-13_01a6.html" title="Edit section: Large Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Large Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome</span></h2>
<p>ENLARGED VESTIBULAR AQUEDUCT SYNDROME (Large Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome)</p>
<p>Name</p>
<p>Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome (EVAS or EVA) may also be known as Large Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome (LVAS) or just plain Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome (VAS). Some researchers call it Large Endolymphatic Duct and Sac Syndrome (LEDS). Still others believe it is a milder version of Pendred Syndrome (PDS).</p>
<p>Anatomy</p>
<p>With LVAS the bony channel or aqueduct connecting the cranial space and the inner ear (vestibule) is larger than normal (greater than 1.5mm or roughly 1/17 of an inch in diameter at the midpoint). The normal diameter for the aqueduct averages 0.8 mm, but with LVAS it can be as large as 8.0 mm.</p>
<p>Within this channel is the tube-like endolymphatic duct, filled with a fluid called endolymph. Endolymph naturally flows into the endolymphatic sac situated between the skull and the brain, but with LVAS, it may reverse direction and flow backwards into parts of the inner ear involving hearing and balance causing damage to the inner ear.</p>
<p>The vestibular aqueduct changes shape throughout a child’s life from birth to its mature shape at about 3 or 4 years old, going from straight and broad to a J-shape. It can suffer damage over this period, leading to hearing loss. As a result, LVAS is not congenital.</p>
<p>It is not clear to doctors how LVAS or the enlarged endolymphatic sac and duct cause hearing loss but theories abound.</p>
<p>How to Detect It</p>
<p>Evidence of hearing loss as a child is one of the first signs to look for to detect this condition, especially if hearing loss follows any head trauma. CT Scans or MRI Imaging can be used to confirm this condition. The CT Scan can see the aqueduct, while the MRI has the capability of seeing the endolymphatic duct and sac.</p>
<p>Implications</p>
<p>LVAS is estimated to present itself in between 1% and 1.5% of the population with sensorineural hearing loss. This proportion is several percentage points higher among those with sensorineural loss of unknown sensorineural hearing loss. Bilateral LVAS is much more common than unilateral LVAS.</p>
<p>LVAS results from having a specific gene in an overlapping area to that for Pendred Syndrome. The results in one study suggest that around 39% of LVAS cases with sensorineural hearing loss had family members with the same problem. This suggests that the gene for LVAS is an autosomal recessive gene (has to be received from both copies of the gene).</p>
<p>Hearing loss usually occurs after birth as the vestibular aqueduct shapes itself into a more mature form. Most LVAS patients lose their hearing as children, fewer as adolescents and yet fewer as adults. Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common result though conductive hearing loss is also possible (or both). In addition, other deformities such as cochlear deformities often accompany LVAS.</p>
<p>In cases where there is LVAS without other cochlear deformities, the likelihood of hearing loss is much more significant, especially in the higher frequencies. Also, sudden drops in hearing are much more likely. The presence of cochlear deformities in effect safeguards the hearing in the case of LVAS.</p>
<p>It is a bad idea to have LVAS and to have an injury to the head or neck or to be subjected to activities that increase inter-cranial pressure. This may result in post-traumatic Meniere’s Disease and/or sudden hearing loss. It is suggested that people with LVAS refrain from contact sports, unless the ears that have LVAS are not salvageable or the person’s previous history shows no resulting hearing loss from such activities.</p>
<p>Hearing loss may be in sudden bouts or may be gradually progressive. Sudden bouts may occur after minor head injuries or after increased inter-cranial pressure. There is a chance the hearing will recover to normal after a sudden bout, but often in recovers to a “new normal” at a lower level than before. A sudden hearing loss with LVAS may damage the balance-related part of your ear region, and may result in vertigo and imbalance.</p>
<p>How to Handle LVAS</p>
<p>To control LVAS, take precautions to prevent head injuries, and sudden changes in intra-cranial pressure. In the event that hearing drops to a low level, people with LVAS are generally good candidates for cochlear implants.</p>

<p>ASK THE PILOT is the title of a long running air travel column at Salon.com, an online news, politics, and arts magazine based in San Francisco. The column is authored by Patrick Smith (born Patrick Santosuosso) a furloughed airline pilot and freelance contributor who lives near Boston.</p>
<p>Smith began writing occasional, unsolicited pieces for Salon in November, 2001, after losing his job in the post-September 11th industry downturn. In June, 2002, he submitted a questions-and-answers format article covering several common queries about air travel. It was well received, and Salon published several follow-ups under the banner "Ask the Pilot," a name coined by Andrew Leonard, the editor at Salon who first discovered and promoted Smith's writing.</p>
<p>Marked by an edgy, literate, and occasionally provocative style, ASK THE PILOT gained a cult following and became a regular fixture on Salon. It has appeared weekly there since 2002, usually running on Fridays, and is read around the world. Topics range beyond technical aspects of flying to encompass everything from airport architecture to global travel. The author has a particular fondness for issues pertaining to terrorism, and for exploring the histories and cultures of the world's airlines. The early Q&amp;A structure was abandoned for a more essay-style format, though he occasionally tackles reader-submitted questions.</p>
<p>A full, regularly updated index of columns can be viewed here: <a href="http://dir.salon.com/topics/p_smith/index.html" class="external free" title="http://dir.salon.com/topics/p_smith/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/topics/p_smith/index.html</a> (Salon is a subscription site, but Access to Salon.com is free by watching a short advertisement)</p>
<p>"Salon.com tends to bury the work of Patrick Smith under a pile of political diatribes and pop-culture effluvia," wrote Dan Mitchell in the New York Times. That's too bad, because more people should see his ASK THE PILOT column, in which he shares his expertise on the airline industry, with mild snark and delightfully gratuitous references to 80's alternative rock."</p>
<p>The New York Times' Joe Sharkey calls ASK THE PILOT "Trenchant and insightful."</p>
<p>An adaptation of the column's first two years was published in book form in June, 2004, by Riverhead Books, an imprint of Penguin. Amazon.com awarded ASK THE PILOT its "Best Travel Book of 2004" honors. It sold reasonably well and remains in print, but has suffered from lack of promotion and extremely poor placement in stores. An Italian version, "Chiedio al pilota," has sold over 10,000 copies in Italy.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-13_01a6.html" title="Edit section: Northwest Classen High School">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Northwest Classen High School</span></h2>
<p><b>History Over Northwest Classen</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Northwest Classen was built in 1955 to meet the growing need for educational facilities in northwest Oklahoma City. It was designed after a committee of architects and administrators visited and studied forty schools in seven states. The final architechure plan was made by Hudgins, Thompson, Ball and Associates, and construction was performed by the Builders Company. The building was first opened on September 3, 1955 with 10th, 11th and 12th grades. When the second wing was completed in 1956, 9th graders were also admitted. Enrollment in 1956 was 2002. At the time, Northwest was the premier school facility in Oklahoma City.</li>
</ul>
<p>The social scene in the early years of the school were dominated by fraternaties (Delta Sigma, Alpha Omega, Kappa Alpha Pi, Phi Lamda Chi, and Phi Sigma Alpha), the O-Club, and the Lancers and Falcons, both of which were pep clubs. Each group had its own car "honks", designated parking places in the school lot, and favorite hang outs. The fraternity boys liked the "Carousel" drive in (now a What-a-burger at 34th &amp; May) while the O-Club boys stayed across the street at the local Dairy Queen (now a car dealership). I am told, however, that everyone got along for the most part.</p>
<p>Early in it's history, NWC's students were called "Silkies". Why they were called Silkies seems to be the cause of some arguement. Some have told me it's because the students were from "Silk Stocking Row", and another from the idea that its athletes wore silk jock straps (I swear, that's what I was told!). In later years, Silkies had appearently taken on a different meaning because the football team didn't win much and it was said that they were afraid to get a run in their silk stockings.</p>
<p>In the forty plus years since the school opened, many things have changed as the school has progressed from being a suburban, nearly all white school to a multi-ethnic, inner city school. Now the students body is roughly one third white, one third black, one third almost evenly divided between Asian and Hispanic students. Sixy-five percent of the students are eligible for the free lunch. Enrollment is now about 1200, and graduating class sizes have dwindled to less than 300. However, many of the old traditions are still carried on. For a recent perspective see my essay on Knights in the 90's</p>
<p>Many notable individuals have been associatied with Northwest. Noted civil rights activist Clara Luper was a government teacher in the late 60's. The Knights head statue in the fountain was Sculpted by the famous sculpture Leonard McMurry of OKC who has done such noted works as the many statues that grace the downtown area of the city, the Buffalo Bill statue and the Restoration of the End Of The Trail statue that are at the Cowboy Hall of Fame. Famous alumni include coutry singer Vince Gill ('75), pop group "Color Me Badd", OU basketball star Darrel "Chu" Kennedy, former lightweight boxing champion of the world Sean O'Grady ('77), Mason Williams ('56) who had a hit record called "Classical Gas" and was a regular on the Smothers Brothers TV show, former Oklahoma City mayor Ron Norick and current OKC mayor Kirk Humphries. . --&gt; [<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/1984/nwc.gif" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/1984/nwc.gif" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]</p>

<p>Florida County Road 535 (also known as CR535 and Winter Garden - Vineland Road is a county maintained highway that generally runs north-south through a rapidly growing area of western Orange County, Florida. The highway begins in the City of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Garden%2C_Florida_694e.html" title="Winter Garden, Florida">Winter Garden, Florida</a> at <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_State_Road_50_3780.html" title="Florida State Road 50">Florida State Road 50</a> as a two lane highway with many twists and turns. There is a full intersection with <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_State_Road_429_9d87.html" title="Florida State Road 429">Florida State Road 429</a>, the Western Expressway, at Stoneybrook West Parkway. The road makes a 90-degree turn east at Summerport Village, continues for two more miles as a two lane road and then turns south again and widens to become a four-lane divided highway at Chase Road in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windermere%2C_Florida_6045.html" title="Windermere, Florida">Windermere, Florida</a>. Many motorists pull onto the shoulder of County Road 535 late at night to watch the firworks show taking place at the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Kingdom_3c09.html" title="Magic Kingdom">Magic Kingdom</a> of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_World_4f0c.html" title="Walt Disney World">Walt Disney World</a>, which is just to the west of the highway near the intersection with Reams Road. The road runs along the northern property line of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_World_4f0c.html" title="Walt Disney World">Walt Disney World</a> and ends in <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Buena_Vista%2C_Florida_6aa4.html" title="Lake Buena Vista, Florida">Lake Buena Vista, Florida</a> at the intersection of Apopka - Vineland Road. At this point the road reverts to state ownership and is renamed Florida State Road 535 as it continues south past <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_4.html" title="Interstate 4">Interstate 4</a>.</p>
<p>During 2007 there are plans to shift the northern most section of County Road 535 approximately one-half mile to the east. Just north of the intersection with State Road 429 (Western Expressway)a to-be-built 4-lane highway would route traffic through a planned shopping center called Winter Garden Village at Fowler Groves and connect to a recently-built 4-lane highway currently called Daniels Road. Daniels Road continues north to the intersection of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_State_Road_50_3780.html" title="Florida State Road 50">Florida State Road 50</a>. A widening of the 2-lane bridge over <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida%27s_Turnpike_5655.html" title="Florida's Turnpike">Florida's Turnpike</a> will be needed.
