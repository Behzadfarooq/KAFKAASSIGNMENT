<dd>We care because we want to make a good encyclopedia, and this doesn't help. From what I can tell, several people have expressed an interest in including a list on the main page of the vehicles, but only the vehicles (no stats).

<dd>Look dude were not trying to mock you here, and we're not ruining something you put your efforts into. We are working to reach a consensus about this article and the information in it (by the way, prose is complete sentences and paragraphs.) Maybe this information has a place on <a href="http://strategywiki.net/" class="external text" title="http://strategywiki.net/" rel="nofollow">StrategyWiki</a>, <a href="http://www.egamia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.egamia.com" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Gamia</a>, or <a href="http://gameinfo.wikia.com/wiki/" class="external text" title="http://gameinfo.wikia.com/wiki/" rel="nofollow">GameInfo</a>. Take a look at those to add strategy guide material. As for Wikipedia, I think the only suitable answer is to delete this article and put a small list on the main Kirby Air Ride article.--<a href="../../../c/l/y/User%7EClyde_Miller_83b6.html" title="User:Clyde Miller">Clyde Miller</a> 22:29, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've got rid of the massive MTV-Unplugged text dump (although someone is welcome to re-add it in a more judicious manner) and had a quick run-through with a wikification pencil on the rest. The subject of the artist is verifiable and appears notable. Certainly the album "Falange Canibal" got press attention, and I'd expect that the same is true of the rest of his discography. A lusophone editor should be able to shed more light on this, but there doesn't look anything wrong with it now. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:34, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm about to apply my personal "book notability" test, which is "a book with Amazon sales rank of better than 200,000." (I picked that number when Wikipedia had about 400,000 articles, reasoning that less than half of Wikipedia's articles ought to be about books. I've stuck with it, for no good reason. However I've found it to be a good way of discriminating between "real" books and self-published and/or very obscure academic titles). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:00, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Update</b> Well fine, y'all want to keep the page. My only suggestion is that it gets a clean up and reflects who I really am (positive and negative, it should be truthful and lets face it I'm not a perfect fellow). Also, probably should merge the LibTom page into this. (Note: I still want the page to be deleted. I'm only offering more acceptable alternatives in case for some reason deletion isn't possible, which it should be because it's about me...!!! ... ok enough wiki'ing, I'm a bit drunk off of Redbull Vodka at the moment... weee...) -- Tom

<dd>Suggestion. It's not considered a good idea to edit articles about yourself, but I don't see why you couldn't draft some paragraphs or suggest some changes on the article's Talk page, Talk:Tom St Denis.

<dd>Sorry, I don't want to come off as rude. I'm just really motivated to have the articles removed. It's also probably not a good idea if I draft paragraphs about myself. That'd be kinda self-serving wouldn't it? The current article lacks details to be of interest to anyone, and even if it were flushed out with more content I still don't see what's so notable about myself to warrant an article. If you guys think you're going to hurt my feelings by voting for deletion you're mistaken. I'm the one who pushed for the deletion in the first place! -- Tom</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: it seems to me that neither the act of publishing books nor posting lots on the Internet provides notability. I'm usually happy to let sub-notable articles be, but when the subject is a non-notable living person who has expressed a wish not to be included, then we should not include them. Please be certain that this person is genuinely notable before we keep it against his wishes. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 09:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Suggestion</b>: Some local media may be doing interviews with me about my doings (setup by my employer ...). If the community wants to keep the article about me, maybe they can use the published interview(s) for material? -- Tom

<li>Yep, that sort of thing is an ideal source. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 17:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I think you've been very clear, actually, Tom; nobody here doubts your earnest desire to see your article deleted. What my "digging the grave" reference to is that you are saying that new sources proving your notability are about to emerge--the best sort of sources for showing notability, that is, genuine media that's independent of you. The nominator claims that you are non-notable, which would, according to policy, be the only real reason to delete the article. You're bringing forth new evidence of your notability, thus undercutting your expressed desire. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 19:00, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, gotcha. Well, to be honest I think it's the marketting folk at my job who talked the local media into it. Though they do seem intrigued about my politics and how I "used the Internet to build a Career." I'm not trying to say what I've been doing for the last five years was trivial or unimportant. I just have to question, in the face of all the other OSS projects out there, how unique and notable it is. It'd be like if you were a really good coal miner. Even if you did a good job, worked hard, etc, do you deserve a wiki article? The only real thing that stands out between myself and other OSS developers is my desire to release to the public domain instead of copyleft. -- Tom
<ul>
<li>We take these things one at a time. Plenty of people argue (these are folks arguing to <i>keep</i> their articles, you understand) that there are many articles of, say, bands just as notable as theirs. Doesn't matter, all you can evaluate is the article in front of you. Same argument applies to Tom St Denis, just in reverse. And, coal miners are not inherently notable, they have to do something truly unexpected to achieve notice. Guys who write books, on the other hand--keep your nose clean, work hard, get the reviews, you get a wiki article. Plus, Tom, you've got a catchy name for your product. Never underestimate the power of a catchy name. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 21:01, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I've added info to the talk page if you guys want to rebuild the article and keep it. At least with some details it'll be worth having the slightly elevated profile around.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Looking at the stuff Tom has done, I'm inclined to say that he's borderline notable at present. What sways me towards deletion is his pleasing modesty.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Tom, my own view is that a really good coal miner could certainly qualify for an article here. In assessing people's work-related notability I look for two things: first, have they accomplished something by their own efforts that makes them stand out in their field&#160;? and/or second, are they recognised by their peers, and by the broader public, for their work&#160;? So a coal miner could certainly qualify, perhaps if he were highly productive ( for example, we have an article on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksei_Grigorievich_Stakhanov_9796.html" title="Aleksei Grigorievich Stakhanov">Aleksei Grigorievich Stakhanov</a>, who was noted for his zealous workmanship ( though there are also doubts as to precisely what happened on that historic day ) ), or perhaps if he in some other way performed at the peak of his profession. The same is obviously true for any other person in any other field of human endeavour. Right now it appears, from the comments of people more expert in the field of computers than I, that you are doing a great job. Your own opinion is that you're not quite unique or notable enough, though, and ( even allowing for some gentlemanly modesty ) you're probably one of the best judges of that, so I'm prepared to go with deletion for the moment. But watch out: people know your name, and are talking about you, so you're definitely at risk of having an article at some stage&#160;! With best wishes for the future. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:04, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the kind words. The way I see it, being a bit over-modest is always a good idea. It's all too tempting to drop your guard and let the ego soar. As another pointed out, usually people are fighting to <b>keep</b> their vanity pages because they lost perspective and think they're really worthy of notability. I'd rather lean towards the side of caution and due process. To be honest, my notability would be better proven when all those, whom I presumably (*) touched through my efforts come forward to offer testimony, then by simply listing a couple of books and a URL to some source code. I admit it seems odd that I argue for deletion instead of keeping it. It isn't because I'm anti-social or self-destructive. Just that I have enough respect for what Wikipedia is attempting to not let my personal ego interfere with the process. (* based on the concensus assumption I'm currently notable). -- Tom</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It's refreshing when a subject of a wikipedia article not only takes interest in wikipedia but also keeps a level head when they learn about their page and that it may be kept against their wishes. I do hope that tom sticks around and updates other wikipedia articles as well. I am sure he has vast experiance in different areas that would definately be a big help to wikipedia. On a site note: I admire the stance to publish into the PD instead of Copyleft. That alone should be a point of notability and what science/research is all about. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 16:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> What's the call? I'm still in favour of deletion on non-notability grounds. I think we should close this discussion once and for all. I'm not closed to the idea in the future about an article (if the circumstances warrant it), but as I see it now this isn't the case. -- tom
<ul>
<li>Deletion debates aren't usually concluded earlier than five days after they start, which means there's some seven hours or so before this one becomes eligible to be closed. The article will almost certainly be kept, though, given that there's no consensus to delete. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 16:56, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is there enough citable resources to fill out a competent article? I think if you really press some of the voters here for wiki-worthy material they may realize the folly of their ways. I'll bet most voted to keep out of some misguided attempt to avoid hurting my feelings or something. As it stands now, the only published material with my name on it are the two books. And aside from the prefaces of both there isn't much material that discusses Tom or his wacky LibTom Projects. Again, I encourage people to re-evaluate the situation. -- Tom
<ul>
<li>I don't think there are enough citable sources to fill out more than a few sentences. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 11:54, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Merge</b> The LibTom Project page is about his software. This page is about him as a software writer which seems to be the only thing he is currently notable for. Assuming that he systematically becomes more notable for other things a higher quality article could be compiled. For now it seems as though his claim to fame is as an "upcomming cryptographer" and as such could be mentioned in articles about cryptographers and in a page about his software. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Hjul_ff76.html" title="User:Paul Hjul">Paul Hjul</a> 11:21, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It can appropriate to have more than one article on a particular cult or religious group. The <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> page, for example, currently includes links to some 55 distinct wikipedia articles. The article proposed for deletion hosts information about the Brahma Kumaris organization, current and former members beyond the group's beliefs, practices and history as covered on the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahma_Kumaris_6c4a.html" title="Brahma Kumaris">Brahma Kumaris</a> page. Specifically, many ex-members have written personal accounts of their experiences, as well as narrating the traumas of other ex-members unable to provide their own accounts, their conflicted lives having ended in suicide. While the content of such pages may (and have been) debated, these references exist, and properly belong to a discussion that considers the cultlike aspects of this particular group. These resources have been aggregated at the BrahmaKumarisInfo website,<a href="http://brahmakumaris.info" class="external autonumber" title="http://brahmakumaris.info" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> representing the movement to disseminate knowledge about the group's cultlike behaviors. It is the name of this website that gives the page its title. The high activity of this site, involving thousands of posts from hundreds of former and current members, and splinter group members and ex-members, justifies an additional article about the cultlike behaviors that can be found within the Brahma Kumaris as well as their human, legal and social consequences.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The use of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> for Japanese performers is highly controversial, as many editors are of the opinion that the Japanese industry is sufficiently different from the American industry that many of the provisions of the guideline are inapplicable.

How many American porn stars have 24 DVDs at Amazon? The Japanese and American pornography industries are different and to ignore those differences is to create cultural bias at Wikipedia. To put things in perspective, consider a Japanese pornographic superstar like Hitomi Kobayashi. "...long hailed as Japan's Queen of Adult Video... It's been 16 years since her debut film and she has made 39 movies for the direct to video market..." <a href="http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2003/07/20030718p2g00m0dm999000c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2003/07/20030718p2g00m0dm999000c.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> So, "Japan's Queen of Adult Video" fails the <i>American</i> 100-film test. For more comparison, the nominating editor has recently edited at a one-sentence stub on an actress with one (1) known, minor appearance in one (1) known film, verified only by one (1) link to IMDB. Yet he previously mass-nominated articles in this category for deletion on "notability" grounds. 24 DVDs at Amazon is certainly a sign of reaching a broad audience, and far more notable than the subject of the other article. If this article needs improving, let's improve it. My online time is taken up with re-instating a list the was deleted through what I am convinced are dishonest means. Once I've got that list (lists now) back up, I fully expect to spend my time improving these articles.

<li>The article had been tagged for questionable importance since September. Nothing had been done to add more meat to it.</li>
<li>There is no article for this actress on Japanese WP.</li>
<li>There is no established guidelines or rules here to say that "24 DVDs at Amazon" makes a Japanese porn actress notable. I personally don't think it does.</li>
<li>What other editing I do and what other articles I nominate for deletion is irrelevant to the fact that this actress seems non-notable and hardly anything had been done since the article's existence to assert her notability. However, if you think the Helen Kim article I edited should be nominated for deletion, by all means, nominate it. I myself question that actress's notability. Heck, I'll nominate the article myself.</li>

<dd>No, I don't think the Helen Kim stub should be deleted. I think it should be improved. Deleting it would prevent a better article from being written on Helen Kim, and thereby remove valid information from Wikipedia. The exact same thing goes for the more notable, and better developed article on <a href="../../../h/i/k/Hikari_Hino_4713.html" title="Hikari Hino">Hikari Hino</a>. I don't edit there, but I watch the Japanese Wikipedia. Many recently red-linked actresses there have new articles, and I won't be at all surprised to see one on Hikari Hino started soon, since she clearly deserves one. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 21:47, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to add - I understand you are having a difficult time assuming good faith. But let me point out that I tagged this article with the importance tag three months ago<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hikari_Hino&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73690968" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hikari_Hino&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73690968" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. When I nominated it for deletion<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hikari_Hino&amp;diff=93075285&amp;oldid=93051031" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hikari_Hino&amp;diff=93075285&amp;oldid=93051031" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, it had the exact same content in the article as it did when I tagged it for importance three months ago. Namely, it had two sentences, with a short filmography. I am perfectly justified in nominating this article. Furthermore, I want to repeat that there is absolutely no criteria anywhere on English WP that says "24 DVDs on Amazon" establishes notability for Japanese porn actresses. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 22:05, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> (Edit conflict) I really doubt this is a case of systemic bias. She is non-notable, and if there isn't a Japanese article on her, there probably shouldn't be an English one. A quick Google search brings up mostly adult sites and such, and I really don't see any verifiable sources in either an English or a Japanese search. I have nothing against an Idol having an English page, its just that there are no reliable sources that prove her notability; even if modified to include Japanese versions of things, I don't see her passing <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">Lim</a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_Esperanza_b9a2.html" title="User:Limetom/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b><i>e</i></b></font></a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">tom</a> 23:10, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The bias comes in treating the Japanese and American porn industries as if they were the same. Obviously they are not. Creating standards for one which the other is expected to pass is a way of creating cultural bias at Wikipedia. Suppose those of us interested in the Japanese side said an actress needed to have 10 videos at Amazon in order to pass notability. How many American porn actresses would pass? Also, if you know anything about Japanese popular culture, you know that these actresses/idols are far more visible, and therefore more notable in Japan than their American equivilants are in the U.S. When I was in Japan, I saw models and actresses exactly like this one all over TV, not to mention magazines, newspapers, photo books... all in standard book stores, not hidden away in an adult book shop. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 00:25, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The bottom line is, there is no seperate criteria for Japanese porn stars here. So she has 24 DVDs listed on Amazon. Why and how does that make her notable? Why does that make her stand out in the industry she's in? These are questions that have never been answered. There are hundreds and thousands of different industries and how they are perceived in different cultures. For example, calligraphy artists are probably more well-known in East Asia than they are in Western countries. The question here is - how does having 24 DVDs listed on Amazon establish that she's widely known? Do we have any information on how many people are buying these DVDs from Amazon? And exactly how many consumers would make her notable? What if only 10 people purchased her DVDs on Amazon? The American porn industry and the Japanese porn industry are not exactly the same, but maybe you just have to accept the <i>possibility</i> that the average Japanese porn star is simply not very notable. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 00:52, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The fact that the information is unattainable is actually my point - it's unverifiable, so yes, we <i>should</i> leave that information out.

Furthermore, the prolific guideline in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> specifically states "Performer has been notable or prolific <b>within a specific genre niche</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> yes leave the sales information out (which means conjecture about how her dvds might have low sales is pointless) as it is unverifiable. however, <i>being</i> on an established retail outlet with more than 1 dvd per month does show that she has been prolific - which is the point. what is actually listed in her article's filmography is obviously not a full list (again, see amazon japan), and having an incomplete filmography is of course not a reason for deletion either. her movies fall into both "asian" and "busty" genres, so she qualifies. --<a href="../../../h/e/x/User%7EHexvoodoo_cd57.html" title="User:Hexvoodoo">Hexvoodoo</a> 23:51, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> (Though I'm trying to prevent getting sucked into another of Hong's famous absurdist arguments.) 1.) If Amazon is not a media outlet, <a href="http://www.allmediaoutlet.com/allmedia/index.jsp" class="external text" title="http://www.allmediaoutlet.com/allmedia/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">All Media Outlet</a> had better change its name fast. 2.) Amazon is a reliable source for proving that said media exists. 3.) No one is setting up an arbitrary number, we are following Wikipedia's guidelines: "5. Performer has appeared multiple times in notable mainstream media outlets" 4.) "Japan's Queen of Adult Video" made 39 movies in 16 years. 24 DVDs is clearly notable there. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:02, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll be happy to address these points: 1) "All Media Outlet" derives its name from "outlet store". And also, the US government probably has a better definition of "media outlet" than the brand name of a retail store. 2) Nobody is denying that media <i>exists</i>. The issue here is whether or not this person is notable, and number of DVDs on Amazon is an unverifiable and arbitrary claim to notability. 3) This person has not appeared in mainstream media outlets. There is seemingly no mention of her ever been in mainstream films, mainstream TV, mainstream magazines, etc. 4) "Japan's Queen of Adult Video" Hitomi Kobayashi (小林由美) is apparently not even famous enough to have an entry on Japanese Wikipedia. So what does that say about this particular actress who is <i>not</i> "Japan's Queen of Adult Video"? <i>Who</i> proclaimed Hitomi Kobayashi "Japan's Queen of Adult Video" anyway? Her manager? <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 18:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a witchhunt, I don't care about the project (it's not because there is a project that any article is free from scrutiny and possibly deletion), and notabiulity is not so "mysterious" at all, only subjective. As for the Google search: it indicates that I have tried to find reliable, verifiable sources (per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) with the means available to me. Many schools have much much more independent exposure on the Internet, and many newspapers and magazines have their articles (or intros) available through Google. What this Google search means is that, <i>as far as I can see</i>, this school is not notable, and <i>unless someone else provides other sources</i> (offline or online), there is no notability for this school and it fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> beyond the fact of its existence (which is not disputed). This is a perfectly acceptable method of discussing the merits of an article, and is the normal way to check if the article should be kept or deleted according to WIkipedia policies. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:01, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Because there is very little content that can be added to the article since there are nearly no (if any) sources for it. All the information in the article is contained in the infobox, and the only item in the infobox that wouldn't be found in the <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Tragic_Kingdom_45ec.html" title="Tragic Kingdom">Tragic Kingdom</a></i> article is the producer and maybe that chart position. —<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 22:41, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, stubs are fine. However, this stub would (almost certainly) never be anything more than a stub, and all of its information would be found elsewhere.

<li><b>Keep</b> - that Google hits only refer to her as Shackleton's mistress, and that she isn't mentioned on his page, are not reasons enough to justify deletion, but only shows that Google and Wikipedia often are insufficient tools to judge importance. Rosalind Chetwynd was an extremely interesting lady: an American middle-class woman, born Rosalind Secor and daughter of a New York lawyer. She travelled to London in 1900 and married Guy Chetwynd, heir to a baronetcy. She later divorced him and developed a life-long attachment to Jack Barnato Joel, a well-known British-South African financier, mining magnate and horse-breeder, part of the <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_family.html" title="Joel family">Joel family</a>. He supported her and her son Victor Chetwynd for many years, and continued to do so even when she started her long affair with Shackleton. She, in turn, presented his wife to the Court. At the age of 33, she became a rather successful actress in London, using the stage name Rosa Lynd (picture at the National Portrait Gallery <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp55942" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp55942" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>) and performing in classic venues such as Wyndham’s Theatre and the Comedy Theatre, for which she even was manager for a while. She also started her own theatre company, The Rosa Lynd Company, which performed both in Britain and on Broadway. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 20:11, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Having checked all books penned by this person, they are evidently publications from various vanity presses and do not constitute genuine contributions to literature so much as exercises in vanity. Also, subject is an institutional personality of a religious organization, "OTO." Actual contributions to society as a whole are dubious. Further, claims regarding to Science Fiction Fandom contributions remain unsubstantiated as do claims of investigating various UFO-related phenomena.

<li><b>delete</b>I see no reason why being a member of a religious organization is a minus, and I think his claim to have been a past-president of the Atlanta Science Fiction Organization probably could be verified.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have had it called to my attention that the autobiographical info on, and literary style of the person who initiated the current request for deletion is a gentleman I know who has an intense *personal* dislike of me, and is motivated thereby. He has used various names, but is an occultist and math teacher from Alabama formerly associated with the same fraternity as myself. He placed several reviews of my books on Amazon.com which I requested be removed on the grounds that, while everyone has a right to an opinion, these reviews were motivated by personal dislike of the author, rather than opinions of the books in question. Amazon agreed and removed them. If this is the case here, I doubt that Wikipedia should delete any article because an individual dislikes the subject (and/or author) of this article. None of my books were published by Subsidity Publishers. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllengreenfield_d05b.html" title="User:Allengreenfield">Allen H Greenfield</a> 00:35, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Who nominated the article or the motivation for doing so are not really relevant here; what's important is whether the article complies with Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The first paragraph or so seems to be a cut &amp; paste from the only (non-<a href="../../../r/_/_/WP%7ER_3abc.html" title="WP:R">reliable</a> source, but since the author of the website seems to be the same person as the author of the article, it's probably not copyvio. -- <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 08:53, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b></p>
<p>To address original arguments:</p>
<p>1) "...all books penned by this person, they are evidently publications from various vanity presses and do not constitute genuine contributions to literature so much as exercises in vanity."</p>
<p>I reply that to remove an article on this premise one one also need to remove all articles regarding Donatien Alphonse François de Sade (among others...many many others), who was forced to seek vanity presses or self publication in order to promulgate his research into human nature.</p>
<p>2) "...subject is an institutional personality of a religious organization,..."</p>
<p>Again, any and all references to any and all personae who have ever been "an institutional personality of a religious organization" throughout history would have to be summarily purged from Wikipedia's database.</p>
<p>3) "Actual contributions to society as a whole are dubious."</p>
<p>It is rare, indeed, that one's "contributions to society" are fully recognized during one's life span. The cases in point are too numerous to mention, and the exceptions to this are few. In fact, it is very plain that, even within a singel a single generation, a definition of being a positive contributor to society can vary greatly between one person and another. In my lifetime alone I have seen many people, and to be on point, writers, who I believe to have been wonderous like Thomas Pynchon, who many people think is simply long winded while I feel that some of the authors some of my friends read, like Ayn Rand, are simply trite.</p>
<p>Who is correct? All of us are. That is just the nature of personal taste. Do I think Ayn rand should be removed from wikipedia? Nope...I wouldn't assume to speak for anyone but myself. But here is one thing for sure...If I don't want to read something, I do the easiest thing in t he world. I don't.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the stated arguments are not, I believe, sufficient to warrant deletion of an article from wikipedia.</p>
<p>I, personally, have not read, nor do I intend to read, the article in question; but it sounds like a personal issue and I would suggest that the individual who initiated this request look deeply into their personal motives rather than than avoid or whitewash them.</p>
<p>Peace to everyone, and never forget, "You know how dumb the average person is? Well, by definition, half of 'em are even dumber than THAT." -J.R. Dobbs</p>
<p>As always, and no matter what, Fear is a Dog</p>
<p>I have known Allen H. Greenfield for a number of years and have always found him to have an extraordinary amount of integrity. I have severe questions about the person who wants to remove Allen's entry. I vote to keep it.</p>
<p>Peace,<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand with an explanation for each category and ranking so it is more than a list. Very useful and a good read. It is not indiscriminate at all, its a very well defined article. It just needs more text to place the information in context. IT can be merged into the United States article but that article is already too large and is already being broken into smaller articles. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 20:10, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Look at the site (again). It's a useful short compilation of sources for national rankings, that additionally gives the US rank.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It's a disambiguation page that links nowhere. While high schools may be notable, a list of high schools that don't have articles is something else entirely.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Řÿūłóñģ</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 22:07, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> There is no such trend. Quite the opposite in fact- the last few months have seen highschools being deleted in a variety of cases. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Sooner or later, one of these high school articles will be created, and it will be incredibly helpful to have this article serve as a placeholder to allow these articles to be predisambiguated. This will prevent the mass confusion of using "Bridgeport High School" as a title and then being forced to rename it when a second "Bridgeport High School" article is created. The argument that anyone can determine that not a single one of these schools will ever be able to demonstrate notability is patently ludicrous on its face. And if folks likes <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes">User:Gracenotes</a> are bothered by <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> issues, the solution is to fix them; not to use it as a poor excuse for deleting an article. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 23:08, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I strongly dislike the "all schools are notable" or similar nonsense but this would be useful at minimum just having redirect to the various school districts that contain the relevant schools. And since one of the schools at this point is not a redlink and has clear notability I think it is easy to justify keeping at this point <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — One link now exists; likely others will as well.

<li><b>keep</b> If it had no blue links, then I would have said delete. And, Alansohn's H.S. actually is notable--site of a notable civil liberties controversy--although, Alansohn, I would still try to scare up some notable alumni.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 06:01, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, it's the best I could come up with in 20 minutes on a Saturday night. And there are so many of those darned Bridgeport High Schools out there, which makes it incredibly difficult to match up alumni to schools.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- The term is certainly no neologism. It is a real term and was already in use in 1992, when I recall first encountering it. It's used both as a legal term in warranty agreements, and as a descriptive in articles and user instructions. This is a commonly used term and as such should be covered by Wikipedia. Further, this term is used both as a common language descriptive, and a legal term in at least the telecommunications, wireless, and PC industries. Something I also want to highlight is that companies such as HP and Lucent use the term in legalese, which is a strong statement of support, considering the cohorts of lawyers both of them command. And finally, the term describes a common user experience, which should have a name other than the marketing-coined hide-the-ball terms that I run across every now and then. Thus, I strongly recommend that this article not be deleted, and instead be embraced as an industry term in common use.</li>

<p>With all due respect this is complete nonsense. I am not affilliated with Voicetronix OpenPBX in any way and I have no interest in promoting it. I created the page because somebody who created the original OpenPBX page made a mistake to use a common law trademark of Voicetronix for an unrelated project called "OpenPBX.org". This mistake had to be corrected.</p>
<p>The name OpenPBX must not be used to refer to the OpenPBX.org project. If this practise spreads, then Voicetronix may start taking legal action and that would mean potential trouble (at least in Australia) for the open source community project "OpenPBX.org".</p>
<p>Of course you could simply delete the "OpenPBX" page and simply carry on with the new, properly titled "OpenPBX.org" page which I created as a legal replacement. However, since this is a site where any member of the public can create a new page, it is very likely that somebody will create another "OpenPBX" page again to describe "OpenPBX.org". The best way to prevent this is to have a page that lists the known uses of the name and links to the properly titled pages.</p>
<p>I created another page for Voicetronix' OpenPBX software because it is also an open source software package, so why would it not deserve equal treatment and this ensures goodwill from Voicetronix not to start complaining about the name conflict.</p>
<p>If the view of Wikipedia is that open source projects can only have an entry if they are not controlled by a single vendor, then you would also have to remove the Asterisk PBX page because Asterisk is an open source project controlled by a single vendor, Digium. You would also have to remove many other entries on open source projects, MySQL for example.</p>
<p>So, why is a page about OpenPBX by Voicetronix inappropriate advertising while a page about Asterisk by Digium is not?</p>

<b>Avoidance of legal trouble for OpenPBX.org</b></p>
<p>The article is neither about a company nor about a product. It is there to inform people about the possible confusion that may arise, in part due to Wikipedia's original wrong doing, that is improperly using a trademark in the title of one of its pages.</p>
<p>Note that we (OpenPBX.org) did not create this problem. Wikipedia did. If Wikipedia had not been using the name "OpenPBX" incorrectly in the title of one of its pages, this would not be an issue now. We didn't ask for this. We never use "OpenPBX" anywhere, we always use "OpenPBX.org". The least we can expect from Wikipedia is assistance in solving this problem and making sure the improper use of Voicetronix' AU trademark to describe or refer to OpenPBX.org does not happen again.</p>
<p>We have amicably resolved this very same issue amicably on the Voip-Info.org wiki site after talking to Voicetronix. There we have repurposed the "OpenPBX" entry to become a disambiguation page linking to an "OpenPBX by Voicetronix" page and an "OpenPBX.org" page (and further linking to a third party using OpenPBX in the name of a software). This is a solution Voicetronix has agreed to and it therefore avoids any potential disputes which would be harmful to our project.</p>
<p>If you do not agree with the solution presented, a solution Voicetronix has agreed to, then please advise an alternative.</p>
<p>Simply deleting all references to Voicetronix' OpenPBX is not a solution because it would only introduce a level of indirection, thus still consitute the use of the name "OpenPBX" for refering to "OpenPBX.org".</p>
<p>If you were to delete the OpenPBX page altogether, then there is no guarantee that somebody will not create the page again and use it to describe or to refer to OpenPBX.org.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, this has to be resolved in such a way that</p>
<p>a) Voicetronix can agree to the remedy taken b) the same problem is unlikely to occur again in the future</p>
<p>If you mean to suggest that the solution I presented will be accepted under the condition that more information is added to the "OpenPBX by Voicetronix" page, I am happy to ask Voicetronix to edit the page following the Wikipedia guidelines for content. However, if I ask them to do so and the page is then deleted, that would only exacerbate the problem, so we will need to have a commitment that the page will not be deleted as long as it has balanced information about Voicetronix' OpenPBX software. Also, Wikipedia should allow a grace period. It is not always possible to have a refined detailed page right from the start. Most wikis entries evolve incrementally over time.</p>
<p>Please note that OpenPBX.org is a not-for-profit, vendor-independent, community driven open source project run solely by volunteers. We do not have a legal defense fund and it would be extremely unfair if we suffered harm because of Wikipedia's improper use of a trademark drawing unwelcome attention to a name conflict that could otherwise be managed. I expect Wikipedia to be helpful in such a way that our project suffers no harm.</p>
<p>thank you in advance for your assistance</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> OK, but so far you've said nothing that shows why <b>this</b> entry <i>doesn't</i> violate <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. If Voicetronix feels the need to take legal action against OpenPBX.org, then it should do so. I don't see where that is Wikipedia's concern, though, since OpenPBX.org has their webpage under that URL. Perhaps the better solution would be to add an entry to OpenPBX.org to clear up the ambiguity, if it can be cleared up without a lawsuit or an edit war. At any rate, a solution which creates an entry which isn't in coherence with Wikipedia policy doesn't seem to be a viable answer to me. (Sorry for not signing on first edit.)

<p><b>Why Wikipedia is involved</b></p>
<p>Wikipedia got itself involved the moment it started violating Voicetronix AU trademark. Let me try to explain this again ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia maintained a page called "OpenPBX"</li>
<li>this page described the project which is actually called OpenPBX.org</li>
<li>this action by Wikipedia legally counts as "passing off"</li>
<li>OpenPBX.org did not create this page</li>
<li>therefore OpenPBX.org was at no time passing off as OpenPBX</li>
<li>instead, Wikipedia was passing off OpenPBX.org as OpenPBX, which is illegal</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, Wikipedia has been in conflict with the law and we ask that Wikipedia provide a remedy.</p>
<p>In such cases a proper remedy is universally considered to require two elements:</p>
<p>1) the infringing party (Wikipedia) must stop infringing</p>
<p><b>and</b></p>
<p>2) the infringing party (Wikipedia) must ensure that no future violation will occur</p>
<p>If the references to Voicetronix were to be removed, this would not let Wikipedia off the hook, because if the OpenPBX page still refers to OpenPBX.org, then Wikipedia would still be using the name "OpenPBX" for referring to "OpenPBX.org", thus Wikipedia would still be passing off, Wikipedia would still be in violation of the law.</p>
<p>If the page OpenPBX was to be removed entirely, this would not constitute a remedy becaus there is no mechanism in place that will prevent a member of Wikipedia to make the same mistake again. In order to qualify as a remedy, Wikipedia would need to somehow lock the page title so that it is no longer possible to create a page with the title "OpenPBX" unless the party trying to create the page can show that they are legally entitled to do so.</p>
<p>Another (theoretical) remedy would be for Wikipedia to make sure that the OpenPBX page cannot be viewed in Australia.</p>
<p>Now, for those who still don't understand why Wikipedia is at fault here, let me try to give you an analogy:</p>
<p>You cannot sell Pepsi Cola in Coca Cola bottles in your pub. In that case, you (the pub manager/owner) are at fault. Pepsi Cola is not at fault. Both Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola are victims of your actions in such case. Both Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola are entitled to remedy. In such a case you cannot simply stop and say "Oh, sorry" to remedy. The claimants are entitled to a remedy designed to make sure you will not do it again (for example, by firing the pub manager).</p>
<p>Stswp</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Response to BJ</b> stating "OpenPBX" already exists as a disambiguation page.</p>
<p>The page is now a disambiguation page, because I modified it this way. However, in order to satisfy as a remedy, this page must show the different uses equally. Therefore, if the Voicetronix part of the remedy were to be removed as proposed by Wikipedia members, then it would no longer be a remedy. It would become an infringement again.</p>

<b>Wikipedia not above the law</b></p>
<p>A reminder for those Wikipedia members who seem to believe that Wikipedia rules somehow have higher priority than the law: You are mistaken. If you believe that proper legal remedy does not have to be provided because Wikipedia rules don't allow it: You are mistaken. Wikipedia is not above the law. If Wikipedia rules are such that they rule out proper remedy, then those rules are null and void because the law trumps Wikipedia rules. I suggest those Wikipedia members should treat the law with more respect. Thank you.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> First off, the OpenPBX trademark is not held in the U.S. where the English servers are hosted so Voicetronix has no legal recourse against the foundation. This doesn't really matter though, it is not Wikipedia editors jobs to deal with legal issues except for copyright infringement, if somebody has a legal issue they can contact Wikimedia Foundation who will take the needed action. Also I have no idea what laws you are talking about, it seems to be Australian laws but they don't apply here so I have no idea why this is an issue. <a href="../../../b/j/w/User%7EBjweeks_5dc7.html" title="User:Bjweeks">BJ</a><small><sup><a href="../../../b/j/w/User_talk%7EBjweeks_e86e.html" title="User talk:Bjweeks">Talk</a></sup></small> 09:22, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Like I said, one possible remedy would be to stop any page titled "OpenPBX" (without .org) pretending to be about something other than Voicetronix' OpenPBX from being served to viewers in Australia. The location of the servers matters not as trade agreements and other treaties between countries universally acknowlegde each others property rights including trademarks.</p>
<p>In any event, it is both puzzling and disheartening and to see that Wikipedia editors don't seem to have any interest in solving a problem which could be so easily solved, and apparently no interest in serving the public by providing information in a way that avoids confusion about two similarly named entities.</p>
<p>Stswp 10:25, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see no problem if the disambiguation page mentions both and the open source article stays at OpenPBX.org. There is no need to have an article on this. <a href="../../../b/j/w/User%7EBjweeks_5dc7.html" title="User:Bjweeks">BJ</a><small><sup><a href="../../../b/j/w/User_talk%7EBjweeks_e86e.html" title="User talk:Bjweeks">Talk</a></sup></small> 10:37, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is that if the page called "OpenPBX" discriminates in favour of OpenPBX.org, then it becomes a de-facto vehicle to use the name "OpenPBX" for referring to "OpenPBX.org", which is what the problem was with the page as it was. The only change would be a level of indirection. Indirection doesn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>As for "the open source article" I am not sure why you are making that distinction. Yes, our project (OpenPBX.org) is purely open source, vendor-independent, vendor-neutral. However, Voicetronix' OpenPBX software is also purely open source (there is no commercial license option) although it is not vendor-independent and thus not vendor-neutral.</p>
<p>If open-sourceness is a criterion, then their (Voicetronix) software should not be disqualified. If vendor-independence is a criterion, then Digium's Asterisk software (for which there is a page) should not qualify either. In fact, Asterisk is not even as purely open source as Voicetronix' OpenPBX is, because Asterisk is dual licensed.</p>
<p>Whatever the criterion for being a commercial product might be, it doesn't seem to be applied equally to all.</p>

<p>Please, type "OpenPBX Voicetronix" into Google and click over a few of the many pages which are returned. You will find that there are many articles about their OpenPBX software, in many languages, by publications/websites which are not affiliated with Voicetronix, amongst them the number-one resource on VoiP+Telephony "Voip-Info.org", an unrelated but significant Japanese VoIP info site "Voip-Info.jp", Linux Magazine, mailing lists, forums, blogs etc etc.</p>

<b>Legal observations to the above</b> by <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">user:FT2</a></p>
<p>First off, I would say that if there are multiple uses and referands for the term 'OpenPBX', then disambiguation either in the article, or via a separate disambiguation page, seems very reasonable. Likewise if one form of OpenPBX is closely tied to a given company such as Voicetronix, and other uses of the term are not, then titling that article "OpenPBX (software by Voicetronix)" is no different than titling another article "<a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo_%28Matrix_character%29_58d3.html" title="Neo (Matrix character)">Neo (Matrix character)</a>" or "<a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_%281986_film%29_4c0d.html" title="Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)">Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)</a>". So this issue should probably not have gotten this far.</p>
<p>However, there's a second side to it. People who claim legal issues where those legal issues are dubious, or simply act heavy handed, are inevitably going to not meet the best of receptions, and somewhere along the line that seems to have happened here too.</p>
<p>Wikipedia article titles are simply references, much like an index in a catalog. If "OpenPBX" is a reasonable term some people might look up openpbx.org under, then it has as much call to the article "OpenPBX" as a commercial product of the same name might have. There is unlikely to be any confusion because the articles do not attempt to claim that openpbx.org's work is the product by Voicetronix. <i>That</i> would be what passing off means. Passing off implies pretending that one thing is really something else, and there is no passing off here, nobody is being fooled or tricked by it. I'm sorry, but legally openPBX.org have as much right to be indexed under OpenPBX as any other user of that name. That an article is titled OpenPBX is not making a legal claim that they are the only people with an interest in the name OpenPBX.</p>
<p>As stated, any number of ordinary disambiguation remedies would solve this, as best I can tell.

<p><b>Response</b></p>
<p>As stated before, there is no dispute between OpenPBX.org and Voicetronix, instead there is an amicable agreement to manage the situation in the way that was applied to the voip+telephony information site at www.voip-info.org, that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a disambiguation page under the title "OpenPBX", that page treating both uses of the name equally</li>
<li>one specific distinguishable page for each use with a description of the specific software/project</li>
<li>the disambiguation page then referencing the specific pages equally and without prejudice</li>
</ul>
<p>A problem only arises because Wikipedia editors apparently want to discriminate against one project over the other. It is this discrimination that poses a problem.</p>

<dd>I actually agree with you, FT2. The argument of trademark and service dispute and lack of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, go hand in hand. Good disambiguation, however, doesn't solve the problem when two products in the same industry have the same name. Disambiguation only works when the same name is used for two or more uniquely different products or definitions - here OpenPBX refers to a PBX software solution that apparently two groups claim registration rights. Frankly, it points out a weakness in the notability requirement with both organizations that neither would defend their apparent claims of trademark or service mark rights. There have been no citations to support <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. voip-info.org is listed in the both article's external links, but this is a self-publishing wiki that allows companies to write information about themselves and others can comment.

<li>Normally I'm all in favor of deleting things as non-notable, but at this one I hesitate. It's been active for at least four years now (I think; seems like I've been playing it at least that long) and has a million logins (not users, but whatever). 1400 people are currently playing. (I am just throwing out stats that I see on the site right now.)

<li>Why do you highly doubt that the statistics reported by the website are accurate (e.g. number of registered accounts, number of games played, number of users online)? They're database queries, after all.

<li>I read through the first nine pages of google hits (after searching on "Flash Flash Revolution") and got a zillion links to the game, mirrors, and blogs, and virtually nothing written -about- the game.

<li><b><s>Keep</s> Strong keep.</b> Frustrating, yes, but as an administrator of the site, I must object. It'd be nice if we had a PR team behind the website getting us noticed in major tech blogs and news publications, but we don't. If someone doubts the number of users of our website, they can go to the forums<a href="http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/vbz/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/vbz/" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> and see the vast scope of the website for themselves. We have 76,000+ active users - a number greater than <a href="../../../d/d/r/DDR_Freak_a06f.html" title="DDR Freak">DDR Freak</a>'s total number of logins. According to Alexa <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=flashflashrevolution.com&amp;site1=ddrfreak.com&amp;site2=konami.com&amp;site3=&amp;site4=&amp;y=p&amp;z=1&amp;h=300&amp;w=500&amp;range=6m&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=flashflashrevolution.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=flashflashrevolution.com&amp;site1=ddrfreak.com&amp;site2=konami.com&amp;site3=&amp;site4=&amp;y=p&amp;z=1&amp;h=300&amp;w=500&amp;range=6m&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=flashflashrevolution.com" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, we get more pageviews than either DDR Freak or <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami.html" title="Konami">Konami</a>'s official website - yet those two articles are certainly notable. I can also share some behind-the-scenes server statistics: this past Friday alone, FFR was played 309,757 times. FFR is kind of a web anomaly - it's not very often that such a massive community is built around a flash game. Though primary sources may not be the best sources, I'd rather use the website as a source than delete or merge the article altogether. I'd say that <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">IAR</a> seems to be crying out to apply to articles about subjects that are exceptions to the rule, so I'd say it applies in this instance. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 17:29, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article seems rather crufty to me, but might be improved.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The author of this webcomic has asked that the readers revise the article, so it is constantly being improved and updated. The comic has a large following with a growing number of interested readers. Also - since other online webcomics from Keenspot have entries, this one should as well. I have been reading this comic for a little over a year and I have seen the transfer from ComicGenesis to Keenspot. Keenspot would not have invited Kel to host her comic on that server unless the comic had a large following.

<ul>
<li>It hasn't been accepted at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>; <a href="../../../k/e/e/Talk%7EKeenspot_8f48.html" title="Talk:Keenspot">Talk:Keenspot</a> is not a policy, or a guideline, or even a widely cited essay like <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 16:13, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> says, "Even if an entire website meets the notability criteria, its components (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article." In other words, even if a webcomic host is notable, each and every webcomic it hosts is not. Also, keep in mind that WP:WEB is only one guideline, and it should not be read in isolation in such a way that it contradicts official content policies like <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 18:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But number 3 in the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> clearly says that "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." And <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> is notable and indepedent of the creators of the comics that it publishes. Which makes all it's comics pass the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which should be enough to at least let the article remain for more than the week it has been up. So that it can be stub and be improved upon. TheAmazingTick 20:12, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Keenspot is not "well-known" outside of its subculture. Note that the idea that "Wikipedia should have articles on every Keenspot comic" didn't work on the first AfD for this webcomic, or on any of the many other previous Keenspot-related AfDs that have resulted in deletion, so it's unlikely to be effectiv ein this "do-over." Again, this is because we can't stretch the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline to the point that it lets us write about topics we personally feel are "notable" by resorting to original research, our own points of view, and other unreliable sources. As far as I can see, the only new information since the last AfD is that this comic was written about in the weekly student newspaper of a college with an enrollment of 2,200. This is not the type of multiple reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy that we, as an encyclopedia, require.

<li>The claim that this topic has had any great impact or is historically significant is not reliably sourced. That this article has already been deleted once would signify that such a claim is at best "contentious." Yes, I know that Keenspot has been written about in a few decent sources (I'm the one who added the two newspaper references to the Keenspot article). This does not make it generally well known outside of its subculture. For what it's worth, we've deleted articles on websites with much better sources and larger readership than Keenspot. This is getting really long. The basic idea here is that for encyclopedia articles we need sources that are at least as good as those we'd use for a junior high school research paper. We don't have those for this article. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 22:19, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states only ONE of its criteria must be met. This article meets the letter of the rules under criteria 3 by being published by Keenspot, even if the talk page on it isn't gospel yet, that's no arguement for deletion- the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does not say that notability has to be unanimous. While it needs to be improved and added to, historical significance (I don't see any claims to that?) and impact, claimed or otherwise, are <i>irrelevant</i> to the notability of this subject. It's fictional work published by a notable source independant of the author, therefore it is itself notable. Delete votes need to state clearly some reason why it's not meeting the third <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria. This shouldn't be an AfD until it's determined whether or not being hosted by Keenspot meets the notability requirement. (54x 21:39, 12 December 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I see no OR here but rather a well-written article about the historical devlopment of the concept of religious leadership in Islam.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs references and several sections need to be developed, and I agree that the concept of "Islamic leadership" should be better defined in the lead, but the subject seems encyclopedic and worthy of inclusion. - <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/o/User_talk%7EEronMain_52bf.html" title="User talk:EronMain">Talk</a></sup> 13:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>Tentative Keep</s> Stubify</b> Not well-written but seems to be an encyclopedic topic. To be a well-written encyclopedia article, the content needs to begin from reliable references, not whatever the editors know off the top of their head. Article currently almost entirely lacks references for what should be a topic much written about in external sources.

<dd>I must disagree.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not encyclopedic, not referenced, not verifiable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not OR, this is somewhat over-simplistic analysis that could be sourced ad infinitum, obviously having been debated by the various sects for centuries. There's surely a good deal more to say than this one line summaries; but I do not like to delete an article about a worthy topic because it is ill-written. The way to do it is not to stubify; they way to do it is to keep the outline and add sourced material. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 06:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Most wiki articles read like "rambling essays." This article is not related to the other article of a similar name, other than that the two articles both describe organizations within buildings that have had a historical and artistic impact (whether one thinks it good or bad) on their communities. It doesn't recommend the reader to adopt their policies and practices, but because of the radicalism they appear to identify with, I think alarms are sounded in the more moderate editors before the article is taken into perspective. My suggestion is that the article cite the impact of the co-op on local event and its appearance in media, documentaries and fiction. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeamZissou_eaeb.html" title="User:TeamZissou">TeamZissou</a> 04:55, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If that qualifies as notability then pretty much everyone in the world could have a wiki page, he is listed as having a job, so what its not notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> So what does it take to qualify as notable for some people. Hits on google are apparently the be all end all notability solution. They guy works on a large radio show, on TV. Thousands know who he is. Wiki's not paper. Every tom dick and harry who has been on TV has a page. As they should. Well he's one.--<a href="../../../x/i/a/User%7EXiahou_4cc2.html" title="User:Xiahou">Xiahou</a> 00:38, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are you for really? he works on a "show" that is piped out of 200 Spar shops in Ireland - no one knows who he is, its a totally unreferenced autobiog. <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 00:45, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>so whats the magic number qualifier to achieve this status of "notability" then? --<a href="../../../x/i/a/User%7EXiahou_4cc2.html" title="User:Xiahou">Xiahou</a> 03:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no number - they guy is just not notable. Google is just a good start to see if there is any notability. When you say he has been on TV - he hasn't - its an autobiography - Please note the language he uses - he states he has "contributed to many shows" - what does that mean, he could have just made tea, photocopied, what? "contributed to a number of well known newspaper publications" - no reference to any of these again and I could find anything on the net either. "working for the famous Radio and TV personality Bruno Brookes" - again doing what, cutting his lawn? again no reference to anything like this on the net! "Stations previously worked on include" again didn't state what he did there, I have spoken to people at two of the stations that he listed and they state he was never a presenter there, so what was he doing, photcopying again, fixing the mcis?! "Also appeared on the Irish Current Affairs Show Prime Time" - please not the word "appeared" - this is Irelands version of Question Time on BBC1 - he never appeared on the panel, so either he is lying or sat in the audience (which is not a notable) and then he states he was an extra on a soap opera - thats almost laughable. Its an autobiography and a vanity page in my opinion. Also noting that is stated can be verified! <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 13:05, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Notability in doubt. Poorly sourced (there is but one source that describes the term in its featured use). Seems like a personal opinion. Full of self references. May be a candidate for Wiktionary. No enough substance. Doesn't fit into existing universe of aricles on soccer. In short, a very starnge article on a very strange topic written in a starnge tone. <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 13:22, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Several reasons here. Firstly, large chunks of it read like original research - someone's personal essay - particularly the Shia section. This violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. That particular section is also completely unreferenced: see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Much of the article is heavily POV: take sentences such as "Shi'a reject this view with multiple arguments especially since there is absolutely no evidence in the Qur'an of any such immunity with regards to all the companions of Muhammad nor the sub companion groups who followed later in history as being infallible and free from sin", and furthermore "Did not the archers leave their stations to collect the booty and allowed Khalid Bin Walid to advance onto the Muslim Army from the rear? So can these greedy people who disobeyed the Prophet be considered as pious? Disobedience of the Prophet is disobedience of Allah!". Not only is this POV but the tone is completely unencyclopaedic. Lastly, I would also question this term's notability. It only gets 100 ghits, most of which seem to be Wikipedia and various mirrors such as Answers. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> 13:43, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Page was deleted on 5 December after nomination on grounds of "biographical article on an unreleased book, failed on criteria for notability for people or for book". Page was recreated 7 December, and edited through 8 December, but without addresing the original reasons for delete, i.e. book is still unpublished and author is no more notable now than she was four days ago. Quotes about the book from celebrities are irrelevant - the book has still not been published - and serve to make this more of an advert than it was previously. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 15:13, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Reluctant</s> Delete.</b> - <s>I'm torn.</s> I don't think that the tour to Korea gives them the notability they need (a lot of college a cappella groups do international trips these days).

<p>I proded the article before realizing that it had already been proded with the tag being removed by the article's creator. In fact it was also tagged for speedy deletion but that was also removed by the creator. Wihtout any explanations of course... In any case, original research. The idea that inline hockey was invented in Missouri in 1990 is at best dubious. No sign of any third-party reliable sources. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 15:48, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep/Delete</b>. After much though on the subject, I'm indifferent on the decision and could go either way. I would prefer the world to not remember me for things I've worked on from as early as 15 years old, and things I've created as a source of entertainment for others while it's a creative outlet for me resulting in "dildo humor" and the likes. However I still know the impact it has made on the internet, the readers, and multiple communities. However wikipedia does not need to have a page to remind people about it. People won't forget about all the enjoyment they had from it if this page is deleted. As creator of the comic, I put trust in whatever final decision is given. --Joshmirman 02:45, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Binhead is a game that I'm pretty sure has been in exsistance for many years either as a drinking game or a smoking game (going by various names as mentioned in the article) We did not invent this game as with many drinking games (lots of which have wikipedia articles) the actual origin of the game is lost. I agree the article my contain serveral references to a specific groups of people in Manchester and London, however this is not suprising as they wrote the article.

<p>I am gathering some more references for the article now. I have already found many more references to Binhead, Drop the Dime and The Rizla Game from a variety of websites Ginjarium 18:07, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This isn't the first time that this article has been put up for deletion I don't deny that, the article was upheld then because it is a well known drinking/smoking game. To be honest I don't see the problem with letting the binhead livejournal community know about this discussion as they are people from all over the world who play binhead and can probably defend this article far better than I (also to let the original article writers know the article is being discussed). Anyway the community post has been made private as it bares no relavance to this duscussion other than informing the community. Ginjarium 19:08, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Your arguments put forward for the deletion of this article, as you summarised are that wikipedia is not for things invented by a group of friends in manchester. I have to concure with you on that point. The issue I would like to raise is that it was not invented by a group of friends in manchetser. It was given a distictive name "binhead", and as stated in the article is known by many other names.</p>
<p>You feature a large number of drinking games on wikipedia, yet a quick search turns up no smoking games. Yet the third hit on google for a search on smmoking and games turns up:</p>

If it doesn't meet Uncle Wiki's requirements for Reliable Sources, then I suggest rewriting them. It's highly regarded in the metal community. And mallcore wasn't made up in school, it was made up on a website (metal-rules if I'm not mistaken) several years ago.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> The article may need a lot of clean up, but I the term is sufficienty used and important to have its own article. The term is used a lot between extreme metal fans, and it is commonly used on <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> (certain bands even have it as a genre!). The term Mallcore does not only apply to Nu-Metal bands, but also to bands belonging to other metal subgenres, so I think that "a sentence on the Nu-Metal article" would be not right. The term is not synonymous with Nu Metal, although many nu-metal bands are labeled as mallcore by some metal fans.

<li><b>Comment</b> Again, the logic behind this proposal is completely ridiculous. "Mallcore kid" is used in the same sense as "newbie" on other websites, and is only used for a little while, until the user accumulates a certain number of posts or points. Also, a search for "mallcore" as a music genre only turns up 16 bands out of the almost 43,000 bands on the website. That hardly qualifies <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> as a "mallcore site." Deathrocker is just trying to associate <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> with a derogatory term.

As such, Google will index many pages from the site, including user comments in reviews, profiles or on the forum, which in no way demonstrate that Encyclopaeda Metallum is a mallcore-related site. There is no logical link between those Google search results and the definition of mallcore. And as others pointed out, using similar logic, we should redirect <b>mallcore</b> to the Slipknot article instead, or perhaps we could redirect the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_Metal_b381.html" title="Heavy Metal">Heavy Metal</a> article to the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> article since Google hits for the keyword "heavy metal" are far more tremendous <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22encyclopaedia+metallum%22+%22heavy+metal%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22encyclopaedia+metallum%22+%22heavy+metal%22" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> The biggest problem with the term can be seen on this very page. Ours18 saying stuff like nu-metal isn't metal and thus uses the term as its "correct" name doesn't jive with another person who believes it to be synonymous with any mainstream "metal" band. An article for a purely derogatory term doesn't need its own article in this instance and can be relegated to the nu metal page. And what band would seriously call themselves mallcore? What would be the use in labelling yourself mallcore? The whole thing reeks of elitism. If you don't like nu metal and want to call it mallcore fine, but coming up with a better name for nu metal other than mallcore may bring more awareness to nu metal not being metal.Outlaw-Viper 10:42, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There's already far too much overclassification of bands going on in the nu-metal genre, and this is just encouraging it. There's only so much derogatory beating of a dead horse you can do until it gets old. The sound of nu metal is clearly cut from the same cloth as the most popular (though <i>not</i> the most hardcore) styles of metal. The popular definition of nu metal being metal completely fits. - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStick_Fig_43b2.html" title="User:Stick Fig">Stick Fig</a> 19:22, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I propose that the article be re-written from A to Z and that peaceful discussion may lead to a more positive change for the fate of this article.

<li>Let me expand the non-notability argument. When I stumbled across the article, I thought I'd like to stop by and see the garden, so I asked an actual NMSU professor-emeritus where it was. <i>Neither he nor anyone in his family had never heard of it</i>; he asked an actual NMSU plant biologist, and the plant biologist apparently had to ask around. Perhaps it was the equivalent of the "Rich O. Alumnus Memorial Shrub Grouping" and the "Class of 1937 Dogwood" you find in odd corners of every college campus. Only with cacti. I hope they transplanted the collection when they de-memorialized it. Alas, now we can only speculate about the glories of the garden that once was: "In addition to over 100,000 <i>Lithops sp.</i> planted personally by Louise Bourgeois, the A.R. Leding Cactus Garden had only a single cactus, a 1000-foot-tall saguaro which Norse myths say held up the sky. Its hollow, poisonous spines exude drops of liquid gold which fall to the ground and are called as "Pele's Tears"; the shamans of the Chaco Canyon culture used this fibrous material to line nests in holes in the saguaro's trunk, where (unlike the distantly-related echidnas) they gave birth to live young. The saguaro was eaten by vagabonds in 2005 and was replaced by the John Q. Endowment Memorial Cloud Forest, which evaporated in early 2006. (this article does not cite sources.)

<dd>I could have sworn there was no "this" in his question. Sadly, I am not perfect, but I am capable of admitting when I am wrong. It is relevant because a significant number of people researching Haley <b>Starshine might also research her cryptograms, which are an integral part of her character.

<dd>The fact that she's currently been afflicted with a temporary condition that causes her to speak in cryptograms has no bearing of any kind on the nature of her character. She's the same person with the malady as without it. At most, once cured, the affliction will be a minor side-note to her character history. And precise repetition of dialogue is rarely important when assessing character<b>. Have a look through articles on real people here; they all manage to describe their character without frequent reference to dialogue, so to suggest that a fictional character cannot be described properly without it is hardly reasonable. --<a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETailkinker_2d3a.html" title="User:Tailkinker">Tailkinker</a> 18:34, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</b>

<dd>I disagree. If you can't understand half of her total dialogue, you are doomed to not understand her character very well.

<dd>Actually, that's not a straw man, that's an analogy. You might like to look those concepts up.

<dd>The relevant facts are this; you looked at the article, and unilaterally decided that it was not worthy of being wikified, before doing any number of milder and more constructive actions.

Unless you want to argue that OOTS is not sufficiently notable to warrant inclusion at all, I don't see anything that justifies the exclusion of this list. As a Web comic with a substantial fanbase, OOTS is an appropriate topic for the Wikipedia, as is a description of its major characters. A notable feature of the major character Haley is her ability to speak only in crytograms. A thorough description of her character would not be complete without this information. We spent substantial time gathering this information and linking to the appropriate comics. Many other media-related topics include lists of similar standing within their topic. It's not sufficient to link to a forum post with similar information. A forum post is not the Wikipedia, it cannot be maintained, corrected or updated. -- Random non-registered user</li>

<dl>
<dd>The suggestion that one cannot describe Haley's character without providing translations for her speech is hard to justify. Take a look at any biographical article for a fictional character. Most of them provide a more than adequate description of that character's personality without repeated use of quotes. Haley's own article covers her personality in reasonable depth, despite no quotes being present at all. A few links to specific strips from the webcomic provide a perfectly acceptable number of illustrations of her personality and how she tends to react to things. If you wished to add a couple of illustrative quotes to her own article, I would consider that entirely reasonable. However, the indiscriminate quoting on the translations page goes way over the top. Very little of it gives any insight into her character that can not be gained far more easily by simply reading the appropriate section of her character page. Her ability to speak only in cryptograms is a significant feature of her character at the moment, yes, and should be mentioned (and, indeed, is mentioned), but a translation of every word she says is utterly unnecessary. --<a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETailkinker_2d3a.html" title="User:Tailkinker">Tailkinker</a> 15:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not a list of just any quotes. This is a list of translations of dialogue spoken by the character of Haley as crytograms. In the context of the character and the comic, this list is appropriate in a way that a list of quotes from other characters in other media may not be. Within its milieu, this list carries a similar significant to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_guest_stars_on_The_Simpsons_0044.html" title="List of guest stars on The Simpsons">List of guest stars on The Simpsons</a> or the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Category%7EMagic%7E_The_Gathering_characters_adca.html" title="Category:Magic: The Gathering characters">list of Magic: The Gathering characters</a>. Given the volume of material devoted to OOTS, the inclusion of this list is appropriate. Translations for these cryptograms represent key background material that newcomers to the comic require and that regular readers frquently reference. Acting as reference material is a central function of an encyclopedia. OOTS is sufficiently notable to be included in the Wikipedia. Once we've established that the topic satisfies that criteria, the decision to retain or delete a particular article must be guided by the topic itself. -- Same random non-registered user</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but I'm forced to disagree. This is just a list of quotes, nothing more. Whether they were originally in cryptogram form or not, they're just quotes by a character. Readers of the comic, both new and old, can easily find translations simply by referencing the forums attached to the site itself, something that they would, in all probability, turn to before referring to Wikipedia. The Order of the Stick, no matter how much we might personally appreciate it, is, when it comes down to it, a webcomic and is thus of relatively minor interest, comparatively speaking, to shows like The Simpsons, or games like Magic: The Gathering. The two lists that you cite both have uses that are greater than their basic content - the list of Simpsons guest stars can provide links to the article for the actor or actress in question, for example. Likewise, the list of Magic characters provides links to the relevant articles, where those characters are described. This list of quotes has no such additional use. In all seriousness, take a look around Wikipedia, look at films, TV shows and the suchlike. You won't find very many lists of quotes for them. Even something as popular as the Simpsons doesn't have a page of quotes on Wikipedia. Nor do foreign language shows, where translation would undoubtedly be useful. WikiQuotes does have things like that, but even they do not indiscriminately quote in the manner that's provided here. If shows, films and items from other medias with far greater popularity than the Order of the Stick do not have lists of this nature, then there can be no possible justification for including one for the Order. If you wished to contribute a selection of character quotes to WikiQuotes, or even include a couple on each character page to illustrate their attitude and personality, you would find me to be wholeheartedly in agreement - I can certainly think of some that would work well - but this degree of indiscriminate quoting is inappropriate. --<a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETailkinker_2d3a.html" title="User:Tailkinker">Tailkinker</a> 20:43, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I appreciate the time you're taking to discuss this matter with me. I think the "minor interest" (i.e fancruft) aspect of the topic is really at the heart of the concerns that I'm reading from yourself and others. Right now, the Wikipedia has at least eleven articles devoted to OOTs. Is this too many? Are we debating whether OOTs is significant enough for the Wikipedia to include substantial material, or are we debating whether or not this article is of encyclopedic character with respect to OOTs?

<li><b>keep</b> Lothlorien is a recognizable landmark in Madison. The name of the house is commonly recognized among UW-Madison students. The house has a unique culture, exterior &amp; interior design, was one of the first building on lakelawn district of Lake Mendota. Also, it has a unique place within the vibrant Madison political history. Furthermore, Lothlorien isn't student housing. The house is clearly notable and the page should be kept. Ditto whats been said above. Lothlorien is also the home of Madison Food Not Bombs.<small>— 70.226.153.177 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.226.153.177_302d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.226.153.177">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> In addition to the above, I would add that there is nothing in the article which reads as an advertisement, unless one chooses to interpret it that way. Even the first line under GOVERNMENT, "Lothlórien's Elven Council meets once a week on alternating Sundays and Mondays," is much more description-of-procedure than ad. That was the original complaint. As far as notability is concerned, a significant attempt has been made to site evidence: Lothlórien in Madison Museum of Contemporary Arts, food not bombs at Lothlórien, Lothlórien in Channel 3000, Lothlórien in Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Lothlórien in Fighting Bob, Aragorn visits Lothlórien, Alec Soth on Lothlórien, Lothlórien in Capital Times. The only improvement I can think of which might add weight to the argument for keeping this page is to consider including some of these sources in the made article. For example the Food Not Bombs connection could be mentioned under "Food." --Molybdenumtop 14:10, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think the article could be better, but the issue is not whether the article is good but whether a good article could be written. the case could certainly be made for Lothlorien- there are certainly sources, although their inclusion is rather haphazard at this moment in time, and, even if individual co-ops generally speaking aren't considered notable enough to be included in wikipedia, lothlorien is certainly one of the more well-known co-ops in the madison area and beyond and is likely to be a topic of interest to those who wish to know about co-ops in general and lothlorien in particular. <a href="../../../a/c/o/User%7EAcornwithwings_66ac.html" title="User:Acornwithwings">Acornwithwings</a> 18:30, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and rewrite. I agree that the article is in terrible shape and is of no academic value right now. I created the article (split off as mentioned above) because I feel that it's important to have legitimate academic information about racial stereotyping available in an encyclopedia, and I still stand by that. I don't feel that the "no one can be the authority on what stereotypes are notable" arguments are valid because there's tons of research and scholarly work done in these areas. However, on the other hand, it doesn't seem that there are any experts on this topic spearheading the rewrite for this article. The article is doing more harm than good at the moment by spreading wrong information so I agree that deletion is a viable option until an expert comes along and re-creates it; but a better option, if someone informed in this area was willing to take on the task, would be to rewrite. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 01:19, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>and improve if needed, and we should get the one on Jews back. The POV is not in the article--the article is intended to be, and is, a neutral description of real-world prejudice. It's not adequate to the subject, for there is clearly a lot more to be said, but it is indeed difficult to find neutral language in which to say it or people willing to add it when it is subject to actions such as this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the POV is in the choice to delete the articles which arouse the strongest feelings in the most people. That is against the spirit of a neutral encyclopedia, which treats all ethnic groups equally. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 07:10, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - mildy sourced, in principle highly encyclopaedic (albeit the actual article needs work). The article does need a lot of real work, but the concept is workable, and there's at least one source - it seems inappropriate to delete. I understand that some people may not like that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, but she ain't. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:49, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. These stereotype article are a minefield of POV and OR. They serve to reinforce rather undermine the stereotypes they cover. Ultimately all groups have been sterotyped at some point- women, black people, Asian people, the Irish, gay people etc. Must all have an article? In fact none of these stereotypes is notable enough to have its own article- all are based on some irrational prejudice. Their content should either be in general articles about prejudice/oppression of particular groups or as examples in the article <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes.html" title="Stereotypes">Stereotypes</a>. - <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 00:01, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A stereotype article should seek to <b>neither</b> reinforce nor undermine the stereotype. Stereotypes are documentable and where verifiable are encyclopaedic, as long as they're documented as stereotypes (i.e. of unknown/irrelevent truth for their importance as a stereotype). As much as I hate to say it, your argument here flies in the face of everything Wikipedia stands for and runs counter to several policies, such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The "moral value" of content is entirely irrelevent (or at least, that's what we're supposed to be aiming for). The <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> article doesn't come with a disclaimer saying <i>You probably shouldn't do this</i> nor do we delete the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> article on the grounds that someone might read it and be duped into believing it. That's not the purpose of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:02, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You misunderstand me. I do not mean that this topic should not be covered on Wikipedia. However IMH opinion the correct place for the coverage is at discussions of <b>racism</b> or <b>discrimination</b>. Steeotyping is a minor instance of such occurances and is not sufficiently <i>notable</i> per se for seperate topics on every group that has been stereotyped. I agree that Wikipedia is not censored and have no problem with that policy. - <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 14:11, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Edit the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> article and you'll see a little reminder <i>Note: This page is 63 kilobytes long. It may be appropriate to split this article into smaller, more specific articles.</i> This article doesn't have an appropriate merge target as far as I can see. And your statement <i>They serve to reinforce rather undermine the stereotypes they cover</i> is mostly what I'm taking exception to. The <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">stereotype</a> article shoudl already cover what relation, if any, exists between stereotypes and truth. Specific examples deserve their own article all the time - for example, I don't think anyone would say <i>Why do we have an article on <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>? There's already an article on <a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">City</a> - isn't that enough?</i> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:21, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Stereotyping is not just a minor manifestation of racism, and I believe it is notable enough to warrant independent articles. Writing about all the stereotypes under the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> article would make it way too long; if you look at previous versions of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_08be.html" title="Ethnic stereotypes in American media">Ethnic stereotypes in American media</a>, you'll see that even when we had a page devoted to just stereotypes, it was still too long. There are entire books written about racial stereotyping; a subsection/mention in a general article about <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> would hardly be sufficient. Although it may appear from many of the above off-shoot articles that there isn't enough substantial content to warrant independent articles, this is not the case. The content exists, but just hasn't been written up and put into the articles. See <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_Asians_417e.html" title="Stereotypes of Asians">Stereotypes of Asians</a> for an example of a stand-alone article with a substantial amount of content. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 23:00, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are many reasons why someone would be interested in reading up on Nottingham Co-op on wikipedia. not only are affordable independent housing co-ops which are open to people of all occupations a dying breed, but this one in particular is a unique music venue in that it takes no money and is also a residence, and yet has managed to stage a fair few quite notable bands (many with wikipedia pages, as is demonstrated on the page) . nottingham has been featured on the front page of a local weekly just for that reason. it has had a particular influence on the culture of madison and on the co-op movement. nottingham is at least as influential as many things that do not get targeted for deletion, such as shopping malls, local sports teams and the madison museum of bathroom tissue. <a href="../../../a/c/o/User%7EAcornwithwings_66ac.html" title="User:Acornwithwings">Acornwithwings</a> 20:37, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> if for no other reason than that it's history as a independent and non-for-profit music (as well as other events) venue. What sets this particular house apart is its hosting of well-known (infamous to actually famous) bands (such as Husker Du, Bikini Kill and Eugene Chadbourne) over the years, and not for monetary interests, as 99% of other venues they'd play would. This, I think, is a notable rarity: a community of people hosting truly independent shows just for the sake of having them, just because they can. --Molybdenumtop 15:08, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The notability of Nottingham as a venue has implications that may not be obvious at first--as an intentional link between Minneapolis and Chicago, making it worth the while of smaller touring bands to make the crossing. Has it succeeded in doing so in a way that could be readily documented--perhaps not in a way that could be immediately documented--but I suppose if proof had to be built it could be--the idea itself, though is intuitively obvious 0once the question is asked. Yet I think that Nottingham is notable for reasons beyond this--looking at the general or theoretical pages about Co-operatives get the reader only so far--there need to be real and individual examples, not only of co-ops which have made it but even some of the notable failures. Look at this question from the viewpoint of someone who doesn’t know much who wants to know more--it seems to me that Nottingham’s' site, for example, and the other sites under consideration for deletion, greatly fill out what the less-knowledgeable reader can know. It seems to me that this especially fits into Wikipedia's mission, that it evolves, that pages can be added that fit the examples of the living world--what is the real difference between Wikipedia and a paper encyclopedia if it has to wait for things to be come very popularly known or very thoroughly covered by historians (often long after the subject has passed on from the world?) Could someone come to Wikipedia, get interested in the theory, and then log off and Google-up many of these eco-operatives and learn that way?--sure. That now means that a generic google has become more informative on this particular topic than Wikipedia. As many co-op websites have sections of co-op theory (and many more will) Wikipedia, not the Co-ops themselves stands to lose notability--that is to say relevance--on this topic. Yet because Wikipedia does have a certain format (I honestly have enough doubts right now to be sure if it has viable standards) it can shape the information in a way useful to the researcher--and should I say in a way useful to the discoverer? It would e a pity if Co-ops had to provide their own Google-notability absent from Wikipedia. Indeed, this is why I often have questions about what has been deleted or edited-out in other areas--part of the point of an encyclopedia is to allow less--known things to be found--and part of the reason for a hyperlink encyclopedia is to allow this to happen because unexpected connections are noted and their follow-through made convenient. The co-op web-pages are just starting out in that regard, I think. One day (if they are not deleted) the role of housing co-ops as rather early LGBT-embracing (or at least safe) spaces, will be added, with links to personal pages in that regard, as at least some Alumni become notable (or noted, I should say) in their own right. Finally, one reason why individual co-ops might not seem relevant is that right now, not very many people actually live in co-ops, a greater number shop at them, and a number of people who don't suspect it buy from the large ones (like Ocean Spray) all the time--there's one of the connections that might be explored by a discoverer BTW--does the fact that co-oping is a smaller movement meant that it is not notable as a whole? I hope not--I hope that people might be able to not only discover, but get involved--and again, having Wikipedia pages about the history etc. of real live, local and particular examples show the point. I am, in summary, confident that the links and the content, the broader signs of an existent notability, will show themselves in time--it seems like it would be a waste to have to do the work of the sites themselves from scratch only after a slam-dunk case had already been established.

<dd><b>Comment</b> To clarify why this is a bad faith nomination: The nominator edited this article, and saw no reason to recommend its deletion last week. Previously he had systematically nominated for deletion multiple articles in the Japanese adult actress category. When his efforts to erase that category began failing, he stopped for a few months. Now that he is again trying to have articles in that category deleted, starting with <a href="../../../h/i/k/Hikari_Hino_4713.html" title="Hikari Hino">Hikari Hino</a>, his editing hypocrisy at this article was pointed out. He then retaliated by nominating this article for deletion. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 22:39, 9 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I "saw no reason to recommend its deletion" then because I was only mass categorising actors/actresses that day. If you check my contrib history on the same day, you'll see that I put the same category on 10 other actors/actresses. I apologise if it did not occur to me, while editing with the intent of categorising articles, to nominate articles for deletion if they ought to be nominated. I'll try to do a better job next time. And please assume good faith. If you believe this article ought to be kept, please actually make an argument to show that she is notable under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 23:59, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Notice that <i>films</i> and <i>productions</i> are in plural.

No redirect, because there are a ton of Helen Kims out there; there is a chance there is a H.Kim out there who has or soon will have notability. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 00:58, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

That doesn't pass muster for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and redirecting to Kill Bill would be confusing for anybody searching on Helen Kim as it would nto be at all obvious why the redirect occured.

Does an artistic work of no known merit get an article because the author won a couple of awards for other works later?

<p><b>Don't Delete</b> I was very disappointed to receive this nomination for deletion mere hours after submitting my first entry to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Your grounds for deletion rest on the following observations:</p>
<p>1. It is a "Non-notable student society: the University of Cambridge has scores of societies of equal or greater stature"</p>
<p>2. Talk page says "Welcome to the Wiki for Cambridge University Automobile Club" contradicting <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a webspace provider</a></p>
<p>Let me address these now:</p>
<p>1. I would certainly contest the claim that CUAC is a 'non-notable' student society. Founded in 1902 it is the second oldest Automobile Club in Great Britain. Part of the purpose of beginning a Wiki for CUAC was an endeavour to assemble the early history of a club that played an important role in British motor sport.</p>
<p>I understand that several prominent racing drivers of the early 20th Century were CUAC members, such as Dick Seaman and Archie Scott-Thomas. I will add reference to this in the Wiki once I have obtain material to support this information that meets Wikipedia's criteria for citing sources.</p>
<p>One historical fact that I have been able to verify concerns CUAC's role in re-starting motor sport in Britain post-WWII when it organised the first motor race in Great Britain after the end of the war. On those grounds alone CUAC merits an inclusion in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>2. That specific phrase in the Talk Page had been deleted. CUAC has its own web site and the Wiki is not an attempt to duplicate that. (Incidentally, if you look at the rest of the remarks in the Talk Page you will see that there are nurmerous avenues of historical investigation that are being pursued to develop the Wiki in line with point one.)</p>

<li>If this society has a long and interesting history, the article should focus on <i>that</i>, which is now given a mere four lines, and it should be based at least in part on published sources independent of the society, to show that its activities have attracted outside interest. The names of the current office-holders are not really of interest to anyone, except, possibly, the current members, and should be removed. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Upp◦land</a> 08:54, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with Uppland. If the article were rewritten to remove the list of office holders and details of regular meetings, and instead describe the society's history using <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">independent sources</a> as much as possible, I for one would be happy to keep it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I notice that you keep saying "a Wiki for CUAC". This is not a wiki for CUAC: this is an encyclopaedia. I think this is the core of the problem. If you were to rewrite it as an encyclopaedia article, not as if it were a home page or a societies' fair flyer, I think people would be happy to keep it.</dd>

<ul>
<li>I think this article (and by extension myself) are being treated unnecessarily harshly. The piece is factually based, corroborated and there is a stack of links in the discussion section that show that I fully intend to expand on the history of the club (which I have now moved to the top of the article). Given the state of many other articles I've seen on Wikipedia I never thought for one second that this would get such a poor reception.</li>

<p>I don't know where you assume the authority to make comments like "The names of the current office-holders are not really of interest to anyone" when we're talking about a club that is over one hundreds years old and in that time would have had a large number of members who, I would hope, through Wikipedia, could help add to this article and form a detailed history of the club.</p>
<p>You tell me to "rewrite it as an encyclopaedia article". It is written as an encyclopaedia article - it's straight, factual and not opinionated.</p>
<p>If you want to delete it, fine, delete it, and I won't bother contributing to any Wikipedia articles any more. But I think using a few pedantic niggles as grounds for deletion is over the top. Fasterthansound 10:47, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, we are not being unfair. I have not recommended deletion of this article (look at other <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Articles for deletion</a> discussions, where you will see people beginning their statements with a bold-faced "delete"), as I can easily imagine that the topic has potential. But stressing the age as a significant aspect of the notability, while saying almost nothing about that history, seems paradoxical. Do you really think the names of the current treasurer or webmaster should be a significant part of an article on a society that is over a century old? Are they more important to the society than, say, the so-far unnamed people who took the initiative to found the Club back in 1902? <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Upp◦land</a> 11:19, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No they aren't and plainly I am not making that case. As I have said so above I fully intend to expand on the history section but finding detailed material to back it all up with (in line with Wikipedia citations standards) is not easy. Hence the material in the Discussions section and the appeal for more information. But all you seem to be interested in regarding that is that I committed the heinous semantic crime of using the phrase "a Wiki for CUAC".</dd>

<dd>You are a newbie and excused for not understanding the intricacies of Wikipedia. Unless you are writing on something where the significance is obvious to the average Wikipedia editor (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a>, whatever), you really have to be paranoid about someone nominating the page for deletion and forestall that already when you create an article. You need to think about it from the point of view of a skeptical outsider with no prior knowledge of your particular topic or its importance. I would suggest that you restart this page in your userspace (as a subpage of your userpage, like this: User:Fasterthansound/CUAC) and work on it at your leisure until it is ready to be reposted. If the nominator agrees, the article could be moved there (in Wikipedia jargon that is called "userfying"). It may still get deleted at some point in the future if it is kept around as-is and not improved, but you will get plenty of time to work on it before that happens.</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>. I've changed my mind. You've persuaded me that this club is notable. But I strongly urge you to rewrite the article along the lines Uppland and I have been suggesting. Talk more about the history of the club and some of its famous previous members: the article itself must make clear why the club is not just another student society, or it's likely to get nominated for deletion by someone else.</p>
<p>I don't know how to withdraw this nomination, or even whether it can be closed before a certain time has passed, so I'll wait for an admin to do that.</p>

<li><b>Keep(For Now)</b> Rated-RKO is in a very active state. The article can only be built up. If it is a good enough article when finished then that would be okay. There are problems with the article which I removed. The problem at current is putting Lita down as winning the Woman's championship as Rated-RKO. This would be incorrect, because an alliance or stable helps each other out. Lita had no help or was either escorted to her match. If the article continues to be built around bad data then it will end up being prone to removal. So as long as Rated-RKO stays clean and correct I see nothing wrong with it. <a href="../../../g/o/v/User%7EGovvy_b92c.html" title="User:Govvy">Govvy</a> 01:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> He did it only to justify deleting Christian and Tyson Tomko because I mentioned it's only been two months for Rated RKO whereas that combination had been done for years, is still strong now, and proven notable during its time. And as for Govvy's statement about Lita winning the Women's title being bad data: Orton didn't get help from Evolution when he won the world championship. Yet as far as all parties are concerned, he won the title as a member of Evolution. He didn't stop being a member til after they destroyed him, remember? So Lita being Women's Champion as Rated-RKO's valet is not bad data. As far as I'm concerned, keep Christian and Tomko, keep Rated-RKO, and keep Lita's title reign as part of Rated-RKO.</li>

<li>Actually, I did it because in my opinion a two-month old tag team is not notable enough for a Wikipedia article, which is exactly what I said in nominating the article. I'm getting really sick of editors over the last couple of days failing to assume good faith on my part. Regardless of whether there's an article on Christian and Tyson Tomko, it remains my opinion that there should not be one on this tag team. If enough people disagree that consensus is established to keep this or any other article, so be it.

<li>Flair and Piper were thrown together and have absolutely no recognition as a true tag team. Rated-RKO was allied together with a singular purpose, and their gimmicks - while already similar in nature - were put into a noticeably more unified stance after they banded together. Based on that alone, Rated-RKO is a definite keep unless they suddenly break up out of nowhwere and lose the tag titles. Yes, they are a two-month-old tag team, but they are the it team on the scene right now on RAW, and general consensus is they will last considerably longer than two months. 172.149.224.143 00:00, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My point exactly.

<li>However, what determines whether tag team champions are transitional? We may have thought that Flair and Piper were transitional, and with enough time we can determine they were transitional champions (time being relative here, as I think it's fairly safe to say they ended up being just transitional champions), but can we really make that judgment now about Rated-RKO? There's arguments for and against it. I would say don't be quick to make pages about a tag team that's held championships just because they seem to not be transitional champions. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnakinjmt_7c04.html" title="User:Anakinjmt">Anakinjmt</a> 06:12, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>We can judge now that they won't be transitional champions because it looks like they will be a part of one of the best tag team divisions Raw has had since Edge and Christian, the Hardy Boyz, and the Dudleys. With DX, the Hardy Boyz, Rated-RKO, and maybe MNM, it is fair to judge that there will soon be a tag team revival on Raw, and the current tag team champions will be a part of it. The stage is perfectly set for Rated-RKO to become one part of a resurrected tag team division, and at this particular time it would be unwise to delete this article. If it turns out that I am wrong, then there is nothing stopping another afd, but right now this article meets the standards of Wikipedia. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">T</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">H</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">L</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_The_Hybrid_1835.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/The Hybrid"><font color="purple">R</font></a></b> 22:05, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Personally, it doesn't matter to me if the page survives on its own. I think it can for as long as Rated-RKO remains a team, which judged on their heat right now, I would guess it will last at least till Wrestlemania. And, just another comment on Edge and Randy Orton as individuals, forming Rated-RKO seemed like a good idea. Edge needed to get out of the WWE title picture for a while, and Randy Orton really didn't have anything good going on at the moment (as far as I'm considered, putting Carlito in a feud with Randy Orton was lack of use of Orton's talent, despite my feelings on him, he's still a fantastic wrestler), and putting the two of them together as a tag team and having such a high-profile feud with DX was a good call. Just keep that in mind when voting for or against deletion: their feud with DX is a huge feud right now, possibly the biggest feud going on in the WWE right now, which would suggest reason for keeping the article, them being such a noteworthy team right now. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnakinjmt_7c04.html" title="User:Anakinjmt">Anakinjmt</a> 03:01, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Article meets criteria.. as it is both <i>named</i> and has had a <i>title run</i>... however just being named, <b>or</b> just having a title run isnt a suitable criteria unless no individual articles exist --- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulley_2f3a.html" title="User:Paulley">Paulley</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: What's to say they are a temporary tag team? Rated RKO I doubt is a temporary team, as they draw ratings with their feud w/ DX. The last time there was a vote to delete this, everyone wanted to keep it. If they were to be just a small temporary team, WWE would not go out of their way to give the team a name such as "Rated-RKO". They would simply call them "Randy Orton and Edge". Also the fact that they are the current holders of WWE's World Tag Team Championships, so I think this article is very notable to keep. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Maxx_a7b5.html" title="User:James Maxx">James Maxx</a> 14:21, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good point. Why the heck are people wikilinking that?

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, possibly as disambiguation per Patstuart. Note that lots of other wikipedias have a page corresponding to this (<a href="../../../../de/i/n/t/Interim.html" class="extiw" title="de:Interim">de:Interim</a>, <a href="../../../../fr/i/n/t/Int%C3%A9rim.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Intérim">fr:Intérim</a>, <a href="../../../../it/i/n/t/Interim.html" class="extiw" title="it:Interim">it:Interim</a>, <a href="../../../../simple/i/n/t/Interim.html" class="extiw" title="simple:Interim">simple:Interim</a>, <a href="../../../../sv/i/n/t/Interim.html" class="extiw" title="sv:Interim">sv:Interim</a>). Some of them are dicdefs, or usages that don't occur in English, but there is probably enough for a decent page here. The Simple English page is based on the dicdef but gives examples that might be beyond the scope of a mere dictionary entry. These could probably be expanded (e.g. list of interim officials, etc.) Note that in the opening definition, interim should be treated as a noun (which it can be, as in "in the interim") instead of the adjective ("interim president," which can be viewed as a noun in apposition). The reason people link it is perhaps it is deemed possible that someone will not understand the usage, the same reason people link <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floruit.html" title="Floruit">floruit</a> (a similar page to this one, in that it is basically a definition with example, but which seems to be well established by the community). <a href="../../../r/i/g/User%7ERigadoun_9ecb.html" title="User:Rigadoun">Rigadoun</a> <a href="../../../r/i/g/User_talk%7ERigadoun_bf8a.html" title="User talk:Rigadoun">(talk)</a> 16:57, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note that the church thingy is basically an interim agreement/ceasefire in the religious wars of the 16th century, and could be given as examples in that section of the page. I believe the links in this case refer to the <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augsburg_Interim_48b4.html" title="Augsburg Interim">Augsburg Interim</a>, but I'm not sure since there was another interim that same year (according to the de: page). <a href="../../../r/i/g/User%7ERigadoun_9ecb.html" title="User:Rigadoun">Rigadoun</a> <a href="../../../r/i/g/User_talk%7ERigadoun_bf8a.html" title="User talk:Rigadoun">(talk)</a> 17:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Yes, that is true, but I think this page in particular is beyond a dicdef. (The Swedish page was the one that is most like a dicdef.) Anyway, I have greatly expanded this page as per my comments and think it is no longer close to a dicdef, though it is clearly related to usage. I'm not sure if it qualifies as a disambiguation page. <a href="../../../r/i/g/User%7ERigadoun_9ecb.html" title="User:Rigadoun">Rigadoun</a> <a href="../../../r/i/g/User_talk%7ERigadoun_bf8a.html" title="User talk:Rigadoun">(talk)</a> 17:54, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> For whatever reasons (verification of notability difficulties?) models just aren't covered well in general, it seems. There was recently a similar issue with frequent cover model <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emilia_Attias_dc5a.html" title="Emilia Attias">Emilia Attias</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> So if you find reliable and verifiable sources, please add them to the article. There is virtually no content in it and no sources. Nothing to distinguish this person's article from hundreds of articles about people of no notability. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:20, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Many would argue that a model being on the cover of those magazines automatically means she's a notable model, even without the typical sources that verify notability. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 22:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There are probably occasionally people in ads or covers who are not famous supermodels. Not everyone appearing oon a cover probably deserves an article. So please find a way to cite to the cover, or list the covers as part of the article with the issue date in the text or listed as a reference, in addition to posting images of the covers (which someone might delete). Again, there are articles for literally thousands of utterly non-notable individuals which are also without references, and there needs to be some sources in this one if the person is famous in some realm of achievement. Otherwise it will stay a sub-stub sourceless article and likely come up repeatedly for deletion. The covers were not part of the article Dec 10, and the model's gender was incorrectly stated. Cites to a few articles would also help to inform the reader and establish notability. It said "He has one son, born in 2003. He proposed to girlfriend Mashonda Tifrere in 2004." So what's the story on that? <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:24, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting essay. Won't knock it. I'll only comment about deleting the gender-confusing sentence. As it didn't make any sense and not sourced, I thought it was best to delete it. If someone wants to restore it, I would suggest clarfication on the "he" and being married to the apparently female <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://musicimages.liquiddigitalmedia.com/0/5/8/6/76850.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.walmart.com/swap/LoadArtistTracks.do%3FmainCategoryId%3D147545&amp;h=170&amp;w=170&amp;sz=15&amp;hl=en&amp;start=1&amp;tbnid=8lWpP2FbwPD5wM:&amp;tbnh=99&amp;tbnw=99&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3D%2522Mashonda%2BTifrere%2522%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DN" class="external text" title="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://musicimages.liquiddigitalmedia.com/0/5/8/6/76850.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.walmart.com/swap/LoadArtistTracks.do%3FmainCategoryId%3D147545&amp;h=170&amp;w=170&amp;sz=15&amp;hl=en&amp;start=1&amp;tbnid=8lWpP2FbwPD5wM:&amp;tbnh=99&amp;tbnw=99&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3D%2522Mashonda%2BTifrere%2522%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DN" rel="nofollow">Mashonda Tifrere</a> and maybe a citation to back it up.

<li><b>Weakest of weak keeps</b> She's one of the more prolific fashion models alright, but outside the Cindy Crawfords its pretty hard to find hard facts on them. I added her sole film role with a review. Does anyone have the October 1992 edition of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interview_%28magazine%29.html" title="Interview (magazine)">Interview (magazine)</a>?

<li><b>Comment</b> Chondrite's comment squares with the lack of factual info, such as the person's gender. Sure looks female on the cover, if that is the subject of the article.
