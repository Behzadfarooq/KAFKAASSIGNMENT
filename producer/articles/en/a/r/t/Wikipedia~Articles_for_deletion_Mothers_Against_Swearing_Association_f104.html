<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>, if hoaxes can be speedied. I'm pretty damn sure it's a hoax: the URL for the website is "masavolvo", which makes me think it's South African: "ma se ..." (pronounced "mah sa", meaning "your mother's...") is a common preface to an insult here, and I can only assume "volvo" refers to vulva. Which means someone is no doubt being funny (and I love the humour), but it is not really debatable whether it should be in an encyclopaedia as a real organisation or not. Get rid of it. If it becomes a renowned and appreciated hoax, maybe it can come back in an article about hoaxes. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 10:40, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> I do not feel that your evidence to support a deletion of this page is valid, therefore, a deletion would conflict with the rules and guidelines of the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a>. I suggest that you further review your accusations before making such rash decisions. This "masavolvo" to which you refer can simply be explained by the fact that it is MASA and Volvo. Two separate entities. MASA refers to the name of the organization while Volvo refers to the claimed sponsor. Byrgenwulf, you seem to be using your own opinion as opposed to true evidence to have this page considered for deletion. I can also assure you, Dhartung, that this page has never been entered into any blogs as a discussion prior to this. Also, the information on this article has much to do with the claims and stories from the website. It is sourced, and therefore none of you have any real grounds to propose deletion to this page. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendand_3736.html" title="User:Brendand">Brendand</a> 8:58, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nice try. It's "sourced" from a Geocities webpage. Which mentions nothing about Volvo (I clicked on all the links, listened to the sing-a-long, and had a good laugh). Maybe masavolvo is over-interpretation on my part (if not, I do find it funny), but what does this lot need money for? What projects have they undertaken? <i>Why, if Volvo is giving them money, can't they even afford a couple of bucks a month for proper webhosting</i>. I love the joke, I really do, but a free webhosting page which reads like a joke is not a verifiable source. Anyway, guidelines to deletion for vanity require third party sources; this page mentions none. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 13:05, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>DO NOT DELETE Scorpiondollprincess, it cannot be assumed that the site is not a reliable source based solely on assumption. That has to do with the author. What is this about media coverage? What you say is completely opinionated and should not be treated as a factor to the deletion of the page. There are plenty of pages on Wikipedia with a link to a single page. And as for these "google hits". There is only one hit, and it does not even go anywhere. So why should that even be considered? I will answer that. It shouldn't. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendand_3736.html" title="User:Brendand">Brendand</a> 11:43, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Brendand, I shall preface this by saying that field theory in mathematics is not an area in which I am an expert. However, is there a reason you changed "the central concept" to "the hellocentral concept" ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_theory_%28mathematics%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64471465" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_theory_%28mathematics%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64471465" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> )? Is "hellocentral" a particular term in this field of enquiry, that I don't know about? I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing it back to normal English. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 15:58, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What this article needs is multiple, independent sources. The group's own homepage cited three times is neither independent nor multiple. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> contains guidelines on sources. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:V">Self-published sources (online and paper)</a> contains guidelines on the reliability of someone talking about him/herself. I suggest independent sources be provided: has anyone written a newspaper or magazine article about this group? Have they won any awards? No one is trying to be unfair.

<dd>Brendand, you needn't preface every response with "do not delete" in bold. It achieves less than nothing. No, the editing history doesn't show your username, because the edit came from the same I.P. address (192.139.71.69) as your last two comments here, as well as a few edits in "swearing" and "profanity" etc. Being an I.P. address, it <i>could</i> be co-incidence, but I'm not so sure, myself. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 16:11, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
