<p><b>Keep</b> I have to say, "Geogre", I have no idea how you extrapolated this article as having "german pride" sentiments. I would actually like you to explain it, because I find your deduction to be rather offensive and ignorant. As I understand it, Wikipedia is a forum inclusive to regional information just as it would be to pop culture. I would ask you to keep this in mind, that simply because you are unaware of the topic, it doesn't necessarily invalidate its contents or make it some kind of student graffiti. Thanks. --Kdevoss 02:20, 20 May 2005 (UTC)Kdevoss</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable. Also, possible hoax - 'Teuto Berga' is not a personal name, but a reference to the battle of the Teutoberg Forest. I'm not going to draw any political inferences.

<li><b>KEEP</b> This article has changed my life. When I first stumbled across this article, I too thought this article on one Lukas Peter was silly and vain. I thought Mr. Peter wrote this article about himself to undermine the integrity of thos hollowed online institution. I felt ASHAMED to be a member of the wikipedia community knowing that pranksters like Mr. Peter could deface our database with his self-serving entry. I was livid. I was so angry that I sought out this Mr. Peter... and I found him. I promise you all I met him, and I gave him a piece of my mind. I berated him for hours on end. However, oddly enough he took my lecture in stride. He just stood there so peacefully, and soon enough cracked a smile. He did not try to refute my arguments nor even defend himself as I attacked and entry on his life. As the day grew, I became tired and gave in. It was then that I was transformed. Lukas taught me so much. He taught me how to be gentle in the face of danger... how to be soft spoken yet strong... and how to live a life where a meaning will ever be questioned. Mr. Peter is undoubtedly the greatest man that I have ever met. He is a man of talent, wisdom, and compassion. Please do not erase this article, if not to encourage others to follow his ways, but for my own sake... this article personally means too much for me to watch it be so violently taken away from me. Thank you all and thank you Mr. Peter. ---Elnemuigato 21:15, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>KEEP</b> I strongly disagree with the claim that this article is that of a non-notable, as I have personally seen this person on the evening news in Seattle as the lead story, a news broadcast that went out to an excess of 3 million people. This article helps to highlight individuals who are of regional significance, and should not be judged by those who are unfamiliar with the area and its culture. By promoting the existence of articles such as this Wikipedia shall come closer to fulfulling the mission of documenting all knowledge, regardless of whether it will ever effect the lives of all people. ---<a href="../../../m/o/j/User%7EMojoismog_7521.html" title="User:Mojoismog">Mojoismog</a> 2:23, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Mr. Bound's last remark, entered at 21:16, May 20, 2005 was maliciously written with the express intent to harm. I contend that his remark was a personal attack. Thus according to Wikipedia policy, which states most plainly "Personal attacks are not allowed on Wikipedia.", I demand his last remark be disregarded from discussion, and I intend to file a complaint with Wikipedia citing this gross violation of the rules. Thank you --Elnemuigato 21:36, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Seeing as the three "keep" voters had five, zero, and three previous edits before contributing to this VFD discussion, I do not think that a little bit of concern is unreasonable. If you'd like, I would be more than glad to defend myself if you'd like to seek a request for comment or arbitration. And remember: please <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStaying_cool_when_the_editing_gets_hot_762d.html" title="Wikipedia:Staying cool when the editing gets hot">stay cool</a>. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Bound_30fc.html" title="User:Mr Bound">Mr Bound</a> 21:54, May 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hey, I have been going to this site for about a year and I've made edits before I actually created an account. I mostly prefer to read articles rather than create my own, and I can assure you that I am a seperate person than the other keep voters. Keep this article and if it bothers you so much then don't read it.</li>

<li>Agreed. Attacking users and making accusations of their validity without proof is uncalled for.--Kdevoss 23:02, 20 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would appreciate it if my remarks were not misconstrued. Nowhere have I said that anyone in this discussion is a puppet of anyone else. I have not "attacked" validity, only questioned it with what I feel is not an unreasonable suspicion. Indeed, I have no proof, that is precisely why I requested that someone step in and shed some light on the situation. Please, keep what I said in context. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Bound_30fc.html" title="User:Mr Bound">Mr Bound</a> 01:52, May 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I can entirely understand why there is much skepticism to the legitimacy of this article, but this biographical profile is entirely consistent with the spirit and purpose of wikipedia. To the residents of Shoreline, Washington Lukas Peter is an iconic, culturally important figure of our town and region. His adventures are closely watched, and often receive coverage from the local media. The man is one of those individuals who can inspire a sense of community, a feeling of regional pride and self-worth in just about everyone he comes across. In the Seattle area, Lukas Peter has a pseudo-celebrity status that makes him notable, significant and an enormous personality inseparable from Western Washington's cultural identity. --Kathman 03:35, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
