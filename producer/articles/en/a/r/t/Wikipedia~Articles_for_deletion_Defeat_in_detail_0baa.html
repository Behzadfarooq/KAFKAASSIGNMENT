<li><s>Weak delete</s> unless better verification shown, or <b>cleanup</b> if kept. Little more than a dicdef as it stands, and one which makes contradictory usages of another term. Not really a strategy or tactic or operational consideration that can be expanded to encyclopedic scope. Unsourced. The first two pages of Google hits are about a pair of books by a single author and about a single wargame, with only one hit relevant to the article's topic among those twenty items. In truth it sounds like little more than "wipe out one squad and hope the other ten brigades are all on lunch break at the time." <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 21:50, 8 February 2006 (UTC) Changing vote to <b>merge and redirect</b> per Isotope23. It's a well-known term (I was familiar with it from wargaming and military studies), but it's really just an idea, not a specific maneuver tactic. If your primary <i>strategy</i> is "defeat in detail", and if your <i>tactics</i> are aimed toward that end, you will almost certainly lose unless the opponent is heavily outnumbered or heavily damaged. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:06, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In my view while the links above are sufficient to show that the term is legitimate, none of them are a very appropriate reference for the term. An appropriate reference would be some authoritative book on military tactics, strategy or history, unfortunately I don't have any such reference at hand. As for making any other contribution to the article, as I said below, this is not my field of expertise and I'm unqualified to add anything to the article. The only contribution I feel I'm qualified to make, is to try to insure that this article doesn't get deleted. I apologize if I've been "sniping".

<dd>FYI. I'm the person who removed the "Prod" template. There is no obligation on the person who removes the the prod template to improve the article. I have engaged in discussion. What do you mean I "don't deserve to survive AfD?" This is about the article not me. Whether Wikipedia should have an article called "defeat in detail" has nothing to do with anything I do or don't do. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 23:46, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, improving the article is "optional", but I agree where the template reads "If you can address this concern by improving, copyediting, sourcing, renaming or merging the page, please edit this page and do so." The "Defeat in detail" talk page is blank, so you didn't discuss it until after the nominator brought it here for proper process. Removing the prod template without doing something proactive to advance the discussion isn't grounds for "don't deserve to survive AfD", but it's likely to cause other editors to discount your assertions. It looks more like edit-warring than consensus-building. Despite this, I'm modifying my vote slightly given the further citations. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:06, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with Barno above. At least leave some kind of comment when the prod tag is removed to explain why the article deserves to be kept. Furthermore, if you feel strongly about keeping an article that, at least in this case, is little more than a dictdef, why don't you feel strongly enough to improve the article a little bit? Just coming in here and voting to keep and improve doesn't seem to get these articles impoved in any way; thus, leaving a hoard of bad articles. BTW, I would like to point out that the reason that I nominated the article for deletion is legitamate and until the article is improved it remains legitamate. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames084_3305.html" title="User:James084">James084</a> 01:07, 9 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid I know <i>just enough</i> about this term to know what it means, and to know that it is a very common and important military term, and consequently to know that this topic deserves to have an article on Wikipedia. However military strategy and history is not my field of expertise, and without going to the library and doing some research, I am unqualified to make any real improvements to the article. That an article needs to be improved is not a legitimate reason for deletion, see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 02:44, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And I would refer you to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> to point out what Wikipeida is not and that is it is NOT a dictionary. This article was a dictdef. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames084_3305.html" title="User:James084">James084</a> 02:51, 9 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes Wikipedia is not a dictionary. And I'm well aware of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which says "if you come across an article that is nothing more than a definition, see if there is information you can add that would be appropriate for an encyclopedia." Thus, that an article only contains a definition is not a legitimate reason for deletion. A lot more can be said about this topic than just a definition. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 03:58, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This vote seems to conflate the editor and the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> If it's indeed a well known military tactic then it is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElfguy_25ac.html" title="User:Elfguy">Elfguy</a> 14:11, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, cleanup, expand and improve</b>, as RDH says. Just because you haven't heard of something, or it sounds suspicious to you doesn't mean it's a fake. Let the military historians take care of this, please. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 20:08, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Valid military tactic and strategy, but concur that article must be expanded. As WikiProject Military History has just gotten rolling, it may be slow going. Please bear with us. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 22:09, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
