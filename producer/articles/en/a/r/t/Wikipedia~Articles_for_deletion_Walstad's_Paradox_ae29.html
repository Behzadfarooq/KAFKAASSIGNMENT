<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> The author did graduate Highscool in the top of his class and also tested in the top %99 for Math on the ACT. He is currently pursuing his degree in physics and environmental engineering at New Mexico Tech and is in high esteem. He was able to prove that Russell's assumption that everything does not contain itself is wrong. That is because the power set of everything is no bigger than the size of everything, because the size of everything is 1/0, to which there is no greater value.

<dd>You may wish to better acquaint yourself with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell%27s_Paradox_367a.html" title="Russell's Paradox">Russell's Paradox</a> before attempting to disprove it. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></dd>
<dd>Thank you for your comment, I truly appreciate it. I am very familiar with Russell's Paradox. Did you read what I just stated above? Russell's Paradox is based off the assumption that the set of all sets can not contain itself because the power set of the set of all sets must be bigger than the set of all sets itself. However, this is incorrect and the reason is because Russell did not know or did not realize that the size of the set of all sets is 1/0, and there can be no greater number. Thus the power set of the set of all sets is no bigger than the set of all sets itself, and thankfully, this means that the set of all sets can contain itself. In turn this means that the set of all sets which do not contain themselves may be defined as the empty set, for in reality everything is self-containing and it must be so since there is no greater number than 1/0. Hopefully this clears up the confusion.Bossk2 20:12, 9 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2
<dl>
<dd>No. It isn't. Russell's paradox makes absolutely no reference to power sets. Russell's paradox is merely that a set defined as "The set of all sets that do not contain themselves" is not well-defined. That's it. No power sets, no cardinality, no infinities, and certainly no need to talk about the magnitude of 1/0.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article with Lee's biography was just edited to include more pertinent academic information such as what was just listed above. Also Lee's ties to Dr. Penny Boston and Dr. Lisa Young were added as well as information about the new species of mushroom which he is currently describing with Dr. Gaston Guzman for either Mycotaxon or Journal of Mycological Research. Thus the article has been greatly improved to exemplify more interesting information and I recommend it not be deleted.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and, frankly, per <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>. Arguing whether the empty set has no value and attempting to assign meaning based on bad analogy to "1/0"?? Kid, stop trying the mushrooms and userfy this non-rigorous fluff until you get it covered by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> by WP's standards. For a topic like this, the source needs to be a peer-reviewed journal, or some really substantial coverage by general mass media. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:19, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I strongly respectfully object because it is clear that the empty set is what is defined as undefined, not the compete set, 1/0. This is plainly evident to anybody who can open their eyes to the inherent definitions of these concepts and thus it is not original research. Furthermore WP:NFT is a category I do not understand because it implies that important realizations can not happen to anyone at any given moment, by serendipitous or other fortuitous means. Additionally, the way that you have put 1/0 in quotation marks with two question marks after seems to indicate that you yourself do not understand the concept of 1/0 and thus I do not understand why you think you can identify a bad analogy when you do not understand the concepts involved. I think it is clear that most people do not understand the concept of 1/0 and perhaps they should read the article about the theory of 1/0 so that they can gain enlightenment about this mysterious and all-important concept which has been ignored for centuries and which was only adressed by <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmagupta.html" title="Brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</a>. The information is being posted in good faith for everyone's benefit and it would be a shame and an injustice to delete such fundamentally important realizations which are an inherent result of human curiosity and our belief in understanding everything, i.e. 1/0.

<li>I am sorry for the confusion. Yes I am Lee Walstad, but I serve as a spokesperson for the theory of one divided by zero until it is accepted or somebody takes my place. The reason I do not claim to be the author of the theory of one divided by zero is because I believe that it is the sole property of 1/0 itself, and I have merely realized what it was telling me, that it is the number everything. Also I am not the only one who has realized this, Arceliar and Edward Solomon are others that I know of. It would be a discredit to them to claim the theory of 1/0 as original research. Walstad's paradox is only an extension.129.138.2.196 02:54, 10 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2

<ul>
<li>Again I respectfully object to all of the above. Walstad's Paradox is an extension of the theory of 1/0 which is a natural realization that anybody can make and which other people have made (see the article), therefore it cannot be claimed to be original research, it belongs to 1/0. Please provide a reference for why you say the theory is verifiably false. Russell was not considering the fact that the set of all sets is 1/0, and the power set can NOT be greater than this value.</li>
