<li><b>Delete</b> The books don't seem to assert anything. Law books (and articles) in the UK are often written by not so succesful lawyers and are in essence a cheap means of advertising. Same goes with getting on the BBC. If there were third party reviews of his work I'd be more impressed. The stuff about the Conservative Collegiate Forum could be a claim to notability if there were some ("substantial") press coverage cited, but at the moment there isn't. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 19:03, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the person under discussion and was new to wikipedia until this year. I have apologised for starting the page as vanity publishing and I repeat that apology again.The page was allowed to stay on the basis that I asserted notability as a writer. I wholly accept that some of my books help advertise my practice although if you do a search of barristers' chambers you will find that very few barristers have even written one book. However, of the ten books that I have now written, I would suggest that three are important books in their own right: Email, the Internet and the Law was one of the first on this subject and Professor Richard Susskind described it in the Times newspaper as "an important new book" at the time of its publication; Sports Personal Injury is the only book on the subject and was therefore once again breaking new ground and has attracted interest internationally; finally, I contributed two chapters to The Future of the NHS which also includes chapters from all three political parties and most of the major think tanks. As for my political involvement, I did not add the story about the Conservative Collegiate Forum but it is true and was covered in both The Times and The Daily Telegraph in 1993, among other newspapers. As for my media appearances, I make no great claims save that I am the regular legal voice for the Jeremy Vine Show which is the largest daytime news and current affairs show in the country (with around 5 million listeners). Once again, I am genuinely sorry for any offence caused by vanity publishing. I shall leave well alone now other than to contribute to this discussion and will be very happy if you cut down my entry substantially. However, I will continue to contribute to wikipedia in the future and thank you all for a great site. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimkevan_4318.html" title="User:Timkevan">Timkevan</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETimkevan_bb62.html" title="User talk:Timkevan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Timkevan_2c3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Timkevan">contribs</a>) 16:01, 25 September 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> OK, so now we have a number of claims for notability of a junior barrister:
<dl>
<dd>- That two of the books he wrote solo are important in their own right, presumably they would meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a>. For the moment the fact that none of these books have an uncontested Wikipedia article should be seen as a sign that this is not proven.</dd>
<dd>- That Kevan wrote for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Future_of_the_NHS_b9f7.html" title="The Future of the NHS">The Future of the NHS</a>, which does have its own article (let's pass by the main author of this book. However as the introduction for that article says it "brings together forty-four leading experts in the fields of health care, politics and policy making". So Kevan is one of forty-four. Not a claim to notability.</dd>
<dd>- The Conservative Collegiate Forum information may be a claim for notability - but it's still not cited.</dd>
<dd>- The <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Vine_f1f1.html" title="Jeremy Vine">Jeremy Vine</a> show is notable, but being a contributor would only be notable if he was essentially a co-host.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have restored the two books that Kevan cites as his most significant. On balance I am happy with him having an entry. The combination of his writings and media appearances make him worthy of an entry. &lt;POV&gt;If Big Brother contestants and rappers who have released a couple of CDs get in here someone who has already done what Kevan has done (and no doubt he will do a lot more) should not be excluded. &lt;/POV&gt; <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 03:18, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete with gusto/userfy if not already done</b>. Where is notability asserted here? He certainly does not meet the criteria for an author, unless he can demonstrate that his books are CORE texts of general application- i.e. sales numbering in the thousands. As noted above, it is quite common for barristers in the UK to contribute papers and or books. If there are multiple external full reviews in e.g. <i>The Times</i> or similiar, then let's see links to them, and it may sway my thinking here. However, on the basis of the facts as they stand, I see no evidence that this gentleman deserves to be in here as an author or academic. So, his other two claims to notability are that he's a barrister and went to Cambridge- as far as I'm aware, neither of these are covered in the notability guidelines. Get yourself on myspace Mr. Kevan- that's the place for popinjays such as yourself, not here. Out out out. <small>I note for the record that Mr. Kevan also added a nice vicarious vanity page for one of his chums, who has even less of a claim to notability- Daniel Barnett.</small> <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:20, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I see no reason to believe that Tim Kevan started this article in bad faith. He was unaware of the rules and has since apologised for inserting his own article. He also seems to have made quite a few good edits to non-related articles. While we may disagree with him on his notability - could we please stop the name calling? Most vanity articles start out as good faith efforts by people who don't fully understand the purpose of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 09:01, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Why is it name-calling to refer to someone who incorporates a biography of themselves and their workmates into an encyclopaedia for the purposes of self-advertisement as a "popinjay"? It's a simple assertion of fact. I struggle to understand how the motivation of someone (ANYone) who composes their own biography here can possibly be described as good faith, unless they are a very foolish and myopic person. It strikes me that Tim Kevan is not particularly foolish or myopic- although he obviously knows an opportunity for free self-promotion when he sees one (see his comment above, for example). The subject edited his article repeatedly over a period of 2 months. He has indeed made some good quality edits to unrelated articles- but many (if not most) of his contribs appear to pertain to himself directly, his father, or his friends and workmates. Very poor show indeed. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:50, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is the subject of this debate, Tim Kevan, again. I very much accept the criticisms made of me and again I apologise. It seems that most of the writers are prepared to accept the entry if there are independent references etc. There have been a number of reviews of my books and references to my student politics (something which was added to my entry by someone else) in national newspapers and publications. These are only available it seems to subscribers. However, for your benefit I have done a search of just one of these newspapers, The Times, and have put the references online at: <a href="http://www.timkevan.com/articles/times%20articles.doc" class="external free" title="http://www.timkevan.com/articles/times%20articles.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.timkevan.com/articles/times%20articles.doc</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm sure youd didn't mean it but you shouldn't vote twice. I've added in the stuff about the CCF to give people some idea of it's notability or otherwise. (There's also an article about this <a href="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2006/03/donal_blaney_a_.html" class="external text" title="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2006/03/donal_blaney_a_.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> although badly written). Personally I think this person is less notable than Emily Barr, who doesn't have her own article. If the ins and outs of the Maastricht debate and Major's dog days become better covered on Wikipedia then I could change my mind. On the e-mail law book, if this is the extent of its notability I think we should forget it. It's said to be an important book in a short review in the Times. There's no indication that it's influential on other books or on cases. If you could prove this then it could be kept in. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 21:31, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Tim Kevan was notable as a proxy in a fight that is otherwise unmentioned in wikipedia. Conor Burns - the other candidate, who's achieved a lot more subsequently - does not have an article in Wikipedia. As coverage improves of Maastricht and the Tory hari-kiri that was the John Major premiership then the Conor Burns affair may be included together with some of the supporting cast. Other than his selection to the post there is no other evidence of his effect on the now defunct organisation or the wider Conservative Party. As to legal textbooks, well no one apart including Tim Kevan has started any articles for them or argued that they would meet notability standards. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 12:13, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
