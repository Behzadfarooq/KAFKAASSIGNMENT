<p>After several recounts I think we can acertain about 5 merge votes, 5 non-puppet keeps, and 39 deletes. Even though this rules that it should be deleted it has already been redirected to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mushroom_Kingdom_362e.html" title="Mushroom Kingdom">Mushroom Kingdom</a> (noting lack of "The").

<li><b>Keep</b>. Are you people are morons? I just read about this in our chatroom. We are the coolest and bestest Mario website on the net. Only idiots and morons would say to "speedy delete" our site. If voting is how we get to keep this article, then I'll definitely be asking all our chat regulars to vote keep on this.

<li>That is nice, but you should add something meaningful to the discussion particularly as it relates to how encyclopedic the article is as this is potentially weighed most heavily around here in determining the outcome rather than just the raw count of Keep or Delete, as votes are not necessarily treated as numerical. Please explain why you believe the article should be kept other than that you are a member of a community or chatroom specific to the site featured. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 9 July 2005 15:40 (UTC)</li>
<li>Your forum misunderstands the procedures of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">This page</a> makes clear that admins can and will discount votes of brand new users . This is uniformly done in such clear cases of new users coming along <i>specifically</i> to support/oppose a particular page. Even if your keep votes overwhelm the delete votes, it will still go if you are all brand new, or fairly new users (or anon IP addresses) with such a clear agenda. You would do better to spend your time establishing the notability of your forum in the article in legitimate ways. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 9 July 2005 15:46 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and Redirect to Mushroom Kingdom</b> - This looks like vanity/self-promotion/spam. <i>11,100,000</i> internet references to IMDB, V.S. <i>5,750</i> to this site in google. It does not appear that, and I do not believe that the <i>Mushroom Kingdom</i> is anywhere near the level of notability or utility of IMDB, which is a large project of broad scope and broad recognition, and I believe that the article overstates the importance of the site: even if it were true in a limited scope, the comparison hurts the article, because the web site. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a> is notable and encyclopedic, but in general, there may be many fansites, but they are not notable, and I have visited many Mario-related websites and sites which document or list Mario games in the past, but never this one. The Mario equivalent to IMDB is just IGN, Gamespot, et al, note that <b>those</b> are considered notable enough sites and do have articles. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 9 July 2005 15:33 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article makes this specific claim "Recently, it was the crown feature among the multitudes of booths in E3 and G4." It seems doubtful, I have checked E3's list of exhibitioners and been unable to find any listing for TMK, is there somewhere else that should be checked before concluding that this claim is probably not so? --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 9 July 2005 16:27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Fansites have a <i>very</i> high bar to clear to be encyclopedic. Give them an external link on the Mario Brothers page, but no article. And this "lottery" of newbies voting won't help either. Your votes won't be counted so don't bother; you'll just piss us off and garner more dlete votes. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 9 July 2005 15:37 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By the way, <i>The Mushroom Kingdom</i> already has external links from several of the Mario-related articles on Wikipedia, and I agree, that is fine, TMK has content that merits linking from those articles, even if the site is not noted widely enough to merit a separate article on it. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 03:57, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that endorsement. To all TMK members: You heard that ringing endorsement, so it's a giant free for all. If it's Mario related, add our site to it. Remember, try to get every article that is remotely related Mario linking to our site. We want all this site's Mario-related articles linking to our site. The deadline for the second lottery will even be extended for two months to make sure we get every Mario related article linked to our site. Tigerz 04:45, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. You guys know that the lottery prize will only be awarded if the article survives, right? I don't think this "discounting" stuff is just a scare tactic, what if they actually discount votes? Well, at least I'll try to make an effort to save this article. To reiterate some of the arguments in keeping our article - we are notable and not "vanity". Our website is the first site to be listed on Google when you search for "Mushroom Kingdom". That should be good enough because security is important to Google, not even the atom bomb can skew its results. Any site that shows up as the first listing on Google deserves an article on your Wikipedia. Also, we have very unique content that other sites don't have. For example, compare our cartoon episode guide with the one found on TVTome. When you compare the two, you will definitely see that we are the superior guide. I bet my total manhood that nobody that can counter these points. There, that should get me at least ten extra entries into the lottery, pretty please. Tigerz 23:24, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>To TMK users welcome to Wikipedia. From looking over the site it looks frequently updated and visited by a regular crowd. Your site may be of significant value for those looking for information related to the topic, but Wikipedia has a threshold of inclusion that is not yet satisfied. Real world or virtual, no matter what, Wikipedia seeks entries on topics that are verifiable (i.e. Externally commented upon). We maintain this standard to help preserve the integrity of information. If the article is made of original research then only insiders will be able to work on it. At its foundation, Wikipedia fuctions by the ability of visitors to verify and challenge the info published. I hope you understand why we editors seek to remove this entry.</p>

<dd>Well, I find it ridiculous people are challenging very basic information. What dummy would challenge that a chicken's egg yolk is yellow, or that 1 + 1 = 2, or that humans breathe oxygen. Challenging that The Mushroom Kingdom's status equivalence to IMDB is the epitome of idiocy.

<dd>Hi, the entry asserts only basic claims, and the Google evidence convincingly verifies the site's coverage as comprehensive, however, there is no mechanism by which Wikipedia can approve of only limited development of an entry. If editors agree to keep this entry, then like all other entries, there is the expectation it should eventually be expanded out of stub status, which will undoubtedly spill insider knowledge into the article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. What can I say that hasn't already been said with more eloquence? Well, let's try this...: You're #1 on Google? OK then, let's do a test. Mushroom Kingdom&#160;: 670,000 Googles. <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Axe_7fd0.html" title="Golden Axe">Golden Axe</a>&#160;: 751,000 Googles. Now according to those stats <i>alone</i> (alone, mind), that would make "Death Adder's Castle" the "more popular" site than yours because it beats back a greater number of other hits to become the #1. But does that mean it's deserving of an article here? Of course not! And another test, let's try Mario. Are you on the first search page? Nope! Try Zelda. Is there a fansite on the first page? Yep, Zelda Universe. Does that mean they deserve an article here? NO! Now look, I'm sure your fansite is awesome, and complete, and detailed, and the bees-knees of Mario... but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of knowledge, not a directory of cool. And as for this tactic of offering adminship to encourage flood voting, I am shocked. You are completely perverting the purpose of our Vfd system, that is that unbiased people vote based on their will to make Wikipedia a better place and uphold our high standards, not provide votes that basically boil down to "OMG dey gonna delet my favrite site ONO!!!11!!

<li>It doesn't matter if you removed it or not (referring to the previous edit). It's already been spread through our chat room, also if this loses the winner of the new lottery can choose channel mod instead of forum mod if they want. Tigerz 02:47, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Do we get any "increased chance" of winning the second lottery for past actions? My friend <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclipsed_Moon_d109.html" title="User:Eclipsed Moon">User:Eclipsed Moon</a> added some already and are still present in some of the articles. Or does each link need to be a different account? I do see why it needs to be a different account, but can she get some "bonus" in the lottery because some of the links are still there. Or does she need to start over? Anyways, if not, at least this second lottery is much better than the first one. Whoever came up with the first lottery needs to be silenced for a week.&#160;:P Sandy M 03:08, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm the owner of The Mushroom Kingdom website, IRC channel, and message boards. I did not endorse this article about my site, so I must vote in favor of deletion. Talk of "spamming links" in order to "become a mod" is nonsense, because only TMK staff get operator status in the chatroom. In addition, I do not recognize any users posting on this VFD except for Phred and Vid. It appears to me that some people who don't like our website are causing a ruckus, hoping to get every link to our website removed from Wikipedia.

<li>Seriously, I put every damned link up, a while before this page was an issue. It's no more spam than IMDB; I'm just putting up relative page links up. People don't do it, <b>I</b> do it. I know nothing about Deezer, other than the fact that he's working on Paper Mario TTYD Mariopedia information. I've no reason to spam, because I'm not even a member. I'm being bold (I believe that's a Wikipedia guideline), and adding them because I feel them relevant to the page. I don't wanna be a mod on TMK; I'm not even that big of a Mario fan.
