<dd>I agree that under regular circumstances it might have been too soon to renominate, but the last listing only had six commentors -- not nearly enough to set a precedent to keep or delete an article. And of those six, five were supporters, and four of those five think that AfD is a vote and that simply saying "Keep - notable" is sufficient. The fifth attempted to demonstrate the notability but offered no support for the claims. Like I said before I have no confidence in the last AfD and have no problems with it being relisted and supporting its deletion. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 02:40, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In any event, it's not a fair account. Moreover, it is uncivil to allege that some people "think that AfD is a vote". With respect, <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> has no way of knowing any such thing about those of his colleagues in this project who voted (or whatever more pedantically accurate word is preferred) last time.

<dl>
<dd>In not just that one but most AfD's I've seen people think that they are simply there to vote "keep" or "delete", when in reality the point is to arrive at a consensus (or come as close as possible). If you do nothing but show up and say "notable" (or "not notable" for that matter), that does nothing to show a skeptical person why this person deserves an article (which, by the way, I'd still like to see happen here).<br />
<br />
As far as me retracting my comments, I don't see why I would. Of the five supporters last time, two did nothing but say "notable", one mentioned only something about her showing up on Google (as though that proves anything), one mentioned only two references to her on Wikipedia that, if you take the time to look them up, do not demonstrate her notability in any way, and finally you started to make some vague claims that, had I been around, I would have asked you to clarify. As far as I'm concerned, the other four voters did nothing but vote and added nothing to any kind of consensus-building. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 08:44, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You should always assume that fellow wikipedians are valued colleagues who are acting in good faith and with due consideration for the benefit of the project, until you see clear evidence to the contrary. That is certainly how I wish to be regarded.</dd>
<dd>Personally, I have no brief for Rosario Isasi, and I don't think she is so notable that it would have been a travesty if the last AfD had gone the other way. However, I happened to know that she is a reasonably prominent spokesperson for certain views, and so I was surprised to see the article listed here. When I checked on Google, it threw up enough information to confirm that I was not imagining things, or distorting things in my mind. Accordingly, I "voted" to keep the article and briefly stated why, without overstating the point. At least some people who followed me also obviously checked Google to see not only how many hits she had (not all that many, actually) but also their quality, which is pretty impressive. There was, indeed, a process of consensus building, which is how this place is supposed to work. From my experience, a lot of people just vote "delete per nom" - I often do this myself if the nominator has said something that I think is clearly right after I've made some quick checks. There is no need to engage in extensive explanations unless requested. Concision does not in any way demonstrate a lack of understanding of the process. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:40, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>1. Okay, but I did see evidence. Actions speak louder than words, after all.</dd>
<dd>2. "Delete per nom" is, of course, completely different from "Delete, non notable", assuming the nominator made valid points.</dd>
<dd>3. Her Google results don't seem any different from what would be expected of anyone in academics who happens to advocate a position. I'd prefer to see where her advocacy has sauntered out of academia and entered into a significant public discourse or some kind of other significant show of her notability. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 10:19, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, the comments or otherwise of the contributors to the other AfD are irrelevant - it was closed as keep, and if you want to challenge that, take it to DRV. Secondly, at least three of the five keep-ers made points (Metamagician, Royboy and Loremaster), and thirdly the only comment of the single delete-er was "nn". QED. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Mestel_2c0e.html" title="User:David.Mestel">David.Mestel</a> 16:32, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The first AfD is relevant since many are using its existence to justify keeping this article. It is very common to relist articles that do not receive comments by enough people to reach consensus. Also, unsupported and/or erroneous claims are not worth much. Saying "good google hits" is kind of pointless -- you should cite one or two of them, unless it's completely self-evident upon punching her name into Google which in my experience it was not. Finally, it should go without saying that I prefer both keep and delete "votes" to be accompanied by a justification (even if it's just agreeing with someone else's). <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 21:30, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Many of the firt Google hits seem to come from pretty reputable sites. But that is irrelevant. You are trying to use this AfD as a kind of "Appeal" from the previous one. USe DRV for that, that's what it's there for. And anyway, six people is enough (subject to DRV), when they're 5-1 united. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Mestel_2c0e.html" title="User:David.Mestel">David.Mestel</a> 06:57, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
