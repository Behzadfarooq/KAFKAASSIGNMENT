<li>Article was written by a fan (me), not by Steph herself. You have pages for other internet personalities, such as <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Curtis_f548.html" title="Drew Curtis">Drew Curtis</a>, why wouldn't this be allowed too?

</li>
<li>Instead of deleting, why not move it into the appropriate category of Internet Personalities? Spazholio</li>
<li>An article doesn't have to be self-written to be considered vanity, and we have pages and categories for <i>notable</i> internet personalities, but not just everyone (otherwise, any Wikipedian could be considered an internet personality). Sorry but this does get my <b>delete</b> vote. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 13:46, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do see your point, and to a certain extent, agree with it. However, how many Wikipedians have 40,000 unique page views per month and have released their own album. I understand you have to separate the wheat from the chaff here, and not every bonehead with a website can be included, but for someone who has that many pageviews and actually recorded her own CD, one would think that would take her out of the realm of "some person with a page" to "internet personality", no? Spazholio
<ul>
<li>Not really. Pageviews alone are a weak indicator of notability, and besides that 40K a month isn't really that high. <a href="http://www.starblind.com" class="external text" title="http://www.starblind.com" rel="nofollow">My website</a> had 50,484 hits last month according to WebTrends, and I certainly don't consider myself either an internet personality or worthy of an article. Having recorded a CD is nice, but as far as I can tell it seems to be self-released. Anyone with a CDR drive, some freeware, and a $3 PC microphone could technically record their own CD in a couple of hours if they really wanted to. Radiant said it best, there has to be some sort of notability before an article on an "internet personality" can be seriously considered. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 15:24, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just saw this in my stats. I didn't submit it myself, and the text of the entry is taken from my bio -- maybe it could be edited a bit to be less self-promo-sounding.

I'd like to correct that the 40k reference above is <i>unique monthly visitors</i>, not page views, which is roughly half a million. I was actually down in Cleveland this weekend, giving a presentation on my site at the <a href="http://www.notacon.org" class="external text" title="http://www.notacon.org" rel="nofollow">NotACon</a> conference. I've been living my life online for nearly five years, and have been on TechTV and in many other publications, and I am to be in an <a href="http://adakin.com/camgirls/" class="external text" title="http://adakin.com/camgirls/" rel="nofollow">upcoming documentary</a> (look for horrible, horrible photo in this month's American Cinematographer) and book on the webcam phenomenon. Yes, my album is self-released, but believe me, not with a CD burner! I've actually even been recognized on the street a good few times. So anyway... I'll leave you to your voting.
