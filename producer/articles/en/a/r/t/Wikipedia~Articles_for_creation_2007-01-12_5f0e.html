<p>Blair Brodie is a Scottish explorer famed for his expeditions in the early 21st Century.</p>
<p><br />
His voyage to the Arctic Circle in 2002 was shown on Sky channel Challenge TV after he championed the channels showing of racist gameshow Bullseye during an interview with Kirsty Wark on Newsnight Scotland. During the ill-fated trip to the Arctic, Brodie lost all of the toes on his right foot when he was attacked by a rabid huskey dog named Colin. The toes were kept in a thermos of Slush Puppy but unfortunately could not be reattached so are now just a painful reminder of the failed trip.</p>
<p><br />
Brodie is also known as a keen naturist and can often be seen on the beaches of his native Falkirk getting an all over tan much to the ire of the local prudes. This pales in comparison however to the Edinburgh Zoo incident when Brodie was arrested for streaking through the Zoo to raise awareness for his charity, The Human League.</p>
<p><br />
His travels have been documented in the book A Year of Adventures by Andrew Bain.</p>

<p>Andy "The Widow Maker" Rennison was born in Sault Ste. Marie, ON on October, 31st 1986 at the Plumber Hospital. He got the nickname from fellow members of his hypnotic acid rock band Dragons Gravy. In his early life Andy was facinated with death and destruction, often attempting to "blow up" random vehicles by throwing molotov cocktails through a open window. At first local police had no idea it was him he would quickly move through different parts of the city in alley ways and dirt roads to evade law enforement. But on October 28th, 2005 3 days before his 18th birthday he was approached by officers regarding his recent crime wave. What happened next has been widely debated some say he ran so fast they couldn't catch him with the police car, some say he was put into the cruiser but managed to escape, and some even claim he was never approached by police and went into hiding. No matter what happened the result was the same Andy "Widow Maker" Rennison was gone. No one knew where he was and no one had seen him for days. on January 5th, 2007 Andy Rennison was seen at a local bar. Many people asked him where he was but he would not say. To this day Andy will only tell of his and life and events before October 28th, 2005 and will not respond if asked any info on what happened. Some say Andy Rennison never existed, and a creation of the media to exploit the police force. Others claim to be Andy Rennison, but with another alias and birthdate.</p>

He has played with famous musicians and trumpets players around the country. He has spent years making a name for himself. In his mid-50s in 2006 he was hired as Edison high school(new jersey) assisted band director.

<p>Simple game for highly energetic people. Low buzz factor. Required supplies: people and beer.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is for each person to choose a hand gesture that they would like to have represent him/her during the game. Can be simple, polite, or sexually enticing, but it must be SHORT.</p>
<p>Everyone sits in a circle, everyone starts the game by "drumming" their hands on the table or floor or whatever the playing surface may be. During the drumming, someone says "WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME?" everyone responds with "THUMPER!!!" then the leader says "AND WHY DO WE PLAY THE GAME?" responded with "TO GET FUCKED UP!!"</p>
<p>At this point the leader performs his/her own hand gesture, immediately followed by the gesture of any other player. This player then performs his/her own gesture followed by another players, etc.. and so on. When a cue is missed or when someone responds too slowly, the "violator" must drink. This person then is the leader for the next round.</p>
<p>Also be creative with what is said during the drumming, it's not limited to the above two questions. You could also call a slo-motion or high speed switch at anytime.</p>
<p>The game takes a lot of emotional involvement, good when played when eveyones hyper because there's no where to go, or nothing better to do.</p>

Formed in 2006, the band feature a hit single also named "Directions in the Sky" that recieved heavy radio airplay. The next single "Girl in the Hall" was less well recieved, and the band was dropped from their label.

<p>There are Wiki entries containing the Shearson name, but none of them give a history of what happened and who were the key players in a single article.</p>
<p>A January 2007 Google on "Shearson site:en.wikiedia.org" shows 46 entries.<br />
A Google on site:citigroup.com for Shearson found 33 entries.</p>
<p><br />
An ad, decades ago, listed all of the names of the founding brokerages of what, as of then, comprised "Wall Street."</p>
<p><br />
While many of those names have disappeared from the brokerage scene, including the Shearson name, it is the Shearson name that would make for perhaps the most fascinating "tour guide."</p>
<p>This article is intended as a starting point for those seeking information about Wall Street and this author would welcome a rewrite or replacement that makes it seem more like a walking tour.</p>

Electroadhesion relates to the electrostatic effect of astriction between two surfaces subjected to an external electric field. Examples include paper retention in plotters, electrostatic robot grippers and similar applications.</p>
<p>Electroadhesion is loosely divided into two areas of usage. The prehension of electrically conductive subjects in which the usual laws of capacitor theory (<b>D</b> = <b>E<span class="texhtml">ε</span></b>) and that used with electrically insulating subjects where more advanced electrostatic theory (<b>D</b> = <b>E<span class="texhtml">ε</span></b> + <b>P</b>) applies.</p>

<p>The European Network of Mobility Centres – ERA-MORE</p>
<p><br />
The ERA-MORE (European Network of Mobility Centres) provides tailor-made assistance to researchers and their families moving from one country to another. The aim is to ease mobility within Europe and to make Europe more attractive for researchers as a place to live and to work.</p>
<p>More than 200 Centres in 32 countries (EU 27 plus Turkey, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Israel) offer quality support to solve a wide range of problems, including the most practical ones encountered by mobile researchers:</p>
<p>• coverage under the social system scheme in the new country • recognition of diplomas • work permits • finding an apartment, a kindergarten or school for the children, a language course,..</p>
<p>The Centres are open to incoming, outgoing or returning researchers independently of their nationality and employment status.</p>
<p>A researcher might contact the Centres directly or find an answer on the European Researcher's Mobility Portal (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eracareers" class="external free" title="http://ec.europa.eu/eracareers" rel="nofollow">http://ec.europa.eu/eracareers</a>). The European Researcher's Mobility Portal is a one-stop shop for researchers seeking to advance their careers and personal development by moving into another country. Job opportunities, funding schemes and practical information are updated regularly. The European portal is complemented by the 31 national portals that provide targeted information such as guides for researchers or FAQs.</p>
<p>The ERA-MORE was launched by the European Commission as one of the concrete implementations of the European Commission mobility strategy in the context of the Lisbon strategy.</p>

<p>Richard David Stockton (b. July 24, 1956) is one of the inventors of the Beer Pager. Stockton grew up in Garden Grove, California. Growing up, he enjoyed surfing, water polo, and restoring automobiles, particularly painting them. At the age of 24, he married his first wife, Julia Billups, and together they had three kids: Franklin Stockton, Sonia Stockton, and Angela Stockton.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, Stockton co-owned and managed Stockton Water Trucks, a business he operated with his father. As California real estate market conditions got tough, they sold the company and Stockton moved on. Later that decade, 1988, Stockton and his first wife divorced. Trying to make ends meet, Stockton started working for an automotive paint repair company called Altracolor in the early 1990s.Started working for an automotive paint repair company called Altracolor in the early 90's to make ends meet. Four years later after having mastered the craft, he bought the franchise from his former boss and started hiring his own employees. In 1997 Stockton married his second wife, Janet Frankland, who bore his fourth child, Cameron Stockton later that year.</p>
<p>However, it was not until Memorial Day 2003 that Stockton began his own . Stockton and his close friend, Casey Oosterbaan, set their beers down by the BBQ for a spirited game of Cornhole, a beanbag tossing game. After building quite a thirst, they returned to the grill only to be confronted with 7 open beers. Tragically, they did not know which beer was their own. At this moment, one said to the other, “If only beers came with alarms so we could beep'em and find'em, like when you lose your car in a parking lot.” This thought was greeted with hilarious laughter and a realization: this was a gift that needed to be shared with the rest of the world. The motivation led Stockton and Oosterbaan to start RC Products, a company dedicated to the betterment of people's lives. Over a span of three years, they built the world's premier beverage locating device: the Beer Pager. Today, other life-changing products are under development at RC Products.</p>
<p>Stockton currently resides in Winchester, California.</p>

Medieval children’s Game called Duck on a Rock was played with a good size stone (the drake) placed upon a very large one or a tree stump. One boy stayed near it to guard it. The others threw stones (ducks) at it in an attempt to knock it off. Once it was knocked off, the throwers all rushed to retrieve their ducks. If one of them was tagged before returning to the throwing line with his duck, he became the guard. The guard could not tag anyone until he had picked up his duck at his feet, nor could he chase anyone till he, the guard, had replaced the drake upon the rock or stump. Resent findings believe basketball was baste on this game.</p>

<p>The Jockey Club Scholars Alumni Association Ltd. was registered in November 2004. It is a non-profit organization comprised of recipients of The Hong Kong Jockey Club Scholarship with an objective to contribute to the society through a network of young elites. The scholarship was established in 1998 with a grant of HK$102 million by The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust for a ten-year period. It provides approximately 26 scholarships each year for local and mainland students to pursue three-year, first-degree courses at eight universities in Hong Kong as well as the Academy of Performing Arts. Scholars are chosen by the tertiary institutions to which they have applied on the basis of outstanding academic ability and talents, and interest in community service. Each scholar receives about HK$290,000 to cover tuition, academic expenses and living costs during the three years. Renewal of the scholarship is dependent on the level of the students' performance.</p>
<p>Recipients of the scholarship automatically become members of the Alumni. As at 4 October 2005, the Alumni have a total of 172 members. After a two-year pilot project funded by the Trust to develop the scholars’ community spirit, the Alumni is being registered as a non-profit organization and going to apply the recognition of charity status. The Alumni is committed to serving the society, extending the community spirit of The Hong Kong Jockey Club.</p>

<p>An outlaw band flees a posse and rides into Refuge, a small town where no one carries a gun, drinks, or swears. The town is actually Purgatory, and the peaceful inhabitants are all famous dead outlaws and criminals such as Doc Holiday and Wild Bill Hickok who must redeem themselves before gaining admittance to Heaven...or screw up and go to Hell. The residents must either defend themselves against the outlaws and risk eternal damnation... or die a second time.</p>
