<dd>Gaff, when I said take a deep breath I didn't mean it to belittle you but to underscore that you need not get overly anxious about a vote that is going in the direction you desire. This article <i>will be kept</i>. Twelve to fifteen keep with two deletes <i>is</i> consensus. If twenty odd deletes appeared in the next minute it would still be kept (and note again I have not voted delete here). So don't worry! And don't badger the one or two people voting delete—they don't have to "come around." Start User:Gaff/Star chart. I will help you. Yes, these one liner entries could be placed in a more useful spot. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:59, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Stars are significant enough by the mere fact of their existence." No: a mass of "hydrogen and helium" is non-notable in the same way the "bricks and mortar" of my corner store is non-notable—in some ways even more so, because at least I can provide incidental details of a corner store. Stars with planets, luminous and visible stars, stars in notable constellations etc., OK. I'll wait for a second sentence here to prove something of this sort. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:48, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Stars that are visible from where? Stars are not even in the same league as bricks and mortar on the corner store. I'm not arguing that every quark in every nucleus of every atom of helium in every star warrants an article. But I thought that wikipedia would contain the sum of all human knowledge or something along those lines. Lets start by agreeing that really, really big things like stars are notable and go from there. What about galaxies known to exist that are not visible to the naked eye? Should they be left out as well?? --<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff">Gaff</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff">talk</a></b></small></sup> 21:54, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Visible from here. "Systemic bias surely!" "Indeed, I'm systemically biased toward the Earth!" Yes, from a certain perspective stars are of course in a different league than corner stores but their representation here isn't. If I <i>can't say anything about it beyond the fact of its existence</i> (or non-notable incidentals—"red brick store," "m class star") I don't think it belongs. Wiki is not a (star or any other type of) directory. Note, however, I'm not delete.

<li>Its an issue of scale. Every known star is notable as far as I am concerned. Even if not visible to the naked eye. (As an aside, I wear contacts. If some evening I do not have on my contacts and cannot see a certain star, can I vote to have it deleted?) I'm not suggesting we catalog every brick just because each is unique in its own way, but every star? Stars are just so darned big that how can one argue they are non-notable. I'm also not suggesting that wikipedia be merely a directory of dry facts either. That's why the article need still be labeled stub. But in the case of extraordinarily gigantic things like stars, I think they are notable by the mere fact of their existence...--<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff">Gaff</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff">talk</a></b></small></sup> 23:18, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Indeed they are darned big, but to repeat <b>if you can't say more about them than the fact that they exist</b> they don't belong. Do you know how many M class stars astronomers figure are in the galaxy? Yes we could have a quarter trillion pages (not a joke) with the following "8978735812cxh is an M-class red dwarf" or "3846751191olm is an M-class red dwarf" or, say, "5770192281jqa is an M-class red dwarf" but, hey, I don't think that's why wiki is here.

<li>Seriously? A quarter million M-class red dwarfs? That would take a long time to catalog. How long do you think that this encyclopedia will be around? Is money to finance the storage of an encyclopedia as all encomassing as this one hopes to be a limiting factor, to keep it from ever containing the sum of human knowledge? Even to limit it from containing known verifiable objects of the magnitude of an M-class red dwarf? If 100 yrs from now wikipedia is still around and people are wanting something to put in the encyclopedia, only to find that guys like Merovingian have already cataloged all 'visible' stars, then will it be worthy of entry?

<li>First Gaff, take a deep breath. It's going to be kept OK? Yes, you're repeating <i>all</i> "stars are significant and notable" but there is no argument as to why beyond darned big and that strikes me as insufficient. "Keep but expand"? In a large number of cases expansion isn't really going to be possible. There is very very little that actually differentiates one star from another and that which does—<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallicity.html" title="Metallicity">metallicity</a> say—isn't a notability claim. As, I think, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Rees_c795.html" title="Martin Rees">Martin Rees</a> once said "an insect is more complicated than a star." A series of single sentence entries doesn't strike me as useful; indeed, creating constellation lists and having the star name redirect there might be more user-friendly. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:27, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for your expressed concern regarding the volume of my respirations. Rest assured my breathing is just fine. Its a good thing that the article will be kept as it along with any article on a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star.html" title="Star">star</a> is notable (as per all of my arguments above).--<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff">Gaff</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff">talk</a></b></small></sup> 16:18, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>But I do appreciate your comments about keeping things user friendly. A centralized list of stars might prevent sprawl. It will be a very long list, but might be a better way to go tha trillions of separate articles. Although, there is something cool about hitting the random article link in the sidebar and finding a star.--<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff">Gaff</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff">talk</a></b></small></sup> 16:35, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Not a centralized list for all: arrange by constellation and have each individual star name re-direct to it. If not in a constellation then yes, a generic list. Save individual star pages for stars that have planets, are super-massive etc. And create a template chart: apparent magnitude, spectral class, planets (yes/no), metallicity, variable (yes/no) etc. Searching "56 Aquilae" and coming up with a list like this rather than the page as it stands <i>would</i> be more useful. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:12, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The article already links back to its home constellation. I see no harm in having a separate article for each star. I do like your proposal for organazing stars on the constellation page, although the way they are already is nice as well. Kudos to Merovingian btw for tirelessly plugging in star article after star article the way that he has been recently.

<li><b>Delete</b> - All these uninteresting stars don't need an article of their own. They should be listed on one page. Any star that is notable can get a page to itself. Seriously, it's bad enough clicking "Random Article" and getting a US county every second time without hundreds of stubs about unremarkable stars compounding the problem. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 04:13, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I should add: just because a certain bit of information is worth having in Wikipedia, it doesn't automatically make it worthy of an article to itself. In fact, by having a seperate article for information that could just as easily be listed in a table, the reader loses out by not being able to compare the thing in question with other similar things. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 05:48, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, then, merge to that list. As to the issue of "all stars", that must be decided on a case-by-case basis, but I say that stars get articles if and only if there is something more to say about them than the standard luminosity, spectral class, size, date of discovery, etc. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 19:09, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That may in fact be the most reasonable course, then maybe have redirects from the names of lesser stars back to their specific constellation. The "all stars" issue is a current issue, that maybe needs to be addressed on more than a case by case basis. Merovingian and other users have been working hard to create many, many articles on individual stars that they feel are notable enough to warrant individual articles. Perhaps a project or taskforce 'stars' could be created to reach a consensus on how to handle this question. I was the one to first nom this for deletion. However, I see that it is not a clear cut issue, as evidenced by the fact that the contributor is Merovingian, who has made extensive contributions to WP and is running for the arbitration committee. There are many, many star articles on WP now, and perhaps a more formal policy needs to be created to manage such an enormous topic.—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff">Gaff</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="purple">talk</font></a></b></small></sup> 20:47, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
