<li><b>Delete</b> The article is unbearably vague about what this fellow actually did. The European Court agreed to hear his case (about what? the article says nothing) but the case was settled before the Court could hear it. Then we learn he continued to work for "reform" and "the rights of young people" (what does that even mean?) in his home area. What establishes notability from that sequence of facts?

<li><b>Comment</b>. The search engine results above will convince you that there is verifiable subject matter that is in need of documentation in at least the two articles mentioned above. I agree that this article is terribly written as is, though. This is where the old AfD dilemma comes in about whether this should be about what has been written in the article or what is readily available. I personally think neither of those options is always the right answer. In this case, I do think looking at what is available by Internet search makes sense. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 06:04, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The Jnanpith is awarded to one person every year. India has one billion plus people and 20+ recognized official languages. I think the Jnanpith criteria is as harsher than asking every British writer to win a Booker. The Sahitya Akademi award is a state-level award. I confess I know nothing about this author or the literature in the language he's written in, but I do know about this award and the recipients in the Indian languages I speak, who are well published and notable to millions. A problem with notability is that transliterations schemes don't always allow for the best hits and India has an abysmal record of getting stuff from local languages up on the net (hence the difficulty in searching on Google). I would like to request native speakers to establish notability (if it is notable) citing references. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntorjal_c04f.html" title="User:Antorjal">Antorjal</a> 17:17, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In Karnataka, "Gowda" is about as common as "Smith" in the UK, so I'd say the chance that he's a relative is pretty small.

<dd><b>Comment</b> actually I'd be more than happy to see all the pokecruft gone from Wikipedia, but realistically speaking, that will never happen. Still, just because Wikipedia has become a stomping ground for hundreds of articles about the minutiae of a childrens cartoon (curiously written by people who apparently are not in the target 10 year old market) doesn't justify adding any other sort of article.

<li>I had no idea Grand Forks was in South Dakota. Only lived in North Dakota most of my life and thought GF was in North Dakota. Guess I learn something new each day from people who can't even take the time to get the facts straight. It was the first built/completed but second opened (by six days) in North Dakota. It also has been the longest open as "The Park" was closed for a few years then reopened back in the 1980's, and although it had damage because of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flood_of_1997_20ad.html" title="The Flood of 1997">The Flood of 1997</a> it was re-modeled and one of the very first businesses reopened after the flood. I'm quite sure a search of the local paper, the GFH would bring up these facts, though they don't have a searchable Archive online. Guess I'll head down to the local library and do a bit of research. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 05:26, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I think that many of the "delete" votes come from people who live in places where shopping malls grow like weeds, and thus cannot conceive of why any individual mall would ever be notable. I sympathize, but also recognize that the notability of something depends not just on <i>what</i> it is, but also on <i>where</i> it is. In the case of North Dakota, a large enclosed mall is undoubtably notable, even if it wouldn't be in, say, Phoenix or Los Angeles. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybum_d3c8.html" title="User:Skybum">Skybum</a> 00:32, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not ready to change my vote yet (and I think this will be no consensus anyway) but this is finally the first really interesting reason to keep and I'd like to see it expanded upon. Are malls really so rare in the State of North Dakota that the first mall is notable? I have to admit, where I live, in 1 hour's time I could get to 10-12 malls easily. A mall simply is no big deal.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:44, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not voting either way on this (I usually vote to keep malls, but I'm wishy-washy as to this one), but I think this AFD proves we need to have a discussion on shopping mall notability in general. There have been a lot of mall AFDs lately, many of which <i>have</i> been kept either on their own accord or by lack of consensus (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Carlingwood_Mall_cdb5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Carlingwood Mall">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Carlingwood_Mall</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mall_of_Louisiana_c47d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mall of Louisiana">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mall of Louisiana</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Oakland_Mall_e3f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Oakland Mall">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Oakland_Mall</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> Isotope, I guess I should explain. Enclosed malls are not abundent up in North Dakota cities as a whole. Fargo, the biggest city in North Dakota has one...West Acers. Grand Forks, has two (columbia and grand cities), Jamestown has one, and there is one in Bismark, the state capital. Something else to point out is that theses cities are hours apart, making enclosed shopping malls nearly a novelty. Grand Forks and Fargo are 45-50 minutes apart via the interstate highway 29 (which is 75MPH and little traffic). Jamestown - Fargo is +2 Hours and Bismark-Fargo is 4-5 Hours, hence the reason the editors from North Dakota are so against this delete. It's the longest running enclosed mall in a state with so few of them around. I can understand if LA, NYC, Miami, DFW, or KC has 10-40 (or more) enclosed malls within the city (or suburbs) making someone from that area believe enclosed malls are not notable, but from an area where the next closest enclosed mall is a +2 hour drive...the mall would be notable. This mall is notable for the community because it is a 'big deal' for the city. It was the Focal point of the city's shopping economy for decades, and still has drawing power. In a state with a <b>total population of 642,200 people</b> I hope you can see the context, when a <b>city</b> such as LA has a total population of 4,097,340! , --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 15:48, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think I can approve of where this sort of reasoning takes us. I have family members who live in rural West Virginia. Up until they got a Wal-Mart last year, they had no shopping of that nature within around an hour of where they lived. Does that mean that the Welch Wal-Mart should have an article because it's a "big deal" to the few people who live in the northern part of McDowell and the southern part of Wyoming counties? I don't think so. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 19:25, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think you can compare a Wal-Mart store to an entire mall. A Wal-Mart, no matter what kind of an impact it has on a local community, is just one store. On the other hand, a mall is more than just a store. In ways, it is almost like an entire neighborhood. The Grand Cities Mall had a major impact on the city of Grand Forks. When it opened, it started the decline of once-bustling downtown Grand Forks. In ways, the mall was a "new downtown". People had never seen anything like it. It seemed huge back then and its opening forever changed the business climate and the landscape of the community. In North Dakota, the opening of a mall is not a regular news item. The opening of this mall was especially noteworthy since it was basically the first mall that anyone had ever seen in this area. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">Matth</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewUND_9622.html" title="User:MatthewUND">w<font color="green"><b>UND</b></font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewUND_1acf.html" title="User talk:MatthewUND">talk</a>)</sup> 00:56, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would like to state that that "49 unique non-wikipedia hits" is incorrect. You are grossly misreading Google results. Do a search for the word cat. By your logic there are fewer than 900 "unique hits" for that word. Common sense tells you that is nonsense. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 04:48, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When the number is this small it is less likely to be misleading in that way. My benchmark is that if you get more than about 200 unique, and thousands total, the unique count is probably worthless.

<dd>There have been frequent reports in the past that the unique hits are only filtered from the first 1,000, so when the total's much higher, they're not valid. They may be of value to provide a ratio, as in this case, 95% of hits are dups of the first 5%. (Per below, by refining the search, the relevant total came much lower. It appeared from experimenting that 7,000+ were foreign uses of zesix as a word, and 36,000+ were from their own domains, leaving not much.) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 19:39, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a Jew, I cannot possibly understand all the nuances that went into creating this school. But a thorough read through the articles regarding the school shows that it is quite genuine and was created to meet a perceived need for a new type of school. That a new school is not accredited by a well-known accrediting agency does not make it a diploma mill. Nor do I find it at all unusual that the mainstream press hasn't latched on to this school as a subject for articles that would confer the notability so many feel it would be given. Despite the lack of traditional news coverage, the articles provided and available online provide clear satisfaction of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> . I find the use of "scare quotes" and other derogatory suppositions regarding its nonaccreditation making it a suspected diploma mill to be a staggering violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.

<li>Thanks for the reply to prove my point about good faith violations. These folks seem to have a genuine interest in teaching folks their version of Baptist theology as they understand it. I've seen ads for diploma mills, all of which read "send in a check we'll send you a sheepskin." If you take a look at <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/AboutUs/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=120" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/AboutUs/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=120" rel="nofollow">the school's admission requirements</a>, they're doing a very poor job of attracting only those who just want a phony credential. I see no evidence (nor has anyone offered any) implying that they're pushing paper, and not their brand of gospel. I find the school notable and verifiable, and I can at least respect challenges to the issue, even if I disagree.

Specifically, of the references, the first two sources are interviews, which are not fact-checked. The third is an article written by one of the company founders. The fourth is commercial self-promotion. Five, seven, and ten are about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Meatrix_21ae.html" title="The Meatrix">The Meatrix</a>, which we have covered.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Despite William's reasoning, a quick web search shows me that there's a lot more out there that <i>can</i> be used. WP:V should not be a major obstacle here. Okay, WP:CORP may be, but it seems like this is the kind of company that may fit in the fringes of that guideline... and I would really hesitate to classify this under "indiscriminate collection of information," and WP is not paper after all.

<p>1. ...and the novelty of it got the attention of both the general public and the social activism community</p>
<p>2. ...Free Range delivered its first Flash animation piece that would have worldwide impact.</p>
<p>and the overall tone of the article is trying to be, at times, too corporate-bound, as someone from the company, Free Range Studios, or someone from an advertising firm hired for Free Range was to write to pronounce and glorify efforts, that I think, is from just another rank and file graphics firm. I understand that this studio has been instrumental in eliminating the civil war in Sierra Leone, but what percentage of contributions they gave to ending the bloodshed is questionable; (is there an article stating the direct cause Free Range Studio's movie had on both sides of the war? Would internet access and electricity be readily available for the warring sides? I simply cannot imagine whether the bloodshed in Sierra Leone, would have, even momentarily, ceased to watch and think about this Flash animation). Finally, The sources lack the tangible authority that Wikipedia is generally known for when its users produce knowledgeable, useful, and globally relative. The sources, or the lack thereof, appeal to people who have strong interest in graphic arts and is severely limited to that clique. An internet user would gather more information simply googling for Free Range Studios, and visiting the company's official website.<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellwing_cd92.html" title="User:Hellwing">Hellwing</a> 00:11, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Although it is obvious how this discussion is going, I like the idea of this article. It is an article about the successful control of an emergency situation. It is from emergencies like this one that our technical society learns to improve. Because of this incident, emergency handling procedures and emergency equipment can be improved. If the incident had been a disaster, and then, I suppose, notable, with all the Souls on Board (S.O.B.'s) dead, then there would be fewer learnings. But most likely, for this article to be notable the authors would need to make more clear the notable learnings from this incident. I think there was a hint of those learnings in the criticism of the air traffic response to their emergency. As an aside, it is most likely very notable to the family and friends of the crew that they did not become an encyclopedic event. <a href="../../../w/v/h/User%7EWVhybrid_6d13.html" title="User:WVhybrid">WVhybrid</a> 23:12, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

On top of that, it is a fairly well written and sourced page, in contrast to most of what is being discussed here. --Ogdred 06:00, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> ultimately this is not about Jason Scott the man, it's about the Jason Scott deprogramming incident and subsequent repercussions. The subject appears to have little or no coverage outside of that restricted locus. Thus, covering it in the articles on CAN and Ross is both logical and prudent per <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> . I am not sure the subjecty would consider this incident to be the sum totalof his life's worth, and as the article says his current activities are unknown (for good reason: he is not actually independently notable). Nor is this article entirely about Jason Scott, a fair bit of it is about his mother as well. Overall, I'd say delete this history and redirect the few inbound links to CAN. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 12:25, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I'd never rely on book retailers alone, they do provide one indication of an author's notability. I, too, noted a Zenik book in the holdings of the Toronto Public Library. To these eyes, the fact that the largest public library system in the country (in Zanik's home province, no less) holds nothing more than a single copy of a single title speaks to non-notability. The title, <i>Beyond Me</i>, described by a vendor on abebooks as "stapled wraps", appears to be a chapbook. I'm afraid I can't speak to the status of the publisher, the Highway Bookshop in Cobalt, Ontario, as they appear to have no website. Zenik's presence on the University of Manitoba's CanLit site consists of nothing more than his name and a link to zenik.com, a domain name currently up for sale. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 19:19, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. After some further reading, it seems that the article is defiantly a hoax. Qi (or Ki as the Japanese call it) can't be used to actually alter the forces of nature, thus a "Ki push blast kick" or "Ki roundhouse blast kick" would be impossible. Using Ki in such a way only exists in martial arts movies, but not in real life. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 04:48, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

There are a few possibly "deletes" here, another few which I'd like to see kept, and a few which could possibly be merged.

<li><b>Keep all</b> First of all I am really aversed to mass-nominations, if you are not sure of the notability of a topic you go by a case by case basis, you don't nominate every single article in the subject for deletion. Second of all, I really do not understand the nominator's reasoning, most of these synagogues seem notable enough for a wikipedia article.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Jayjg and others. I want to add that these synagogues are not just *well, for almost all( notable in and of themselves / these pages cumulatively document a historical geography of the Jewish people. My suggestion is instead of deleting these articles - or even articles on Churches or lighthouses - we rethink them. I used to be opposed to all "lists" because I thought what is the point of just a list? But now I realize, as Wikipedia has grown and as our coverage has grown both in scale and complexity, that series of articles like these can fulfil a very valuable function. A list of lighthouses, for example, is not just a series of articles on tourist sites or points of possible architectural interest. They can provide a historical geography of maritime history, illustrating how the organization of regional and global shipping has changed over the years with new technologies, new forms of consumer demand, etc. Similarly, I do not think a series of articles on "churches" should just be about buildings - these buildings illustrate important moments in the history of a geographically dispersed phenomena, it is a whole other way of writing about religion. Now, there happens to be a fair amount of research in historical geography so I am not making this up, and I bet there are very good secondary sources one could draw on in using those articles to map out the historical geography of different religious movements. I see this request for deletion as an opportunity to take stock of just what Wikipedia can do. I urge not only that these articles be kept but that editors working on them coordinate their efforts to ensure that the articles (synagogues) on this list not only talk about buildings, but use these buildings to talk about where and when Jewish communities have waxed and waned. The result of this kind of work on these articles (and similar series) can really push wikipedia further as a scholarly resource. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 21:07, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>To refine my perspective...I went with "keep all" in agreement with Uppland's recommendation, but I think Jossi actually offers a better proposal... While those synagogue articles that deal with congregations that aren't particularly noteworthy on their own, from an encyclopedic standpoint, specifically, they <i>are</i> noteworthy from the perspective of the history of Judaism in the US [or whereëver else, for that matter]... If a synagogue isn't noteworthy on its own, specifically <i>sufficiently</i> noteworthy to warrant its own article, it is, more likely than not, sufficiently noteworthy to warrant mention and some coverage in a more wide-ranging article such as Synagogues in San Francisco, or...and here's what's swaying my perspective, Synagogues in Wisconsin... Three <i>defunct</i> synagogues, and that's only the ones that come immediately to mind, in Wisconsin (in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison%2C_Wisconsin_c802.html" title="Madison, Wisconsin">Madison</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevens_Point%2C_Wisconsin_0d5e.html" title="Stevens Point, Wisconsin">Stevens Point</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appleton%2C_Wisconsin_37b2.html" title="Appleton, Wisconsin">Appleton</a> are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, yet <i>none</i> of them, in my view, are sufficiently noteworthy to warrant independent articles. I know there are 3 defunct synagogues in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superior%2C_Wisconsin_215f.html" title="Superior, Wisconsin">Superior</a>, 2 in <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheboygan%2C_Wisconsin_44e5.html" title="Sheboygan, Wisconsin">Sheboygan</a>, and one in <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashland%2C_Wisconsin_218f.html" title="Ashland, Wisconsin">Ashland</a>, as well... All of which probably wouldn't warrant mention in Encyclopedia Brittanica, but <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. I think a failure to understand that concept is probably what prompted this nomination, especially where that concept butts heads with <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. And so, I'm going to refine my opinion to <b>keep all, merging into appropriately-named articles where warranted</b>. To clarify, I'm strongly opposed to this group nomination, but I think it has been a beneficial exercise nonetheless. If my view holds sway, the aftermath would probably be most productively pursued at <a href="../../../j/e/w/WP%7EJEW_276f.html" title="WP:JEW">WikiProject Judaism</a>... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 07:14, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>First, Google test is only something that gives people a gut feeling on how widespread or popular something is - it's not a substitute for notability criteria, but it's an indicator among many. But in this case, it's pretty problematic: the article has no <i>references</i>. If we can't google this, how on Earth anyone is supposed to fill the references and clean up the ad tone? One would guess there were a lot of web references famous people of this caliber, no? Yet none are referenced in the article, not even the <i>printed</i> material, none of the <i>press</i> material. Second, "this person has famous relatives/ancestors" is <i>not</i> a positive notability criterion. We've already deleted a lot of articles on the grounds that they're just some celebrity's children with absolutely no accomplishments of their own. Third, please don't take AfDs personally. We're not debating about your worthiness, we're debating whether or not the article fits our inclusion criteria in this state.

<p>Celebrity - Ha!! I am not desiring nor needing celebrity. As far as references within the article Emerson Knives and Ernest Emerson's work as well as Hannah Emerson Dustin and Ralph Waldo Emerson's work are easily researchable on the web. Only since last year have I allowed work about myself to be posted on the web by my representative e4 FINE ART, e4fineart.com., &gt;To <a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a>&lt;/, you mention google was only "one" way of many way to get a gut reaction to an article, despite that on goolge searching "l. R. Emerson II" produces 3 pages of results. Are you saying I do not exist at all. Even just in May, 2006 my work was exhibited at Virginia's elite and nationally respected, Contemporary Arts Center and two television programs have recently been in contact with me. My work was being published as early as 1985 in both trade magazines and Newspapers. Work has also been on th cover of Entertainment Sections of Daily newspapers and other newspapers. During the past 20 years more than 100 awards, including ceremonies in my honor have be bestowed upon me - not that I care or I would have introduced my "upside-down art" 20 years ago. Instead I professionally perused art starting in 1985 and built a tremendously successful business, as awards came in and in 2005 hired assigned a major portion of my work over to e4 FINE ART to represent and promote. I am not really sure why this is any of your "talk pages" business to know.</p>
<p>Is every article on wikipedia written with every single detail of a person's ( they are the subject) life or life's work. Seems to me the majority of the qualitative comments on this discussion about deleting the article have been that There were no references or that the style of the writing sounded like an ad. There are some published biographical articles in the possession of e4 FINE ART, which do not sound like an ad. Is Wikipedia saying these should be incorporated into the article, "Emerson, L. R.'&#160;?</p>
<p>Sounds to me Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia edited by users but rather an encyclopedia wishing it was Britannica. It is not critical for me to see that all evidence of my success be posted to the web. So to use google as a "primary" source, albeit ‘gut feeling’ or whatever is bogus. My accomplishments speak for themselves and there is so much more to be told and to come. If other tests exist to define the merit of an article what are they??? L. R.

<li>Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia edited by users. It's also an encyclopaedia that is <i>edited</i> by users. This may sound surprising. "Editing" doesn't just mean "add random information that someone finds interesting", yes, we value that too. But editing also means "summarise, compare, add sources, add pointers to further information". That's what "real" encyclopaedias do, too. As said above, don't <i>require</i> web sources, just sources that are <i><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a></i> and sufficiently <i>public</i>. You say you have newspaper sources - that's fine, by all means, <i>do</i> add them to the article. Please be specific - it's not enough to say "has appeared on cover of magazines", but it would be prudent to give examples of such. As for published bios, we can't use them, due to copyright reasons, unless they're licenced under <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> - but they can be used as starting points and sources. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand your argument. Nonethelss, the list does not intend to list every word in Singlish, but rather it lists only selected and representative words.

<li>The difference is that urbandictionary is full of made-up shit. Half the stuff that's "real" is less than 10 years old. The stuff in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish_vocabulary.html" title="Singlish vocabulary">Singlish vocabulary</a> existed before most of its practitioners were born, and it's well studied by linguists. My impression is that both linguists and "native speakers of Singlish" (if that concept makes sense) maintain the articles. While I don't particularly endorse the use of singlish, it's not really comparable to slang. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 06:32, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I mentioned that it was not a formal version of English and thus a type of slang, since you stated earlier on that Singlish was "not really comparable to slang."

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes but a Singlish dictionary would be too specific and no one who wants to find out what Singlish is about quickly will have the time to go through a Singlish dictionary. This article is meant to give readers a general understanding of Singlish based on a representative list of words. It is not simply a list of dictionary definitions. Dictionary definitions don't usually explain how the terms came about. --<a href="../../../h/s/c/User%7EHschin_8771.html" title="User:Hschin">Han Sheng</a> 19:06, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What does it mean to be a "representative list" of words? How were some words and phrases chosen as "representative" and others excluded? For example, I don't see what telling someone that "gabra" means "very confused" tells them other than the meaning of the word. I also think you'll find that any dictionary worth its salt <i>does</i> explain how a term came about; see <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/confused" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/confused" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> for example. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 19:17, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether words are representative or not are not determined by just one person. That is exactly why this article is here for others to contribute. This article is still a work in progress. The words that simply list their definitions are still being worked on and I have yet to find additional information for these entries. These words are simply left-over from when this article was still a section in the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a> page. It was never my intention to make this page a plain list of Singlish vocab and their definitions. I'm working hard to clean it up and make it more useful to wikipedia. That's also the reason why i added the clean-up tag to the top of the list. --<a href="../../../h/s/c/User%7EHschin_8771.html" title="User:Hschin">Han Sheng</a> 19:51, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the problem is that many people who are actually proposing to delete this article don't understand what Singlish is about at all. Some might think that Singlish is something arbitiary formed from throwing together words from a few other languages. Fact is, Singlish has been around for more then 40 years, since Singapore's coloial days, and has slowly been evolving till its current stage today. It is not possible just to "work a few examples into the text of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a>" as it would not be representative. Furthermore, this page originated from the article on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a> and was split because the page was growing too long. If this page is to be deleted and a few examples were put back into the article on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a>, the page would start growing too long again as more and more people add their examples. There are many similar pages available on Wikipedia, such as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_vocabulary_8951.html" title="Australian English vocabulary">Australian English vocabulary</a>, and they exist undisturbed. I'm not sure why there is a sort of double standard being practised here. I feel that this issue should be left to Wikipedians based in Singapore to decide whether this page is representative of Singlish and will help others in the understanding of Singlish. --<a href="../../../h/s/c/User%7EHschin_8771.html" title="User:Hschin">Han Sheng</a> 15:38, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I know what Singlish is la so please don't try to insult my intelligence. I have about half a passport full of SG entry/exit stamps. Delete the examples if they get too many. It's cruft. I know the problem, we get the same problem at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> where newbies try to add every factlet under the sun about the group, but it's something we have to deal with. Singlish is an important English dialect which requires an article, but it's not so important that we have to breach <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and become a dictionary. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 16:39, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No one here is claiming that Singlish is "something arbitiary formed from throwing together words from a few other languages." Also, no matter how long Singlish has been around, the article is still nothing more than just a list of Singlish dictionary definitions, which is a violation of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> policy. Other related vocabulary pages continue to exist because they describe <i>grammar, history, and background</i> , whereas this article simply <i>lists the definition every single Singlish related expression</i>, which as I mentioned before violates <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>. As for your comment stating that "that this issue should be left to Wikipedians based in Singapore", please remember that Wikipedia (being a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">Wiki</a>) is a <i>community</i> based project, thus issues are resolved among the Wikipedian community, not just a select group of users. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 16:49, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure how (as an example) <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_vocabulary_8951.html" title="Australian English vocabulary">Australian English vocabulary</a> differs from this page. How does it describe "grammar, history and background"? Anyway, I apologise if I stepped on a few toes while putting forward my argument on keeping this article. I'm still not too familiar about how things work around here as this is my first time participating in an Afd discussion.

<li><b>Keep the Article.</b> Goy Advanced Automobile is an already existing Australian automobile manufacturer verifiable by the Australian Company Number 119 763 674. If anybody is interested, pls go to the Australian Securities and Investment Commision at www.asic.gov.au and search under the National Names Index. The company is in the R&amp;D stage and its works are not available for public viewing until early next year. The official website will be completed by mid Oct - early Nov. It is not speculative. It is definite. It is as valid as any other automobile companies listed in Wikipedia, however young it is. However I admit that this article needs improvement and I will do the cleanup soon. Thank you for your understandingDavidgoymt 01:51, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> If the company is not trading, and information about it is confidential, it's hardly "as valid" as "other automobile companies listed in Wikipedia". It's simply not notable. There is no guarantee that the company will <i>ever</i> trade and the protocols of this site mean that crystal-ball gazing, whether by <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Grant_cc36.html" title="Russell Grant">the most reputable of seers</a> (or the <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystic_Meg_d38d.html" title="Mystic Meg">least</a>) is a no-no. When the company has achieved notability, an article will be deserving. Millions (if not billions) of properly registered and <i>active</i> companies all over the world do not justify Wikipedia articles because of lack of notability. How much more so one that has not even launched. Top tip: Get a stack of media coverage from reputable (and notable) sources and even without trading, an article would be justified. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 10:19, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>ADD</b> I am the webmaster for the Hemifacial Spasm Association website and I totally disagree with the comment that we are violating copyrights or are "basically just a cut-and-paste" website. The majority of the information on our website is member created, our member's personal experiences dealing with hemifacial spasm. Hemifacial Spasm is a condition, that due to being rare, often goes undiagnosed or mis-diagnosed by the medical community and many individuals find our site and take information from our site to their doctors to aid at arriving at a diagnosis, which obviously is the first step in treatment. Do to the need for kno/wledge and emptional support, our online membership currently has members from 26 different countries. If it is ultimately determined not to include us under "Hemifacial Spasm Support", then we would hope you would provide us as a link under "Hemifacial Spasm". Thanks</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. If the diatribe below doesn't validate your accusation of it being a vanity page, then nothing will.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnebravemonkey_d240.html" title="User:Onebravemonkey">Onebravemonkey</a> 10:41, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the circumstances, pleased to meet you, Modemac. I was actually somewhat surprised at the deletion nomination, as I've contributed other (I'd like to think) valuable content here before; as things stand, being a packrat and annotator of odd Net histories (I still recall the flamewars on Alt.hackers.malicious, among many other places, always careful to avoid involvement, but observing with genuine interest, before Usenet became a complete and total Cesspool, sadly enough...), I would think a Google search of the Thought Shop's hacktivism activities, pro-individual-privacy stance on things and the like (including 'ChristerThon '97, I think it was called - **Correction: it was "Christer Troll 97"**), and/or hitting the wayback machine should yield quite a number of results.</p>
<p>So why haven't *I* added all of those things in? Well, I'm one person, myself, my investement in logging stuff isn't *that* rabid (so if Wikipedia deletes it, no hard feelings, I assure you), and I have a finite amount of time per day, and have to head out for work at the present moment. Time permitting, I'll add more there, if that is worth doing; if not, then I won't bother.</p>
<p>However, as a logical aside, noting the links I cited there <a href="http://www.thoughtshop.com/subgenius_01.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.thoughtshop.com/subgenius_01.jpg" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.thoughtshop.com/subgenius_02.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.thoughtshop.com/subgenius_02.jpg" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, if signed laudatory letters from the Founder of the Church of the SubGenius singing their praises for incidents clearly dated by/before 1994 (as those letters are) is not at least some small measure of proof of having <i>done something</i>, then I suppose one could either A) contend they are forgeries/fraudulent -- something easily enough found out by email Reverend Ivan Stang with them -- or B) by the same logic, if commendations from such High Pranksters as the head of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Subgenius_99b5.html" title="Church of the Subgenius">Church of the Subgenius</a> worthless, is the Subgenius page there not also, too, a vanity page? If so, is it a candidate for deletion? I cannot imagine so, unless the grounds are on religious ones.</p>
<p>Actually, something which has come to mind regarding what could be the actual cause for lobbying to delete the entry about the Thought Shop has come to mind: I believe we've met before, Modemac; you &amp; Rev. Stang had a falling out, if memory serves...?</p>
<p>If I am misremembering, *please* correct me -- seriously. However, if I'm not mistaken, and if that *is* the case, then your request for Deletion of the entry more likely than not has a personal motive behind it, I suspect.</p>
<p>Regardless, I bear you no ill-will, and leave it to the judgement of Wikipedia as to whether or not to judge what is, in fact, verifiable historical data, as frivolous and worthy of deletion; sadly, I'm out of time, so can neither continue this commentary nor dig through search engines and the like to provide the information available to substantiate things, beyond what is already there.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<dd>Let's see...you're saying I have some sort of grudge against you, and you're worthy of inclusion because Reverend Stang wrote you a letter twelve years ago.

<li>Precisely where above I stated that you "...have some sort of grudge against" me personally, I'm missing; I also don't see where I made the claim that Stang wrote *me* anything; I merely cited those as demonstrable proof that the group really had been around since the 1990's.

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>. The raw totals are 10-6 in favor of deletion. That comes pretty close to no consensus as it is. But several of the Delete comments were "per TheronJ", and TheronJ's comment was (originally, and even still after he changed his actual bolded summary) predicated on TransWikiing this to WikiSource, which is not an option. So it's not clear that some of the Delete comments envisioned completely destroying the information in the article as opposed to moving it to WikiSource.

Getting into specific BMI values is a bit indiscriminate, and best left to calculators (though it would be wonderful if there were a way to wikicode such calculators) but a graphical chart with the contour lines of the BMI categories marked is useful and appropriate, and until a free use chart is available, this table is an acceptable alternative. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred">Caer’s whines</small></a> 01:02, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Whether the interwiki links are correct or not, the book itself is genuine.

As such, I can check the copyright violation. Yes, the entire "Preface" section of this article is copied word-for-word from the book.
<p>The majority of the article comprises a sample from the book and several quoted book reviews, written in the first person. This isn't an encyclopaedia article on a book. It's what one would expect to see at Amazon. There's probably an encyclopaedia article to write on the various ways to tie a tie. But that would be <i>about the subject</i>, not <i>about the book on the subject</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The book passes <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> for at least having multiple non-trivial reviews by third parties, including "Scientific American" magazine. True, Google gives me only 850 or so general hits, which boils down to only 257 distinct hits, but there are several reviews in this lot beyond the dozens of book sales. There are also several listings of articles based on the book, which is apparently a derivative of knot theory, which in turn also meets <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a>. Downsides are the article does appear to be an ad, and it lacks sources and <i>verification in the article itself</i>. The real problem I'm having however is in the nomination, which doesn't actually state grounds for deletion. "Seems a bit suspicious"? Reads "like" an advert. "May" be copyvio. One fake Interwiki?

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> This site has been cleaned up by an editor. All others should desist from petty political comment or bias. As a candidate for the election Mr Jackon deserves equal courtesy with every other candidate. That's democracy folks. If you don't understand this principle then you need to take a course or two in civics or politics. The proposed deletion is unwarranted because the article has now been edited by a professional journalist and editor, who happens to have close knowledge of Jackson. This information is relevant for voters. Jackson is well known to many other editors and journalists. He has been a columnist for a widely distributed periodical.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article is no longer an autobiography. Vanity items have been edited ruthlessly, and it now conforms to the neutral POV policy. Please stay out of other people's electorates and what you think they need to know for this election, or your personal views on notability. Jackson's profile and recognition in this electorate is very high. Please would you now remove the autobiographical tag. Editor at large.144.138.196.103 10:48, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article about a sort of white magic cult that pretends it can teach its followers supernatural self-defense. Now in all fairness the article attempts to debunk this a bit but all in all, this is a non-notable group. You do find a bit of Google hits but mostly because videos of practitionners have been circulated on the likes of YouTube and because the practitionners have been fairly vocal about their claims.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: if we have relevant citations by end of 2006, we'll have an article by end of 2006. Currently, it's not (yet) notable. I still haven't seen defense of that anywhere. If an article is recreated, you are correct: that is grounds for speedy deletion.... however, these things aren't done blindly.

<p>Third, At what point would it be ok to create a page for this site?</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The article has gone through a considerable amount of improvements here. But major issues have to be addressed here. For example, a <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=allintitle:++%22+Movement+and+Action+for+Social+Services%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=allintitle:++%22+Movement+and+Action+for+Social+Services%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">google search</a> on the organization this subject had established, have only about three or four unique hits. The closest NPOV website to this organization is <a href="http://worldaidscampaign.info/index.php/wac/wac/partners/movement_and_action_for_social_services_mass" class="external text" title="http://worldaidscampaign.info/index.php/wac/wac/partners/movement_and_action_for_social_services_mass" rel="nofollow">this</a>. The organization so far, did not achieve anything notable. Thus, this subject is the founder of a non-notable organization. A <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=allintitle:++%22Rajeev+Kumar%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=100&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=allintitle:++%22Rajeev+Kumar%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=100&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">google search</a> on his name shows about 500 hits. But there is a problem here. This is quite a common name which produces various different occupations on the same namesake of the subject in the article. And as far as I am aware of, the subject in question only has a few google hits which is consistent to the content of the article. Quite a number of hits also shows non-English websites as well. Considering these factors, it is quite difficult to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the subject from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. However, there is no question in my research, that this subject exists and a founder of an organization. But is the subject encyclopedic in nature? That is the key question one must ask. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 14:53, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

To make a long story short for anyone who <i>doesn't</i> want to dig through all of that: this page and many, many others like it were created by an editor who spoke little english and wasn't interested in communicating with other community members.

Finally he was blocked for his refusal to respond to the concerns of others. Right now the consensus is that these articles need drastic clean-up, but should not be deleted. <a href="../../../m/o/-/User%7EMo-Al_4913.html" title="User:Mo-Al">User:Mo-Al</a> and others are beginning to work on some of them, but it will take a long time before they get to them all.

<li><b>Comment</b> (from the user's blocking admin). Like most of the user's "onomastics" pages, this contains no verifiable info on onomastics. Unfortunately it currently serves as combination of several disambiguation pages, so simply deleting this will not decrease the headache.

<li><b>Keep</b>.The experimental work appears to be occuring in a relatively open manner, initial experiments appear to show a positive result, the work is attracting interest from several notable sources and has been written up in popular science journals. My personal view is that the theory is wrong, conservation of energy and momentum are maintained, and the positive results so far are measurement error due to small differences between large numbers. BUT as long as the artcile gives fair weight within the wiki policy to both claims and doubts, there is no reason for us to pre-judge the science by removing it from view, and we should continue to reflect the debate. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilUK_69f3.html" title="User:NeilUK">NeilUK</a> 15:11, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not a "scientific claim". This is not generating "this much controversy", because its not controversial, and everyone agrees its junk. It should be deleted because it is not notable. WP should not contain articles on every bogus culture blip out there. In particular, there are many many many print magazines out there, and at this time, WP does not have an article about every topic that was ever discussed in a printed magazine. WP does not even have an article about every printed magazine ever published: I (+my parents) have current subscriptions to almost a dozen magazines, which have been in print for 40-50 years, for which there does not even exist a WP overview! Ergo, just because some topic appears in some magazine doesn't mean that the topic is "notable". Its got a lot lot lot farther to go before it becomes notable. I don't want to see WP filling up with drivel, because the drivel is unmaintainable. Its a crank magnet that invites dimwits with too much time on their hands to sap the energy and goodwill of capable WP editors, breeds hostile edit wars, and is generally harmful to the WP camraderie.

<dd>Hmmm, surely the article's source is the New Scientist article, the emdrive.com web site, and the online magazine articles listed in the external links section? Or am I confused about terminology here? Shawyer performed original research and published his unsourced original research in the form of his paper and his responses to interviews, and we're documenting those sources? I've done some background reading (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) and I've not found anything that disqualifies this article, in my understanding of it. It's not original research (I gather it would be if Shawyer came here and wrote his own article). It's NPoV since we're writing it as a documentation of what Shawyer has claimed, not writing his claims as fact. Etc. Is there a concensus that it has to have a peer-reviewed journal article to be mentioned? I'd say that it should have a peer-reviewed journal article to be mentioned *as fact*, but at least in my contributions, I've tried to document it as a *claim* rather than a *fact*. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaric_76d5.html" title="User:Alaric">Alaric</a> 14:47, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am very disappointed that <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a> has been publishing this kind of wild-eyed story. The basic problem with the article is seen in this passage: <i>"since it violates well-established principles such as the conservation of momentum. One potential weakness of the theoretical basis given for the EmDrive is that it may not be valid to use the group velocity of a wave in a calculation of the radiation pressure; however, if Shawyer's experimental evidence is indeed valid, then this would appear not to be a problem."</i> The problem with this is that these three considerations do not all carry equal weight! Violation of conservation of momentum is just about the <i>gravest imaginable theoretical objection to any alleged engineering device</i>; this objection makes any alleged "experiment verification" of an apparently small claimed effect (recall the alleged purpose is to adjust spacecraft orbits) <i>extremely suspect</i>. Another major problem with articles like this and comments like some of those above: in many previous cases, inventors looking to attract private capital have made <i>vastly overblown claims of stated interest</i> by <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a>, etc. Regarding the (now defunct) <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakthrough_Propulsion_Physics_Program_e398.html" title="Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program">Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program</a>, Marc Millis recently <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics.research/browse_thread/thread/cf00e68355286a4a?lnk=st&amp;q=Millis+group%3Asci.physics.research&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics.research/browse_thread/thread/cf00e68355286a4a?lnk=st&amp;q=Millis+group%3Asci.physics.research&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">posted a comment</a> in sci.physics.research deprecating some wild claims by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hutchison_7a13.html" title="John Hutchison">John Hutchison</a> anti-gravity fanatics in the Wikipedia which Lina should probably examine.

In particular, note that Egan makes the same points that I, SCZenz, and others have made: in the physics community, New Scientist is increasingly regarded as the scientific analogue of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_National_Enquirer_eb23.html" title="The National Enquirer">The National Enquirer</a>; contrary to the impression left by the cited article, the so-called EM drive appears to be firmly in the arena of pseudoscience, as suggested by the fact that the "inventor's" claims for this device would appear to violate conservation of momentum,</li>
<li>Several recent New Scientist articles, which in my opinion should never have been published, including the one critiqued by Egan, have been uncritically cited at the WIkipedia. While I understand why several voters here have stated that they feel the article should be kept but neutralized, I feel these voters underestimate the tenacity of the POV-pushing users, and I respectively request that in the near future they spend some time assisting members of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Physics_630e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Pseudoscience_7116.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Pseudoscience">Wikipedia:WikiProject Pseudoscience</a> members in trying to neutralize some older problem articles as well as EM drive, which appears very likely to become a new problem article in the physics pages here:

<li><b>Delete</b> This research has not been published in a peer reviewed format, nor has it been independently verified. Given that it seems to violate one of the most fundamental principles of physics, this would constitute an extraordinary claim, which (as the aphorism goes) requires extraordinariy evidence. This extraordinary evidence is currently completely lacking. One of the arguments used to justify keeping it in wikipedia is that it was a cover story in New Scientist. However, we have to keep in mind the different goals of the wikipedia project (encyclopedic in scope, but also in quality) and a science magaizine like New Scientist (profit and increased interest in science). So, although this research project *might* be notable for a science magazine, it is not yet of encyclopedic quality. <a href="../../../e/d/h/User%7EEdhubbard_3245.html" title="User:Edhubbard">Edhubbard</a> 20:12, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Mark it as a "Current Event" if you will. If the science doesn't work, we'll record the EmDrive as being a failure. If it does work... well... then that'd be awesome.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The number one source suggesting that this is junk science (which is different from pseudo-science) is that it violates the well-established princliple of conservation of energy. This in itself suggests that the claims here would require extraordinary evidence, and as of yet, there is nothing published in reliable, respected, peer-reviewed journals. Not a single article. Just an interview in New Scientist, and a single conference presentation. We have to get away from the idea that New Scientist is in the business of only publishing well-established scientific facts. As there is nothing published yet in favor of this effect, other scientists have not yet been able to evaluate and examine the claims. To refute a claim you need to be able to properly examine it, which scientists cannot do on the basis of a New Scientist article alone. <a href="../../../e/d/h/User%7EEdhubbard_3245.html" title="User:Edhubbard">Edhubbard</a> 07:47, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

You'll note that we don't say perpetual motion is possible, but we do have an <i>article</i> on it. That's why I'm voting keep. Because it's NOTABLE, even if it hasn't been peer reviewed yet. It's notable enough that aparently the US goverment has either been bamboozled by it, or is jumping onto the next big thing. Either way, that's pretty notable. And when the results come in, we can either report on how the US government picked up on a peice of junk science, or how they're going to develop it to make spaceships or flying cars or whatever.

<dd>My comment wasn't so much related to the vote for deletion (although it's relevant there, too) but mostly in reply to your comment "For those of you voting delete because you call it psuedoscience... well... then shouldn't you be able to find sources to refute the claims made in the article? That'd be a service to us all... showing how it doesn't work." The point I was making above is that you are asserting notability based on an idea that has no peer reviewed publications, but then want the nay-sayers to provide the counter-evidence. At this point, the burden of proof is not on the nay-sayers, but rather on the EmDrive proponents, who must provide the extraordinary evidence for their extraordinary claims... that's how science works. Also, citing something doesn't necessary mean that NASA has been bamboozled. Scientists will often cite competing data or hypothesis to point out how their results contradict the articles they cite. <a href="../../../e/d/h/User%7EEdhubbard_3245.html" title="User:Edhubbard">Edhubbard</a> 19:04, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To expand a little on Edhubbard's comment, since this is something that's been bothering me lately. Some things <i>are</i> just nonsense, be they pseudoscience, junk science, or whatever. Many of them are so transparently rubbish that no-one bothers publishing a peer-reviewed, serious article pointing out exactly <i>why</i> they are rubbish, leaving this work to the bloggers, "skeptic sites", etc. However, if the nonsense in question has a Wikipedia article, it too often proves impossible to use the article to "educate" people as to why the subject is nonsense, because there exist no "reliable sources" giving criticism of it, resulting in all criticism being reverted as "original research" or in the name of "NPOV". Even if the criticism added amounts merely to the application of generally well-accepted scientific principles, the "citation needed" tags spring up all over it, and it gets removed eventually, or forms a horrendous drain on whatever poor editor volunteers to shepherd the article). Hence the article ends up being a hagiography of the nonsense, which simply does not do for an encyclopaedia. Since Wikipedia is not a science-related news blog, there is no reason to report on phenomena which have not generated a decent amount of material in the peer-reviewed literature, and hence EmDrive doesn't yet have a place here. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 06:40, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This need not be either pseudo-science or correct. It could be a stastical artifact, measurement error, or many other possible factors that haven't been possible to examine yet, since as I noted in my vote for delete above, there are *no* peer reviewed articles on this effect. None. New Scientist is not in the business of providing peer review or scientific examination, and they may be guilty of promoting what turns out to be an honest error (at best). It may turn out be like <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a>, another seemingly impossible claim that does not generally hold up to closer scientific scrutiny, and which has been rejected by the majority of the scientific community. Until there is at least some sort of peer review of the theory and experiments, we cannot even be sure that there is not a simple math error here (this applies, too, to the comment above by Fieari; how can we evaluate something that has only been "published" in the sciene equivalent of the Enquirer?).

<li><b>Keep</b> Simply because it may be pseudoscience (and if so, one that has convinced a number of goverment agencies) doesn't mean it warrants an automatic delete. Without any clear and obvious proof that a) it does wildly violate laws of physics, and b) no one but an extreme lunatic fringe takes it seriously, it appears to be generating enough interest to warrant an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> for two reasons (a) If this is a real science, it should be kept. If a pseudoscientist succeeded to convince NASA in importance of his "research" which violates one of the fundamental laws of physics, such an unusual story certainly should be kept. (b) Anything which draws attention of many people deserves an article. Cover story in New Scientist means that lots of people know about this issue, so it deserves to be mentioned on wikipedia.</li>

Take <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Johnson_%28radio%29_ff63.html" title="Bob Johnson (radio)">Bob Johnson (radio)</a> for example. All he has done is produce a relatively minor radio show, and once filled in for a presenter when he was ill. Yet apparently he is 'really notable' even though he only produces a radio show heard by 500,000 people a night. TMF meanwhile broadcasts to an audience of a million people a day, and she is pretty much on it daily.

<li><b>Keep</b> - TMF is a free to air station in the UK, and therefore has potentially one of, if not the, largest audience for a music channel in the country. TMF Live, which Kate presents is also a core part of the channel's schedule being both daily, and the only live output produced by TMF UK. I would therefore dispute these are minor shows.

<li><b>Keep</b>: On the point that ten-tenths is non-notable - this is incorrect. Tenths is one of the biggest internet forums for motorsport alongside such sites as Motorsportforums and Speed channel's forums. Tenths has previously had its own radio show run by <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globecast.html" title="Globecast">Globecast</a> Radio, and has a number of high profile members who obviously give tenths notority - including <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Rahal_a674.html" title="Bobby Rahal">Bobby Rahal</a>, Martin Haven, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Huff_31e1.html" title="Robert Huff">Robert Huff</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_O%27Neill_1fb7.html" title="Paul O'Neill">Paul O'Neill</a> just to name a few.</li>

<dl>
<dd>On the point that no third part sources are available - firstly I ask that any decision on this is postponed as the person that created the page is currently unavailable, and it would be unfair not to give him chance to name any sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, the only element that is unsourced is the history to the site. The other sections (eg. the present content of the site) is easily verified just by looking at the site and seeing what is there, a primary source which is therefore undisputable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, I state that internet forums are extremely difficult to find sources for - on the whole the only source can be the site itself. There are many other examples on wikipedia where internet forums are also without independent sources to clarify their origins, and to delete them all for this reason would destroy the category. (for examples, Christian Forums, E-Sangha has no sources as regards history, <a href="../../../x/-/e/X-Entertainment_e3af.html" title="X-Entertainment">X-Entertainment</a> has no independent sources - these being three examples from three random selections from the category list) <a href="../../../m/2E/a/User%7EM.Aspin_da7e.html" title="User:M.Aspin">Asp</a> 10:39, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Lack of sources is a major problem with this article in general, however, time should be given to see if verifability can be established - particularly as it is reported above that article creator is unavailable and he will obviously be best placed to add citations if possible.

<li><b>Neutral</b> I see nothing wrong with ten-tenths having an article on wikipedia, but it should make sure that some of the facts are correct in the article. For example it says that ten-tenths was one of the few sites 'approved' to use the new vBulletin software. Which is incorrect, anybody could use the software as long as they paid for it, no 'approval' necessary. Also Craig Antill didn't come up with the idea of co-branding, MotorsportForums.com was co-branding its own forums for approx 9 months before ten-tenths launched its own version and then only when Jelsoft (the makers of vBulletin) included it as a standard software feature. (Declaration: I'm the owner of Motorsport Forums which could be deemed a competitor site thus I'm reluctant to edit the article itself I could be seen not to be neutral in the matter)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, there is nothing called a "Halloween yard." Some people decorate their yards on Halloween, (and how they do so is adequately covered at <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a>) but we don't have an article called Christmas living room for the same reason we shouldn't have one here. That reason is that the concept of a yard during Halloween is not considered seperate enough from the general concept of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> in the same way that, say, a <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Lantern_b598.html" title="Jack O'Lantern">Jack O'Lantern</a> is. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 17:26, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> browsing the website I see that GCN appears to have all of ten employees, receives 3000 visits per day and transmits about 25GB per month. Lets assume that they broadcast 24 or 48kbps (which seems to be about what most iTunes radio stations broadcast) 25GB * 8 = 200gb/month divided by 30 = 6.66gb per day / 24 = 277mb per hour / 60 = 4629 kb / minute = 77kbps. So at any given time only 1-3 people are listening to this station online. If we assume that every listener listens for one hour than each listener is receiving 86400kb @24kbps and 172800 @48kbps, this would give the station 1150 or 2300 listeners a month.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I couldn't find any affiliate list on the GCN site, but it's <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standing_operating_procedure.html" title="Standing operating procedure">SOP</a> for American radio networks to not offer a full affiliate list to the public, as most of the stations that would be on it only carry one or two of the network's shows. I went to some individual show websites instead; here's "The Joe Mazza Show' listing 12 stations <a href="http://www.joemazzashow.com/stations.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.joemazzashow.com/stations.htm" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, the "Bobby Likis Car Clinic" (claims 100+ affiliates plus a slot on <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirius_Satellite_Radio_4c94.html" title="Sirius Satellite Radio">Sirius</a>) <a href="http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/04/06/188083.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/04/06/188083.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, and of course <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_9070.html" title="Alex Jones">Alex Jones</a> (listing 42 stations if my quick eyeballing of the page is correct) <a href="http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/04/06/188083.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/04/06/188083.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>.

<p>Article claims notability, but searching Google, I've had difficulty pulling up information on this artist.

<li><b>Comment</b>: LOL, I wish we could keep this on its comedy value alone. His "music videos" are just him videotaping stuff from the side of his car while playing 50 Cent music over it. If this is Slovenia's most famous gangster rapper, then he must be Solvenia's <i>only</i> gangster rapper. Seriously though, I think this fails the policy on notability and needs to be <b>delete</b>d. - <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunch_22cb.html" title="User:Runch">Runch</a> 20:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Some thoughts from the author:</li>
</ul>
<p>Wildthing61476 and Runch: you are correct, Slovenian rap is still very small and is still evolving. Mr.B has not yet published his CD, so looking him up on Slovenian web shops will be useless. You mentioned, that there were very little information on Mr.B, i agree with that totally, that is why i started to write this article - i summarised (yes with my own words&#160;:) ) his interview for a Slovenian tabloid and included my own interview (most of it is in the article). To get some more info, please try googling for "lordbebo" - without the quotations (lordbebo is a second alias from Mr.B). He went by that nickname when he started, so many people still use that name, and some know him only by that name. He is extremely popular on internet boards, beacouse he had published some of his writings, lyrics and music freely on internet, and boards are the best place for people for exchange toughts on his work, not to mention that 95% of topics you will find were not opened by Mr.B but his fans that copy pasted his works.</p>
<p>Runc said, that his videos are just him driving in a car and playing 50 cent. I partially agree, <b>but</b> only the first two videos are made like that. As i have written, he got some more money for the third video, so semi-proffesional cameras etc. were used. And i don't think he drives around and plays 50 cent in the last one&#160;:).</p>
<p>Also if you check the counter on the page where his videos were uploaded, you will see, that it has literally thousands of views (first video - 2227 views, second video - 6052 views and the third one only 550 views, if you do not believe the numbers, please check the links provided in my article!). But these videos are the low quality ones, the quality was reduced, so that these pages can host them. The bigger files are hosted on private servers, but there are no counters, so i cannot say for sure how many downloads. Maby you will think that approximately 9 thousands of views is not much, but it is in my land with only 2 million population.</p>
<p>Also his video and music was published on a DVD and CD, that comes with a computer magazine called Joker ( if i am not mistaken, it is the most popular computer magazine in Slovenia, i will provide the number of subscribers later after i contact the editor of the magazine). If their website could provide excact informations on what is on the dvd i would gladly provide you the proof, but sadly he had fallen under the "misc" section, so there is no explicit mentioning of him on the homepage. I will call my friend, so he can make some screenshots of the dvd, to prove that i am not lying about that. Danny Lilithborne: When you can, please provide some reasons on deleting the article i will try to answer them as best i can&#160;:)</p>
<p>Worker21, the writer of the Wikipedia article on Mr.B</p>
<p>I have just recieved a screenshot that my friend made. It was on the runnable CD that was added to the latest computer magazine Joker, the picture can be found here <a href="http://img81.imageshack.us/img81/5478/gospodarwicale2.jpg" class="external free" title="http://img81.imageshack.us/img81/5478/gospodarwicale2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img81.imageshack.us/img81/5478/gospodarwicale2.jpg</a> (if translated to English: MP3 Gospodar Wiča, that was made by a Slovenian rapper Mr.B). I still have to contact my other friend that has the DVD edition (they come seperately, depends on the type of subsctription), the video is on the DVD. I am still waiting for the response, from the magazine editor, on the number of subscribers for this magazine. If it is necessary i will add these pictures to the article as well</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The artist doesn't meet the criteria set out in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. It requires at least two albums released on major record labels or a charted hit- neither of these have been achieved. One tabloid interview doesn't meet criteria of multiple non-trivial independent sources. Maybe some other time when he becomes famous and notable, but not now.--<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 18:26, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

delete him because he is a fake and he only made 3 songs which he didn't even seriously think about selling. also the picture of him on the first page of a tabloid has been faked because the text next to it refers to something completely different. i also doubt anybody who is not a member of the mn3njalnik forum knows about him.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> from author:</li>
</ul>
I've decided to completely edit my arcticle and mostla gather <u>all</u> proofs that Mr.B is not just some random dude which thinks that it would be really cool to be on Wikipedia&#160;:). By proofs i mean scanning the other magazine he appeared in, which i did not know until recently. Thanks to Runch that pointed out a few mistakes i made unintentionally ( the article is titled the famous gangster but shuld be mr.b oufcourse&#160;:) ). And i will read the article about musicians on wikipedia more thoroughly.
<p>And a little comment to the anonymous comment: you say he made 3 songs? if i know rap, he only made one song (only one is mentioned in the article, the others will surely be in the next and improved article about mr.b), the rest are from 50 cent. But maby i am mistaken, *rolls eyes*&#160;:). Any you say he is only known on one board called mn3njalnik? Use google please, before writing such nonsene.</p>
<p>I will answer other accussations from the dearest anonymous comentator when i return from school&#160;:)</p>

If she were the author of the entry, I don't she would have put "c. 1980" for year of birth, which I put only because I knew her age but not her birthdate. Of all the local playwrights that have had their work put on in Indianapolis, she is the only one I know of to be dubbed a "local genius" by the alternative press, and I concur with that monicker. 169 hits is quite a lot for someone to be tagged "non-notable" and I think we'll hear more form her in the future. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottandrewhutchins_fac3.html" title="User:Scottandrewhutchins">Scottandrewhutchins</a> 04:06, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Essentially, CCCP is just a collection of slightly modified, already extant software, so I don't really see any place else for it to be mentioned or for the article to be merged into.

<dd>Can you provide a reliable source that supports your assertion that "CCCP is a very widely used codec pack"? Also, the fact that a wiki exists for CCCP doesn't mean the article is not being used in the fashion of a guide.

For example one could state (and use the project page itself as a source here) that the codec pack was created to standardize playback of video files, so that instead of having to deal with different playback setups on every computer, one could simply install this one pack and be sure it would work with all video designed to work under the pack. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 18:55, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. In spite of its name it is not a "codec pack" but a playback solution used by numerous groups involved in movie encoding. It is the recommended playback solution by the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matroska.html" title="Matroska">Matroska</a> team and by tens of release groups in the Anime community, and used by tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of users. As the current encoding and playback standard as well as being the standard playback solution for Matroska playback, it does deserve its place. The article documents a widespread standard playback solution. As such, deletion would be wrong wrong, and if anything needs to be done about the article it should be edited instead. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikademus_7048.html" title="User:Mikademus">Mikademus</a> 18:47, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain for now</b>. I'm curious as to what constitutes a reliable source. It's rare for free software to be reviewed by "reliable" third parties because the purpose of such reviews is to help the consumer make an informed decision with their money. Numerous software articles on Wikipedia do not cite sources other than their homepage. If the homepage is not considered reliable then these other software articles should be deleted as well, or other sources should be found. (e.g. the integral component of CCCP, <a href="../../../f/f/d/Ffdshow.html" title="Ffdshow">ffdshow</a>). POV is not a legitimate reason to delete in my opinion, because it is something that can be fixed. The only reason I can see to delete this article is if the sources from which the article is composed are deemed unreliable, hence making it hopeless to reform. --<a href="../../../k/a/m/User%7EKamasutra_0819.html" title="User:Kamasutra">Kamasutra</a> 20:56, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

The only real problem I see is that it is base entirely on primary sources and needs secondary sources to balance it. It could also include information on its affects on the fansubbing community and what criticism it has received, if any. But those alone aren't enough to delete this article. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 21:22, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Addendum</b> One of the reasons I missed in the original rational is that the article is a manual or guide. But I don't see how this can be interpreted as such. The page doesn't give any instructions on how to download, install, configure, or use the software. What it does is introduce the subject, give a brief history, explain why it was created, and gives a list of features and what other components make up the pack. None of which constitutes a guide. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 11:48, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a fairly notable codec pack. Maybe the article needs to be wikified more, but not deleted. <b><a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../h/o/b/User_talk%7EHobbeslover_fb13.html" title="User talk:Hobbeslover">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hobbeslover_dec5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hobbeslover">contribs</a></sup> 22:15, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - strikes me as notable. I don't even use it (or windows), but I'm aware of it and I see the justification for the claims that it's better than most other codec packs.

<li><b>don't delete</b> wait why is this going to be deleted?? Is it just because of the picture or what? If it is that's stupid. College Vanity?? Where does it say anywhere that this dorm is better than anyother one? Or is just having a wiki for a dorm considered vanity? If so, then having a wiki for anything is vanity...so wiki's shouldn't exist. I'm new here, so I don't understand all the rules, but I want to learn, so someone please let me know what rules this page is breaking, and why? thanks. Usammon

<li><b>Comment</b>: I just read the article and the discussion on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">political correctness</a> and I'm not sure how the issues there relate here. I didn't read any comments about how well established that term was - most of the commentary revolved around the controversey of the article. Could you elaborate? I'm new to Wikipedia and sort of new to all this but trying to catch on quickly.

<li>They do not directly relate here. They (various editors) were not accepting examples for political correctness. The requirement was: The term must have been established for years. It is a while ago. By the way see the talk page of Modifiable Multimedia; probably there is another article which alread covers the concept.<br /></li>

<p>This page is describing a form of <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_innovation.html" title="User innovation">end-user innovated</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collaborative_software.html" title="Collaborative software">collaborative software</a> that is neither unique to multimedia nor requires multiple forms of media.

<p>Modifiable multimedia is more than a form of software - it also describes a framework by which multimedia content can be structured so that its modifiable and thus more affordable. Part of this framework approach does involve the use of specific types of software, however, it doesn't have to only be collaborative software. In many cases, automated software processes will drive data to multimedia files (e.g., news title, stock tickers, weather, GIS locations) and cause updates without human intervention.</p>
<p>Modifiable multimedia also encompasses the use of different styles interface design, storyline planning, concept development, workflow and planning for copywriting than in traditional multimedia concepting and production. For example, a multimedia presentation that can be modified also requires that the authors plan navigation differently and identify cases where that navigation might also need to change based on content that is removed/inserted. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndless_blue_2cba.html" title="User:Endless blue">Endless blue</a> 20:44, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If there is a different level of activity here, it probably falls under the category of <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamic_web_content.html" title="Dynamic web content">Dynamic web content</a>. If the article suggests that dynamic media content is used in much broader applications than online media, then it should be under the category of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_media.html" title="Electronic media">electronic media</a> or dynamic data-driven media. In any case, unless the level of interactive is only possible with multiple forms of media, it shouldn't be considered part of a multimedia subject. The multimedia discipline is taking into consideration the skills and technologies of <b>combining</b> multiple forms of content, instead of the technology associated with the separate content forms. 75.80.181.224 05:09, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I thought about your suggestions and I still think that there are important distinctions in modifiable multimedia that make it a poor fit into one of those categories. Modifiable multimedia does not have to be web content. It could be a multimedia presentation playing on a Plasma screen in a corporate office that changes over time, or it could be a a CD ROM with a multimedia (text, images, animations) interface whose data (images, text) can update via web services like <a href="../../../s/o/a/SOAP_4de9.html" title="SOAP">SOAP</a>. Electronic media on the other hand seems much broader and nebulous. It covers more than just multimedia, and the concept of modifiability is subsumed in it, however its important to note that while modifiable web pages that are not multimedia have been possible since the advent of the web, modifiable multimedia interfaces are truly a new thing made possible with continuing advanceds in Flash, Java, etc. I would also suggest we consolidate discussion in the article deletion thread: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Modifiable_Multimedia_e88b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Modifiable Multimedia">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Modifiable_Multimedia</a>. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndless_blue_2cba.html" title="User:Endless blue">Endless blue</a> 19:02, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand that what is called modifiable multimedia describes a level of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactivity.html" title="Interactivity">interactivity</a> unavailable in previous years. There is always going to be emerging technologies that have big impacts on <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_media.html" title="Electronic media">electronic media</a>, static <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media.html" title="Media">media</a>, and the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_ecology.html" title="Media ecology">media ecology</a>. However, it's not that often that technology changes enough to warrant a new term. Technological buzzwords are short lived as technology is constantly developing. Unless there is new hardware (like the router), new formats (like digital), revolutionary concepts (like DOS, OOP, GUI), or revolutionary languages (like Java), there usually isn't enough change in technology to justify a new term. Excessive variations of terms and excessive definitions of terms for existing technology only makes it hard to grasp the broader more important breakthroughs. The risk is that these buzzwords catch on before there meaning is fully understood. This only contributes to the vagueness. The lack of consensus surrounding the full meaning of a term can lead to a lack of collaboration in utilizing the technology the term is describing.</p>
<p>I did a google search on "modifiable multimedia". The full term that came up was "User-modifiable Multimedia Applications". My suggestion is to find the best application of what is called modifiable multimedia and add the relevant information to the pages where that application is being discussed. There is already a page on <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_innovation.html" title="User innovation">User innovation</a>. If it's not user innovation that's important, then it must be either <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personalized.html" title="Personalized">user-personalized</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data-driven_design.html" title="Data-driven design">data-driven</a> that makes it important. If it's not the end user who is modifying the content, it's nothing special because most online content is modifiable to some degree. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 09:28, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is still an important distinction though that wasn't covered by your quick search. Modifiable multimedia can be "user modifiable", <b>or</b> it can be modifiable by third parties or administrators (e.g., teachers who want to reuse a multimedia template where they can upload assessment materials, videos, etc. and create multimedia lessons tailored for specific classes or even topics). What you're describing is related more to context driven changes in multimedia - e.g., allowing a user to select his/her favorite music track while browsing a site. That is different that administrator-modifiable-multimedia. Both forms of modifiability are subsumed under "modifiable multimedia". I want to stress again that the main reason this concept is significant is that it makes multimedia interactions more affordable to deploy, thus opening up new possibilities in education, marketing, e-commerce, customer service, and so forth. What you say taht "most online content is modifiable", it should be pointed out again that multimedia does not need to be <b>online</b> and furthermore, multimedia is more difficult to update and make data-driven than text or alphanumeric content like an HTML file. Really this concept covers all of the articles (and more) that you list above. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndless_blue_2cba.html" title="User:Endless blue">Endless blue</a> 22:01, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I emphasize again that <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_innovation.html" title="User innovation">user innovation</a> is a higher level of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactivity.html" title="Interactivity">interactivity</a>, which seems to be the significance of modifiable-multimedia. Even if the page remains and is linked to all relative pages, <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_innovation.html" title="User innovation">user innovation</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactivity.html" title="Interactivity">interactivity</a> will be researched before a term such as modifiable-multimedia by those most interested. A google search shows 74,600 hits on the phrase "user innovation" in quotation marks compared to 92 hits under "modifiable multimedia". Rather than use a vague term to promote such an important concept, it's better to use more popular terms to support the concept if it's that important. The best way to do this is link the concepts as with the most popular terms to each other. This is why I suggest you put them on the pages to which they are relevant. Noticed when you added the term to the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multimedia.html" title="Multimedia">Multimedia</a> page, I replaced it with user-innovation, the more popular term for the enhanced level of interactivity you described. Like wise, you could add multimedia to the user innovation page and explain how multimedia can be user innovated (modifiable) on that page. You could even create a new page and call it user innovated multimedia that would probably be received better. It's comparing the words "modifiable" with "user innovated" that makes me uneasy about the term. Modifiable is so broad, it could dilute the importance of user innovation in this concept. You may even get more hits on the Polar Design web page with the term user innovation in the subtext.&#160;;) <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 02:52, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the first sentence of the article states, <cite>Near-visible EMR is the frequency range from far-infrared to far-utraviolet</cite>. This looks wrong right off the bat.

<li><b>Keep</b> It can be verified, as many of the wikipedia articles on pornographic actresses state that the actresses are known for anal scenes and there are award categories for anal scenes at adult film emmys AVN's? I think, or whatever they are called. It should be moved inside the list of pornographic actors <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_porn_stars.html" title="List of porn stars">List of porn stars</a> list--Onitsuh 21:37, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Having a separate article listing a different niche within the pornography industry is valid. Wikipedia.com browsers may want access to specific actresses who have, I assume, solely performed anal sex in their career. All a matter of convenience, for them that is. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellwing_cd92.html" title="User:Hellwing">Hellwing</a> 00:14, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

As far as I can tell, this article is not intended to be a list of porn actresses who limited their activity on film/video exclusively to anal sex, but to any porn actresses who ever performed anal sex on film/video. If so, it would probably be a long and not particularly useful list, because I don't believe such activity is rare among contemporary porn actresses. --75.0.159.208 03:12, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> According to amazon.com, this "book" (ASIN: B0006YL5G8) is an unknown binding published by Awana in 1978. So its self-published by Latham's group a decade before he died. It isn't even in print and has Amazon.com Sales Rank: of 2,191,303-- Just 190,000 shy of cracking the top two million. That "book" does not pass notablity criteria. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 17:08, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - older stuff google is poor-ish (and not exactly the kind of thing that easily makes its way) but thereis some essence of verifiablility/.encyclopaedic value here.

<p>Does this book blurb need its own article? The author has her own page where her books are all listed, but only this book has its own page. The summary seems very much a blurb for the book. If there is something notable about the author's beliefs/practices, it seems to me it'd be better on the author's page. Eileen R 23:07, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Sorry Eileen, the book does appear on many libraries shelves' and is spread over the world. That alone allows the book to pass the current notability guidelines.
