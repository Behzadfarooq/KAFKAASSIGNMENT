<li>Of course there's a small chance that this is the trigger that gets Geoff S. to register and become a valued editor, starting with improvements to this article.

<p>This page does not seem to be describing a design pattern but more an element of object encapsulation. It seems to be defining an aggregate pattern as a design method that allows data members to be operated on by routines built into their containing object. This is a fairly trivial property of OO design.</p>
<p>Asides from this semantic issue, the article itself is littered with terrible English, with many spelling and grammer mistakes that render it virtually unintelligible. The code examples are entirely unelucidiating, and much of the information is described seemingly from the perspective of a Perl programmer, rather than being a language agnostic description of the methodology.

<li><b>Delete</b> Hoax/joke, almost bordering on nonsense. From the article: <i>"The series was mainly on only disco music, and the characters in the series is unknown."</i> Gee, you'd think that for a show that had been on the air for a full 4 years, somebody out there would remember the characters. 4 years would be considered a triumph by the standards of cartoon series, which typically have rather short lifetimes. Transformers, for example, ran in the US for three seasons. Ducktales, the longest-running Disney cartoon, lasted two seasons. Tiny Toon Adventures lasted 3 seasons. So for a network cartoon series to last a full four years, it would have been one of the most popular/famous cartoons of its time, and certainly would be at least vaguely remembered now. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 15:19, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - I do not think it is a good idea for wikipedians who know little about another country or culture to start proposing articles from that culture or country for deletion. As per the nomination by this same user for a Malaysian related article (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Jiwang_1522.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jiwang">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jiwang</a>), the user had made no attempt to discuss with wikipedians potenatially familiar with the topic as to whether the article was notable or not. Search engines are very likely to be biased against non-English subjects and it is not a useful test. To limit one's research to Google is unlikely to produce a good result. In an attempt to do my bit against countering {{WP:Bias|wikipedian bias]] I have left a note on the discussion of each user page listed under <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_Turkey_8d08.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians/Turkey">Wikipedia:Wikipedians/Turkey</a> as there appears to be no Turkish project page.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 00:51, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Further comment -I think there is a significant transcription issue with the spelling in the article. I suspect that the text I have copied below from the <a href="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/portal/default_en.asp?belgeno=2062" class="external text" title="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/portal/default_en.asp?belgeno=2062" rel="nofollow">Turkish Ministry for Culture web page on mausoleums etc around Istanbul</a> refers to the same person as the article.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Apart from the above, there are also a number of tombs in Istanbul belonging to historic personages who really lived and these tombs are visited like the tombs of the saints. The most striking of these is the tomb of Sheikh Vefa (d. 1491 ) in the Vefa district. Next to the Koca Mustafa Paşa Mosque is the <b>tomb of Sümbül Sinan Efendi, a member of the Halvetiye Order, who died in 1529</b>, that of Merkez Efendi (d.1552) in Yenikapı, of Karacaahmed in Üsküdar, of Emir Buharî (d.1516) in Fatih and the tomb of the then Sheikh-ul Islam Zembelli Ali Efendi (d. 1526) on the lower side of the Zeyrek Kilise (church) Mosque.</i></dd>

<dd>It would however be useful if somebody with more authority on Turkish or Islamic matters could confirm they are one and the same before I edit the article on the basis of this information --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 01:08, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - on the basis of clarifying information from User:MonsterOfTheLake (a <a href="../../../t/r/a/WP%7ETrans_d73f.html" title="WP:Trans">turkish speaker</a>) - this article is on a notable person who died in 1529 and whose tomb is a notable place to visit in Istanbul. The article needs to be redirected to Sümbül Efendi perhaps with reference to the alternate Sünbül Efendi- a seemingly more widely accepted transcription of his name from arabic script to European script. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 08:57, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Articles like this degenrating into lists is always a bad idea. Inevitably someone comes along and adds their favorite band that either no one or everyone likes, and the whole thing becomes a pile of crap that lists just about every band in existence. An <i>article</i> on this subject could be worthwhile, but not in list form. I imagine there's stuff to be said that hasn't been included in another cult related article. Mentioning a few of the best examples <i>within the text</i>, discouraging <i>ad nauseam</i> additions, could be good.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I created the page and have no relation or interest in the service. It is ongoing, viable service that exists and people are using. If you want to re-word it feel free, I just paraphrased stuff of the net, if it sounds market-speak, feel free to make it sound more neutral. The concerns should have been addressed in the talk page, or by editing the article first, instead of a VfD. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 15:42, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: A search for pages containing "cellphedia" but not containing "wikipedia" on Google amounts to a paltry 63 sites (if you allow "wikipedia", then it's still only 106), some of which reside on the same domain. In Cellphedia's current state, it only accepts the first incoming answer, so if it's wrong, you're sunk; therefore, it's not even particularly useful to those few people with access to it at the moment. My nomination stands. --<a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemiller226_eedc.html" title="User:Jemiller226">Jemiller226</a> 18:39, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you could say that in the article, instead of the VfD page, so readers who come to Wikipedia looking for information can learn more about it. BTW Google is a tool. There are 432 hits for "I am broccoli".. is that notable? <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 20:52, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>See comment above. I created the page and have no connection with them, how could it be advertising? Sounds, again, like a copy-edit issue. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 20:48, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It can be "advertising" if the apparent purpose of the article is to drive up awareness of the product or service. There does not have to be a financial connection in order for something to be considered advertising. Alexa doesn't even have a traffic ranking on this service yet. Since it's also not showing up on google, I am forced to conclude that it's not yet ready for a Wikipedia article. There is not enough <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> information to create a non-stub article. <b>Delete</b> but without prejudice against re-creation if/when it becomes a notable service. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:33, 5 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, there is no apparent purpose as you say. I thought it was notable, nothing else like it exists, it's an entirely new concept and way to organize technology, community and data. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 02:50, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>This could be a great article...but in the future. My nomination for deletion has nothing to do with my opinion of the cool factor of the service itself. I just don't think it's an article whose time has come quite yet. --<a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemiller226_eedc.html" title="User:Jemiller226">Jemiller226</a> 05:06, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wired News, May 12, 2005. As Wikipedia Founder Jimbo Wales completed negotiations with Cellphedia to incorporate the service into the not for profit Wikimedia enterprise, the users of Wikipedia had a vote of their own to delete any mention of Cellphedia. "It's simply not notable and is advertising" one Wikipedian was quoted as saying, who wished to remain anonymous.

<li>I agree, that there is research in the NASA BPP program, which is only crazy, but nevertheless notable. But the four examples I've put on VfD, where originally published by one author:
<dl>
<dd>Millis' "Challenge to Create the Space Drive," in the AIAA Journal of Propulsion and Power <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-107289.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then they were presented by this author on one NASA workshop <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-1998-208400.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-1998-208400.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and made it into one NASA press release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dd>Nothing more has been heard from this at NASA. No research was funded (nobody knows how to do any research in these directions). Check later NASA BPP publications, check with the <a href="http://search.nasa.gov/nasasearch/lb/search/advSearch.jsp" class="external text" title="http://search.nasa.gov/nasasearch/lb/search/advSearch.jsp" rel="nofollow">NASA search engine</a>, check their newest <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-2004-213082.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/TM-2004-213082.htm" rel="nofollow">summary</a>.</dd>

<p>i have just read the current Oliver McGill log and completely agree with the writer's opinion. The log is informative and humourous too. When reading the article it was clear to me that the writer is passionate and learned about McGill (not in a perverse way) and music in general.i was disappointed to discover that the log may be deleted as it will probably be replaced by some musically unknowlegdeable prude who has just copied and pasted an article from the net. It will be a great shame if this log is deleted and replaced with mediocrity.it must stay! 60.230.99.205 5 May 2005</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>: I am the author of this article and I have a few things to say: Firstly, 'Ollie McGill' returns 516,000 sites on Google, and the first 10 all refer to the musician. Secondly, the claim that he is not noteworthy is surprising, given that as a musician in Melbourne and Australia he is quite well known. We are talking here about a musician whose work and solos appear on the Australian charts - the latest Cat Empire album hit No. 1 here. On top of this, his style is quite unique, and though this area is shakily subjective, he is noteworthy on a purely musical level. Thirdly, he requires his own article as there is more room for discussion around specifically his music. Fourthly, I am in the middle of editing the page, and it would seem like the critics would do better to help me than ask for deletion. Fifthly, If Silversmith has a problem with people contributing only to causes they feel are worth contributing to, I'd like to know why. - User:144.132.112.125 11:21, 5 May 2005 (EST)</p>

<p>dear all, the article is a stout piece of cheese which would stand up against the finest camembert you might care to through at it mrs./mr. silversmith. i sense that there may be a touch of jaloux-fromagerie as the french put it. i think it is a good article, which is not only writte with flare but also has mature aroma. in addition to the article itself, one ought to keep in my mind that the author has cancer. fond regards, me.

May I remind you that you are perfectly welcome to add all the information you would like on Ollie, but just under the Cat Empire article instead. Not a big deal is it?

<p>Non-notable individual/vanity. A cantor who also does art, and once had a tiny article printed about him in a minor weekly. Oh, and like a million other people, he met the Pope.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Do not concur. Kepecs is a well known personality in the cantorial world. The fact that he was chosen by the Vatican to be one of thirteen cantors to sing for the Pope and presented him with one of his art works is an important point. This was the last group to meet Pope John Paul II (urged by the Pope himself I might add.) and made history. Kepecs' art I am told (currently doing research on it) has sold for as much as $65,000, and I believe he's got an album or two out on liturgical music. He is very interesting.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Kepecs is a noteworthy Reverend Cantor - and the title is correct. He has an exceptional tenor voice quality, similar to Luciano Pavarotti. I heard him at a concert in Canada, and he wowed the audience with his spectacular delivery, and mastery of Cantorial music and italian opera. In my opinion, nobody even came close to his delivery. Mark my word. You will see great things from this guy, give the researchers a chance. The fact that Kepecs sang for and gave the Pope a mezuzah has appeared in numerous newspapers, including The Jewish Star, The Nassau Herald, and I think the front page of the New York Times had an article on it as it was happening in Rome in January. His concert in Rome was televised throughout Italy. If you wish I will dig up what I can find.-User:Rabbis May 5, 2005</li>

<li>There is nothing whatsoever in this disjointed rambling diatribe that makes a coherent argument for the enclopedæicity of the article in question. The fact that the "Keep" votes all seem to be User:Merlinzor or sockpuppets is rather revealing that this entire thing is the result of possibly only a single user's unnoteworthy and eccentric POV. The pope and/or the pope's office distribute tens, even hundreds of letters every single day. Getting a letter from the pope does not make a person worthy of an article in wikipedia. The claim that this is the first ever audience given by a sitting pope to members of the "Jewish clergy" is patently false. That notwithstanding, even if it was a historical moment (which remains to be seen) and a lot was accomplished (which is doubtful) and that the event will be remembered forever (is that a prophecy?), that information is relevant to Jewish-Christian relations, and does <i>not</i> make any difference with respect to whether or not this guy is notable, nor whether or not this article is encyclopedia material or ever can be. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 15:42, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are supposed to be a source of information, not present biased viewpoints, as I have read some of your various unintelligent comments regarding Rabbis and Cantors. You should not render decisions of elimination based on assumptions as to who is commenting, or if the article doesn't "do it for you" and my rendering is that it is apparent to me that you don't know Rabbis nor Cantors. I am an ordained Rabbi. Wikipedia is free for all to share the information. I am a user of Wikipedia, as I've done much research with Wkipedia, and I find this article about Kepecs beneficial, as do my colleages. I care what happens to this article. The event with the Pope was an event that happened whether you like it or not and an important one at that. It wasn't just "members of the Jewish clergy". It was 141 Jewish clergymen - unprecedented in history, and the Pope's final meeting. What does it hurt you to keep the article? Why should it bother you sooo much? There are a lot of people who DO care about keeping it. -User:Rabbis May 5, 2005</li>

<li>Wikipedia's purpose is spelled out, as are its guidelines, elsewhere. This article violates a number of them, as do your comments against wikipedians. In cyberspace, your claim that you are a rabbi is unverifiable, but we are constrained as wikipedians to assume good faith. That constraint, however, has limitations. You are, it is true, free to share information. You are not, however, free to turn the Wikipedia project into a platform for promoting your personal views. I'm sure I care about what happens to this article just as much if not more than you do, so that statement on your part is something of a non-sequitur. As for the number of people who <i>do</i> care about keeping this article, the numbers just don't show it. Thus far, the only people who have registered that view, if they're really not all different personalities of the same anonymous user who's been trying to screw this "information" into every conceivably remotely related article, seem to be sharing a single computer. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 20:57, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>An emphatic<b>Keep</b>. My name is Reverend Cantor Victor I. Beck, President of the Jewish Ministers Cantors Association of America. I led the delegation of cantors - one of the 13 cantors who were selected to sing for the Pope on 1/18/05. It was a monumental event unprecedented in Judeo-Christian history. Rev. Cantor Kepecs gave the Pope a mezuzah that he created for that purpose - to show that the Jewish people really want to have reconciliation with the Catholic church. The Pope very much wanted this meeting. Being the President of the oldest Cantorial organization (dating back to 1896)who had such illustrious members as Cantor Yossele Rosenblatt, Ben Zion Kapov Kagan, Chaskele Ritter, David Koussevitzky, Moshe Koussevitzky, Berele Chagy, Israel Alter, Mordechai Hershman, Adolf Katchko, Leib Glantz, Alter Yechiel Karniol, Zavel Kwartin, Samuel Malavsky, Shlomo Mendel, Yeshia Meissels Pierre Pinchik and many others, I feel in my expertise that Cantor Lawrence Eliezer Kepecs is more than a noteworthy cantor, he is an exceptional Cantor and artist, who deserves a page in your encyclopedia. I can only assume that those who wish to remove mention of Cantor Kepecs in this forum are either ill-informed or have other agendas which are not in keeping with the historical and informative nature of this forum.-Rev. Cantor Victor I Beck, President JMCA May 5, 2005</li>

<li>Dear Samaritan, I trust as your name implies, that you are a good samaritan. Please do not ascribe any lesser motivations to me than you do for yourself. My entire life and the lives of those with whom I associate, are dedicated to attending to the needs and aspirations of both the Jewish community, and the world community at large. Endemic to this work, is a constant striving to uphold the fundemental building blocks of a civilized society. In the Pirkei Avot (Ethics of the fathers) there is a statement that the world rests on 3 things, on study of Torah, prayer worship, and on acts of loving kindness. Endemic to those 3 principals is a constant striving for truth and accuracy. I invite you to join me in this endeavor. -Rev. Cantor Victor I. Beck, President JMCA 5/5/05</li>

<li>I would like to decreasingly humbly point out that "Reverend Cantor Beck"'s "contribution" here, quite clearly spells out that this article is, as has been pointed out previously, <i>nothing more than self-promotion</i>. I also think it's interesting that the Jewish Ministers Cantors Association of America website is hmmm...<a href="../../../m/i/s/Missing_in_action.html" title="Missing in action">Missing in action</a>. A google search for "Reverend Cantor" turns up exactly 5 distinct hits, only 4 of which are actually using "reverend cantor" as a title, two of which clarify that this is a title of sorts bestowed by the Cantorial Associaton of America, not the JMCAA. Another of them is a somewhat sideways joke about a blogger's grandfather, and the other is, Lo and behold, an almost verbatim copycat of the stuff that this anonymous editor keeps trying to inject into wikipedia. Wanna see? Check it out here: <a href="http://search.localcolorart.com/search/encyclopedia/Pope_John_Paul_II/" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.localcolorart.com/search/encyclopedia/Pope_John_Paul_II/" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. How do you spell "AGENDA"? So then, I decided, why don't I go see what I can find on Victor I. Beck. So, I looked him up, and guess what I found? 13 relevant google hits. About half of which identify him as "Victor I. Beck" and the rest as "Cantor Victor I. Beck". That's right, to my utter lack of shock, there were no "Reverend Cantor Victor I. Beck"s. So then I said me, "How about just plain Victor Beck?" So I did that search. Predictably, this turned up a significantly greater number of hits. I paged through them, and found out that there are a number of people with the names Victor and Beck in various combinations with other names, but still no Reverend Cantors Beck. So, now I'm thinking perhaps what I should do is email Cantor Victor I. Beck, at cantorbeck@cantorbeck.com, an email address I feel comfortable publishing, since it appears here: <a href="http://www.tucsonfestival.org/EventPAGES/CulturalDiversityAnEndangeredSpecies.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tucsonfestival.org/EventPAGES/CulturalDiversityAnEndangeredSpecies.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>...and ask him whether or not he's had free time lately to write disrespectful notes on Wikipedia talkpages. Now that I know he's a part-time resident of Phoenix, perhaps what I should do is head over to whitepages.com and see whether or not I can get his phone number.

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. Kepec's notability has been more than sufficiently established. He is a leader in his field. The papal audience is notable on its own, of course, but so is the good Cantor.

<li>In the interest of developing a community consensus on this issue, the community should take any <i><b>evidence</b></i> presented by those outside the community under consideration but is not obligated to be swayed by <i>opinions</i> from outside the community. Very little evidence of Kepecs' notability has been forthcoming. I had voted to keep the article because I do not consider notability to be a very useful criterion by itself. Other criteria such as NPOV and self-promotion seem to be adequate for this case. Although I welcome any actual evidence, at this point it seems I have no choice but to change my vote. I vote to <b>merge</b> any useful information into other articles. The interesting life of a cantor can be detailed in a more generic article. If the presentation of the mazuzah is significant, other places can be found for that bit of information as well. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 21:49, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think everything I can say has been said already re: Cantor Kepecs. I've tried editing some of the articles myself at Wikipedia (where anyone can edit). However I have found that it is difficult to keep the edits in, as others who may know less about certain matters, take them out. I've always been from the school that an article is written by someone, and can be edited by others for punctuation, phrasing, and sentence structure, but what you are looking to do is completely remove others works, who have spent their time researching people, events, concepts, intellectual ideas etc. Morally, this is wrong. On another note, I feel that Wikipedia is an excellent source of information to the general public, and all of you have done quite well, but just because you have amassed a lot of knowledge editing in certain areas, nobody knows it all. Sometimes an expert in a field may "pop in" to see what you are doing. He may want to make corrections, or add to a listing, based on his expertise - so let him. -Victor 5/6/05</li>

<li>Hazzan Beck, the problem is that Wikipedia is not vandalism-proof; rather, it is vandalism-<b>resistant</b>, and as a result of this, we can be quite ardent in demanding proof of an article's validity. <i>"If this Hazzan Kepecs is so notable"</i>, we say to ourselves, <i>"should not his name have been mentioned by more people in more places? Could this not be a vanity article, such as children and the mad make to promote themselves, or a friendship article, like the well-meaning make to promote their friends?"</i> We look at the claims made in an article, and if they do not seem to match what we find in other places, we become wary of fraud - because fraud is sadly not absent from Wikipedia. Some do it out of malicious glee in their vandalism, others do it to further their argument that Wikipedia is inherently valueless... please do not assume that we have agendas other than trying to make this the best resource that we can. All are welcome to contribute <i><b>if they do so properly</b></i>. If someone contributes to one of these debates, and he has never contributed to Wikipedia before, then once more we become suspicious. <i>"Could this not,"</i>, we say to ourselves, <i>"be merely a friend or relative of the article's creator, arguing on his behalf not out of any inherent value in the article, but merely out of personal loyalty or friendship?"</i> After all, a ten-year-old can create an article claiming that he is the strongest and fastest boy in all his school and that he will surely be President one day, and when we recommend that his article be deleted immediately as nonsense, his six best friends can instantly protest that he IS the strongest and fastest boy in all his school, and that he WILL surely be President one day, and everyone deserves the chance to know about him. They can even claim that they do not know him, but that his article has convinced them. If such a statement in a deletion debate is someone's first and only contribution to Wikipedia, then we consider it as being of lesser merit than the same statement from someone who has participated for months. Even if someone signs their statements, we cannot know that they are who they claim to be - but if they register an account (and why not; it's free, after all), then their every contribution to Wikipedia is recorded and made available to all, and we can then judge their worth. If someone makes an account, and uses it to insert the word "poop" into the name of every member of Congress, then we know to discount their statements. If someone makes an account, and uses it to create many exquisitely detailed but false articles about wars that never happened between nations that never existed, then we know to discount their statements. If someone makes an account, and uses it to say that such-and-such an article must not be deleted - and does nothing else - then how are we to know whether they are trustworthy? The answer is that we cannot. I can claim to be a Jew, a Muslim, a Hindu, a Catholic, a man, a woman, an exceptionally bright child, a chemist, a rabbi, a surgeon, a pilot, a soldier, a tailor, a chef, a lawyer, black, white, or jaundiced from gradual liver failure, but these cannot be proven and are not relevant to the trustworthiness of my statements in these debates. What is relevant is that I am the Wikipedia contributor with the username DragonflySixtyseven, and every one of my contributions can be examined for value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that I have made my point clear to Hazzan Beck and to the others who support this article but have not yet proven themselves.</p>

<p>My dear friends, one of my colleagues and Rabbinic students (I teach certain topics) made mention to me a few days ago that a listing about me appeared in Wikipedia. I was overwhelmed and honored to learn of this. Today, I was curious to see this listing first hand. I read everything that was discussed about me and was amazed and flattered by many of your remarks. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am just a simple Reverend Cantor - one who serves G-d, and the Jewish community. I try to do good, to sanctify G-d's name, such as when those who are less fortunate than I need help, I would help them in whatever ways I could. I feel this is a glorification of G-d's holy name. The trip to greet the Pope, I felt was also a sanctification of G-d. The fact that we were given the opportunity to offer blessings to him because of all the good that he did for the Jews, from the Holocaust era until his death, was so very important. Pope John Paul II was a righteous gentile, always looking to do good. He was an exceptional man of peace. We all wanted to recognize this. We were told by the Vatican, that we were the only "People" to ever say "thank you" to a Pope. I am an average person. I feel my voice is average, my art is average, my grades in school were only a "B". My life has not really been all that interesting. You all have done such a superb job on your works at Wikipedia, and you all are to be commended for your research efforts, "Yasher Koach." You did such great research on me, that you even discovered my old screenname that I used to use. My breath is taken away. I'm so flattered that I have such a following, I never knew it. I feel, however, that perhaps I am unworthy of the great honor bestowed upon me of having a page in your excellent encyclopedia. I am really not a "great" person. Perhaps my page should be reserved for someone of much greater worth than I, for someone of major importance. I applaud all your efforts. Thank you for thinking of me. May you all be successful in your quest for truth. May G-d bless you all. -Lawrence Eliezer Kepecs 9 May, 2005 12:55</p>

<p>All right. Specifically which facts in the article are in question. Is it the Pope visit? There is a newspaper article in the discussion section. I'm sure there are more, if we really look. The wall that was built appeared in the Newtown Bee (in discussion section)- the arts newspaper that goes all around the world to every gallery and auction house. Very prestigious, and very difficult to get into. There's The Jewish Press article on him. We can call Yeshiva University to find out if he actually got degrees there. That he sings internationally, that has been proven from the Rome article. There may be more articles, I would have to research it. Tell me what else you need me to find.

<li><b>Comment</b>. For those attempting to distill a consensus from all this blabbering, observe that, although an annoyance on this page, sockpuppetry should not reflect on the status of the article itself. I'm inclined to think that the Cantor does merit an article, at least as much as any minor James Bond character or American Idol finalist. It should be edited to remove matters of opinion and exaggeration and monitored for recurrences of vanity. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 20:13, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>FWIW, I agree with you. Unfortunately, that would leave the article with less than 1/4 of its current content. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 21:16, May 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Further comment</b>. I've been trying to clean up the article and I think I just have to give up on this. Kepecs seems to be a promising tenor in the Cantorial community and was priveleged to have been invited with other cantors to a papal audience. His major artwork - a decorative fundraising wall at a Cantorial seminary - is made of carved and painted foam. The multiple newspaper clippings, improperly scanned and uploaded, establish nothing beyond his existence as a performer. I don't know if the article <i>can</i> be cleaned up enough to be neutral. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 21:18, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If the vote for this rambling VfD is ever tallied and the article deleted, I would like to request that, if the sock-puppet master who has fought so hard for its retention wants, that s/he be permitted to have the article as it stands prior to deletion.

<li>Current version is a <b>copyvio</b> (and is now marked as such). I'm afraid I don't consider two bad reviews on Alexa to be much of a controversy - not even WikiNews material much less an encyclopedia article.

Any controversy about their services should be discussed there. By the way, most of those Google hits are false positives. Very many are comments at the bottom of merchant or auction pages that "we accept PayPal, BidPay, ..."

<p><b>Do not delete</b> I don't think that it should be deleted. It is a database where people can come and find quick and easy answers about the Star Wars universe. I think that it is a great idea and that they should be included in all articles. Anyone can ask a question and everyone can answer the question. I don't see this as a discussion board, merely as a way to get quick knowledge about the Star Wars universe to other Star Wars fans on this website. - By the way, I am NOT the person who created this page. I am merely a user who saw the page and thought it was a great idea.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Extremely strong DO NOT DELETE!</b> This page is awesome! Don't say it is not encyclopedic, because it is. It is a unique encyclopedia. I see it as a way to encourage users to add information. Also, a lot of information does not appear on the Star Wars wikipedia page, no offense to the creators or anything. It's just that there is a lot of information there that they think is the most important. What about the other information that everybody knows? There are a lot of people who don't know things like that and want to learn them. The FAQ page is not an actual FAQ page. Actual FAQ's have one person, an official representative of that company, in this case Star Wars, answering everybody's questions. Whoever made this, was saying everyone help everyone. The user stated it was NOT a discussion board, and just wants to make it easier for people to obtain information that they want. I have been to SuperShadow.com. This web page looks absolutely nothing like it. And there is nothing wrong about posting links to it on the Star Wars web page. It is a related topic from the Wikipedia site. How else is everyone supposed to learn about it? And by the way, someone has deleted the link from the Star Wars page! Think about the positives. If enough users contribute questions and answers, it will be a huge information database. There will be so much stuff, you may not even have to ask your questions anymore. You just look them up from the long list. This is an outstanding idea and I would THINK that Star Wars fans would want to keep it! <a href="../../../i/l/o/User%7EIlovetolearn_f95c.html" title="User:Ilovetolearn">Ilovetolearn</a></li>

<li><b>DELETE</b> the article is not a FAQ as it contains no frequently asked questions or answers to them. It can't be encyclopedic, since it's a discussion board.
