<li><b>Marginal keep</b>. This author is not one whom I would consider to be directly "notable" in himself alone; however it is clear looking through InfoTrac and on Google that his work has been referred to by others (albeit to a comparatively minor degree). In my own personal opinion, I wouldn't say he's worthy of inclusion in any encyclopaedia due to lack of substantial merit on his part, but of course since Wikipedia is meant to be a "sum of human knowledge" we don't seem to ignore people who have some demonstrable level of following in the world at large simply because of their academic insignificance. Admittedly, if Wikipedia were my encyclopaedia, such articles as this would be deleted post-haste, but mercifully for the world this is not the case. Thus it seems he is notable enough to warrant an article given usual Wikipedia editorial procedure. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 21:18, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> to deletion request. Maze Clays is a new shotgun discipline that was just recently launched. It is a <b>unique and newsworthy</b> topic, from the fact that it already has a following in the shooting ranges that it was introduced. We have had TV coverage that is about to air in the following weeks. The article is not an ad or vanity, it plainly states the creators of the discipline and the main characteristics. It does not go into the benefits of this game over the other existing shotgun sports. This topic is verifiable by visiting the official website.</li>
<li><b>Not a promotion</b> - it simply states the components and rules of the game. Please explain what you mean your accusations in greater detail so that I may respond.
<ul>
<li>God forbid, no accusations. I have nothing against you, and your shouldn't try to convince me, rather everybody here.

<li>Details** I understand that this is a debate. I would like to know specifically, what is it that you see in this article that would classify it as an ad?

<li>Basically, there are two points. (1) it looks like an ad for the website that licenses the game and sells the equipment. (2) It appears non-notable as, basically, it looks like practically nobody is doing this. The lack of Google hits makes this look like a start-up attempting to get some exposure. You claim there's a following, yet nobody seems to be talking about it.

<ul>
<li>First of all the article does not talk about licensing or selling the equipment. It describe the Maze Clays discipline. The link to the website is put there for verifiability purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, just because you can't find hits on Google doesn't mean that it does not have a following. What corellation exists between shotgun shooters and computer users. What basis do you have to tell me that shotgun shooters automatically are big fans of computers? The purpose of the article is to inform shooters about the existance of a new shotgun sport. What is wrong with that. The article does not mention a sales pitch which you claim that it is. Cautaro</p>

</ul>
<pre>
This is a quote from the notable page: "The word notable is often used as a synonym of "unique" or "newsworthy." 
</pre>
<pre>
To explain, Maze Clays is unique because it uses a new system of operating the shotgun sport. Besides that it has a new classification and no registered targets are are necessary, two new, unique things which don't currently exist. 
</pre>
<pre>
Second, it is newsworthy. We have been filmed by the Comcast channnel CSS and will be airing in the following weeks. We are in talks with other media sources who are interested to feature Maze Clays.
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that you are the producer of this product means that the article may also violate <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>. Also, Maze Clays has not yet been aired on any major media sources; whether it will be in the future is irrelavent. Finally, the article does not assert the notability of its topic and we thus have no idea how many users the product has and if that number is significant.

<li>First of all the article describes a shotgun discipline, which by definition cannot be sold. The equipment is described to provide a better understanding of the game. Second, what is wrong with having the information come directly from the authors of the creation.

<li>First of all, the article insists on using the TM symbol every time the discipline is mentioned. In other words, no one can run these games without paying royalties to the owners of the trademark. Don't be disingenuous. By definition, that is selling. In addition, it seems there's specialized equipment for this sport that's also being sold.

Second, the forum at mazeclays.com is a new addition and the list of users does not reflect the number of members.

<dd>If you could read Japanese, you would know that if you do a search using <b>kanji</b>, that she was (and still is) incredibly popular in Japan and also outside of Japan. She has several DVDs in Japan, and numerous photobooks. A search on amazon.co.jp will show this. As far as fleshing out this article, a) I only stumbled across it today because it was listed for deletion b) since I do most editing at work, searching bikini model web sites isn't really an option as I would probably get fired.

<dd>Which is exactly why I used prod instead of speedy deletion, I repeat. All I'm asking for is that rather than closing this as "keep" and leaving the article a micro-stub that someone sometime in the next five days puts some evidence <i>into the actual article</i>.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> since I don't actually think she ahs ever done anything that notable. Any woman with large enough breasts can garner a million Googles easily without ever doing anything of any signifciance whatsoever. Not that I care overmuch, but this really does seem to be breastcruft. I suppose it might justifiably be defended per systemic bias, as balancing some of the millions of utterly non-notable American women with large breasts... <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 18:27, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Alright, I'll contest it. She's a girl with moderately large breasts (this is the second draft of my comment) and she appeared in one porn movie 20 years ago. Wow. Non-notable.

<li>But the article is claiming she's notable for being a famous bikini model, not for being a woman with large breasts or an actor. The only evidence I have of her notability are the Google hits and the word of Nobunaga and JJay, but for me, that's enough to keep a recently created stub. While editors' personal knowledge shouldn't be cited as a source in articles, it seems reasonable to me to consider it in behind-the-scenes judgements like AfDs. (I haven't been here long, so if anyone can point me to any old discussion on that last point I'd appreciate it.) --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 02:20, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, the article says <i>"mainly known for her large breasts."</i>, not <i>"is mainly known as a bikini model"</i>. The only passing claim to notability is having, as they say, big ***s. Evidence that can't go in an article is difficult to find much use for, since it is the article and the material in it that is at issue here. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:33, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're right, it does say that. But what about this official website that Nobunaga added? The "discography" link goes <a href="http://www.universal-music.co.jp/aoki_yuko/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.universal-music.co.jp/aoki_yuko/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>... she seems to be a recording artist with a major label album, which would make her notable in itself. I'd add it to the article, but I'll leave that to the editors who can read Japanese. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 02:40, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure that this means she is signed with HMV, if that's what you mean, since I'm not even sure that they are a label. Even if it does mean that, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> asks for two albums on a major label, and there is no proof of that. Allmusic.com has never heard of her, sugesting that probably that release was not, in fact, on a singificant label. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:56, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, I was thinking Universal Music Group, not HMV. Again, I can't read Japanese, but it looks to me like a Universal release. And you're right that it's just one, but it's packaged with a DVD and looks like the kind of big pop release that would easily have sold 5000 copies. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 03:07, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh, I see. Hmmm, that is difficult.

<ul>
<li>Actually, looking at the IMDB listing, I don't think that's her. She would be about 10 or 11 years old when that movie came out, and seeing as it looks like an erotic film, I doubt it's her. Most of her *ahem* movies are "smile and pose" straight to DVD type jobs, not listed on IMDB. The album is news to me, but I'll look at the site.

<dd>I can see how this would be considered on the gray area of acceptable use policy, but I maintain that it fits.</dd>
<dd>If any "movement" were chronicled the day it was born, would it still be superfluous?</dd>
<dd>The people involved have a sense of humor, but it is not a joke, they put their actual filmmaking beliefs in their manifesto. And between the three of them, they have actual film credits, books on filmmaking in stores, reviews in Variety, Film Threat, etc.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Looks like the catme06.com domain is brand new, from GoDaddy; the redirect may have been left over from the previous renter of the IP. It's been fixed now, and basically matches the article. Also, it appears that one of the "three friends" who thought this up is, in fact, a cat. At least, there is a Julie Peasley whose website (<a href="http://www.foxynymphs.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foxynymphs.com" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) includes pictures with her cat, Squeaky McGee <a href="http://www.foxynymphs.com/galleries/01.12.03/pages/julie_squeaky.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foxynymphs.com/galleries/01.12.03/pages/julie_squeaky.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> This section of the Batman article has been agreed upon by a number of editors and has withstood attack as well as suggestions it be removed, for over a year now. The consensus has consistently been that it would be against the rules to remove the material to its own article since it is against policy to get rid of provocative material in this fashion. The argument that the article is too long is spurious on its face: for example, today's featured article <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a> is 51K long, while the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> article is only 44K long, and there are other sections that could be spun off if so desired. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 02:29, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I believe the best thing to do is to have this information in the main article. There it presently resides, and sits very well with the rest of the article which provides it context, lacking in the fork. The (possiblly POV) fork has <i>nothing</i> that the version in the original article <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> doesn't—unsurprisingly, as it looks like it was simply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homosexual_interpretations_of_Batman&amp;oldid=44420915" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homosexual_interpretations_of_Batman&amp;oldid=44420915" rel="nofollow">removed</a> from the original article. (An editor later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Batman&amp;diff=44476608&amp;oldid=44463192" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Batman&amp;diff=44476608&amp;oldid=44463192" rel="nofollow">reverted the deletion from the original</a>, so this same text now lies in two pages). The removal accomplished little: it reduced the size by a miniscule 4k. Furthermore, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> is a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_7cf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article">Wikipedia:Featured article</a>: part of its value is that it includes this thoughtful, well-written section on an interesting subject, the sort of commentary that is sorely lacking in most comic and pop-culture type articles on WP. Deleting the section is therefore a poor choice, IMHO: we damage a featured article by removing one of its most interesting sections, and then place this well-written information to what amounts to a POV fork, where bereft of context it is distinctly suboptimal. All for the supposed benefit of reducing the article from 44kb to 40kb. If 44kb was a perfectly acceptable length for the <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">FA director</a>, then it ought to be perfectly fine for Wikipedia, I imagine.&#160;;-) Therefore, <b>delete</b> <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual_interpretations_of_Batman_9609.html" title="Homosexual interpretations of Batman">Homosexual interpretations of Batman</a>, please. There is no need to merge anything, as the text was originally at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> (and still is, along with the pictures and references). The references in the original have to be sorted out by someone familiar with the article, though: there appear to be two sections. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:#002bb8;cursor:crosshair;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 23:03, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, based on the following points:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Very sizable percentage of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vox_melba_cylinders_48e5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vox melba cylinders">user contributions</a> are vanity edits, including <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_John_Steven_Lasher_6c68.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/John Steven Lasher">all links back</a> to this article.</li>
<li>Blatant disregard for vanity guidelines as discussed on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam</a> (specifically under "How Not to Be a Spammer" point number <i><b>one</b></i>), <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>, and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines</a>. Especially notable in the light of the fact that he already had a vanity article, Vox Melba Mastering Labs, speedily deleted for this reason and engaged in a vigorous debate with several editors wherein these policy guidelines were linked and thoroughly explained to him. Nonetheless, he has added an article about himself shortly since then.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Just to clarify for those who have asked above, I bring these points up merely to show that a) the user is familiar with these policies and encountered them before, and b) continues to make a substantial number of edits whose main or only purpose is to highlight himself and his work. Sure the two together are relevant? It's certainly not vandalism, but were this to continue like this substantially longer, it would. I'm concerned, is what. <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 23:49, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Non-notability in regard to the majority of the article - while I have no doubt that he facilitated the commercial availability of classic movie soundtracks, I certainly wouldn't consider such a producer any more or less notable than someone who produces, say, the budget classical music CDs for <a href="../../../n/a/x/Naxos_%28record_label%29.html" title="Naxos (record label)">Naxos</a>, or an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assistant_director.html" title="Assistant director">assistant director</a> who has worked on big Hollywood films for several years. Its interesting work involving other notable things and people, but co-relation with such things does not confer notability in and of itself. (Were that the case, you could argue the every name ever listed in a playbill, liner notes, or end credits of any creative work counts as a notable entry.) As for the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Herrmann_ebe6.html" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a> info, it is uncited and has a high probability of conflation as it is an autobiographical article.</li>
<li>All of the Vox info relates to companies and divisions founded and run by John Lasher. A quick search on the internet confirms that he runs them in conjunction with the man responsible for his bio on his IMDb page. Furthermore, it seems as though the company was only recently started, which again smells awfully like self-promotional ad-spam. While it is marginally interesting and notable, I believe it would better be served by a brief mention and link in the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonograph_cylinder.html" title="Phonograph cylinder">phonograph cylinder</a> article. Which Mr. Lasher has already done.</li>
<li>The Kinopanorama info, similarly, is somewhat interesting, but of his work, it's been barely seen and by his own admission, only one of his three films in this format has been fully completed or screened en-masse. Again, this would be far more appropriately merged as brief mentions in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinopanorama.html" title="Kinopanorama">Kinopanorama</a> article. Which, again, Mr. Lasher has already done.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I simply don't think that the <b>creation</b> of an autobiographical article is proper in any regard, nor do I think that Mr. Lasher qualifies as an encyclopedic subject at the moment. I am willing to concede the latter point, but only if someone other than Mr. Lasher or his associates feels fit to create such an article. IMHO, the case here is very cut and dry and is about vanity and disregard for the policies and guidelines. I think that Mr. Lasher does interesting work and has worked with interesting people, but this alone is hardly enough to warrant an encyclopedia article written by someone else, much less himself.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, simple fact is, an IMDB entry is no guarantee of meeting Wikipedia's notability guidelines. Being able to back up information with reliable sources does. Assuming you actually are Mr. Lasher, I'm sure you could provide independent sourcing (ie, not written by Mr. Sefton-Parke), and a complete discography for the article, and make it potentially worth keeping, instead of throwing a tantrum.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know where you draw the line on a college player. This guy's not a starter.

<li>The relevant provision of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> would seem to read, in pertinent part, that notability for "sportspeople [is demonstrated where one has] played...at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad already have articles." I readily concede that the latter phrasing isn't directed at college teams, but I think the principles nevertheless translate; best as I can tell, the only UNC player for whom a bio exists is <a href="../../../t/y/l/Tyler_Hansbrough_b9f7.html" title="Tyler Hansbrough">Tyler Hansbrough</a>, who surely merits an article. Seven other Tar Heels played more minutes per game than Thomas this year <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/teamstats?teamId=153" class="external autonumber" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/teamstats?teamId=153" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and none has an article. Were there another distinguishing characteristic (e.g., likelihood that Thomas will be drafted into the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a>), I would be inclined to vote keep, but of course there is no such characteristic; therefore, <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:11, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm relatively new to wikipedia, so I'm unsure what to do and am seeking advice. Is the right step to delete this page and lose the history before creating a new redirect page, or should I just go ahead and delete the contents and replace with a redirect?<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> Even as I believe the article, in its first iteration, to have been sufficiently clear as to the notability of the subject (at least to an American user), I can't abide the suggestion that to have nominated the article for deletion was to have committed vandalism. Nominations for deletion, generally, I think, inamsuch as they abide by process, are not to be considered vandalism; to make a suggestion to the Wikipedia community as to the proper disposition of an article and to await the reaching of a consensus by the community writ large seems nearly diametrically opposite to vandalism. Moreover, notwithstanding that I think the provisios as to what is vandalism are too exclusive (they do, of course, seem to reflect a consensus of users, though), the "What vandalism is not" section of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAN_11b1.html" title="WP:VAN">WP:VAN</a> would surely seem to include such tasks as tagging an article for deletion under the (mistaken) belief that its subject is non-notable. Finally, I don't think that the tagging of an article one minute after its creation is anything about which to be upset; whilst one may think it best for him/her to wait for an article to develop, surely such waiting is not necessary and can be counterproductive (non-notable bios, hoaxes, etc., quickly disappear from "new pages" and are picked up by Wikipedia mirror sites, incentivizing the creation of such pages). The worst-case scenario, of course, in this case, would have been that, in the absence of an expanded article, the Barnes article was deleted; someone might easily have recreated it, then, and simply added information sufficient to establish notability <b>on the first edit</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:33, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I tagged this for speedy as advertising, but the creator of the page appended a bit more info, added the "hangon" tag, and noted on the talk page an intent to modify the page such that it was no longer advertising (albeit ostensibly with eleemosynary aims). I removed the speedy tag but nevertheless believe the article, inasmuch as it references a non-notable organization (to-wit, a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Schoolhouse+Earth%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Schoolhouse+Earth%22" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> returns many hits, but none--as far as I can tell--to this project) and seems destined to remain advertising (since there don't seem to be any organizational accomplishments of one might write), should be deleted. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:56, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>...I may not be able to address the concerns that give rise to this recommendation. Although I might concede that the organization in question is non-notable, I wonder if the absence of Google results is in itself, evidence of that. I will clearly describe here the current state of the organization, and may ultimately concede that an article in Wikipedia is not merited. But I have a sense that the presence of such an article will serve both the organization in question and Wikipedia. The organization is currently formed by fewer than a dozen individuals and has just been newly formed. So accomplishment of note is as yet undelivered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are three objectives I have with respect to submission of this item. The first is to provide a clean place in the public commons that identifies the mission and scope of the organization Schoolhouse Earth. In this place, public comment is invited and open access is available both for endorsement or concern. A secondary (and somewhat unstated) objective is to publicly invite commentary about namespace conflict. We can find no significant evidence of an organization that is using this name and that has these objectives. The appearance in Wikipedia will help to unearth any prior claims to the name that we have not yet identified. The third objective is (secondarily again, and certainly) that of raising public exposure of the organization and its mission. It cannot help but happen that if we lucidly explain the mission of this organization, that there will be many who wish to express support either through contribution of their efforts or other resources. This is not our direct aim with this article, but it is inevitably a side-effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I alluded to the idea that the article may serve Wikipedia goals as well. Perhaps this is in an indirect way, but it is an intention of the organization in question both to utilize Wikipedia content in its curriculum, but also to create curriculum that has learners participate in wikipedia as content editors and providers.</dd>

<p>Full of original research, many sources are unverifiable, doesn't satisfy WP:BIO. Furthermore, constant edit warring. Constant problems without resolution. Level of notability doesn't merit this activity. I wrote the bulk of this article and previously fought to keep it.

No we are not the same person. This has already been explained to you. I am no sockpuppet. You fought to keep this article a couple of weeks ago. Something has changed. If you want to enlist the support of people for your amazing "about face" on the fate of this subject, I would suggest that you pour out your reasoning on the discussion page as per WP policy. I have no clue where you are coming from and I suspect others are in the same boat or flotation device. You rarely explain yourself or your edits and this is in my opinion the main reason there are conflicts between the editors on this subject. You constantly scream "sockpuppet", but in reality many wonder if the shoe isn't on the other foot, so to speak.-<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChai_Walla_24f5.html" title="User:Chai Walla">Chai Walla</a> 07:51, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This discovery has been reported extensively in the scientific literature and so I think it's notable even if it doesn't cure cancer yet. I added the article because I saw the news reports and wanted to know more, but discovered there was no coverage in wikipedia. I've sent emails to experts in these fields inviting them to expand wikipedia articles in their areas of expertise. I think it's not very nice to delete authoritative articles that people are interested in and it might discourage participation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sjhalasz (<a href="../../../s/j/h/User_talk%7ESjhalasz_a666.html" title="User talk:Sjhalasz">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sjhalasz_130a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sjhalasz">contribs</a>) 07:44, 20 March 2006.</small>

Self reference is generally a problem because it is unprofessional, but this isn't the case with a pronunciation key: Guidelines such as this are standard in print encyclopedias such as the EB. As for Wikipedia's pronunciation guideline, these issues are covered in the key's talk page: No one has yet come up with a way to represent English in the IPA in a dialect-neutral way, so the IPA has resulted in edit wars over "cultural imperialism". Also, many people are more familiar with this kind of system than the IPA. Think of middle-school kids in the USA, for example. The IPA should always be used as well, of course, but this extra info is <i>helpful,</i> which is something we should always keep in mind. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 20:59, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay, after looking at 'what links here', I'm wondering if this is a particular respelling standard that's used in astronomy? If so, then it may be appropriate to offer it alongside IPA (which is already the recommendation) in astronomy articles.

<dd>The purpose of the manual of style is to avoid haphazard pronunciation spellings. However, this key is intended to avoid that problem as well, by making the pronunciation spellings regular and consistant. The manual of style causes its own problems because people fight over whose dialect to use as the approved pronunciation. This system avoids that problem, and having both it and the IPA addresses the needs of more people. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 05:17, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'd recommend that at the worst, the namespace idea happens. I'd much rather see it developed more to provide a non-IPA method of pronunciation transcription that could be useful throughout linguistics and languages pages, classical literature and history pages, biology, and so on. Every page of my oldest Webster's has a similar pronunciation guide on every page. Another advantage is that this system (similiar to what most newspapers and magazines would use) only requires one special character, the unambiguous schwa, [ə]. I'd rather see us first work to edit the article to address MLA's POV that it's "not very well written".

<p>Despite the fact that there may be some correct facts in this article, I see no basis for the existence of the article itself. Just for the record, can someone state in a neutrally-worded sentence or two, what exactly is the "Russia naming issue"? Citation of at least one respectable source would help, too. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-03-20&#160;19:29&#160;Z</small></i></p>
<dl>
<dd>The issue is the existance of the claim that the self-appelation of the "Rus" rooted names (Russia, Rossia, Rus' Velikaya, etc) was "stolen" by the "Muscovites" for the political purposes, that the "correct" names were and remain only Muscovites and Muscovy (which I don't disagree, these were also correct names) and the Russia and Rus' are incorrect and stolen. That "they" "stole" or "attempted to steal" or "to monopolize" the legacy of Rus', that ony <i>we</i> (whatever it means) are related to Rus' and Muscovites owe their legacy only to Mongolic or Finno-Ugric tribes, that "we are more Rus'ian" then them" (see this article <a href="http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/nn/show/328/29376/" class="external text" title="http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/nn/show/328/29376/" rel="nofollow">in Ukrainian</a> or in <a href="http://www.zn.kiev.ua/ie/show/328/29376/" class="external text" title="http://www.zn.kiev.ua/ie/show/328/29376/" rel="nofollow">Russian</a> for a good review).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, if you go to uk-wiki, you can find users who deny to call Russin things as "Russian" even today and agree to only call it Muscovite (see <a href="http://uk.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%87:Maksym_Ye.&amp;offset=20050422061016&amp;limit=3&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://uk.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%87:Maksym_Ye.&amp;offset=20050422061016&amp;limit=3&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this</a>). --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 20:11, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, so this article is about a particular rhetorical stance used in a debate about the lineage or "legitimacy" of the Ukrainian and Russian nations? Does it really justify more than a mention in <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology_of_Rus%27_9cbb.html" title="Etymology of Rus'">etymology of Rus'</a>? Perhaps it is part of a larger topic about the rhetoric of national self-importance?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I just don't see the merit of analyzing a name-calling match in too much detail. English-language historians tend to document the etymology and usage of names like <i>Rus’</i>, <i>Russia</i>, etc, and the social and political histories of the peoples involved. They may mention that some argument features prominently in somebody's national rhetoric, perhaps mentioning prominent scholars who have held particular related views, but stay well away from evaluating the relative merits of such arguments, as, I think, should we. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-03-20&#160;20:27&#160;Z</small></i>
<dl>
<dd>All I am saying is that this is a valid issue and such cleaned up article will not harm and will cover a legitimate, although a rhetorical, point. I think it doesn't qualify for AfD. I would consider the etymology article much more important. Note that both were started by the same user (now seem retired) rather than some troll. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 20:41, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if someone would rewrite this so it doesn't sound like someone's personal grudge, then I may change my vote. But as currently written, it's not a suitable article. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-03-20&#160;23:16&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<p>Until then it should be POVed with a tag that I find totally justifiable. However, the POVish presentation in itself is the reason for correction and not deletion provided that the topic is legitimate. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 23:30, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Not sure if to keep</b>. Agree with above that an article is not owned by any one person and that mere wish to delete by one author of article or the subject of the article is not enough. But we have in the past acquiesced to requests by sole authors to remove content even if it had been GFDL (I remember a case about an image of someone's wife and the Koran, I believe) as a matter of human courtesy. What would be helpful is to know to what extent Inspectore is the only "real" author of the article - there are others in the contribution history, but a lot of the changes seem minor or removals of paragraphs. Isn't there some visual tool to see the authorship split of an article? If Inspectore is the near-only author and he wants it to go, I'm inclined to delete. If there has been active collaboration, then not. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 01:58, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Twice before this article has been nominated for AFD. The article was kept weakly on the basis the article could be improved, if the article was cleaned up and citations were provided. However, nearly a month later the article has remained untouched. The band when searched for, has not won the award they proclaim they have. Nor does the band have anything to do with the musical styles of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_Rock_8b04.html" title="Gothic Rock">Gothic Rock</a> or <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_Metal_c57b.html" title="Gothic Metal">Gothic Metal</a>. The band is also not well known in their own country. The article fails <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and fails Notablity. As such, considering the time given for the article to be cleaned up, the article should be deleted for Non-Notablity and Advertising purposes. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Ley Shade</a> 19:25, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - the recent spate of mall AfD's is an example of an anti-mall cultural bias, as are any anti-mall precedents in deletion policy. I strongly feel that Wikipedia is being kept from covering many massive, notable, quasi-permanent commercial institutions (many of which are important features in the lives of hundreds of thousands or even millions of people - entire communities!) simply because of cultural bias. I am not a huge mall-lover myself, but most large malls are more notable than many of the small museums that wikipedia covers, and are treated differently mainly because they are seen as distasteful or dislikeable. Wikipedia should not censor or delete an entire category of information (we already cover a number of malls), information that is relevant and important to an electronic encyclopedia, simply because some people find that subject a bit crass. Covering individual malls is <i>not</i> comparable to, say, covering individual Wal-Mart stores (which should not be done), because each mall is different. The layout, location, and composition of a mall is important geographic and cultural information. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Obviously we should be open-minded to any attempt to document notability for any subject. Without passing judgement on the question of whether malls as a whole are unfairly discriminated against in wikipedia, we have to decide about individual articles about individual malls. I see nothing in this article that suggests that <i>this</i> mall warrants an article. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 22:02, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that this mall is <i>less</i> notable than many that have recently been targeted in the AfD blitz, but I think that it is still notable, as it includes 23 stores. Also, being located in a small community, it is likely a commercial center of that community - and, as such, as important as a local state park or something on that idea. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<li>How many Main Street or Town Squares moved from town to town in the past? They should be merged because they are a feature of the town - saying they warrant seperate articles is like saying that we should have a separate article about <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pele.html" title="Pele">Pele</a>'s right and left feet because he used them to score so many goals. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 13:40, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't understand your analogy with Pele, however I do believe that, to a large extent, Main Streets and Town Squares have moved- into the malls. As you know, malls also drain customers from much larger areas than the immediate towns they are located in. Finally, I guess we could merge every article on a building, highway, school, museum, stadium, team, mall, company, etc. into a jumbo article on the town in which they are located. While we are at it, we should probably merge every player bio into the sports team they play for. Then when that becomes unmanageable, we can edit all the discussions of these things in the Town/Team articles down to single line mentions. Then we can give up on trying to be a comprehensive, internet-age encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:03, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They didn't move, they were replaced (unless someone actually dug up the entire street, moved it to the edge of town, and put a roof on it). It's like Pele retiring and someone else playing for Brazil. I think the analogy is that a particular small mall, or a main street, is part of one specific town and no other (in the way that nobody other than Pele has ever scored a goal by kicking the ball with Pele's foot, so no matter how impressed you are with Pele's foot, or how many times Pele's foot propelled the ball into the back of the net, it's still Pele's foot so doesn't have its own article, as you can't really say that much about it, and what you can say relates directly to Pele). Very large malls have a life and reputation of their own of course, but this isn't a very large mall. 128.243.220.21 11:47, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am utterly astounded that anyone could look at Wikipedia and think it has an <i>anti</i>-pop-culture bias. I wouldn't say it has an anti-mall bias either, but that's probably much harder to determine.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Encyclopedias are reference books that deal with all fields of knowledge (the word comes from the Greek words <i>enkyklios paideia,</i> meaning general or well-rounded education). Since Wikipedia doesn't have very many size constraints, we can include a lot of stuff. Also, I'm not sure it's worth destroying someone else's work and alienating that person--who could be a contributor to other articles as well--over an issue as uncertain as notability.
