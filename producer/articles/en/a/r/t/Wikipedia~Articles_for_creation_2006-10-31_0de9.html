<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-31_0de9.html" title="Edit section: Old Andreans Association">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Old Andreans Association</span></h2>
<p>The Old Andreans Association (OAA) was founded in 1906 by the third Headmaster of the School, the Rev. Percy Simpson. The first president of the OAA was Mr Justice Webb, of the Industrial Relations Commission of NSW, who held office for over 40 years. In 2006 the OAA celebrated the centenary of its founding, making it one of the few alumni organisatios to reach that milestone.</p>
<p>The OBU always suffered from the fact that students completed their St Andrew’s education at Intermediate level and went on to matriculate at other schools. From 1960 the School prepared boys for the Leaving Certificate. This was the beginning of substantial growth, both for the School and for the OBU.</p>
<p>Membership grew steadily through the 1960’s, 1970’s and 1980’s with the OBU assisting the School in various ways, most specifically with the appeal for the New School during the 1960’s. In 1976 the School moved into it current home, St Andrew’s House. The membership of the OBU steadily rose as it became one of the key associations that form part of the wider St Andrew’s community.</p>
<p>In 1998, with the impending entry of girls into St Andrew’s, the OBU voted to change its name to the Old Andreans Association (OAA). In the subsequent years the OAA has grown enormously in terms of membership and ability to assist the School.</p>
<p>In recent years, the OAA has incorporated, adopted a formal constitution and has been able to donate $80,000 to the School's building fund, and also donate a $40,000 scoreboard for use at St Andrew's Oval. The OAA has also launched the OAA Canon Newth Memorial Scholarship, to perpetuate the memory of Canon Newth, the School's longest serving headmaster. In October 2006 the OAA formed the Old Andreans Foundation, which will be used to raise funds to provide further scholarships into the future.</p>
<p>The current council consists of:</p>
<p>Nathan Winn - President/Secretary; Richard Grover - Vice President; Dean Gillespie - Treasurer; Amelia Rutherford - Councillor; Cara Punch - Councillor.</p>

<p>Born on the mean streets of Philadelphia, Austin got no brotherly love from his older sibling John who ran the local crack game on the South Side of Philly. His parents, John and Mary, both highschool dropouts, worked at the local grocery. John, who was good at math in highschool prior to dropping out worked as a cashier. While Mary focused on her true passion in life, flower arrangements. John worked the night shift and Mary in the afternoon so there would be someone in the family's apartment after the kids came home from school. Austin's true love was found at a very young age as his parents discovered his true love for physics, but his social settings held down his one true passion in life. Instead he was forced to peddle crack and started pimping his sister Merrel on the main streets of Philadelphia. His fame rose quickly threw the streets and in April of 1989 he earned the prestigious "Thug of the Year Award" from The Source, but was quoted as saying "Fuck You, Benzino, you don't run shit", and in return got heavy coverage from XXL. He had always held the reputation as being one of the illest MCs in his projects, and in 1992 he battled the Notorious B.I.G. for the King of New York, and he wasn't even from New York! From 1993 to 1999 he released 6 albums, all of which went platinum. After obtaining a net wealth of 390 million dollars, he retired from the rap game and enrolled as a full time student at Cornell. After earning his bachelors degree in Astro Physics, he interned at NASA for a brief period before entering graduate school at Yale, after 4 years and trippling up on course work he earned his doctorate and became the first African American to work for NASA. On July 6th, 2006, he gunned down in front of his pink Escalade (formerly Cam'ron's) by members of DSN gang.</p>

EDGAR ALLAN POE



One of America’s most famous writers
Was born in Boston, January of 1809.
Both his parents were failing actors
And his father was drunk most the time.

In 1810 Edgar’s dad disappeared 
His mother died soon after.
A childless couple took him in
Raising him with love and laughter.

Edgar had a Negro nurse
Who brought him to her quarters.
There he listened to ghost stories
Far beyond earthly borders. 

The strange tales he later wrote
May have come from her inspiration.
The words she used to describe death
Gave Poe his taste for sensation.

The Allans moved to England
Where Poe attended boarding schools.
There’s no doubt his time spent there
Sharpened his skills as tools.

Returning to Richman and back in school
He began to compose new verse.
Heavy debts forced him to leave college 
As his life took a turn for the worse.

Poe caught a ride on a coal barge to Boston
Where he was unable to find employment.
A young printer agreed to publish his poems
Giving him hope and enjoyment.

Penniless, Poe enlisted in the army
And was accepted to West Point in 29.
Poe couldn’t stand not being a writer
Self-imposing his dismissal from The Line.

Afterward he became an editor and critic
And married his cousin who was thirteen.
Six years latter he discovered she was dying
Suffering once more the unforeseen.

He went through periods of insanity
Caused by grieving and functional fall.
He smoked opium and drink too much
Till at his door step death would call.

Edgar Allan Poe the master of verse
Still lives in our hearts today
Famous for The Raven and other great works
May his soul rest in peace we pray.


SHAKESPEARE


Shakespeare, perhaps the greatest writer in history,
In his day was known as a master of good plays.
The theater gave him the freedom to create
And in turn he put hearts and souls a blaze.

Far from the world of the stage
Shakespeare was born in April of 1564.
In the little English town called Stratford
With several sisters and brothers after and before.

All the boys went to the same grammar school
As soon as they could read and write.
Where the only subject taught was Latin
Which was of little use to those born bright. 

At 18 he married a woman named Anne Hathaway
Who was 8 years older than he.
The daughter of a neighboring farmer 
Who bore his children, with twins, made three.

In 7 years he was a successful actor
After starting his career at 21.
Only the best actors found work in London
And by the grace a God Shakespeare was one.

Many actors of the period were playwrights
And Shakespeare was one of the best.
His greatest success was Henry VI,
Which placed him above the rest.

Shakespeare turned to another kind of writing
When because of a plague London theaters had to close.
He wrote two narrative poems greatly admired by the critics
Though to be famous as a poet, he never wanted or chose.

He in stead, turned back to the life of the stage
As soon as the theaters reopened again.
He joined an acting company until he retired 
Writing plays for the Chamberlain’s Men.

Shakespeare died in 1616
And was buried in his local church back home.
Where he had been baptized 52 years before
He lies in his grave silent and alone.


--MASTERS OF VERSE
</pre>
<pre>
Poetry is one of Earth’s oldest arts
Practiced long before words of print.
Every race had its masters of verse
In caves, huts cabins, or tent.

Stories in verse were handed down
From one generation to another.
The first told of love, war and more
And how to survive each other.

As man became more civilized
He could not help but wonder within.
Verse then took on a deeper meaning
With stories of faith, superstition, and sin.

The act of reciting became in demand
As verse began to advance
Every tribe, city, town and village
Had someone who gave words romance.

Today’s poets are on the World Wide Web
Though many seem spiritually ill.
Thank heaven for all who still have God’s gift
To compose, teach, comfort, and fulfill.

  GOD’S POETS

The prize jewels of any nation
Are the philosophers of the heart.
How they think is universal, 
For it’s God who makes them so smart.

Most poets tell the truth of life, 
Though they may wrap it in beauty.
It's their passion, not their purpose;
To compose is but their duty.

Poets have no reason to lie 
When the truth is always so clear.
All that others say and do
Is but food for the poet's ear.

One merit of a poet's work, 
Which most people cannot deny, 
They say more and in fewer words
To illuminate you and I.

God sent his poets down to earth 
With words of wisdom and of worth, 
That they might touch the souls of men 
And bring them back to Him again.

 
A GOOD POEM


A good poem paints a picture
For both your heart and brain.
It doesn't need a second chance 
To make its meaning plain.

A good poem is like the flower, 
The lily or the rose.
God plants it in a poet's brain 
And there its beauty grows.

A good poem like a cardinal
Is pregnant with song;
You can’t help but hear its message 
As it sings what's right or wrong.

A good poem helps us remember 
What the joys of life are for,
It makes us want to love someone
'Till death comes knocking at our door.


POETRY


God has always had his poets, 
Who he watches with love from space.
But Satan has his poets too, 
Who try to lead us from our grace.

King Solomon was a poet, 
Who spoke of love, life, death, and war. 
That lips were like threads of scarlet, 
And that breasts were roses and more.

The wild birds sing and flowers bloom, 
As clouds form figures in the sky. 
But only humans will write poems, 
That shall last long after they die.

The eldest sister of all arts, 
Which some have called the devils wine.
Poetry is but pure passion, 
To stimulate the heart and mind.
 

ALL POETS SERVE A MASTER


Most poets have a bit of Solomon
Shakespeare and Poe within.
Constantly eager to share their visions
Of love, life, joy and sin.

Some guzzle whiskey
Some sip wine,
Some prefer cola
And feel just fine.

Some smoke pot
Or suck cigarettes,
Some abuse drugs
With lifetime regrets.

Some attend church
And sing of God,
While others make fun
And call them odd.

All have a purpose,
Which drives them to compose.
All serve a master,
Who by free will, they chose.



DIVINE INTERVENTION


I never write a poem
That doesn’t write itself.
I catch a buzz and come alive
Like a puppet off it’s shelf.

Hearing many voices,
Whose words are never mine.
My pen becomes a painter’s brush
Forming visions on a line.

I seem to be a better person,
When it’s time to sit down and write.
A higher power guides my hand,
Sharing wisdom by day and night.

People born to create,
Have no choice but to perform.
It’s the rush of sharing their gift,
That elevates them from the norm.

What would our world become,
Without intervention from above?
Angry beings in a revolving cage,
With no sense of passion or love. 


THE POWER OF POETRY


Poetry is the lighthouse of life
Guiding the lost from a stormy sea.
Without it’s presence darkness prevails
Keeping us from all we can be.

Poems are used to convey passion
By poets of both good and evil mood.
Some are hateful others loving
Sharing thoughts to be consumed as food.

Verse can lead us to glory or doom
As we partake with others within.
Depicting our past, present and future
With words of man’s grace or sin.

People write poetry because they have no choice
Answering to the call of their gift.
Where some tend to pull their readers down
Others compose to give them a lift.

Always remember the power of poetry
Is used by both heaven and hell.
It’s up to us to choose our pleasure
As poetry remains alive and well.


WHISPERS OF THE HEART


Poetry consumed is where wisdom begins
As we heed to the whispers of the heart.
It’s easy to blame others for our dismay
When from ignorance we refuse to part.

Verse is a beacon of hope in the darkness,
To help us navigate the pitfalls of strife.
Far more people write it, than read it,
And that’s why there’s endless conflict in life.

I write poems to help fuel the light
By sharing what God has given me.
With stories of life, love, war and more.
Where heroes pray on bended knee.

<p>MWSA Book Review TOM ZART MOST PUBLISHED POET ON THE WEB Love, War &amp; More Author: Tom Zart Publisher: Publish America Reviewer: Bill McDonald – President of the MWSA A Poet’s thoughts, on history, emotions and more… Normally you pick up a poetry book and it may run about 50 to 80 pages but not the man who is called “The Westport Poet." Poet Tom Zart gives the reader their money’s worth of poetry in his fine collection called “Love, War &amp; More." His book, at 267 pages, is filled with the thoughts and emotions of a dedicated poet and his vast spiritual tastes for life. His prose runs the gauntlet from relationships, battle, butterflies, and even one that ends the book called “Katrina,” about what happened in New Orleans. My favorite poem in his collection deals with turning 60 years old since I can relate to that experience. His poems are easy to read and more traditional in nature, as opposed to all those beat and new age writings that flourish in newer poetry books. It is readable by all mature family members and thought provoking at times. His war poetry covers everything from Pearl Harbor and D-Day to present day battles. He honors Soldiers and Sailors and our nation through many well thought out pieces of prose. There is something of interest in his collection of poetry for all readers. This is one of the most assorted and diverse collections of poetry ever assembled in one volume. For poetry lovers this will be a great book to buy. This book is given the MWSA's highest rating for a poetry book - 5 STARS!</p>

<p>Degrees from Heidelberg University, Germany; Vordiplom, (equivalent to a B.S.) in 1975, Diplom (or M.S.) in 1976 and Ph.D. in theoretical particle physics, summa cum laude, in 1978. Clemm-Haas Price for outstanding Ph. D. thesis at Heidelberg University; Cold Spring Harbor Summer School on Computational Neuroscience, 1985.</p>
<p>Klaus Lackner joined the faculty of Columbia University in 2001, where he is now the Ewing-Worzel Professor of Geophysics in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering. He received his Ph.D. in 1978 in theoretical physics from the University of Heidelberg, Germany. He held postdoctoral positions at the California Institute of Technology and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center before joining Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1983. He has been a scientist in the Theoretical Division for much of that time, but also has been part of the Laboratory’s upper management. He held several positions among them Acting Associate Laboratory Director for Strategic and Supporting Research, which represents roughly a third of Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Klaus Lackner’s scientific career started in the phenomenology of weakly interacting particles. Later searching for quarks, he and George Zweig developed the chemistry of atoms with fractional nuclear charge. He is still participating in matter searches for particles with a non-integer charge in an experiment conducted at Stanford by Martin Perl and his group. After joining Los Alamos National Laboratory, Klaus Lackner became involved in hydrodynamic work and fusion related research. In recent years, he has published on the behavior of high explosives, novel approaches to inertial confinement fusion, and numerical algorithms. His interest in self-replicating machine systems has been recognized by Discover Magazine as one of seven ideas that could change the world. Presently he is developing innovative approaches to energy issues of the future. He has been instrumental in forming ZECA, the Zero Emission Coal Alliance, which is an industry-led effort to develop coal power with zero emissions to the atmosphere. His recent work is on environmentally acceptable technologies for the use of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Tony Fitzjohn (7 July 1945-..) is the Field director of the George Adamson Wildlife Preservation Trust.</p>
<p>Fitzjohn was born in 1945 and grew up as a forster child in North London. At 21, Fitzjohn shipped off to Cape Town, South Africa. He worked odd jobs that included transporting uncut diamonds and working as a bouncer at a brothel. Five years later, in 1971, he wrote to Joy Adamson in Kenya. She mentioned that her husband, George, from whom she recently had separated, could use assistance with his lion project at the Kora Game Reserve in central Kenya.</p>
<p>What followed was a 18 year cooperation with George Adamson. During their time together, they successfully reintroduced more than 30 lions and 10 leopards into the wild. More importantly, perhaps, they also pioneered the development and management of the Kora National Park, setting up camps, creating airstrips and cutting more than 300 miles of bush roads, as well as fighting numerous battles with ivory poachers and bandits. In 1975, one of the wild lions near George Adamson's camp inexplicably attacked Tony Fitzjohn, biting him through the throat.</p>
<p>Fitzjohn and George Adamson were operating in a part of Kenya that was constantly invaded by Somali bandits and poachers. When Kenya's political stability slipped in the early 1980s, the government could no longer guarantee the duo's safety. Fitzjohn implored Adamson to come with him to Mkomazi and start over, but Adamson would not leave his beloved Kora.</p>
<p>Joy Adamson had been killed in 1980. In 1989, George Adamson was machine gunned by poarchers. The guilt that Fitzjohn carried with him has been transformed into determination.</p>
<p>Since 1989 he has overseen the 2,200-square-mile Mkomazi Game Reserve in northern Tanzania, where he is working to increase the numbers of African hunting dogs and black rhinos. The project is funded by the Adamson Wildlife Preservation Trusts. The trusts also support the Kora National Park in Kenya, the home of George Adamson and Tony Fitzjohn for 20 years.</p>
<p>Fitzjohn is married to Lucy (nee Jackson). They have four kids together. In 2001 Fitzjohn received Golden Ark award from Prince Bernhhard of the Netherlands.</p>

<p><b>Engine idling</b> refers to engines, usually in vehicles such as trucks, busses and locomotives, being left at <a href="../../../i/d/l/Idle_speed.html" title="Idle speed">idle speed</a> for prolonged periods. It is a major source of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_pollution.html" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a>. Reasons for drivers to keep their engines running at idle speed include the operation of special features of a vehicle such as heating, air conditioning, or watching television, the need to prevent the engine block from freezing (in extremely cold weather), and being accustomed to keeping an engine idle and/or not being aware of the consequences of engine idling.</p>
<p>According to a 2002 study by the American <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_Protection_Agency_b5e0.html" title="Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, heavy-duty diesel truck idling consumes approximately 960 million gallons of diesel fuel annually and releases 11 million tons of carbon dioxide, 180,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, and 5,000 tons of particulate matter every year. This causes deterioration of oil and oil filters and decreases the lifespan of engines.</p>
<p>The EPA recommends shutting down an engine when it is anticipated that the vehicle will stand still for over five minutes.</p>

<p><b>Juliane Werding</b> (born July 19th, 1956) is a German singer/songwriter, and has been an active recording artist since 1972.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-31_0de9.html" title="Edit section: Career Restrospective">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career Restrospective</span></h3>
<p><b>Beginnings:</b></p>
<p>In 1970, at the young age of 14, Juliane sent a demo-tape to the talent-scouting program "Talentschuppen" which was broadcast by the TV station SWF. She was invited to the preliminary round and won. The following year, she performed Udo Jürgens' song "Mein erster Weg" on same TV program, but was offered a contract before the show even aired.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1972, Juliane released "Am Tag als Conny Kramer starb," a German version of Joan Baez's hit "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down." The song went to first place in the German charts and stayed in the Top 10 for 14 weeks, even in spite of controversial lyrics. Since over 1,000,000 copies of the single were sold and an impressive 100,000 copies of Juliane's first LP, <i>In Tiefer Trauer</i>, also sold, she was awarded the "Goldene Europa" from the radio station "Europawelle Saar" and the "Golden BRAVO-Otto" for being the most popular singer of the year. The second single "Kinder des Regenbogens" was also released.</p>
<p>1973 saw the release of two new singles: "Wildes Wasser" and "Der ewige Soldat" as well as a brand new LP, <i>Mein Name ist Juliane</i>. In addition to continuing her recording career, Juliane attended business school for 2 years after passing the O-level finals.</p>
<p>Two more singles are released within the next year: "Morgens Fremde, mittags Freunde" and "Wenn ich ein Adler wär."</p>
<p>In 1975, Juliane returns to the charts after working with a new producer, Gunter Gabriel, with the single "Wenn du denkst, du denkst, dann denkst du nur du denkst" and takes 4th place. The album of the same title also appears. Juliane is again awarded an "Otto" award as well as "Silverner Löwe" of "RTL."</p>
<p>The following year another LP, <i>Komm' und hilf mir durch die Einsamkeit der Nacht</i>, was released, this time featuring only a select few new songs paired with selections from previous albums. The singles "Man muss das Leben eben nehmen, wie das Leben eben ist" and "Komm' und hilf mir durch die Einsamkeit der Nacht" accompany the album release.</p>
<p>Some major changes began to take place both professionally and personally within the next two years. Juliane worked with Tony Hendrik and Karin Hartmann as a new producer team. And after moving in with her boyfriend in Munich, she started to work on composing music and writing her own lyrics. The next album, <i>Ein Schritt weiter...</i> soon followed with a multitude of singles: "Nur noch eine Nacht," "Postfach auf der grünen Wiese" (a cover of Fleetwood Mac's "Don't Stop"), "Hotel Royal" and "Klappe auf, Klappe zu."</p>
<p>In 1979, Juliane travlled to India. She also makes her acting debut in the film "Palermo oder Wolfsburg" which is directed by Werner Schroeter.</p>
<p>The following year, Juliane released <i>Traumland</i>, an album which seemed to move in a different direction musically. Unfortunately, the album wasn't well received and Juliane decided to take a break from music. The single "Niemand hat Zeit" from <i>Traumland</i> (a cover of Styx's "Too Much Time On My Hands") was released in 1981.</p>
<p><b>A Second Chance:</b></p>
<p>After spending two years travelling, studying eastern mythology, learning to speak Italian, taking up wood carving, and training herself to be a PR woman for a big Munich agency, Juliane decides to return to the studio to record a cover of Mike Oldfield's "Moonlight Shadow" called "Nacht voll Schatten." Incidentally, Juliane would later work with Maggie Reilly, the singer on "Moonlight Shadow" and a number of Mike Oldfield's 80's songs. The new single was a huge success and reintroduced Juliane to the popular music world.</p>
<p>In 1984, the album <i>Ohne Angst</i> was released and helped greatly by two more incredibly successful singles: "Geh' nicht in die Stadt (heut Nacht)" and "Sonne auf der Haut" (Nik Kershaw's "Wouldn't It Be Good"). These songs were not only blockbusters in Germany, but also in the Benelux States. Despite this success and countless TV appearances, Juliane did not give up her PR job. This album also marked the beginning of a long-lasting cooperation with the Munich production team and composer Herald Steinhauer and writer Dr. Michael Kunze.</p>
<p>Two more singles from <i>Ohne Angst</i> appeared the following year: "Drei Jahre lang" and "Lohn der Angst." Juliane also began training as an alternative medical practitioner.</p>
<p>The next single showed Juliane's new-found staying power. "Stimmen im Wind" was elected "Song Of The Year" for 1986. And the LP <i>Sehnsucht ist unheilbar</i> remained in the charts for over a year and was awarded with platinum and triple gold status for selling 750,000 copies. In addition, the singles "Das Würfelspiel" and "Sehnsucht ist unheilbar" reach the Top 30.</p>
<p>1987 also saw the release of a new Juliane Werding album called <i>Jenseits der Nacht</i> which musically continued in a similar vein to <i>Sehnsucht ist unheilbar</i>. The first single, "Vielleicht irgendwann," immediately entered the charts. "Wahre Lügen" and "Tränen im Ozean" were also released as singles. The album reached gold status within the first year and Juliane was awarded the "Goldene Stimmgabel." As artist of the year, she was presented the Berolina award in Berlin by the TV station ZDF. She also gave birth to her song Gabriel on August 5th.</p>
<p>The following year continued the trend with the release of <i>Tarot</i>, which also reached gold status. The singles "Starke Gefüle" and "Tarot" helped make Juliane a regular TV guest again. And the third single from the album, "Nebelmond," became one of Juliane's most recognized songs.</p>
<p>This recent success led to the release of <i>Stationen</i> in 1989, a greatest hits compilation of songs released during that decade. The LP did include the song "Wie weit ist Eden," which became the next single. This album also reached gold status.</p>
<p>This same year, Juliane passed her final exams and finally began her own practice as an alternative medical practitioner in Munich. In addition, her daughter Charis Maria was born on July 11th.</p>
<p>Juliane began moving in different directions musically within the next few years. The 1990 album, <i>Zeit für Engel</i>, had a different production team, yet continued to solidify her recurring gold album status achievements. "Der Himmel schweigt" and "Zeit für Engel" were released as singles.</p>
<p><b>New Directions:</b></p>
<p>In 1990, Juliane also began a new venture by writing and publishing her first book "Mit ganzer Kraft gesund" with the help of her colleague Werner Stumpf.</p>
<p>Juliane's 1991 album <i>Zeit nach Avalon zu geh'n</i> again introduced a new producer in addition to a new songwriter and future collaborator Andreas Bärtels. Musically, there was a definite evolution in sound on this album. The singles releases were "Avalon" and "Rote Schuh." Once again, Juliane was presented with the "Golden Stimmgabel" award as the most successful artist of the year.</p>
<p>The following year, with the release of the album <i>Sie weiss was sie will</i>, Juliane took a much more active role in her music by becoming co-producer, along with her partner Andreas Bärtels and Mats Björklund, and having more songwriting credits to her name. The album and the single of the same name remained in the Top 100 for 3 months. The single "Geister über Afrika" is released within the next year.</p>
<p>In 1993, Juliane appeared on a ZDF program called "Traumjob" (Dream Job), where she searched for a duet partner and found a young singer, Ulrike Sauerland. They released the ballad "Nadza" (a cover of "Scarborough Fair") as a b-side to the single "Ans Meer zurück" from <i>Sie weiss was sie will</i>.</p>
<p>The album <i>Du scaffst es</i> was released in 1994. The title song and single is a cover of Roy Orbison's hit "You Got It." The second single was very unique in that Juliane had two guest singers and the song was sung in German, English and French. "Engel wie Du" (Angel With You) featured Maggie Reilly and Viktor Lazlo. The trio went on tour giving very successful concerts in 20 German cities that fall.</p>
<p>In 1995, "Singles," the third single from <i>Du schaffst es</i> was released. Shortly after, Juliane established herself as a live artist on a celebrated solo tour visiting 13 cities. In September of that year another new single appeared, "Alles Okay?" This would be the title song from the next album which was released in October.</p>
<p>The second single from <i>Alles Okay</i> was released in 1996 called "Gib' niemals auf." At this time, Juliane also began working on another new album, <i>Land der langsamen Zeit</i>. And by the beginning of the next year, a brand new single was released in addition to the album, called "Weiss du, wer ich bin." This new album instantly made it into the Top 30 of the "Media Control" charts. In addition, this album had an entirely different musical style, borrowing world music influences, smooth jazz instrumentation and new age style ambience.</p>
<p>Another successful tour followed in 1998. Juliane was also awarded the "Goldene Stimmgabel" in October. The new single "Männer kommen und geh'n" was soon released, followed by the album <i>Sie</i>. This album reached the Top 40 on the "Media Control" charts and continued to explore the musical ground that the previous album opened up while tempering it with some more familiar style material. An interesting collaboration featured here is "I Remember" with Howard Jones.</p>
<p>In 1999, Juliane split from her partner and hit producer Andreas Bärtels who had been largely responsible for the unique and varied qualities of Juliane's albums throughout the 90's. But at the same time, Juliane released a new compilation album called "Der Weg 1972-1999."</p>
<p>To promote the greatest hits collection, Juliane went on tour in 2000 with an 8-piece band and gave 27 highly successful concerts. On two separate occasions, the concert hall "Friedrichstadtpalast" in Berlin had sold out concerts as did the concert hall "Kulturpalast" in Dresden, which has been unprecedented in her musical genre. In August, Juliane also split from her record label WEA after a successful cooperation for 15 years. Towards the end of the year, she took acting courses and played a part in the theatre production "Die Vagina-Monologe" by Eve Ensler. The piece was performed in the "Metropol-Theater" in Munich. In addition, Juliane wrote 2 treatments for TV series. And finally, Juliane signed with Polydor (Universal Music).</p>
<p>2001 saw the release of Juliane's <i>Es gibt kein Zurück</i> album. Strangely enough, despite their break-up, Juliane still worked with Andreas Bärtels on the album, co-writing and producing the bulk of the material together. The first single was the title track, released in February. The second single was a cover of German singer/songwriter Marque's "One To Make Her Happy." The same year, Juliane published her second book called "Sagen sie mal Herr Jesus...", with fictitious, funny and provocative interviews with personalities from the Bible.</p>
<p>After a couple years break from music, Juliane returned to the studio to work on her 20th album called <i>Die Welt danach</i>. For the first time in almost 15 years, she again began writing songs with Herald Steinhauer who ended up co-producing the album. Another successful tour followed. 2004 also saw the release of Juliane's first DVD <i>Juliane Werding - In Concert</i>.</p>
<p><b>Latest Album:</b></p>
<p>By 2006, Juliane was ready to release her 21st album <i>Sehnsucher</i>. The first single was "Vergiss nicht, dass du lebst" which contained the bonus track "Kleine männer." Within a couple months after the album's release, the accompanying book <i>Sehnsucher - 7 Wege, mit der Sehnsucht zu leben (Seven Ways To Live With Longing)</i> was released.</p>

<p>Mount Vernon Youth Athletic Association (MVYAA) is an all-volunteer community program with a stated mission of "developing good citizenship and building character in youths through the use of wholesome athletic activity." MVYAA has been in existance since about 1965 and over the years has been involved in several sports. Currently MVYAA only offers basketball, although a splinter group also runs a girl's softball program. MVYAA is fields "select" teams in the Fairfax County Youth League. MVYAA also runs "house" leagues with over 700 children from age 5 to age 18.</p>
<p>MVYAA "select" teams are composed of players who try-out and who are drafted to play. In the "house" leagues on the other hand, all players who sign-up will be assessed and assigned to a team. The House league intentionally moves players from team to team over the years, as this helps to build community rather than rivalries. Additionally, the House leagues have a very strict participation rule requiring all coaches to play each player not less than two quarters per game.</p>
<p>MVYAA plays games in gyms across Fairfax County, and the MVYAA House leagues are centered in the southern end of Fairfax County. MVYAA teen leagues play most of their games in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Saudi_Academy_756c.html" title="Islamic Saudi Academy">Islamic Saudi Academy</a>. The Islamic Saudi Academy (ISA) is one of MVYAA's best community partners and the ISA has placed teams in the MVYAA county leagues.</p>

<p>Cheney Tech began in 1912, started by Mr Howell Cheney with the establishment of a textile school on hartford road. The main idea was to offer specialized training for people wanting to work at the silk mills. In 1915 the school was moved to the Franklyn Building on Main and School Streets, and the classes were expanded with the add-on of carpentry, electrical, machine tool, and mechanical drafting. In 1924 the school moved to a new builing on school street. In 1943, the name of the school was changed to Howell Cheney Regional Vocational-Technical School In honor of Mr Howell Cheney. In 1946, the ideals of vocational education went a major change. Along with specialized trade training, the student was offered courses in related and general education. Mathematics, science, and blueprint reading were now taught at Cheney Tech, and English and social studies were offered in co-operation with Manchester High School. This co-operative plan also permitted students from Manchester High School to take trade training at Cheney Tech as part-time technical students. In 1954, the co-operative plan was discontinued in favor of Cheney Tech offering a complete academic and trade program of study. As student enrollment increased at Cheney Tech during the post-war years, plans were made for the creation of a new school. In 1962, the new school at West Middle Turnpike was opened. The expanded program included new trades in automotive technology, tool and die making, and electronics. In 1982 a second floor was added to house additional classrooms, and a wing was added to the shops. New trade offerings added to the curriculum were Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning, Welding, and Diesel Mechanics. The 1990s have seen the addition of Micro computer Technology and Culinary Arts to the trade program. Students at Howell Cheney Technical School are challenged by the faculty to push themselves in their studies to become the best students and technicians they can be. The students are challenged to ask questions, to analyze complex data, to solve problems, and to work together to achieve excellence in their trade and academic studies. In February 2005 Cheney tech underwent a $45 million expansion/ renovation project to include: the construction of a three-story addition that would house all technology programs; addition of a new culinary arts kitchen, bakery, and public restaurant; and all new academic classrooms, library media center, administration/guidance/support services/gymnasium, locker rooms, and fitness center. The project is scheduled for total completion by spring 2007 And in year 2006 Cheney tech combined electronics with micro to form information systems technology due to lacking students in both classes. Howell Cheney Technical School approaches the 21st century with pride in its glorious history, and with anticipation of the many positive contributions our students will make to the future.</p>

<p>IN THE SHADOWS?? Not Quite…..</p>
<p>As I was in Adelaide last month, I had an interesting meeting with the not-so famous half of the Chandhok siblings. As his brother is out scorching the race tracks and winning races, Suhail, the younger brother of Karun Chandhok, is playing cricket and studying at the University of Adelaide. I caught up with him to find out more about cricket in Australia and whether BIG BROTHER’S fame has affected him.</p>
<p>MK : A question that I’m sure you’ve answered often, why not motorsport?</p>
<p>SC : Well I know its in my blood and I took to go-karting but I always drifted towards any bat-ball sport. Cricket soon became a passion.</p>
<p>MK : Was there any pressure from family though?</p>
<p>SC : (laughs)Not at all. In fact I think my dad’s really happy because I think he’d probably be living on the streets if he had to fund another son’s racing career.</p>
<p>MK : Why Australia though? It seems to be the trend to move out of the country now doesn’t it?</p>
<p>SC : I’m not sure about trends but I think it was always a dream for me to play cricket outside India and I was fortunate to be accepted by the team here and the University. I played a lot of cricket in Madras but was often bogged down by the pressure and politics that surrounds the sport back home.</p>
<p>MK : What major changes have you seen here though?</p>
<p>SC : Firstly, I think the way they approach the game is extremely professional. Everything is based on merit and not who you know and what string you can pull !! They put fitness first and also bring in the mental aspect of the game, which is very vital in the sport. When it comes to coaching I don’t think it’s too different. I was fortunate to have extremely committed coaches in Madras who laid the ideal foundation for me and taught me all that I know.</p>
<p>MK : Do you see yourself playing professional cricket in a few years as well?</p>
<p>SC : I think with a sportsman, 1 year can change everything. If you want something bad enough, you can get it. I have my eyes set playing for a while. I am now playing grade cricket for the Adelaide University Cricket Club with recognized state cricketers. The likes of Carl Hooper, Michael Slater and more recently Liam Plunkett have played for the club and I hope to make it to the A’s by the end of the year. I think I learnt from Karun and lost 13kgs after I got here which has definitely helped my game. I am going to pursue a sports management degree as well so whether I am playing or not, I know I will be in and around the sporting world !!</p>
<p>MK : Sports management? Does that mean you may opt to manage your brother?</p>
<p>SC : (laughs) Why not. I’d let him do the driving and I’ll just take care of the finances.</p>
<p>MK : What’s it like to be overshadowed by his fame?</p>
<p>SC : I really don’t think about it like that. If we were both racing then maybe so but I’m on another path. We respect what each of us has achieved. From being a guy who weighed close to 100kgs to who he is today.. I’ve taken a leaf out of his book.</p>
<p>MK : Do you think he’ll make it to F1?</p>
<p>SC : Well based on commitment, I would say yes but there are more important aspects that come into play. The finances have to come through. Although Narain has opened up the sport in the country I don’t think the major corporates have climbed onto the bandwagon just yet. I think Karun has proved that when you put him in the car and he’s under the helmet, he knows what he has to do and certainly gets the job done.</p>
<p>MK : What is the real Karun like? Outside the car, how does he spend his time?</p>
<p>SC : I think he’s just like anyone else. He likes to hang out with his friends whenever he can, play GP4 with Narain or stay at home and play cricket. His favourite pastime would definitely be talking to my dog though. They go at it for hours on end. We barely see him though because he’s either at the gym or cycling to keep fit. I think his key to success has been his dedication and although he’s never had things come easy he has certainly proved a point to his critics this year.</p>
<p>MK : Finally, your mentor or idol ? And a message to others who are thinking about the shift to Australia…</p>
<p>SC : My mentor or idol would have to be Mr. V.B. Chandrasekar, my cricket coach in India. He’s a gem of a person and has always supported me through everything (although I can still never tell when he’s actually really angry). As for anyone who is thinking about The Land Down Under, I would say go for it. The people are extremely friendly and the country is sport crazy. I love it for the sport !!</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-31_0de9.html" title="Edit section: Flying Lotus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Flying Lotus</span></h2>
<p>Los Angeles resident Flying Lotus brings beats with a cinematic flare: "I see these tracks as little short films that play in my head." Flying Lotus is a free spirit: "I have this beautiful lemon tree in my backyard, and on a sunny day the light shines through. Little things like that inspire me." Flying Lotus is a Coltrane: "My greatest influences are my family, I'm lucky to have been around so many accomplished musicians." And most importantly, Flying Lotus is a visionary; get ready to meet your favorite new producer.</p>
<p>From note one, there is a feeling of something new and exciting at play here. Keyboards wobble and wiggle with mutated funk, skewed rhythms grind underneath, warped samples play hide-and-seek with the beat- in other words, that "next level shit" artists are always talking about? This is it.</p>
<p>While the title 1983 may conjure images of parachute pants and asymmetrical 'dos, the '83 Lotus envisions isn't the typical retro cheese covered by VH1 specials. This is Blade Runner, Bambaataa, the Bomb Squad, and Basquiat. This is the musical future Prince was dreamin' about- forgive us if we go astray. Just listen to "Orbit Brazil": synths float into space with melodic optimism, grimed out in a dystopian sheen. By track's end, you really feel like you're at zero gravity, peering through your space mask at the sweaty Brasilian booties bumpin' (it's cause they're listening to Lotus).</p>
<p>And yeah, Lotus is a part of the Coltrane lineage, but don't write this off as nepotism, cause he ain't riding on anyone's coattails. But, if you really MUST make the correlation between A Love Supreme and A Lotus Supreme, dig: If Alice and John had lived in the era of SP-303s and laptops, they'd be flirting with the same muse as Lotus is.</p>
<p>Flying Lotus IS a visionary. He is tapping that well of creative juice that seems to float in the ether for certain artists every generation, carving his own path through the wilds of the beat. By the time you read this, Lotus will already be making the music everyone and their robot will be biting through 2030. Like most natural talents, though, Lotus' aspirations are simple: "I just want to keep having fun."</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom the term paramedic is protected by law and only applies ambulance practitioners who are able to achieve and maintain strict standards established by a statutory body. The Health Professions Council (H.P.C) requires paramedics to enter on to a register before being allowed to work autonomously. It sets the profession’s standards of proficiency and expects registrants to work by codes of ethics, conduct and performance.</p>
<p>Paramedics are expected to work using the clinical standards set by their employers. These vary throughout the country but increasingly are being brought into line with national guidelines. The Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee, a collection of professionals from the U.K.’s medical, nursing, and ambulance communities, have produced these guidelines bi-annually since 2000. This group reviews its advice based on the principles of evidence based medicine and best practice.</p>
<p>Unlike other countries, there is only one legal level of practitioner. However, many paramedics have undertaken further training or higher educational programmes in order to work as advanced practitioners. Community paramedics and emergency care practitioners vary in the scope of their practice throughout the country but can be found offering unscheduled care in the community in lieu of G.P. visits.</p>

<p>Traditionally the only route to becoming a paramedic was to join an NHS ambulance service and work towards the position from non-emergency patient transport roles through to the emergency division. After qualifying and working as an ambulance technician for a period, it was possible to internally apply for paramedic training. Although offered at ambulance service training departments, the curriculum and certification were awarded by a private company called IHCD. Such paramedic training was usually a 10 week course with some of this time spent in a hospital operating theatre, assisting the anaesthetist. Completion of the course allowed the paramedic to register with the then legislative body (state registration).</p>
<p>It was nearly impossible for non-NHS employees to access such courses, and many private ambulance companies provided their own training. However, lack of recognition by the regulatory body for such training created a problem. This was compounded by paramedical staff leaving the armed forces found their training unrecognised. Eventually the term paramedic was used by variety of people with varying levels of ability. After the incorporation of the H.P.C. the paramedic became legally defined and private and military ambulance staff were given an opportunity to have their training and experience reviewed (grand parenting) against the new standards. This allowed many to register.</p>
<p>Eventually the IHCD began to accredit non-NHS training establishments, alowing them to teach their ciriculum. In the mid 1990s some universities started to offer paramedicine diplomas and degrees, in association with local Ambulance Trusts. These incorporated the IHCD ciriculum and allowed registration. Later, the HPC and British Paramedic Association defined the educational standards required to register, removing the requirement for the IHCD material to be the core of such programmes. Only recognised courses will lead to registration however.</p>
<p>The higher educational route is still considered controversial, with some more experienced ambulance staff arguing that such a fast-track approach misses the experience of PTS where recruits learn vital interpersonal skills.</p>

<p>The NHS employs the majority of paramedics, usually in the role of clinical lead on accident and emergency ambulances. However, some are employed by the NHS in providing other services such as G.P. practice based roles, community unscheduled care provision, and within minor injury units. Private sector paramedics are often found providing medical services at large public events, at remote industrial sites, as lectuers and trainers, or increasingly as contractors working on behalf of the NHS in accident and emergency work.</p>

<p>The British Paramedic Association is the paramedic's professional body in the U.K. It was formed relatively soon after the H.P.C.'s incorporation but only due to Government pressure rather than peer demand. It was the only profession regulated by the H.P.C. without such a body and this situation was deemed unallowable. It was important the profession could maintain self regulation responsibilities for standards and education. At the time paramedics were still struggling with what it mean to be a professional rather than a vocational worker and the B.P.A. was eyed with some suspicion. As a consequence membership is still relatively small compared to the body of the profession as a whole. It does not offer industrial relations or other services normally associated with trade unions.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom the term paramedic is protected by law and only applies ambulance practitioners who are able to achieve and maintain strict standards established by a statutory body. The Health Professions Council (H.P.C) requires paramedics to enter on to a register before being allowed to work autonomously. It sets the profession’s standards of proficiency and expects registrants to work by codes of ethics, conduct and performance.</p>
<p>Paramedics are expected to work using the clinical standards set by their employers. These vary throughout the country but increasingly are being brought into line with national guidelines. The Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee, a collection of professionals from the U.K.’s medical, nursing, and ambulance communities, have produced these guidelines bi-annually since 2000. This group reviews its advice based on the principles of evidence based medicine and best practice.</p>
<p>Unlike other countries, there is only one legal level of practitioner. However, many paramedics have undertaken further training or higher educational programmes in order to work as advanced practitioners. Community paramedics and emergency care practitioners vary in the scope of their practice throughout the country but can be found offering unscheduled care in the community in lieu of G.P. visits.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-31_0de9.html" title="Edit section: Qualifications">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Qualifications</span></h3>
<p>Traditionally the only route to becoming a paramedic was to join an NHS ambulance service and work towards the position from non-emergency patient transport roles through to the emergency division. After qualifying and working as an ambulance technician for a period, it was possible to internally apply for paramedic training. Although offered at ambulance service training departments, the curriculum and certification were awarded by a private company called IHCD. Such paramedic training was usually a 10 week course with some of this time spent in a hospital operating theatre, assisting the anaesthetist. Completion of the course allowed the paramedic to register with the then legislative body (state registration).</p>
<p>It was nearly impossible for non-NHS employees to access such courses, and many private ambulance companies provided their own training. However, lack of recognition by the regulatory body for such training created a problem. This was compounded by paramedical staff leaving the armed forces found their training unrecognised. Eventually the term paramedic was used by variety of people with varying levels of ability. After the incorporation of the H.P.C. the paramedic became legally defined and private and military ambulance staff were given an opportunity to have their training and experience reviewed (grand parenting) against the new standards. This allowed many to register.</p>
<p>Eventually the IHCD began to accredit non-NHS training establishments, alowing them to teach their ciriculum. In the mid 1990s some universities started to offer paramedicine diplomas and degrees, in association with local Ambulance Trusts. These incorporated the IHCD ciriculum and allowed registration. Later, the HPC and British Paramedic Association defined the educational standards required to register, removing the requirement for the IHCD material to be the core of such programmes. Only recognised courses will lead to registration however.</p>
<p>The higher educational route is still considered controversial, with some more experienced ambulance staff arguing that such a fast-track approach misses the experience of PTS where recruits learn vital interpersonal skills.</p>

<p>The NHS employs the majority of paramedics, usually in the role of clinical lead on accident and emergency ambulances. However, some are employed by the NHS in providing other services such as G.P. practice based roles, community unscheduled care provision, and within minor injury units. Private sector paramedics are often found providing medical services at large public events, at remote industrial sites, as lectuers and trainers, or increasingly as contractors working on behalf of the NHS in accident and emergency work.</p>

<p>The British Paramedic Association is the paramedic's professional body in the U.K. It was formed relatively soon after the H.P.C.'s incorporation but only due to Government pressure rather than peer demand. It was the only profession regulated by the H.P.C. without such a body and this situation was deemed unallowable. It was important the profession could maintain self regulation responsibilities for standards and education. At the time paramedics were still struggling with what it mean to be a professional rather than a vocational worker and the B.P.A. was eyed with some suspicion. As a consequence membership is still relatively small compared to the body of the profession as a whole. It does not offer industrial relations or other services normally associated with trade unions.</p>

<p><i>"jed-i-ism"</i></p>
<p>We are a community united in discovering the nature of The Force of Creation of the Universe and using our powers, mental, physical, spiritual and mystical for the good of ourselves and others. We are not the fictional Jedi you have seen in Star Wars but are <b>Real Jedi</b>, in this Galaxy, in this Universe. Jediism is both an old and new religion; we did the same thing that religions have done for thousands of years … we asimilated spiritual teachings from other and ancient faiths. Taoism, Zen Buddhism, Mysticism, as well as the honorable martial art’s philosophies; this spiritual mixture is potent. We call this fusion<i>“Jediism”.</i></p>
<p><b>ORIGION OF JEDIISM AS A NEW WORLD RELIGION</b></p>
<p>The Temple of the Jedi Order is a legal and highly organized religious community. The members of this reigion are dedicated to the teachings of the Jedi Code, Jedi Creed, &amp; those of the 16 Teachings. The objective of the Order is to spread the teachings and beliefs of Jediism in a peaceful and friendly manner. The teachings are taught by the Master and Apprentice relationship. The Temple of the Jedi Order has a Council that consists of the most knowledged and wise Jedi within our community, known as Council members. The Jedi concept's and ideals are based off the teachings of Joesph Campbell &amp; his insight into the simularity of all the world's religion's.</p>
<p><b>TEMPLE OF THE JEDI ORDER DEFINITION OF RELIGION</b></p>
<p><i>re·li·gion</i></p>
<p>A set of beliefs, values, and practices; a cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion; a system of thought, feeling, and action that is shared by a group and that gives the members a code of behavior by which individuals may judge the personal and social consequences of their actions; and a frame of reference by which individuals may relate to their group, their universe and The Force Of Creation [The Force]. The definition of The Force is left to each individual’s conscience.</p>
<p>Many Jedi follow a syncretistic religion -- a faith involving elements from two or more religions.*</p>
<ul>
<li>One can be a Jedi Jedi, a Wiccan Jedi, a Christian Jedi, a Buddhist Jedi, an Agnostic Jedi … Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>TEMPLE OF THE JEDI ORDER STATEMENT OF BELIEFS</b></p>
<p><i>Jedi Believe:</i></p>
<p>1.) In the inherent worth of every person. People are worthy of respect, support, and caring just because they are human.</p>
<p>2.) In working towards a culture that is relatively free of discrimination on the basis of gender, race, sexual orientation, national origin, degree of ability, age, etc.</p>
<p>3.) In the sanctity of the human person. We oppose the use of torture and cruel or unusual punishment including the death penalty.</p>
<p>4.) In the importance of democracy within religious, political and other structures.</p>
<p>5.) In the separation of church and state; and the freedoms of speech, association, and expression.</p>
<p>6.) That the systems of truth in the field of morals, ethics, and religious belief that we have studied are not absolute: they vary by culture, by religion, and over time.</p>
<p>7.) In the generally positive influence that most religions have had on their followers and on society.</p>
<p>8.) In the importance of individual believers determining evil influences and policies within their chosen faith group, and advocate for their correction.</p>
<p>9.) In the importance of education. We believe that people are not truly educated unless they have studied at least the world's major religions and ethical systems. They need to learn of the good and bad impacts they have had on society.</p>
<p><b>HOW TO BECOME A JEDI?</b></p>
<p>1.) Profess to yourself and proclaim your acknowledgment of being a Jedi. Follow the Jedi ideals and beliefs. You may hold other spiritual convictions along with being a Jedi and loyalty to both is attainable and encouraged, for your focus determines your reality.</p>
<p>2.) Believe in the Force and its power, a Jedi is devoted to the Force, being committed to the ideals of a Jedi is a pervading tenet. A Jedi does not serve the dark side in any way, in thought or in deed. A Jedi acts in a righteous manner defining the principles of a true Jedi. Knowledge and a relationship will you develop with the Force, it resides within you, surrounds you and flows through you.</p>
<p>3.) Accept the Jedi teachings that were professed by all Jedi Masters. Their teachings give a spiritual guidance to all Jedi. The melding of the different faiths give the Jedi the direction, knowledge and wisdom that aid in life’s journey.</p>
<p>4.) Learn from other Jedi and unlearn what you have learned. The knowledge and support of other Jedi will do nothing but increase your own knowledge and awareness of the Force. On-line fellowship is conducive to the learning process of a Jedi, a process that never has an end.</p>
<p>5.) Profess to be a Jedi if you will, but take heart be not boastful or prideful in your abilities and in your talents as you journey along your path.</p>
<p><b>THE JEDI CODE</b></p>
<p><i>There is no emotion; there is peace.</i></p>
<p>There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.</p>
<p>There is no passion; there is serenity.</p>
<p>There is no death; there is the Force.</p>
<p><br />
Jedi are the guardians of peace and justice throughout the World. Jedi use their powers to defend and protect, never to attack others. Jedi respect all life, in all it’s forms, they are humble and live to serve all living things. For the good of others, Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and wisdom, a journey that is never ends.</p>
<p><b>THREE MAIN TENETS OF THE JEDI ORDER</b></p>
<p>Focus - Knowledge - Wisdom</p>
<p>The purpose of our existence is to Love, to Learn and to be Kind.</p>
<p><b>THE JEDI CREED</b></p>
<p><i>I am a Jedi, an instrument of peace.</i> Where there is hatred I shall bring love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.</p>
<p>I am a Jedi. I shall never seek so much to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.</p>
<p>The Force is always with me. I am a Jedi.</p>
<p><b>THE 16 TEACHINGS OF THE JEDI</b></p>
<p>1. Jedi must maintain a clear mind, it is achieved through meditation and contemplation. The mind can become cluttered and must be purged of the unnecessary elements on a daily basis, our minds can be infected by forces and attitudes that we encounter every day.</p>
<p><br />
2. Jedi live and focus on the present; they must neither dwell on the past nor be concerned about the future. As the mind wanders, focusing on the present is a task not easily attained, for the mind is not content with the eternal present moment, release the stress and ease your mind.</p>
<p>3. Jedi feel the Living Force flowing around them, they are spiritually aware of the Force, and are sensitive to its energy and its fluctuations and disturbances.</p>
<p>4. Jedi trust and use their feelings, they are intuitive, more so than others and with this heightened intuition they are more spiritually evolved their mind is in harmony with the force.</p>
<p>5. Jedi are mindful of their thoughts, they focus their thoughts on the positive. The positive energy of the force is healthy for the mind, body and spirit.</p>
<p>6. Jedi believe in Patience. Patience can be an elusive quality, but can be consciously developed over time.</p>
<p>7. Jedi protect the peace, they are warriors of peace and are not ones to use force to resolve a conflict; it is through peace, understanding and harmony that conflicts are able to be resolved.</p>
<p>8. Jedi must be mindful of the emotions that lead to the dark side: Fear, Anger, Aggression, and Hate. If a Jedi senses these emotions manifesting within oneself, they know they must meditate so that a purging of these destructive emotions ensues.</p>
<p>9. Jedi understand that physical training is as important as training the mind and the spirit, all are necessary to maintain the Jedi way of life and to perform the duties of a Jedi.</p>
<p>10. Jedi believe in destiny and trust in the will of the Force, they accept the fact that what seems to be random events are not random at all, but the design of creation at its deepest level. Each living creature has a purpose, understanding that purpose comes with a deep awareness of the force.</p>
<p>11. Jedi must let go of attachments, both material and personal. The Obsession of possessions create the fear of loosing those possessions, which can lead to the dark side.</p>
<p>12. Jedi believe in eternal life, they do not mourn those who pass. Grieve people as you will but take heart, for their soul and spirit will continue.</p>
<p>13. Jedi use the Force only when it is necessary, they do not apply their powers to boast or be prideful, for knowledge do they use it, for humility is a trait all Jedi must be always embody.</p>
<p>14. Compassion and love are central to a Jedi’s life. Jedi believe that the core of everything is love. We must love each other as we love ourselves, having done this shall all of creation be enveloped in the positive energy of the Force.</p>
<p>15. Jedi are committed and loyal to the Jedi cause, the ideals of the Jedi define the belief of Jediism, they take action on this path for self improvement, and to assist others, they are both the witnesses and protectors of Jediism.</p>
<p>16. Jedi are guardians of peace and justice. Jedi deeply believe in finding peaceful solutions to problems, gifted as they are they remain negotiators of the utmost ability. They never negotiate out of fear but never fear to negotiate. Jedi embrace justice, protecting and preserving the fundamental rights of all living creatures. Empathy and compassion are vital to the Jedi, it allows the Jedi to comprehend the wounds caused by injustice.</p>
