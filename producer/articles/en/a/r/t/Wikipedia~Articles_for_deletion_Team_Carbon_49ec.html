<li><b>Comment</b> In my relatively short time participating in AfD discussions I have seen a lot of grief come from these mass nominations and not once have I seen one result in a well-organized, thoughtful debate that came to any sort of conclusion. No offense to the nominator. Maybe this is a strategy that needs to be rethought or retired?--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 08:35, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would note that the majority of the articles nominated, aside from <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnathan_Wendel_90df.html" title="Johnathan Wendel">Johnathan Wendel</a>, have been created solely by one user, in an act that appears to be promotional intention. None of the other persons, or teams, appear notable under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> at the current time. Perhaps in the future - but right now, this appears to be simply an attempt to drum up publicity for Major League Gaming. <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 08:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While I have had some bad experiences with mass nominations as well, I have seen and even started some good, successful ones as well.

Recently, we have had some mass nominations of towers (radio towers mainly) which went quite smoothly as well. But the articles have to be fairly similar or very related to have a successful discussion (no matter if the result is delete or keep, like with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Abusaria_f8d6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Abusaria">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Abusaria</a>). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:05, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Partial Delete</b> In the electronic sports circuit, the Major League Gaming is regarded as being non-notable, or only minor at best. The same goes for its players and teams. It seems that these articles were mostly created by people from the MLG in order to extend its playerbase onto WP. There are three articles here nominated however, that are not linked to the MLG and that are actually on top professional gamers/teams. These three being <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_NoA_65ed.html" title="Team NoA">Team NoA</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnathan__Fatal1ty__Wendel_a91e.html" title="Johnathan &quot;Fatal1ty&quot; Wendel">Johnathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel</a>. For instance, they have all performed at a top level this year, as shown in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_e-Sports_World_Champions_c248.html" title="2006 e-Sports World Champions">2006 e-Sports World Champions</a>. Therefore, <b>delete the MLG related articles</b> and <b>keep the actual professional gamers and teams</b> <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_NoA_65ed.html" title="Team NoA">Team NoA</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnathan__Fatal1ty__Wendel_a91e.html" title="Johnathan &quot;Fatal1ty&quot; Wendel">Johnathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjith_4679.html" title="User:Djith">DJiTH</a> 12:56, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Instead of attacking this, why not cite why they're notable? I have grouped those teams in because they were included in the contributors' contributions.

<dd>Additionally, both the Team NoA and Team 3D articles significantly pre-date the other articles (both being about 2 years old) and contain actual content instead of just the MLG records of the teams. If you review the articles, you will see that these two teams are, in fact, notable. Also, I think they call hunting down any articles edited by another author <i>"Wiki-stalking"</i>. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 23:47, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While it may constitute as <i>"wiki-stalking,"</i> when you see an editor making several pages all of which are non-notable, then logic would dictate that you'd see what this guy is up to.

<li><b>Comment</b> - There is no possible way that this AFD can end in anything but no consensus. I'd say keep for the major teams such as Team Carbon and Str8 Ripping, and would probably merge the specific players. These are teams with major press and TV coverage, I'm not too familiar with them myself as I'm more of a PC gamer. These teams and the events they compete in will have third party press sources in which to build articles from.

They won the 2005 <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Cyber_Games_ff08.html" title="World Cyber Games">World Cyber Games</a> in Halo 2, which according to Wikipedia, is "the largest gaming festival celebrated once a year".

I may be wrong, but I believe that they have been discussed on the gaming channel G4 multiple times. They are #1 and #2 in the MLG league, which I do not believe is non-notable or minor (what other leagues have a TV spot on USA, a channel carried in most homes across the country?) According to Wikipedia notability standards, they belong. They: "are competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable" "have a large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following" I could add more sources, more, better arguments, but I hope that will suffice, as I don't want to spend way more time on this than necessary. If it doesn't I will keep adding, keep sourcing, I will locate better sources (there are just the first few I found).

Most of the players have been featured in an article AND a magazine- the only players I can think of that haven't been featured in both are maybe StrongSide and Cpt. Anarchy, MAYBE! I have put in the rest of the references, cleaned up the first paragraphs in each electronic sports team wikipage and removed all the nonsense. Since all the team pages are clean, all the members should be clean as well. These pages are significant because all the players and teams have been shown on television from November 2006 to the end of December 2006 on USA Network on the weekly basis. I even put a link to episode 5 and 6 on every highly relevant page. They all have been featured in atleast a magazine, article, and some have been on the radio.

<dd>Trivial being the publishing media not falling for something that's more of a facade than the actual real thing? Any media publishing on the MLG with the claim that this is 'the real thing' have no idea what they're talking about and just fell for the MLG money-generated PR-machine. As said before, within the global e-Sports circuit, the MLG is regarded as non-notable, only minor at best. This being due to all kinds of factors, such as the competition model, the platforms being chosen, and so on. But most importantly, the lack of competitive nature and skill curve in the games being chosen. These players and teams should not have an article.. Players like Johan "Toxic" Quick, Paul "czm" Nelson, Xiaofeng "Sky" Li, fnatic, Pentagram, etc. should. Wikipedians should not forget being on the lookout for companies like these that are trying to re-invent history.. -- <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjith_4679.html" title="User:Djith">DJiTH</a> 03:11, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Show me some proof that the "global e-sports circut" considers MLG non-notable, for I've never heard of this. This just sounds like your opinion, which group would you rather push? Even if MLG's "PR machine" is "trying to re-invent history" , they're succeeding, because many people, even non-gamers and casual gamers have heard of MLG, and its members get widespread media attention, making them notable by Wikipedia's standards, which is all that matters. This AfD debate is not about whether you like MLG and their set-ups and gametypes or whether or not they're overshadowing "better" leagues, but whether or not they meet Wikipedia standards to deserve an article, which they clearly do. <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 03:33, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Generally, MLG is only featured on websites and other media that have no target of covering e-Sports. You will mostly see MLG featured in either business media or mainstream media, while both are obviously not knowledgeable of the field of e-Sports (yet). Sure, there will be articles on e-Sports websites, but only sporadicly. Though, you're pointing out an excellent flaw here in the Wikipedia standards, basically that journalists can invent history, or worse, that vampire corporations can use media as a tool to do so. That being said, regard the following sentence from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: "Third-party verification from a non-trivial publication outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity should be provided to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized—meeting the first criterion—as performing in a fully professional league or at the highest level.". Now regard that most of the references made in player articles are from the MLG's own website, or from MLG affiliates, like "USA Network". That aside, I'm not involved in any crusade against the MLG, on the contrary even, but I just think that there needs to be some counter-pressure against the way it currently operates and tries to position itself in the media. It's dangerous in a field that is relatively young, is the lastest buzz, and where media have no background in the subject yet. Yes, the MLG should have an article, but the players should not, whereas they have only played in one single, minor, national competition, and only have for a short period of time (apart from some participating in WSVG). Using money as the only motivation just harms the sport and the truth. If you are able to look at the whole field objectively, whether you are related to MLG or not, you will have to come to the conclusion that WCG, ESWC, CPL, WSVG, WEG, KODE and so forth are all more notable than MLG, definitely on a global scale. This all being said, multiple people suggest that this AfD will never reach any consensus and I think so too. So let's leave this for what it is and close the listing. -- <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjith_4679.html" title="User:Djith">DJiTH</a> 14:45, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm familiar with e-sports. And whereas I consider the CPL and WCG to be of vastly greater importance than childsplay on consoles like the MLG, the mainstream press sees no different.

<p>Please do not even comment on this board unless you have a good understanding of the leagues. Why would WCG even take Halo off of their list of competitive games if MLG is so small? In addition, why would any organization broadcast for a non-affiliate anyway? How is USA Network different than any other US cable channel? Don't avoid answering the question directly anymore, why do you believe MLG and their top three teams are non-notable?</p>
