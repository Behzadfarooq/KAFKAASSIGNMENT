<p>Owlim is a high-performance semantic repository with support for <a href="../../../o/w/l/OWL_c2b9.html" title="OWL">OWL</a> reasoning and rule extensions. OWLIM uses the TRREE engine for forward-chaining of entailment rules. The reasoning framework is analogous to the R-entailment, which is an extension of the D-entailment, defining the standard RDF(S) semantics. OWLIM is a specific configuration for the Sesame RDF database and counts on it for various sorts of features and infrastructure, including, but not limited to, an extensive set of RDF and query language parsers. Since Sesame is one of the most mature and popular semantic repositories, this allows for very easy adoption of OWLIM. OWLIM v.2.8.3 is packaged as a Storage and Inference Layer (SAIL) for Sesame (v.1.2.2-1.2.4) named OWLIMSchemaRepository; it implements the RdfSchemaRepository interface. OWLIM is an open-source <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_%28programming_language%29.html" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a> library available under LGPL license. In OWLIM, reasoning and query evaluation are performed in-memory by the TRREE engine. At the same time OWLIM implements a robust persistency and backup strategy. The efficiency of TRREE allows OWLIM to manage millions of explicit statements even on desktop hardware. The upload and query evaluation are fast even for huge ontologies and knowledge bases, as demonstrated through a number of benchmarks. The major limitation of OWLIM is the relatively slow delete operation. The easiest way to use OWLIM is in the so-called embedded mode, i.e. as a <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_%28programming_language%29.html" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a> library. The distribution of OWLIM contains a RMI factory (CustomFactory) that provides RMI access to the SAIL layer of the repository.</p>

After that, they launched their first album "Blunt Force Trauma" in 2005 via Madness Music.</p>

<p>Saltby</p>
<p>Moving back above the Belvoir escarpment, about five miles south east of Harby lies the village of Saltby. The first recorded name Saltebi in 1086 moved through Saultebi in 1200 to the present Saltby first recorded in 1345. Again there is a degree of ambiguity in this name. Cox suggests that it could derive from the Old Norse personal name Salt, or from the Old English Salt that has the same meaning as it does in Modern English. It could also stem from the Old Norse Saltr meaning salty. In considering the meaning of this name it is important to take into consideration the fact that in the area there are several mineral springs and there are salt deposits in the rock bed underlying this area. Cox tells that there is a stream known as Saltbeck that drains from the Saltby area that has been found to contain mineral and salt deposits. There is also a major Chalybeate (medicinal containing beneficial salts and minerals) spring in Saltby. All of this evidence tends to suggest that the idea of the name deriving from the Old Norse personal name Salt is unlikely. It seems much more probable that the name is a compound of the Old English Salt and the Norse affix By, or the Norse Saltr and By, both of which give the meaning to the name ‘the farmstead at the salty spring’. Cox also suggests that it may have been the case that salt was produced in evaporation ponds in the village, and this activity could have given the name to Saltby, he does however point out that there is no conclusive evidence of this. Whatever the case, the name suggests that the salt deposits and springs at Saltby were an important aspect of the village and can probably be considered the reason that it came into existence and was called Saltby.</p>

<p>An "up-or-down vote" refers to the act of directly voting on an amendment or bill in Congress. This is opposed to tabling, recomitting, etc... which would be other ways of dealing with the bill. The "up-or-down vote" is prefered because it results in a quick and easy decision. This is also sometimes refered to a "clean vote"</p>

<p>Northvia, an instrumental post rock band, formed in the fall of 2002 when Thomas Lloyd (Guitar) and Rob Colclasure (Drums) met in Tallahassee, Fl. Soon after Rick Arnow (Bass) and John Garner (Guitar) joined the group when they first performed in February of 2002. After recording two EP's in Hattiesburg, MS (S/T, Your Detached and Self Obsessed) in 2003 and 2004, Rick Arnow left the band and was replaced by Rob’s brother William Colclasure (Bass). Citing influences ranging from Radiohead to Samuel Barber, Northvia has developed their own niche in the post-rock genre. In 2005 they recorded their first full length album Sleeping in Ariports which has yet to have been released.</p>

<p>The Medicaid disproportionate share program (DSH) was created in the early 1980s to provide payments to hospitals to help cover the costs of uncompensated care. Though various local, state and federal programs also provide hospitals with payments to cover uncompensated care, the Medicaid program is the largest subsidy program that issues these types of payments. In 1998, more than $15 billion in Medicaid DSH payments were issued to hospitals.</p>
<p>The purpose behind the DSH program was to provide hospitals with enough compensation to offset the hospitals costs for serving the uninsured and low-income populations. In this way, the program seeks to continue to encourage hospitals to provide health services for these individuals.</p>

<p>The beautiful traditional village of Prodromi is located at 35 degrees 15 minutes North and 23 degrees 45 minutes East at 1757 feet in the municipality of Pelekanou - Paleochoras of Chania Crete (coordinates are taken from Google earth).</p>
<p>The name of the village in 18th century was "Peroudo Vrisi". The current name is from the church of Agios Ioannis Prodromos It is a nice community unspoiled from tourist exploitation surrounded by natural mountain view beauty of Cretan earth.</p>
<p>The area is covered with picturesque hills and beyond them steep mountain-sides in a magnificent landscape. There are protected considerable archaelogical places like the area of Lissos which is a magnificent location that hosts a Temple devoted to Asklipio (god of medicine) and a natural spring with curing water, a Roman grave yard and one of the first Byzantine Churches in the province of Selino at Chania. Yrtakina is an ancient city from the prehistoric period with a castle made by Giant Rocks.</p>
<p>Main production is based on Olive Oil, Splendid wine from dry rocky fertile ground, and diary products from naturally grown goats and sheep.</p>
<p>Main church is Agios Charalambos located near the nice neighbourhood of “Halliliana”. At the name day the friently local population organizes a big celebration</p>
<p>The village had no modern road till recently and till today can be reached with a narrow modern asphalt covered road only from one side leading to the near by city of Paleochora. The north approach to the village requires a 4X4 ofF road car or any other durable car. This has protected the area, which kept its calm and unspoiled environment.</p>

<p>The Matrimonial Causes Act is the legislation governing matrimonial matters and the financial consequences thereof. It sets out the one ground for divorce, that being that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. To prove this, one may rely on of the five facts below; usually one will suffice but, in rare circumstances, one or more facts may be used. These are:</p>
<p>(i) unreasonable behaviour on the part of the other spouse; (ii) two years' separation with the other party's consent; (iii) adultery; (iv) five years' separation, without consent; (v) or desertion.</p>
<p>One would generally petition for divorce, by completing the standard divorce petition form. The person who completes the divorce petition is known as the 'petitioner'. This is then sent to the court who, after sealing it (stamping it), will send a copy to the respondent (spouse not petitioning for divorce). The respondent will, in theory, then read the divorce petition and complete the accompanying 'acknowledgement of service' form. Once this is received by the court, the petitioner must then complete an affidavit in support of their petition, confirming the facts of the petition to be true. The facts, based on the paper evidence, are then considered by a judge who decides whether the fact relied upon has been proved. If this be the case, the judge will give a date for pronouncement of decree nisi, the provisional decree of divorce. Six weeks and a day after, upon application from the petitioner, the court will grant decree absolute, the final decree of divorce, formally ending the parties' marriage. This will also affect any inheritance under a will.</p>
<p>Although perhaps sounding complex, divorce proceedings are very straightforward these days. Divorces are rarely contested in themselves and, in most cases, it is not even necessary to attend court; everything is dealt with on paper.</p>
<p>Financial aspects of the marriage are somewhat more complex however. These do require court attendances and solicitors' costs can increase dramatically. This area of the law is far more complex and will not be set out here. However, the key factors the court will consider and give credit for when attempting to divide the matrimonial assets in a fair way will be, as set out in section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973:</p>
<p>(a) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources that each of the parties has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future; (b) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future; (c) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage; (d) the age of each party and the duration of the marriage; (e) any physical or mental disability of either party; (f) the contributions which each of the parties has made or is likely in the foreseeable future to make to the home; (g) the conduct of each of the parties, but only if it would be inequitable to disregard it.</p>

<p>The village of Hutton, in the county of Somerset, is four miles from Weston-super-Mare and the Bristol Channel. It is bordered to the north by the Hutton moors and to the south by pastures and woodland which are part of the Western seaboard of the Mendip hills. These woods and fields are part of the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (the AONB). The settlement was recorded in the Doomsday Book of 1086, and the earliest known buildings are the 13th century church and the adjacent manor house of Hutton Court, the first written reference to which was in the early 14th century.</p>

<p>What is Sequence Annotation? When an organism is first sequenced – so that we know its entire DNA string, our knowledge about the genetics of that organism (number of genes, what they do, what organisms it is related to and how related, etc etc) is initially ZERO. Sequence annotation means identifying (usually tentatively) what is actually contained in a genome sequence; I.e marking certain bits as genes, certain bits as binding sites, etc…</p>
<p>Why Sequence Annotation? This is one of the main areas in which bioinformatics is at the forefront – the reason for sequencing an organism is so that we can learn a lot more about that organism; annotation is the first (and major) step.</p>
<p>How Sequence Annotation? Various ways, all of which (obviously, if you think about it) use a computational technique (ranging from straightforward to sophisticated AI) to predict a categoiy or function from a DNA pattern.</p>

<p><b>Jwhwlao Daimalu</b> is considered as a hero of the ancient golden period of the Bodos.Today,he is remembered as the cause of <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodo_people.html" title="Bodo people">Bodo people</a>'s tragedy because it is believed the he had cursed the Bodos for the deeds of some people who betrayed him.A statue of Jwhwlao Daimalu carrying his bow and arrows can be seen pointing his hand to the sky near the national highway of India in the Kharigao village of <a href="../../../k/o/k/Kokrajhar.html" title="Kokrajhar">Kokrajhar</a> District</p>

<p>Jwhwlao Daimalu was a senior official during the reign of King Iragdao.It is said that brave Daimalu along with his troops had defeated the King of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burma</a> and had brought white elephants as a token of victory.</p>

<p>It is believed that Lord Shiva had appeared in Daimalu's dream.Lord <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">shiva</a> had asked Jwhwlao for his needs for super natural powers.Given any of five fingers of the Lord to choose from Jwhwlao grabbed all of the fingers of Lord Shiva.The consequence of this is that jwhwlao got all the powers in the five fingers but then Lord Shiva cursed him that he was so greedy to be betrayed by his own blood. Daimalu had become very powerful as time passed by and by.The collegues of Daimalu were then becoming jealous of the bravery and power of daimalu;he could defeat two elephants at a moment.So the collegues somehow made the king to go against daimalu and thus Jwhwlao was put to prison.But no one could kill him because of the blessings of Lord Shiva.Then the officials brought Daimalu's step mother to meet Daimalu and they somehow managed to bring the step mother to their side.The step mother was able to find out that Daimalu can be killed only if they pour liquid metal into his ear.Thus the officials were able to kill Daimalu.But Daimalu,just before his death cursed that bodos will never prosper.</p>

<p>Written as a short story by Robert Heinline in the forties or early fifties, it tells of people who ask their computer "what the meaning of life is." No computer, no matter how smart they got, could answer the question and just said "insuficient data." This went on for thousands and thousands of years until the human race and all the galaxies had died out, BUT the computers had all merged and joined and were so big and powerful they occupied all of sub-space. This one giant computer had no more reason "to be" except for one, and that was to answer the age old question, "what is the meaning of life?" It thought about it for thousands more years and then one day made a decision and said "LET THERE BE LIGHT"</p>

<p>Function: The Circulatory System involves the transporting of cells and their waste products along with related chemicals throughout the body, and transports oxygen and nutrients to all cells, and removes their waste and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Organs Included: Cardiac muscle (heart), blood vessels (arteries and veins)</p>
<p>Process: The functioning of the circulatory system revolves around the heart.</p>
<p>The heart acts as a double pump to move the oxygenated blood to throughout the body and deoxygenated blood back to the lungs. Oxygenated blood is carried away from the heart by the arteries, while deoxygenated blood, along with the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced as a by-product from the cellular respiration carried out by the cells is carried back by the veins. The circulatory system is also an important factor in transporting hormones, proteins, and other substances from the digestive system throughout the body.</p>
<p>The heart consists of four chambers. The left and right atrium and left and right ventricle. The blood enters the heart from the body deoxygenated from the superior and inferior vena cavas into the right atrium. When the atrium contracts, it sends the blood through a one way valve (tricuspid valve) into the right ventricle. The right ventricle then contracts, sending the blood through the Pulmonary valve to the lungs to be oxygenated. The blood then re-enters the heart into the left atrium, and then is pumped into the most powerful chamber, the left ventricle through the Mitral valve. The left ventricle pumps the blood through the Aortic valve and out through the aorta to all parts of the body.</p>
<p>Blood consists of two parts: the cells and the plasma. Plasma consists of water, metabolites, wastes, hormones, ions, and proteins. Oxygen is carried by the blood bound to molecules of iron in hemoglobin. The hemoglobin is carried in the red blood cells. The blood also contains white blood cells, which are part of the immune system. The final important part of the blood are the platelets. The platelets are coiled protein fibers that are released into long, narrow fibers by a chemical signal released into the blood by damaged cells. The fibers become caught at the damage site and begin to form a clot. The resulting clot is the scab you see after a cut or scrape.</p>

<p>Stephen E. Karopczyc is a posthumous recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War. His Medal of Honor Citation follows:</p>
<p>KAROPCZYC, STEPHEN EDWARD</p>
<p>Rank and organization: First Lieutenant, U.S. Army, Company A, 2d Battalion, 35th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division. Place and date: Kontum Province, Republic of Vietnam, 12 March 1967. Entered service at: Bethpage, N.Y. Born: 5 March 1944, New York, N.Y. Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. While leading the 3d Platoon, Company A, on a flanking maneuver against a superior enemy force, 1st Lt. Karopczyc observed that his lead element was engaged with a small enemy unit along his route. Aware of the importance of quickly pushing through to the main enemy force in order to provide relief for a hard-pressed friendly platoon, he dashed through the intense enemy fire into the open and hurled colored smoke grenades to designate the foe for attack by helicopter gunships. He moved among his men to embolden their advance, and he guided their attack by marking enemy locations with bursts of fire from his own weapon. His forceful leadership quickened the advance, forced the enemy to retreat, and allowed his unit to close with the main hostile force. Continuing the deployment of his platoon, he constantly exposed himself as he ran from man to man to give encouragement and to direct their efforts. A shot from an enemy sniper struck him above the heart but he refused aid for this serious injury, plugging the bleeding wound with his finger until it could be properly dressed. As the enemy strength mounted, he ordered his men to organize a defensive position in and around some abandoned bunkers where he conducted a defense against the increasingly strong enemy attacks. After several hours, a North Vietnamese soldier hurled a hand grenade to within a few feet of 1st Lt. Karopczyc and 2 other wounded men. Although his position protected him, he leaped up to cover the deadly grenade with a steel helmet. It exploded to drive fragments into 1st Lt. Karopczyc's legs, but his action prevented further injury to the 2 wounded men. Severely weakened by his multiple wounds, he continued to direct the actions of his men until he succumbed 2 hours later. 1st Lt. Karopczyc's heroic leadership, unyielding perseverance, and selfless devotion to his men were directly responsible for the successful and spirited action of his platoon throughout the battle and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army.</p>

<p>The Bratland antenna was three wires connected by one anchor point on one side of the fiord and three anchor points on the other side. The salinity of the fiord was so constant year round, that the fiord water itself became an excellent ground plane for the transmitter. The helipad was four feet above the peak of the mountain, and had a small sign saying, "This is the world's smallest airport". The span was ~1.25-1.5 miles across.</p>

<p>The replacement ratio refers to size of unemployment benefit paid with repsect to goin wage rate in employment.</p>
<p>The higher the replacement ratio, i.e the higher the benefit paid to the unemployment, the higher the rate of unemployment will be as it less costly for an individual to continue seeking a better job and accept a job at the lowest wage rate. It affects the willingness of an individual to work and how vigourously they persue a job.</p>
