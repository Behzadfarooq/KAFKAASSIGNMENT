A Circuit Court, in Virginia, has appellate jurisdiction over General District Court and Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, and also hears all felony cases for the county. It is also a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_record.html" title="Court of record">court of record</a> that sets legal precedents. A circuit court judge is probably at least as notable as a state delegate or senator. Jeff Parker is in fact the ONLY circuit court judge who sits in <a href="../../../f/a/u/Fauquier_County%2C_Virginia_8305.html" title="Fauquier County, Virginia">Fauquier County, Virginia</a>. I cast this vote, by the way, with knowledge that votes from non-logged-in accounts may carry less weight than those logged-in accounts. As for sockpuppetry allegations related to Tparker393, I refer readers to <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Formal_statement_of_User:205.217.105.2_.2F_User:24.54.208.177" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents#Formal_statement_of_User:205.217.105.2_.2F_User:24.54.208.177</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The position of Circuit Court Judge is notable and this article does not deserve to be deleted. Parker is a former law partner of current U.S. Senator George Allen.

<li>It appears that Parker is a state trial court judge, a position which is at a relatively low level in the judicial hierarchy, as judges go in the U.S. A state trial court judge <i>could</i> be notable but there is no guarantee of that. For example, Wikipedia has an article about <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Ito_cf8e.html" title="Lance Ito">Lance Ito</a>, but I don't think it has, or needs, articles about all the judges whose chambers are in the same courthouse as Ito's. Also, being a former law partner of a senator and presidential candidate is not inherently notable; Wikipedia has articles about <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webster_Hubbell_f2e2.html" title="Webster Hubbell">Webster Hubbell</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Foster_7429.html" title="Vince Foster">Vince Foster</a> but not <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_9905.html" title="Hillary Rodham Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>'s other former law partners.

<li><b>Comment</b> This message is for Jerzy and those who are connected with him in this ignoble effort to delete an article that doesn't warrant such action. Yeah, you're right- he is my father, and I'm proud of him. He has accomplished more than someone who just sits behind his computer all day trying to incite arguments. Also, I'm not a sockpuppet, I didn't even know what that was until this morning. I often forget to login before making comments but I have nothing to hide and could care less about 'stuffing a ballot box'. Sorry if i caused any confusion. But your reckless bullying tactics that have spurred this article's vfd are nothing short of despicable.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sufficiently familiar with the structure of the nooks and crannies of the U.S. court system to evaluate whether a Virginia Circuit Court judge is sufficiently notable for an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not every judge is notable--there are tens of thousands of people who have served as a judge in the U.S. in one capacity or another. Has this judge worked on even <i>one</i> high-profile, notable case? No, there is no evidence given of that. True, he was college roommates with someone who now holds high public office, but the only way that would ever be notable would be if the judge owes his position to his friendship with the senator, which no one has so far suggested. The person who created the article has already admitted that the only reason he created it is because it's about his dad and he's proud of him. That's a nice sentiment, but it doesn't create notability. Furthermore, Tparker393's outbursts and violations of Wikipedia civility standards further damage his case through emotionalism, when he would be better off assembling and presenting independently verifiable <i>evidence</i> of his father's notability, if any indeed exists. --Stan 4.246.120.153 20:18, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to give an idea of proportion: The ratio of circuit court judges to citizens in <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairfax_County%2C_Virginia_71ab.html" title="Fairfax County, Virginia">Fairfax County, Virginia</a> is one judge for 55,000 people. A similar ratio is found in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_William_County%2C_Virginia_2940.html" title="Prince William County, Virginia">Prince William County, Virginia</a> – 5 circuit court judges for 280,000 people, or 1:56,000. Extrapolating that to a nationwide population of 300 million, that would be about 5,400 judges of comparable notability. So, Stan is right that there have been tens of thousands of judges of comparable notability in the entire history of the U.S. However, it is worth considering that the U.S. population was only 150 million as late as <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>, and was only 76 million on <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>. See <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/urpop0090.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/urpop0090.txt" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. So, it may not be in the high tens of thousands. And, I am not sure that anyone is contemplating writing an article about all of them. I think this is a borderline case as the article stands now. Perhaps more facts to establish notability will emerge. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 01:32, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>LOL. Yes, by all means, let's get a grip on a sense of proportion here. According to the Fairfox County website <a href="http://www.co.fairfax.va.us/police/animal.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.co.fairfax.va.us/police/animal.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, there is one <b>dog catcher</b> per every 41,304 county residents (950,000 divided by 23). Who wants to volunteer to write a Wikipedia article for each one of those dog catchers, mmmm? That's 23 "animal control officers" for us to research. Let's track down all of their sons and invite them to write articles about their dads or moms. Bear in mind that the animal control field requires years of study and preparation, that the officers' kids are very proud of them, and that at least some of those dog catchers must have once been friends with somebody more important than they are, perhaps even a U.S. Senator. --Stan 4.246.120.153 03:33, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The dog catcher analogy is poor, unless your dogcatcher authors legal opinions that are used as binding precedent to clarify and define laws and policies that you live under. My dogcatcher does no such thing, so he's not nearly as notable. How many similar articles might be written is conjecture, and conjecture is poor criteria for deciding the merit of any individual article. Compare and contrast this to all the minor candidates from obscure political parties for Congress/Parliament and Executive positions that have articles here: it seems that to run for a Legislative or Executive office and fail is more notable than to actually hold office in the Judiciary. If before I saw this VfD, I were seeking an unbiased view of the Circuit Court judges in my jurisdiction, I would have checked the official government page first, but Wikipedia for a second, NPOV opinion. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused">Unfocused</a> 03:39, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Au contraire, the dog-catcher analogy is entirely apt. If a judge is notable because he serves 55,000 people within a certain county, then a dog catcher who serves a population of 43,000 within that same county is within the same range of notability. Furthermore, judges are liable to have their decisions overturned by higher authority. Almost always, the dog catcher has the final word. Whether we are judging judges or judging dog catchers, we must ascertain whether the individual is notable <i>within his field</i>. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpo_Marx_34e0.html" title="Harpo Marx">Harpo Marx</a>, for instance, will always be more notable for <i>playing</i> a dog catcher in <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck_Soup_1582.html" title="Duck Soup">Duck Soup</a> than Jeffrey W. Parker has ever been notable as a judge in real life. One must come to <i>understand</i> the essentials of notability. The Judge Parker who was the 1904 Democratic nominee for President is notable because, like Harpo playing a dog catcher, he was playing a notable role on a wide stage. According to what has been presented so far, the Judge Parker under discussion here (Jeffrey W. of Fairfax Co. VA) is very important in one small room in Virginia, but has done nothing that makes him especially notable among the 10,000+ people in US history who have been judges. Judge Parker needs to do something <b>big</b>, and he has only a few hours left to do it in. A high-profile case. The solution to the world's biggest crossword puzzle. A cameo on the Howard Stern Show. Something. And fast. C.W.MerchantC W Merchant 20:03, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hey Stan, no one asked you to research anything or write an article about it. Are you trying to mock the situation? I didn't write this article genius, did you see that or are you too busy trying to sound intelligent? Having an opinion is one thing but don't be a jerk- I'm certain that judges on any level go through more schooling and make more critical decisions than dog catchers. Geez, what an idiotic suggestion. 'Friends' with a U.S. Senator? Try former business partners. <a href="../../../t/p/a/User%7ETparker393_3f6f.html" title="User:Tparker393">Tparker393</a> 15:43, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>, vanity, no evidence of independent notability beyond his office. I would change this vote if evidence of individual notability is provided. I agree with Stan, above, on all points. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:40, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since I voted, descriptions of two court cases heard by this judge have been added to the article. Both cases were similar to ones heard by almost every state judge at almost every level. I saw no indication that their consequences or any surrounding controversy rose to nationwide or industry-wide significance. <b>No change of vote</b>, but thanks to that editor for trying to establish fact-based notability instead of repeating stuff about being proud of Dad or insulting VfD voters. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:33, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, even all of the US federal Circuit Court judges are not notable, unless they become involved in high profile cases. We certainly don't need articles on every state judge, unless, he, too, is involved in notable cases. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 21:10, May 10, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ok, that's just empirically wrong. All U.S. Circuit Court judges <i>are</i> inherently notable (except maybe those who have only served for a year or two). Takes a lot to get to that position - you have to be appointed by the President and approved by the Senate (and there's a lot more wrangling over these appointments than there is over regular District Court judges); and <i>all</i> U.S. Circuit Court judges are involved in at least some notable cases. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: darkgreen" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD</font><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">Abram</font><font style="background: darkgreen" color="#FFC000">son</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">thi</font><font color="red"><b>m</b></font><font color="DarkGreen">k</font></sup></a> 01:49, 2005 May 11 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I commented above, but didn't vote yet (although I disagree with <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> on "any judge overseeing death sentences", as this would include brand new judges who had never done anything, but merely had the <i>power</i> to impose such a penalty, while not offering the same automatic inclusion to longstanding judges in states that had no such penalty.
