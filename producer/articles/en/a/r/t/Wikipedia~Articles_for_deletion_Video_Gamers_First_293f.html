<li>As the owner of VGF, I will remain neutral (I'm assuming this is allowed). I was considering voting delete to blend in, but I'll resist that temptation for the time being. I'm not voting keep because keep votes apparently aren't particularly welcome in this discussion (looks like at least one was deleted and one was blasted for being the same as two delete votes, which nobody mentioned), and I don't particularly care whether this article remains or not anyway. If I did care, I'd PM our 50 most active forum members and have them descend on this topic. It's pretty apparent where this vote is headed, since most of the people who have voted thus far appear to be either new to the Internet or just don't know that much about video game sites. That said, I have a few comments about the site (I'll try to be brief... apologies if this is too long).</li>
</ul>
<p>VGF has a fairly long (8 year) history. It started out as a single site that was updated on an excessively frequent basis, at least twice daily every single day (all original content). The community, which remains a strong focus to this day, was a large part of that. In a short time, it was built up to a very respectable stature in the video game site genre. As it became more popular, it evolved into a network. This was very successful, and VGF soon became one of the top video game networks in the world, reaching 25 million monthly page views at its height and owning several of well known sites. This allowed it to partner with all the major ad networks while I personally became among the most prominent voices in the online advertising community as one of the most respected members of Geekvillage and Gethighforums, as well as a writer for Adbility. Granted, this was only 1/4th of IGN's numbers at the time (though certainly respectable by any standards and on par with others like GX - Gamers.com, FGN, and Gamefan), but we didn't have $1 billion (with a b) to flush down to the toilet either. To the contrary, I was dirt poor when I started the site.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a couple years ago as the bubble was fully bursting, without the financial backing the major corporations had (and even they all either collapsed or had to be bought out to survive), it became necessary to make cutbacks, including deliberately killing off traffic. As a result, I'll acknowledge that VGF is not nearly as large as it once was or could have been. Still, it's unfair to claim it's unknown. Also, since we update on a regular basis and have an active community, I fail to see how it's just an advertisemnt. And it's just silly to claim that nothing links to VGF, even though the number of links is perhaps not particularly large. Regardless, what I would like to stress is this... If you want to visit the site, you're welcome to. If you don't want to visit it, who cares? But at least try doing more than 30 seconds of research based on clicking one link, visiting Alexa (inaccurate spyware that at one time ranked itself #3), or getting one unobtrusive popup here or there (oh no, it's the end of the world!) before bashing it.

<li>I find it funny that your first line reads "As the owner of VGF, I will remain neutral", yet your article (which is much bigger than the VFD'd article) is completely in the direction of keeping the article. It's good that you didn't have your forumgoers descend on this topic, because then it wouldn't make a difference. (sockpuppetry) As for the keep votes, one was made with no reason to back it up, and the other was deleted because along the way, the voter vandalised other votes (read the history of this VFD, please). I doubt those three paragraphs save the article from below the notability bar, but it was a good try. <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENestea_bc8a.html" title="User:Nestea">Nestea</a> 01:34, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd just like to say that a part of this site's network already has an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/e/g/Neglected_Mario_Characters_3f59.html" title="Neglected Mario Characters">Neglected Mario Characters</a> is part of a hosted site on this network. As for the advertisment claim, I don't work for the network and wouldn't benefit from it in any way. <a href="../../../z/e/i/User%7EZeipher17_10bf.html" title="User:Zeipher17">Zeipher17</a> 20:23, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
