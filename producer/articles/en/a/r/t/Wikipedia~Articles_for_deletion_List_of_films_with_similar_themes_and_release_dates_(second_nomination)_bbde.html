<p><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_films_with_similar_plots_b323.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of films with similar plots">Here</a> is the first nomination. This article consists pretty much of subjective comparisons of movies. There are exactly zero citations, and two shakey (at best) links at the bottom- a "discussion" and a "blog discussion." Obviously some movies will bear a striking resemblance to each other via ripoffs and such, but how do we draw the line? Are they similar because of genres? Actors? Plots? How do we define "similar release dates"? What critics and sources would we consider notable or numerous enough for movies to be "similar". This list is just too vague abd subjective. I think this fails <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a>. <a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:37, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> I've read about this in Entertainment Weekly, but don't have that article anymore, and from what I see here (and looking at random revisions in the edit history), this is completely unsourced, and both links are blogs. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 03:46, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seems like we're having a hard time coming up with an apt title for this article, and yes it is open to subjectivity, but I find the article very interesting and valuable for anybody interested in the film studio system. It's not as if it's a list of movies that make you feel good or something subjective by nature; it's a list of movies that seem to be made just to compete with another. Additions need to be moderated or the text should be changed so people better understand the purpose, though (having Master &amp; Commander and Pirates of the Caribbean listed together is just silly) -<a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel</a> 04:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My argument is that it's really not possible to create an objective list here. How many critics (or other important people) must mention that one movie is similar to another? How do we define "similar" release dates? I feel that the last question in particular would just end up being completely arbitrary. Would a movie like <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy_Story_6f9e.html" title="Toy Story">Toy Story</a> be considered similar to <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_Soldiers_e67a.html" title="Small Soldiers">Small Soldiers</a>? --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 04:28, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. To compare to movies on Wikipedia without an independent source discussing it first is the very definition of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>: An editor went out and saw (ie researched) both movies and made his/her own decision about their relatedness and then decided, "I want to feel smart and tell the world about my discovery on Wikipedia!" Unfortunately, that's not the way this place works. I'm surprised that it survived the first nomination with people basically saying "Keep, it's an interesting subject". <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 05:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Lots of these similarities have been noted in major media. I grabbed three bullet points from the 1990s and easily found New York Times and Toronto Star articles noting the similarities. I've added the references to the article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_films_with_similar_themes_and_release_dates&amp;diff=98116047&amp;oldid=98094462" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_films_with_similar_themes_and_release_dates&amp;diff=98116047&amp;oldid=98094462" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think this article would fail an <a href="../../../a/n/o/ANOVA_0b44.html" title="ANOVA">ANOVA</a> if you could run one. Miserably. Looks to me like within-group variance is at least as large as between group variance! In other words, it would be just as easy to match two films from <i>different</i> categories as they stand now as it is to agree with the match of the films IN the categories as they stand now. So I agree strongly with <b>original research</b> comments. Great point above on <i>"<a href="../../../f/l/u/Flushed_Away_e25d.html" title="Flushed Away">Flushed Away</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratatouille_%28film%29.html" title="Ratatouille (film)">Ratatouille (film)</a> being considered similar because the protagonists are rats? Nevermind that the actual themes are wildly different."</i> There are tons of examples throughout the page of this. <i>"Event Horizon (1997) and Sphere (1998), both involve an abandoned U.S. spaceship that contains a giant orb and members of the search or rescue crew who hallucinate their worst nightmares."</i> You could just as easily argue that <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_b021.html" title="Nightmare on Elm Street">Nightmare on Elm Street</a> should be on that list with the hallucinatory nightmares. While we're at it, I don't know about you, but those Aliens were pretty awful, and they were birthed as eggs (spheres) and Ripley <i>does</i> have nightmares... (*tongue in cheek*). If something like this is going to stay, I'd argue <i>strongly</i> that it should be stripped down to things that can be supported with citations(similar to the pruning comment earlier)...which, since there are currently no references, sounds like a fresh start might be a good idea. The list is also <b>haphazard</b>, so I don't think it meets Wikipedia's quality standards. Maybe these things would make more sense in the "Trivia" that appears at the bottom of some film entries.</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>, this is packed full of original research, and I agree that the relatedness may well be illusionary. A lot of the similarities seem to be related to the presence of stock characters common in a genre. Having said that, an encyclopedic treatment of this 'phenomenon' may be possible (but very difficult to do). This article is nowhere near, however.--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 13:01, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I just looked over this article again, and I think some contributers were confused as to its intention. Many films are/were listed just because they happened to have similar surface content (ie probably a coincidence), but the article should only be listing films that were made seemingly to compete with eachother (Deep Impact, Armageddon) or capitalize on a trend (Matrix, Thirteenth Floor, eXistense). Perhaps it should be retitled/repurposed (again), maybe to "List of films made to compete with eachother", which would be notable and would be much less subjective (and printed reviews could probably be used as sources). --<a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel</a> 02:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC) (Used the wrong signature code first time)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The idea has merit and I keep running into articles in the mainstream press that mention this phenomenon. Some of them contain suspiciously similar examples to this very list.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I still maintain this list is arbitrary and unmaintainable. We have a vague definition of "similar release dates" which would, at best, be arbitrarily decided by the community as some form of consensus-driven <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>- even then, we're still left with the whole principle of drawing a line somewhere- are movies considered similar release dates if they're in the same year? Two years? Five? How about ten? If we were to eliminate the date criteria, we'd simply be left with "lists of films with similar themes/plots/whatever", which could be indefinite and unmaintainable seeing as any critic could compare any two movies and declare them similar. This leaves out that there's a question of <i>how</i> similar two movies must be, whether through plot, actors, score, theme, etc. This whole article seems to hinge on an undefined concept of "similarity". I completely agree that it's a phenomenon noted in the press through common ripoffs and movies riding trends, but I don't think it can be made into an article because it's essentially a collection of "Hey, these two things are sort of alike according to so-and-so" --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:27, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I still maintain that this is a phenomenon that is widely reported on in the media. Have a look at this: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/13/AR2006101300339.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/13/AR2006101300339.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I think it would be easy to find consensus that a year would be an appropriate cutoff for this phenomenon, and that we should make it clear in the comments of this article that people should not add their own original research, but should only add verified, notable similar films with similar themes and similar release dates. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECas510_af82.html" title="User:Cas510">Cas510</a> 04:05, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm saying it would likely be easy to find consensus, if we tried. All of the copycat movie articles I've read, and all the typical examples (Bug'sLife/Antz, Capote/Infamous, TrumanShow/EdTV) are very close in release dates, usually under a year. Movies take about a year or less to make; for two movies that are very similar to come to fruition within a year is notable. I'm going to keep trying to improve this article during this AfD, adding references, removing OR, and trying to find consensus on the talk page about what the list definitively is for.

<p>This discussion is pretty much headed in the direction of no consensus. Since I (and many others) really dislike the article in its current state, I say we compromise:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rename and restructure</b> to List of trends in cinema, or something similar. This eliminates the criteria of "similar" themes and release dates. These trends will cover things like the current trend with penguins in movies, Bond ripoffs, etc. Of course, trends need to be cited (which is pretty easy to do in most cases). These trends are far more significant than "movie x looks like movie y" and they are noted for historical importance by many critics and film historians.</li>
<li><b>Provide some examples</b>. Trends obviously exist, so what we could do is have a small selection of, say, two or three films (cited, of course) which are the best examples of such trends. I think something like "This movie started the trend, this movie capitalize, and so did this one" or something like that.</li>

<dd>A good topic for an article, perhaps "Trends in Cinema" with an appended list. I'd suggest you do it regardless of the outcome here. Not the same as the list here tho, as this deals with <i>specific</i> pairs. <b>Re-examining</b> the list, I think its present state is quite respectable, with good annotations on all items. Meets the guidelines in WP:LIST, and the standards seem to be applied fairly rigorously. Very few red links.

<dd>Wikipedia always had the policy that when in doubt about an article, don't delete it. If the criteria are vague and there is no consensus if this article meets those criteria, there is doubt, so no deletion. The sourcing of the article has improved dramatically since it was nominated (from 0 to 36), and the few I checked indeed supported a link between the movies they were supposed to deal with. A better introduction to the article would be wanted though. Concerns about POV and "really disliking the article" are no reason for deletion. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<dd>Relax please, I was <i>asked</i> on my talk page to comment on this proposal. I do not <i>count</i> on anything, nor do I have affection for this particular article. My only concern with is was sourcing (as I already stated on the 3rd of January) and this has been largely solved. If an administrator decides to delete, then that is his call. The one "counting" on no consensus was Wafulz, who writes above "this discussion is pretty much headed in the direction of no consensus", and apparently disliking that potential outcome he states "I (and many others) really dislike the article" as an argument to plea for essentially removing this article and replacing it with List of trends in cinema, an article he has all the right in the world to write anyway (regardless of the outcome here). --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<dd>I think this idea has some potential and credibility if implemented properly as a history article and not particularly as a list. I think the similar theme and date issue could be covered within such an article without the issue of being an exhaustive subjective list. Examples noted by critics could be cited without the issue of original research that we have here. With that said I still object and vote delete regarding this article as an unmanageable subjective list containing original research.

<dd>I like the idea, in fact if there isn't an article about cinematic trends over the years there definitely should be. However, the thing I like about this article as-is is how it insinuates a level of subtrifuge on behalf of the movie studios. That many movies are made with the blatent intention of taking the audience from--, hoping to be confused with--, or attempting to be compared to-- another movie. This seems to be a separate (more conscious) movement from a trend.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose the problem with that is that there's no clear way to source whether a movie was in fact just conforming to a trend or trying to mimic another movie. In fact, if you asked anybody point-blank if their movie (say, AntZ) was meant to copycat or compete with another movie (say, A Bug's Life) they would probably say no, even if they had. I guess that makes it impossible to make the distinction between trendiness and a knockoff, so a list of cinema trends would be a fine compromise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only question would then be, do we format it the same as the current article by date and list "2000s': Penguin Movie trend: <i>Happy Feet</i> and <i>Surf Penguin Or Whatever It's Called</i>" etc, or do we sort it by trend. "Penguin Movie Trend: <i>Happy Feet</i> and <i>The Other One</i> (CGI Penguin movies) seemed to follow the popularity of the award winning <i>March of The Penguins</i>."</dd>

<li><b>Support proposal but still delete the article</b>, I rather like Wafulz's proposal here. My main concern (after the OR and verifiability bit) was the <b>notability</b> of these comparisions, especially in light of the plethora of sources. Sure, someone decided to compare two movies in some reliable source, but is the comparison notable? I can't imagine every single one listed could be notable enough to include on Wikipedia. With Wafulz's proposal, some criterion for inclusion seems inherent in that the movie must have started a trend, rather than simply an isolated and possibly coincidental similarity. In this way, the article becomes much less indiscriminate than the current article as well. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 22:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose proposal, but let's work on this some more</b>. Wafulz's suggestion is a good start, but let's keep talking before we put anything to a vote. These are not "trends in cinema", which is pretty vague (CGI is a trend. Jump cuts are a trend. Science fiction was a trend in the late 1970s, and adventure in the early 1980s. Film noir was a trend, if not a movement). What we're talking about is the fact that studios often go head-to-head (or close to it) with two, or occasionally more, similar films. I agree that the reason for why this is so is often unclear, from great-minds-thinking-alike to copycatting to coincidence; and I also agree there's no reason for us to decide why this was, either. But "trend" is just too unclear for me. I still think a variation on the present title would be a little more apt, i.e., List of films with similar topics released within a short time of each other. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions"><span style="color:#800">Pro<span style="color:#a00">hib<span style="color:#b00">it<b><span style="color:#c00">O</span>ni</b></span><b>o</b></span><b>ns</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProhibitOnions_b4f5.html" title="User talk:ProhibitOnions"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 22:43, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Yes and no</b>. One argument <i>for</i> deletion mentioned by many above is the vaguely defined scope of the current list. A list of trends in films, while perhaps not a bad topic for an article per se, would be even more vague, and would almost certainly have to exclude items on the current list. The fact that "Turner &amp; Hooch (1989) and K-9 (1989) are both movies where a police officer gets a dog for a partner" is not notable as a <i>trend</i> on its own, but is probably notable as an <i>example</i> of the <i>specific trend</i> of films with similar themes and release dates. I don't see a reason why Wikipedia shouldn't include this information (yes, I realize that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>). On the other hand, a list of trends in films would be able to focus on the larger picture, which is obviously also important. For instance, inclusion of Flushed Away and Ratatouille on the current list may not be justified, just because they are computer animated films from 2006/07 with rat protagonists. However, a list of trends could accomodate the fact that DreamWorks and Disney have their own "trend" of releasing films with similarities (Antz/A Bug's Life, Shark Tale/Finding Nemo, Madagascar/The Wild, Flushed Away/Ratatouille). — <a href="../../../k/w/i/User%7EKwi_d01c.html" title="User:Kwi">Kwi</a> | <a href="../../../k/w/i/User_talk%7EKwi_0378.html" title="User talk:Kwi">Talk</a> 23:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> With respect to film, this is as important an article as any. To be honest, I'm surprised that it hasn't been addressed before now. I agree with ProhibitOnions (and others) that what you're proposing is not about trends in cinema per se. However, I disagree with his/her suggested name change. A better title would be "competitive implementations of thematic devices in cinema," or something to that effect. Also, when you limit it to similar films that were released a short time apart from one another (i.e., The Time Machine / The Butterfly Effect), you are effectively ignoring longstanding patterns of competitive pseudo-plagiarism. An angle worth exploring would be studios' years-long infatuation with releasing cookie-cutter blockbusters: alien movies, disaster flicks, superhero films, mobster films, spy films, neo-noir, the whole gamut. This phenomenon has as much relevance to the matter at hand as any two similar films released in practical simultaneity, and in fact would serve to establish a broader framework for a more thorough investigation.

The solution for a topic worthy of an article with problems is improvement, not deletion.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 23:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I believe what Nick is trying to say is that <i>this</i> article is inappropriate, but a different incarnation of it with better, more encyclopedic criteria would be good. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 02:53, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think this list works fine, but within the context of a more complete article. I suggest it be kept and improved. It needs a larger introductory statement, with referecnes relating to the practice of "borrowing" ideas over the history of cinema. Begin with genres of film that obviously mimic or were inspired by another. Spaghetti westerns and samurai films, for instance, or Brian DePalma's Hitchcock infatuation early in his career, both of which are well-documented. One doesn't need to be a film historian to see that this kind of thing has gone on for a very long time. A lot of these references are solid, and it'd be a shame to let the research go to waste. The appropriate call is to enhance the article with more history, and to pinpoint objective relationships between sets of films. If the release dates of two films were very close together, one could easily reason that a studio got word of another's idea, but it is important to be able to substantiate the claim with either hard evidence, the opinions of several journalists, film critics, or industry insiders, or an overwhelming public belief in the existence of such a connection. Look up pre-production dates and cite IMDB and other sources for things like scheduled release dates versus actual ones. If you could show that film X was rushed through production to compete with film Y, it wouldn't hurt. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevorPearce_3e94.html" title="User:TrevorPearce">TrevorPearce</a> 06:57, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
