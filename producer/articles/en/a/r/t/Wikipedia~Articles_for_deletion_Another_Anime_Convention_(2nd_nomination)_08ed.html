<dd>For one, my reference towards preserving information was to a Wikipedia Policy, while you mention only an Essay!

<dd><b>Comment</b> The "preserve information" bit means that if <b>part</b> of an article is bad, the good parts should be kept.

<dd>That philosophy will only lead to cruft. We need to make editorial decisions as to what information is relevant and should be kept and what is simply trivial and unimportant.

<dd>Look closely at all the other Anime Convention links I provided (or randomly select a couple!) NONE of them have anything more than AnimeCons.com and the official website to claim notability. Are you telling me that these should all be deleted? Anime Conventions are rarely covered by news media, and they are a fairly new thing. Another Anime Convention has more references than OVER HALF of the articles in the anime conventions category. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 17:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, some cons are missing references, but those aren't being nominated for deletion because -- at least for most of them -- people feel that we <i>can</i> find some reliable sources if we actually sit down and look. (We have been slowly plugging through the con articles adding references, but it takes time.) If you want to nominate them for deletion, nobody's stopping you. ...but I really don't think an AfD on <a href="../../../a/n/i/AnimeNEXT_4005.html" title="AnimeNEXT">AnimeNEXT</a> (one of your examples) would get far considering it's the 10th largest con in the US and is fairly well known and has received a lot of press coverage. Also, <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a> is not a good argument to keep an article. This AfD is about Another Anime Convention, not some other articles. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 21:01, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"(We have been slowly plugging through the con articles adding references, but it takes time.)" Again, you missed my main point, and it isn't that other stuff exists, but it is that this article is more referenced than half the stuff that I mentioned! It hasn't got much coverage yet because its new, but it's still in pretty good shape. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 22:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Most of the references, however, are not from reliable sources. And the ones that are do are actually directory listings and do not confer notability to the convention. As for pointing out that other convention articles have sourcing problems of their own, you are comparing apples and oranges. Most of those articles have several reliable sources available, but they go cited in the articles. But as for AAC, such reliable sources don't exist to begin with outside of the directory/event listings, such as AnimeCons.com. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 15:49, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Patrick, I noticed you arguing that it would not be fair to "not list an event just because it hasn't happened yet". Wouldn't those conventions be even more non-notable?

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Much as I'd like to see this article cleaned up and preserved, I cannot agree to even a weak keep, for a number of reasons.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The Primary <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">Notability</a> Criterion states, "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject and of each other." The article in question fails the second half of that sentence. Anime-Cons.com is merely a repository of information from press releases and other data that comes directly from the Convention committees. As such, the information there is not independent from the subject.</li>
<li>The other references provided within the article do not satisfy "non-trivial" mentions. The Anime-Mania.net listing is a mere list of upcoming conventions, The AnimeNewsNetwork article is a copy of a press release which is not independent, and the oasismag.com article is a blog entry of one person's account of the convention, without any assertion of press credential.</li>
<li>The article does not contain any information that is not duplicated on the Convention's website, or on AnimeCons.com. What is the encyclopedic purpose of having an article on Wikipedia if it's just a mirror of other reference materials?</li>
<li>And on the subject of "Notability is not policy," <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">guidelines</a> can and more often than not do result in better articles than this one being deleted. In fact the only difference between a policy and a guideline is that the policy is less likely to have exceptions. You have not proven that this article needs an exception.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best solution that I see is to have the convention contact a number of local newspapers and television stations, give out a few press passes, have them write articles on the convention, and THEN and ONLY THEN, will you have the information to write an article on -- <span style="border:1px solid #63B8FF; font-weight:bold; color:#23238E; background-color:#D0E7FF;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">RoninBK</a> <sub><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERoninbk_7cd0.html" title="User talk:Roninbk">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roninbk_59dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roninbk">C</a></sub></span> 05:20, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the reason I would say that this article should be an exception is because it is the biggest anime convention in New Hampshire. That seems pretty notable. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 01:18, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>...but apparently it wasn't notable enough for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mikkakan_6cf7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mikkakan">Mikkakan</a>, NH's first anime con and the largest in New England until <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_Boston_cd7c.html" title="Anime Boston">Anime Boston</a> came along. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 03:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with this. If Notability is "generally permanent", then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mikkakan_6cf7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mikkakan">Mikkakan</a> will always have the distinction of being the first con in its state (New Hampshire), and the first New England con (as it claims) to have an invited industry guest, even if surpassed in attendance in the New England region by Anime Boston, and now by the convention which is the subject of this very article. The former reason was enough for keeping <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_No_Brand_Con_2b60.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/No Brand Con">No Brand Con</a>. I would like to repeat the idea of merging the old Mikkakan articles and this one if a deletion seems likely. ~ <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanOrange_39c0.html" title="User:SeanOrange">SeanOrange</a> 05:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Your sources are mostly blogs and/or trivial mentions in directories or listings.

Please read <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Self-published_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">the guidelines</a> on what kinds of sources are required.

<dd>Mike, I'm not sure which part of this discussion you are commenting about.

<dd>The like you provided (as shown in that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Another_Anime_Convention&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116031412" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Another_Anime_Convention&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116031412" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, may be from an independent source - however, it's definitely a trivial mention, as it's only a listing that the convention takes place, and likely taken directly from information provided by the convention itself. <a href="http://animecons.com/cgi-bin/events/search.cgi?pg=1&amp;kw=&amp;t=&amp;mo=&amp;yr=&amp;st=NH&amp;co=&amp;at=" class="external text" title="http://animecons.com/cgi-bin/events/search.cgi?pg=1&amp;kw=&amp;t=&amp;mo=&amp;yr=&amp;st=NH&amp;co=&amp;at=" rel="nofollow">The page you link to</a> does not make the claim, as you state, that the convention is the largest one in the state - it is merely a listing of conventions, and your assertion is your own opinion based on information found on that page, and therefore original research, which should not be used. In any event, both <a href="http://animecons.com/cgi-bin/events/search.cgi?pg=1&amp;kw=&amp;t=&amp;mo=&amp;yr=&amp;st=NH&amp;co=&amp;at=" class="external text" title="http://animecons.com/cgi-bin/events/search.cgi?pg=1&amp;kw=&amp;t=&amp;mo=&amp;yr=&amp;st=NH&amp;co=&amp;at=" rel="nofollow">this link</a> and <a href="http://animecons.com/events/info.shtml/1243" class="external text" title="http://animecons.com/events/info.shtml/1243" rel="nofollow">this link</a> from that page are definitely trivial mentions, and do not confer any notability or independent editorial opinion about the event in question. The claim on the convention's own website is puffery, and also should not be used without verification by legitimate sources. Either way, it's a non-issue, as I do not believ the article will survive this AfD - I've certainly not seen anything here to change my opinion. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 17:46, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't quite see where the two links from AnimeCons.com support the claim that it is the largest in NH. The first one is a search result, which is by nature a trivial mention. The second is the AnimeCons.com listing, which we've already established that while it may help prove some facts, it can't support subjective claims like "the largest in X."</dd>
<dd>The point is, you are trying to use primary sources, (i.e. the convention's own words,) to prove what the convention claims. By our policies, we need second-hand accounts from reliable sources.</dd>
<dd>Trust me when I say that I am not unsympathetic to what you are doing. But I really think that maybe you need to take a step back, and think about this. Do you maybe have a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest?</a> Trust me, if it was my favorite convention up for AfD, I'd be upset too.</dd>
<dd>Look, if this ends up getting deleted, why don't you copy the page to a user subpage, and keep it until you can find some news coverage to back it up, ok? -- <span style="border:1px solid #63B8FF; font-weight:bold; color:#23238E; background-color:#D0E7FF;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">RoninBK</a> <sub><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERoninbk_7cd0.html" title="User talk:Roninbk">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roninbk_59dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roninbk">C</a></sub></span> 05:54, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have never been to this convention, or even in the state of New Hampshire, for that matter. My favorite convention is <a href="../../../a/n/i/AnimeIowa_0779.html" title="AnimeIowa">AnimeIowa</a>. Furthermore, as for the references, these are the requirements to say that I have used original research:</dd>
<dd>* introduces a theory, method of solution, or any other original idea;
<dl>
<dd>It is not being introduced, as it has already been <a href="http://www.anotheranimecon.com" class="external text" title="http://www.anotheranimecon.com" rel="nofollow">claimed</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>* defines or introduces new terms (neologisms), or provides new definitions of existing terms;
<dl>
<dd>Irrelevant here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>* introduces an argument without citing a reliable source who has made that argument in relation to the topic of the article; or
<dl>
<dd>Sources have been cited. One to make the claim, two to back it up.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>* introduces an analysis, synthesis, or interpretation of published facts, opinions, or arguments without attributing that analysis, synthesis, or interpretation to a reliable source who has published the material in relation to the topic of the article.
<dl>
<dd>I didn't come up with the claim, <a href="http://www.anotheranimecon.com" class="external text" title="http://www.anotheranimecon.com" rel="nofollow">they did</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The two sources provided show that AAC's claim as the only/largest convention is true, by showing that it can not be so far proved false. Importantly, content must be verifiable, not necessarily verified. If I claimed that I was the only Computer Repair Company in the entire state of Iowa, and multiple phonebooks proved it, that would be good enough verification for wikipedia, right? <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 06:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I want to say 'keep' since it's notable as New Hampshire's (first?) only Anime con as far as I've been able to determine, but given the already-stated near-complete lack of supporting information about it from secondary sources. The only source I could find was <a href="http://trancelab.com/2006/10/lord-bass-rocks-another-anime.htm" class="external text" title="http://trancelab.com/2006/10/lord-bass-rocks-another-anime.htm" rel="nofollow">Trancelab.com</a>, but it says nothing about the convention other than it happened, and they took pictures. ~ <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanOrange_39c0.html" title="User:SeanOrange">SeanOrange</a> 06:05, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The first convention in New Hampshire was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mikkakan_6cf7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mikkakan">Mikkakan</a> in 2001. Mikkakan's wikipedia article was deleted last month. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 13:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's really bizarre, to delete an article for (what appeared to be) such a significant convention in the area. Such deletions make it difficult to independently verify this sort of information, especially given how fickle the internet can be as a resource for something that people are no longer talking about... Another Anime Convention is still the largest/only New Hampshire con at this moment in time, and it's still ongoing. If these events don't warrant their own individual entries, perhaps we should find a way to merge them into an article about New Hampshire anime conventions, instead of just deleting them? Making the explicit connection to Anime Boston (if sources can be found to support the claim) might also be of some value. ~ <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanOrange_39c0.html" title="User:SeanOrange">SeanOrange</a> 14:22, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
