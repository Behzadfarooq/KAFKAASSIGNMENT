<li>Looks like some vanity page for a mba student, <b>Delete</b>--<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">User:Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">comhrÃ</a> 02:40, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that this is nothing more than power-tripping by a user Boothy443 with nothing better to do than discuss the content of someones page. Would the page for "Jennifer Lopez" not also be considered a vanity page. But because you happen to feel the opinions of Hollywood adds validity to documenting the accomplishments and life of this woman that she deserves a page over a published author in an MBA program?

<p>This is an article about one of the civilian contractors who was kidnapped in Iraq and eventually beheaded. I am submitting this to VfD as a test case, since there are several such articles. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:51, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While the kidnappings and beheadings of contractors, reporters, etc, in Iraq are incidents that were certainly very notable, the individual contractors are not, and don't warrant encyclopedia articles, Wikipedia not being a memorial. In general, the articles are about the kidnapping/beheading incident not about the person. Accordingly, all of the articles about the individual beheading victims should be deleted, and either a section added to the appropriate article about the Iraq war describing these incidents, or else a new article created covering them. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:51, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree with BM above. But I don't think this information should get lost, I just don't think it should be on an article by itself. Having information about all the hostages in Iraq in one place would be much better. At first, the appropriate article for this seems to be <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-invasion_Iraq%2C_2003-2005_4f4c.html" title="Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2005">Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2005</a>. But that is already too big, so maybe a new article should be created for the hostages. I believe, though, that this will be frowned upon by most VfD voters, who will unfortunately vote "keep" on this one.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 04:05, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not proposing the information be removed, only that the information currently in multiple articles under the names of the victims, be restructured. The articles aren't really about the victims. In general, I think articles titled with a person's name should be a biographical article about that person. If the outcome of this VfD is Redirect or Merge, it is fine with me. I wish there was some system other than Redirect pages on Wikipedia to index a term or name. Encyclopedias have indexes. If someone is not notable enough to merit an article, but has figured in an important incident, we can have a redirect page titled with the person's name to the incident article . But, there might in fact be several articles mentioning the incident, and a redirect can only be to one other page. The set of redirect pages do not actually form an index, even though sometimes you see people (e.g. Jimbo) say that the redirect pages are like an index. To some extent, Google Advanced Search (where you can limit a search to just en.wikipedia.org) is a workaround, but we are then letting Google decide how Wikipedia should be indexed and the results ordered, and Google results will also include Talk pages, User pages, Wikipedia name space pages, etc. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:03, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Consolidating the information about the victims onto one page might be an agreeable optionânot for the ones about which there is a good deal written, but for some of themâbut you can try that without VfD. It is a reasonable enough point to make that these victims' whole lives are not necessarily encyclopedic, just their involvement in whatever events they are notable for. However, I still vote to keep because I think the organization of the information should be dealt with by the people who work on these articles as they think is appropriate. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:36, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That is true, and it occurred to me to just merge and redirect them myself without getting any sanction from VfD, since one does not have to have admin powers to do that. However, VfD is one of the few places where one can go to test the consensus on an issue like this, although it will tend to be muddied a bit by misplaced (in this case) deletionism versus inclusionism concerns. In contrast, the articles' editors are apt to think the articles should exist, so that doesn't seem like a good place to start. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:51, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>It would be less muddled if you would say upfront you are hoping for a merge, or would be content with one. The VfD tag says "A request has been made for this article to be deleted".</li>

<li>It is true that I have a strong tendency to vote for deletion of articles submitted here, and to submit articles from time to time myself. However, you will note that I don't vote delete on all articles. I generally don't throw in many "me too" keep votes, because usually when I would vote keep, the article doesn't need any help from me to be kept. For that matter, I frequently don't bother voting on the obvious "delete" cases, either, although I might if I have something to say. If I cared about being characterized as a "hard core deletionist", I could make plenty of honest "keep" votes to balance things out. However, actually I don't object much to the characterization. I'm not running for anything, and if there are people here who hate my guts because they think I'm a deletionist, that doesn't really bother me. Perhaps I will occasionally persuade someone with arguments, even though he might think I'm a deletionist. I do object to the implication that anybody characterized as "hard core deletionist" cannot possibly be participating in good faith. Suggesting so seems to be overstepping the bounds of civility. I hope that people who object to my perceived "deletionism" will observe Wikipedia strictures about civility, as I generally do, with the occasional lapse for which I apologize in advance. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a></li>

Others contain the URL to the beheadings via ogrish.com, where you can also watch young girls having sex with horses while you wait for the snuff movie to download. The information about all these victims should be consolidated into one article, written in an encyclopedic way, with some respect for the individuals, no videos, no death pics.

<p>Anyhow, Hey guys, think of conscious evolution as a very rough work in progress, with absolutely enormous potential like the rest of wikipedia&#160;;) Conscious evolution is the wave of the future, and the last stage of our human evolution, so please reconsider your vote to keep it rather than delete it! Think of it this way, each one of you is like a brain cell in the mind of the coming god consciousness and the internet is the network that connects all these brain cells together. With that knowledge you discover that wikipedia is the memory of gods brain and our communication its consciousness. So lets consider keeping it guys!!&#160;;)</p>
<p>Also where is jpgordons vote to delete? I am disappointed that he didn't vote delete within 1 hr of the topics creation. &lt;g&gt;</p>

The arrogance with which you assume that no-one but you has read the article, however, together with your insults to those who disagree with you, suggests that you're either a sock-puppet of Dnagit (or <i>vice versa</i>), or merely a <s>maggot-skinned</s> white-supremacist fellow traveller. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">ÎÎµÎ» ÎÏÎ·ÏÎ·Ï</font>)</a> 19:51, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>While my claim that no-one read it was poorly thought out, I still stand by my previous points. Although it is poorly written, I still beleive that the article should be kept because of the fact that "Conscious Evolution" has established its presence on the internet (do a Google-search), the article was far from a "personal essay" as someone claimed, in fact these ideas have been put out in one form or another by various thinkers over time, and I see no white-supremacist propaganda on the page. My comment that no-one read it seems to become more valid the more you read this page. Someone compared the page to <a href="../../../z/y/k/Zyklon_B_44ff.html" title="Zyklon B">Zyklon B</a>...Ummm, excuse me?? are we reading the same page here?? It seems like many of the voters on this page are coming here, quickly seeing accusations of white supremacy by others and voting Delete without actually taking in the article. Your accusation that I am either DNAGod's sock puppet or a White Supermacist is: 1. A cheap attempt to slander me and therefore make any comment I have made on here invalid 2. Patently invalid because: A. A quick look at the edit histories by me and DNAGod or even a look at our User pages shows that we are not related in anyway, in fact if DNAGod is actually a White Supremacist like you claim, I doubt he would wish to relate in any way with me since: B. For your information I am not White. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 05:08, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>You misunderstand me. I don't think that the article contained white-supremacist material (in fact I think it had very little if any genuine content, hence my confusion over your description of it as <i>valid</i>). Rather, claiming that no-one but you had read the article, and calling other voters <i>sheep</i> was strongly reminiscent of the style of comments made by Dnagit and his friends at, for example the VfU for <i>Jewish ethnocentrism</i>. In fact it was those comments of yours, in my view, that would make few people take your interjection seriously, not my response to them.<br />
I did in fact check your edit history, and it was immediately obvious that there was no actual connection between you and Dnagit; I therefore didn't claim that there was. Rather, I said that the tenor of your remarks <i>suggested</i> that there was. I could (and should) have made myself clearer. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">ÎÎµÎ» ÎÏÎ·ÏÎ·Ï</font>)</a> 09:25, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm mixed. This article is crap. Pure POV drivel. However, the notion of "consious evolution" is (or at least was) pretty commonplace in New Age thinking not so long ago. It's unfortunate to see that the term and concept is being co-opted by such societal detritus as the neo-nazis. There *could* be an article on the topic, but this is probably a worse starting point than a blank page.

<li>there is such an enormous wealth of material on conscious evolution, that it would be an utter shame and waste for such a topic to be merged with other topics. eugenics and conscious evolution are not the same. Eugenics is about selective breeding, where as conscious evolution encompasses all strategies, philosophies and tactics to enable upward evolution. There is also a very spiritual element to conscious evolution, that does not exist in transhumanism. Merging conscious evolution with transhumanism wont work either, as transhumanism which was hijacked and rejects eugenics - even though the founder of transhumanism was an avid supporter of eugenics. Conscious evolution deserves its own category, and has thousands of unique articles and perspectives on it make it worthy. I ask that you give me a couple of months to develop this topic and I will include all perspectives, pro, con, neutral, etc.. etc..

<li>Eugenics is a subset of conscious evolution, they are not one and the same. Transhumanism is a subset of conscious evolution, because the hijacked (huxley was a eugenicist) version of transhumanism rejects conscious evolution. Conscious evolution does not discriminate, it embodies all philosophies, all view points, all strategies of real tangible transformation towards Godhood! Why would anyone want to delete the most fascinating, creative, imaginative, stimulating and interesting topic that has ever come to wikipedia or the human race for that matter? We are talking about the last revolution where man takes control of his own conscious evolution to attain the ultimate dream of immortality and godhood. Sure the thing needs work, so does the rest of wikipedia, but why would we want to delete something which represents the true essence of wikipedia? If we deleted something because it wasn't finished or could be improved regarding its POV, wouldnt we have to delete all of wikipedia? Boulder Dash!&#160;;) Is not wikipedia Conscious Evolution and conscious evolution wikipedia? Are we not taking control of our own evolution here by building all the knowledge in the universe? Is that not clearly defined in conscious evolution as one of the traits of godhood? Imagine genetically modifying ourselves where we could hold the whole wikipedia (year 2100 version) in its completed form in our minds. Don't you see what this is? We are creating God here, this is mans ultimate dream to be immortal and attain oneness with god. Why would you want to delete this opportunity? Conscious Evolution is the great convergence of everything, all the knowledge in the universe and understood in our post human minds with perfection! Imagine a state of consciousness where consciousness permeates the whole of the universe and knowledge, and even the past and future. This is earth shattering stuff here folks. Please, let this thing stay, it needs a lot of time to nurture, to fertilize - no pun intended - and developed into something profound and wonderful. Give Conscious Evolution a CHANCE! As a reward you will all be given godhood.&#160;;)&#160;;) In all seriousness PLEASE give this a chance folks, please. <a href="../../../d/n/a/User%7EDnagod_c0a5.html" title="User:Dnagod">Dnagod</a> 02:11, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well this is why some would argue democracy is a scam, because there seems to be more ignorant people in the world than intelligent (not meant as a personal attack). Based on the number of people voting to delete, I don't see any reason to try to make this section NPOV, as well as include a wide variety of legit POV on the issue. The votes will mean the outcome of deletion is the same (true or false)? You may have proved that wikipedia is simply and mostly a numbers game (encouraging sock puppets and proxy servers). And of course proved I was right in regards to my statements regarding an organized biased jewish cabal, even worse are their lackeys. I think my bringing this fact of jewish biast to the forefront, will never allow for me to make long term legit contributions to wikipedia without the weenies (you know who you are), censoring, deleting or reverting.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I won't waste time developing and expanding this section (unless it is preserved), as it will get purged anyway, so what would be the point? I also think that most people are probably not ready for this kind of truth, it causes too much pain to the masses to realize that for thousands of years their silly revealed religions (especially judaism &amp; christianity in the west) were perpetuated myth-scams and that reality is Man is actually God in the making - you can pretend if you want that we are an end unto ourselves or simply that it isn't true, but deep down you know it is true and you hate the truth. You can't handle the truth!&#160;;)</p>
<p>So please make the deletion final. On a tangent, I think the real problem is that I exposed the absolute fact that every section regarding or even remotely involving jews, judaism, israel, zionism and holocaust denial have a cabal of jewish ethnocentrists, jewish supremacists and (neurotic?) jews, even worse lackeys of jews, who refuse to allow these areas to be fair, balanced, npov, and include legit links and sources. Even worse is that these sections will rarely if ever have the truth regarding the extent of alternative points of view which largely exist and are not pro or neutral concerning jews. By exposing this as a fact regarding wikis jew bias and jew infestation, I have brought the wrath of the jews and their lackeys, thus not ever being able to make legit contributions to wikipedia without those legit contributions being purged, deleted or reverted. Not an insult, not a personal attack, just follow the cabal and you will see I am right.</p>
<p>Would it make more sense that I no longer use this account to contribute? I will still use it to browse though, or would a fresh start be in order under a new name and proxy? In other words, would it make sense I set up new accounts, by instead using one of the thousands of proxy servers I have access to? Does one need to use subtle stealth to achieve positive results of neutrality? Not concerning the jew bias problem.</p>
<p>Wikipedia works for the most part, but your jewish bias from your jew cabal (which includes lackeys of the jews as well) and the inability for the great majority of people to see there is a serious jew problem here will definitely hurt the long term legitimacy and credibility of wikipedia regarding issues involving or even remotely involving Judaism â FACT!</p>
<p>I am glad I was able to bring attention to this fact, even though itâs futile with most people sticking their heads in the sand. However, I enjoy wikipedia and I have faith that history will repeat itself.</p>
<p>You have my blessing purge conscious evolution.</p>

<dd>Modemac, you are exactly correct. I have looked at these "jew biased" sections in question with great detail and they are free of insensitive ideas, free of right wing agendas and carefully sanitized, which means they are politically proper and socially correct. There is absolutely no bias, censorship or questionable POV involving what this user describes as "topics even remotely involving jews and judaism." Censorship of additions, contributions and links which point to politically incorrect, insensitive, alternative and critical ideas should not be allowed on wikipedia. If you allow alternative view points which are racist, politically incorrect, insensitive, hurtful and alternative, you will destroy the credibility of wikipedia. I am glad there are a large number of people keeping a close eye on these "jewish biased" topics ensuring they stay in the same voice they are now. Dariodario 14:05, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, AndyL's ingenuity in finding something reasonable for the article to be about is commendable. But, you know, this book by Barbara Marx Hubbard is not really notable, nor is the author. The book has an Amazon sales rank of 58,000 or so, and doesn't seem to have had much of an impact, though it was published in 1998. Tip of the hat to AndyL, but I don't think we need to be bending over backwards to have an article of this title in the Wikipedia.

<li>I don't think articles pending VfD should be so totally altered as to not even be about their original subject matterâthe only thing the same is the title.

<li><b>Comment</b>. On closer reading, I suspect that link doesn't reveal quite the level of notability one would hope for. The quote from the linked article is, "Throughout his career, he has <b>shared [a] stage</b> along with [such] world-acclaimed artists as...". Presumably those highly notable artists appeared as soloists while Murillo was a member of the symphony orchestra behind them. Even if <a href="../../../i/t/z/Itzhak_Perlman_f3ec.html" title="Itzhak Perlman">Itzhak Perlman</a> is at the front of the stage, I don't think it makes every member of the orchestra (thirty, fifty, a hundred musicians?) notable. I would suggest that for a symphony orchestra (one noteworthy in and of itself), only the conductor and maybe the concertmaster are usually above the notability threshold for inclusion. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 19:08, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This may not be the place for this discussion, but the harm it does is that it undermines Wikipedia's encyclopedic authority in relation to what is notable and significant. People come to an encyclopedia not only to obtain facts about particular subjects, but to understand how the subject is important in relation to some broader context. Paper encyclopedias have notability thresholds not only because they are "paper", but because the significance filter they apply is one of their most important functions. Even though Wikipedia does not have those practical constraints, not being paper, it still should apply an importance metric in its selection of subjects and the amount of detail that it provides about them. If someone does a search on Rigo Murillo and finds a long article, or even any article, about him in the Wikipedia, that person is entitled to believe that Wikipedia considers Murillo to be a notable musician. The people trying to get vanity articles about themselves into an encyclopedia seem to understand this much better than some of the editors. They want an article about themselves in the encyclopedia because it means they are important! If an article doesn't seem to establish why its subject is important, then it will seem to the reader that the article is poorly written and the reader will wonder why it was in the encyclopedia. If it later turns out that Rigo Murillo is not significant, the Wikipedia will seem unreliable, even if all the information in the article was correct, and a reader will be less inclined to trust its judgement about significance in the future, and perhaps even to question the factual accuracy of the articles. This is why deletionists waste a lot of time trying to remove "trivia" and "vanity" from the Wikipedia. It isn't because they are trying to save the project a few pennies on disk space. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:20, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Culling information is not the way to tell people what is notable and significant, if an article has a properly written introduction that will do the job fine. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:23, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>So you're saying that if it's well-written, any vanity is okay to keep? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 06:10, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm not actually arguing to keep vanity articles, I just oppose the use of quantity of information as a shorthand for importance. While IMO pure vanity isn't really useful information, deletionists vote delete on subjects with verifiable information which significant numbers of people might want to look for. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 07:41, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>I must respectfully disagree. Transplants from Athens, Georgia have begun to spread this holiday all throughout the nation. Last November it was celebrated not only all throughout the state of Georgia, but also in pockets of California (most notably in the Sacramento region), Virginia Beach, Las Vegas, and possibly even so far north as Boston. It can not be forgotten that very few holidays began nationwide. Valentine's Day started out as a small little holiday observed only in a town in West Virginia. Thanksgiving was once nothing but a meal eaten by some pilgrims. Christmas started in a little village in the mideast. It is quite foolish and stereotypically old-fashioned to stand in the way of something just because it's not big yet. Hell, if everybody did that, we'd still be living in caves.

<li><b>Delete.</b> No evidence presented that it is celebrated to any significant extent. The alleged theme song, "Money, money. it is good Money, money" returns no hits on Googling for exact phrase. Article reads like a transparent joke or hoax. As for the comment above that "It is quite foolish and stereotypically old-fashioned to stand in the way of something just because it's not big yet," Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not an incubator for holidays or neologisms or garage bands or memes on the rise.

<li>I did those kind of searches too. Sure its a venue for jazz, which means that jazz musicians do gigs there. These are announced on allaboutjazz.com, which produces Google hits. But to be significant, I'd want to see some evidence that this is a place which is more than just another venue. Is it the place where important jazz musicians got their start, for example? Have the owners of it been impresarios who were important in encouraging the development of new styles. Any place that is in business as a jazz venue has to have enough local notability to attract paying customers; but that doesn't make it encyclopedically notable. There must be 30 jazz clubs in NYC. What makes this one stand out, apart from cheap beer and a low cover charge? No change of vote.

<dd>The Lupinski Clan was first found in ancient china, although from eastern europe their roots can be found everywhere, EVEN PLUTO. AIT sources say that the first members of the lupinski clan were aliens, who were in deep freeze from the ice age. They defrosted and started mating with the human woman. The lupinski clan is renound for stopping nazi germany at the top of its peak, on mt. Hialyah. Infact, Oomtak (the leader of the clan) once had tea with hitler and himmler him self, until hitler killed himself because of Oomtaks awsomeness. Another great acheivement of the Lupinski Clan, is stopping the snow yetti's from invading america to rape the woman and pillage america. The lupinski clan stopped them by using alien cyborg criminal assassins, and then they settled an agreement with the yeti overlord, and they gave new jersey to the yeti's.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It is much better now than the original. However, animals do not come in "types". Other terms are used for the classification or taxonomy of animals. Moreover, this is not a disambiguation page. A disambiguation page is in order when several articles on different subjects would otherwise have the same title. By the way, there is already an <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">Animals</a> article, which is itself a disamiguation page. The current text would be an improvement over the text of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">Animals</a> and could simply be <b>merged</b> there. However, this page should be deleted and Types of animals should not be a redirect. We shouldn't be in a big rush to create articles for every phrase or term that somebody might conceivably enter into a Google or Wikipedia search box. At present, if you do a search on "Types of Animals"+Wikipedia in Google, the first Google result is <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">Animal</a>, which is perfectly fine. The article was created originally by a child, which is not strong evidence that "types of animals" is a phrase that warrants an article. It is getting to be ridiculous how many articles are being created just because Wikipedia's search function is pathetic. Encyclopedias have indexes, you know. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:20, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Even after improvement, the article is hardly a legitimate discussion of animal classification, and simply muddies the waters where there <i>is</i> a <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_classification.html" title="Scientific classification">legitimate taxonomy</a>. In what sense is an animal's conservation status its "type"?

<li><b>Delete</b> As others have said, this article is not scientifically accurrate. It mixes different levels of taxonomy, and mixes different kids of categoreis, and gives so few examples in each case is does discuss as to be misleading. A total re-write could produce a useful page on Taxonomy of animals, except that that already exists.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I really wonder how useful the existence of this page is. Nothing really links here, and I can't see anyone doing a search for "types of animals" (excepting an occasional 8 year old). Are we going to have pages for kinds of animals, sorts of animals, categories of animals, various animals, etc? It seems any useful information here that isn't already included in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a> should be merged into that article under an animal classification section. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:35, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
