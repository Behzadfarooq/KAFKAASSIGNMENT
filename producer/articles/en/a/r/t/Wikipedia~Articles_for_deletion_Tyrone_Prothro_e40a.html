<p>Non-notable college football player; only claim of fame is a medal he won for making a good catch. I'm from <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, I'm a football fan, and even I haven't ever heard of him.<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrennleberrn_acc8.html" title="User:Drennleberrn">Drennleberrn</a> 20:31, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b>: No offense, but you must not be much of a college football fan, especially if you are from the state. This guy was a national story last year and is arguably the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alabama_7e4c.html" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</a>'s top player - they are still feeling his injury this year which helps explains why their offense is so poor this year (injuries, probation and their coaches). Look, I'm an Auburn fan and could really care less, but even I know who Prothro is. Do a google search on the guy as there is plenty of news about him which would seem to make the article a worthy entry. He was one of the top receivers in the nation before his injuries and when his leg is fully healed (if it heals - sure looked like an ugly break to me), I would think him to be a probable draft pick. Anyway, my vote is that it seems notable and should stay...at least until the end of his rehab. If he doesn't recover, then the article should definitely be removed. <a href="../../../o/t/d/User%7EOtduff_7ab5.html" title="User:Otduff">otduff</a> 5:52, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He's obviously getting a lot less famous, though. I've never really liked the Auburn University team, because they've never played really well, and so I don't get what the F is going on with this "great player". Also...definitely get rid of the whole high school thing. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrennleberrn_acc8.html" title="User:Drennleberrn">Drennleberrn</a> 15:16, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well your bias against <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auburn_Tigers_football_3de2.html" title="Auburn Tigers football">Auburn</a> has no bearing here as Prothro does not even play for Auburn - he plays for <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_c1b8.html" title="Alabama Crimson Tide">Alabama</a>. And not sure what you mean by Auburn "never played really well" considering they play in the toughest conference and have been ranked in the top5 the last several seasons. But again, it's irrelevant...just funny that a supposed football fan from Alabama doesn't know better? As for the high school, if you look at many other players (<a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Montana_b4bb.html" title="Joe Montana">Joe Montana</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Jackson_c943.html" title="Bo Jackson">Bo Jackson</a>, etc), their high schools are listed so not sure why it's not relevant here. Besides that, the article isn't very long so I don't see what the big deal is about mentioning it? <a href="../../../o/t/d/User%7EOtduff_7ab5.html" title="User:Otduff">otduff</a> (<a href="../../../o/t/d/User_talk%7EOtduff_16ab.html" title="User talk:Otduff">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_otduff_8ec9.html" title="Special:Contributions/otduff">contribs</a>) 01:40, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> It seems reasonably notable. An ESPY is a basis for notariety. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigMonroe_ac41.html" title="User:CraigMonroe">CraigMonroe</a> (<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECraigMonroe_fef5.html" title="User talk:CraigMonroe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CraigMonroe_4308.html" title="Special:Contributions/CraigMonroe">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Added three articles about him from New York Times and four from Tennessee and Alabama papers which were carried on a national press wire service. Notability is determined by multiple independent mainstream coverage, not personal like or dislike of a player or team. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:17, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As per reasons noted by otduff; both that catch and his injury were national stories in 2005 (though the injury probably only because the catch had already been a story). Also agreed that if he does not return for a senior season (2007) or make the NFL, it should probably be removed, as he will be just a footnote. And agree with Drennleberrn that there is no need for the paragraph on his high school career, but I will wait until after this vote is complete to remove it. <a href="../../../p/a/w/User%7EPawl_Kennedy_15cd.html" title="User:Pawl Kennedy">Pawl</a> 21:09, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> Although I did hear about him, I do not think he is notable enough yet for inclusion. <a href="../../../m/y/n/User%7EMynglestine_6f64.html" title="User:Mynglestine">Mynglestine</a> 00:06, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Winning an ESPY qualifies as notable. Also, playing a skill position for a Top 25 team (well, last year) counts as "at the highest level in mainly amateur sports...including college sports in the United States" (from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>). This is stretching it, but the highlight of that catch will probably be added to the "enduring historical record" of 'Bama football. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 03:00, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>He's NOT THAT FAMOUS! He's not even a 'Bama hall-of-famer.

<dl>
<dd>Actually, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>'s page is much longer. Also, it doesn't take being placed in a hall of fame to be notable in sports. By this logic, Adrian Peterson (star RB from Oklahoma) would be non-notable. The fact is, numerous articles have been presented. He is a likely NFL draft pick. This is enough to be notable.<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigMonroe_ac41.html" title="User:CraigMonroe">CraigMonroe</a> 22:00, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
