<p>Owens ran a company which made <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_%28electricity%29.html" title="Battery (electricity)">batteries</a> for ships. As such he was a civilian contractor for the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> and also had regular contact with the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriegsmarine.html" title="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a> in <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiel.html" title="Kiel">Kiel</a>, and his first contact with espionage occurred in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> when he had been briefly employed by the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Intelligence_Service_e82b.html" title="Secret Intelligence Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a> to give information on what he had seen in the German shipyards. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, Nikolaus Ritter, operating as an Abwehr agent in Britain under the name 'Dr Rantzau', made contact with him. As a supporter of <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_nationalism.html" title="Welsh nationalism">Welsh nationalism</a>, Owens was a relatively easy target for turning into an enemy agent as he had little loyalty to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. His work also provided a cover for any foreign trips he might have to make, and he visited Germany that year where he met the Abwehr and was recruited. While Owens appreciated the payments for his espionage, his real interest was sexual as the Abwehr provided attractive women for him. His codename in the Abwehr was 'Johnny'.</p>
<p><a name="Double_agent" id="Double_agent"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Owens_ff6f.html" title="Edit section: Double agent">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Double agent</span></h2>
<p>However, on his return to Britain Owens had second thoughts about working for Germany and told the British authorities in September 1938 of his contact and that he was to receive a radio transceiver. The radio arrived via the left luggage office of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Station_%28London%29_30f4.html" title="Victoria Station (London)">Victoria Station</a> early in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> and Owens turned this over. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">August 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> Owens visited his Abwehr controller in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg.html" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>; during this visit, his wife and son went to the police to tell them he was a German agent. Despite this information the police failed to pick him up on his return on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_23.html" title="August 23">August 23</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_4.html" title="September 4">September 4</a>, Owens made contact with the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Branch_7a96.html" title="Special Branch">Special Branch</a> to volunteer his services. However, he was instead interned in <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wandsworth_%28HM_Prison%29_cafd.html" title="Wandsworth (HM Prison)">Wandsworth Prison</a> under <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defence_Regulation_18B_0a4c.html" title="Defence Regulation 18B">Defence Regulation 18B</a> as someone with hostile associations. MI5 decided that Owens, to whom they gave the codename 'SNOW', could act as a double agent. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>, MI5 returned the transmitter to Owens in Wandsworth where it was used by a warder to contact the Germans. Owens received a reply inviting him to go to the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Countries_e9ff.html" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a>, then neutral, and he was let out of jail to attend.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Owens_ff6f.html" title="Edit section: Activities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Activities</span></h2>
<p>In the early months of the war the Germans asked for regular weather reports from him for the use of the <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> and also to test his credibility. At a meeting with the Abwehr in <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, Owens was given some cash and some detonators for use in <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage.html" title="Sabotage">sabotage</a>. He had taken along another double agent, also a Welsh nationalist, who was instructed to start a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postage_stamp.html" title="Postage stamp">postage stamp</a> business so that the Germans could communicate through <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microdot.html" title="Microdot">microdots</a> on stamps.</p>
<p>From the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> the Abwehr sent most of its British-based agents and contacts to see Owens. MI5 tried to make sure that Owens only passed on to the Germans the information that they had given him. One of the most important was supplying false names and ration book numbers for the Abwehr's agents who were parachuted into Britain. MI5 continued to be suspicious of Owens who was known to exaggerate his importance and sent a second double agent, Sam McCarthy (codenamed BISCUIT) to see him. McCarthy reported back that Owens admitted he was also double crossing MI5, which led MI5 to believe that Owens was primarily interested in making money from both sides and that probably neither trusted him entirely.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Owens_ff6f.html" title="Edit section: Suspicion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Suspicion</span></h2>
<p>In March <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, Owens and another double agent, Walter Dicketts (known to MI5 as CELERY), were summoned to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisbon.html" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> to meet their Abwehr controllers. Unexpectedly Dicketts was then taken to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg.html" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> for three weeks' interrogation, having been suspected by the Germans, but survived it. The fact that this had not happened to Owens, and that Owens had not warned Dicketts that it might happen, gave rise to MI5 suspicions, and they assumed from then on that SNOW was helping the Germans actively.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Owens_ff6f.html" title="Edit section: Later life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later life</span></h2>
<p>MI5 used Owens' radio to inform the Germans that he was seriously ill while interning Owens in <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmoor_%28HM_Prison%29_cee6.html" title="Dartmoor (HM Prison)">Dartmoor</a> Prison until the end of the war. In Dartmoor Owens stayed in the hospital wing, which was termed as Camp 001 for internees. On his release, Owens emigrated to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> where he was known as Mr Brown; there he went to the British High Commission in <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> to demand compensation for what he regarded as his wrongful arrest in 1941. When he threatened to publish his memoirs, a secret fund was set up to buy him off.</p>
<p>Owens later moved to <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and settled in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harristown.html" title="Harristown">Harristown</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Dublin_5703.html" title="County Dublin">County Dublin</a> where he died in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>.</p>
