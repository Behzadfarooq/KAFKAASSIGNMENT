<p>Beast Mode is a special form that Rantoul, IL track members use to get in the zone. Beast Mode is something not to be taken likely for it can result in serious injury if done improperly. To get into Beast Mode, one must repeast "Beast Mode" several times. After this, begin to shrug your shoulders up and down, continuing to say "Beast Mode". After about 1 minute of this, you should be ready to compete in Beast Mode. It is highly encouraged that you only try Beast Mode under the supervision of an experienced user of Beast Mode.</p>

<p>The West Coast Weave refers to a specific play in a 1988 National Football League game between the New York Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs. The Chiefs kicked the ball off to the Jets and the Jets return featured 11 laterals and 3 fumbles. It set the NFL record for laterals in a play, yards traveled in a play, and elapsed time during a play. The term West Coast Weave was coined by then Houston Oilers coach Jerry Glanville.</p>

<p>KidDUKERocks was an irreputable poster on the ACC Boards message board. KDR first began posting in 2003 and quickly amassed several thousand posts. He began to draw the fury of ACC Boards moderators on many occasions.</p>
<p>KDR mainly inhabited the Duke board, being the bandwagon fan that he is, but was mainly known on ACC Boards for his contributions on the Wasteland. On one such occasion, KDR posted a picture of the infamous Tubgirl, and received a two-week perma-ban for his actions. The incident caused ACC Boards moderators to threaten a system-wide ban to any user who posted the picture or even mentioned the name, "Tubgirl." Tubgirl soon was referred to as "she who can not be named."</p>
<p>During KDR's various bans, he created several aliases so that he could continue to participate in hs shenanigans. Several aliases included "TheCogfather", "Kid Lenoir-Rhyne" (KLR), "LookAtMe, LookAtMe", "sumerelcnu" and "DukieVitale".</p>
<p>In 2006, KDR was permanently banned for successfully hacking into the moderator's forum, along with his co-conspirastor PossumAllaWishes.</p>
<p>KDR later went on to become a regular on the Brickyard, the NC State off-topic board. KDR was tossed from this board many times as well, due to his unfriendly relations with feared board Nazi-moderator, CalStabn.</p>
<p>KDR, in his finest moment, decided to found his own board, where anarchy and disarray could be celebrated and not persecuted. Thus, the Speakeasy was born. The Speakeasy was founded with the motto, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled wuffies yearning to be free. Those disillusioned with other boards. Send these, the exiled and banished to me for refuge from the power-crazed whore."</p>
<p>While posting on the Speakeasy, KDR has often regalled other posters with his grand accomplishments in golf, including being his club's champion and shooting an 83 in the Caldwell County Amateur championship. KDR owes much of his success in life to his gracious father-in-law, without whom his house, cell-phone and broadband internet would be unattainable.</p>
<p>The Speakeasy thrives to this day, though KDR and his massive forehead are still periodically banned whenever the glare becomes too blinding.</p>

1988 New wave album called Blah Blah Blah started once again Iggy and Bowie partnership. Bowie was surprised when Iggy brought him demos of an album because it wasn't usual Iggy's style. Bowie took care of production and it became Iggy's most commercial record until Brick by brick from 1990. It peaked at number 90 on USA billboard top 200 albums. First single Real wild child became his first and only top 10 UK hit. There were few more moderate hits from record as Cry for love, Shades and Isolation for which all were made videos. After a while Iggy went on succesfull tour to promote the album. The venues were full and he was enyojing long waited succes after 4 years of hiatus ( he didn't record an album since 1982 Zombie birdhouse ). The album went gold in Canada and was succesfull all around the world.</p>

<p>Real aikido is a martial art invented by Ljubomir Vračarević, a self-defence instructor from Serbia and Montenegro. It is a mixture of aikido, judo and jujutsu techniques, with some modifications made by Vračarević himself.</p>
<p>Real aikido is a defence techniques system (empty-handed, as well as defense against weapons such as knife, pistol, etc.) derived from Vračarević's experience as a bodyguard, military and police instructor. It consists of, generally speaking, aikido, judo and jujutsu, techniques simplified in such a way that they are easily taught in security and self-defence courses.</p>
<p>The curriculum of real aikido itself is mainly based on a general aikido curriculum, with a kyu/dan system of grading.</p>

<p>Magicka is the system of magical abilities within The Elder Scrolls. The magicka system is daggerfall was different from morrowind in that skill reflected upon the spells cost in magicka, in morrowind it was changed and skill didn't have much to do with any thing besides determining the spells you could cast. In oblivion the magicka system is the same as it was in daggerfall. Also Morrowind players may find that the spell buying system is drasticly different in Oblivion since the player may no longer create a spell that he or she desires right off the bat. Instead they have preset spells ( Don't dispair, the preset spells are much better than they were in morrowind.) You have to wait to create spells until you complete a series of tasks from all of the local mage's guild leaders. Once all of them send recommendations to the Arcane University, you will have access to the University, and all the facilities inside. This means that you will be able to create custom spells and add custom enchantments to any unenchanted items. You use a soul gem with a soul in it to enchant items. They're also used to recharge enchanted weapons one they're used too many times, and the enchantment's power runs out. To fill a soul gem with a soul, there is a spell called "capture soul" that is used on any human or creature. Once that creature is killed, the soul is put into the gem, and the gem is then available for use. Humans can not have their souls captured before Oblivion, but there is a mod for Morrowind that makes it available.</p>

<p>Whatever the possibility of a US strike against Iran, the fact remains that the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) is far more capable than most western sources think.</p>
<p>There are many instances from late 2003 where the US has tracked IRIAF aircraft near the Iraqi border. For example: in November 2003 a USAF E-3 sentry tracked a formation of no less than 16 IRIAF F-14s. This disproves the theory that Iran's F-14 is inactive due to lack of parts. Most western observers still base their observations on 20 year-old data, such as the fact that the aircraft purchased by Iran in the 1970s from the US are un-operational. Not only are the Tomcats used by the IRIAF operational but they have undergone massive upgrade programs. The US claims that Irans stock of AIM-54 Phoeix was sabotaged in the the 1970s by the CIA. This might have been the case but the IRIAF has reverse engineered the Phoenix and is now in low level production. This is complete ironery as the USN has retired its remaining AIM-54s and is about to phase out its last two squadrons of Tomcats.</p>
<p>This means that if a US air campaign were to take place against Iran, they could defend themselves to a certain extent. The USAF and US Navy have no fighter that can engage a target beyond 30 miles. While the F-14 can engage a target at 120 miles. This is a small advantage but it will make the US think twice before starting a full air campiagn against Iran. Combat Aircraft magazine</p>

<p>Aligator meat is an exotic and regional comestible, largely exported from the State of Louisiana, on the United States' gulf coast. It is generally marketed in three categories: white tail meat, which is tender and reminiscent of veal; dark tail meat, the toughest meat on the aligator; and body meat, which is chewier and resembles pork shoulder in consistency. When preparing aligator meat it is important to marinate before cooking with intense heat. Marinating, in vinager (or milk, in some cases) tenderises the meat so that it will cook evenly. Aligator meat can be purchased through exotic food purveyors in a variety of cuts and states of process, i.e. aligator sausage and aligator tail steak. Aligators that enter the food chain are mostly farm raised, but some are simply hunted and butchered.</p>

<p><b>Meat Labels:</b></p>
<p>Before we proceed to discuss the meaning or certain food labels, lets step back as consumers and consider our obligations and interests when buying, eating and serving food. In fact, we are responsible to ourselves, our family and friends. There are a variety of qualities that we look for. Taste, nutrition, and price often top many of our priorities. We might scan the ingredients, look for a trusted brand, and or course, compare prices. And with all the labels and claims these days, how can we make a decision.</p>
<p><b>What do they mean?</b></p>
<p>We might be familiar with the certification organic, but, really, how can we tell what is true? As consumers, every day we are role to make choices from what we know. This label navigator lays out which claims mean what, and what to look for.</p>
<p><b>Meat Label Guide</b></p>
<p><br />
 Certified Organic. Animals are given no antibiotics, no hormones, and must have access to pasture. Their feed is GMO and pesticides free. (Irradiation is not allowed.)  Raised without hormones or Raised without antibiotics  Free Range (poultry meat) and Cage Free (eggs only)  Pasture &amp; Grass Fed: Cattle are raised in open pastures and fed on grass Humane: Producers use this claim differently  Free Roaming: Defined for poultry as animals having outside access, but no time amount set. The USDA regulates use of "free range" claims for poultry, but not for eggs or beef.  Natural is any minimally processed meat according to the USDA.  Kosher: Refers only to meat and animal products prepared under rabbinical supervision. Kosher does not indicate food-safety, nutrition, environmental or welfare standards.</p>

<p>Good choices for health, welfare, environment Need more information No relevance to health, welfare, and the environment</p>
<p>What if there’s no label?</p>
<p>If there is no label, this is an opportunity to ask the farmer or grocer yourself! These are simple questions to ask, and farmers are proud of the food they raise. If there isn’t someone who can answer your questions, are you sure you want to make this choice?</p>

<p>Das Williams has the energy and experience to work on the tough issues facing Santa Barbara County. Das will not build consensus on bad policy. He will fight to protect our neighborhoods and the environment.</p>
<p>"Das has been a very effective advocate for neighborhood issues, and delivers on his promises to deal with over development, traffic, and protection of environmental laws. Das doesn’t just talk about the issues, he takes action." said Jim Kahan, neighborhood leader and president of Allied Neighborhood Association and chairperson of the Grove Lane Area Neighborhood Association. "I have worked closely with Das and find him to have the energy and experience that the 2nd District needs."</p>
<p>Today we have a Board of Supervisors who proclaim its concern for the community but supports policies contrary to our established environmental ethics and trample the values we share as a community. The Board of Supervisors majority is focused on loosening environmental protection ordinances and diluting strong land use policies. They have systematically reduced public input in the process. I am deeply concerned that our County has strayed from the balanced perspective that leaders like Tom Rodgers and Bill Wallace fought so hard to establish and uphold.</p>
<p>We need a voice on the Board of Supervisors who will not compromise with special interests in the name of cooperation and diminish our environmental quality of life in the process. We need someone on the Board of Supervisors who is more than a sound-bite advertisement for environmental and neighborhood protection. We need forthright leadership, and I will never shy away from speaking out when others try to take away what generations have fought so hard to achieve.</p>
<p>"It is not my prerogative to build consensus around bad policy, but to stand against it. We need someone who listens and represents their constituents" -Das Williams</p>
<p>Das on the Issues:</p>
<p>Urban Agricultural</p>
<p>Local farms are a part of our history and way of life in the Goleta Valley. Although these farms are community assets, their future is uncertain. I oppose any re-zoning of these parcels of land that would take them out of active agriculture.</p>
<p>We must fight to ensure that land is preserved and that local farms remain viable businesses to sustain our regional food supply. One part of sustainability is having enough housing so people that work here may live here, another part of sustainability is securing our locally grown food supply.</p>
<p>Housing</p>
<p>A public perception exists that protection of the environment and quality of life is inherently in conflict with the interests of working people. I reject that notion. Protection of our environment is the highest form of justice for people of any economic class. Further, saving open space and agricultural land does not have to be in conflict with building a modest amount of affordable housing.</p>
<p>If properly located in an area already built out, with ready access to transit and walking distance to shops, affordable housing can reduce the traffic impact that we already experience from commuters.</p>
<p>The threat to neighborhoods is not the 162 affordable units required by the state mandate. The problem is that the state mandates are set up so that five times more units of luxury housing might get built along with those affordable units. The changes that are being discussed, including a blanket rezone of 15 acres at 20 units per acre with no guarantee of affordability, could lead to thousands of units unless we put restraints on what can be built.</p>
<p>We must also ensure there are no inherent contradictions between the housing mandates and state law regarding community and circulation plans. That is why I am working with Assemblymember Pedro Nava on legislation that would allow local jurisdictions to put affordable restrictions on the rezone, making sure that less luxury housing will ever get built and that whatever is built is affordable. To ensure that housing is prioritized in built-out commercial areas, the legislation would also ensure that mixed-use units count towards the state housing allocation.</p>
<p>Goleta Community Plan</p>
<p>Instead of the state demanding a new housing element every 5-8 years, it should mandate community plan updates created by local residents working together. I was the first candidate for 2nd District Supervisor to call for the completion of a comprehensive community plan before any re-zoning takes place. Appropriate community planning must consider the whole picture. In addition to land use, effective community planning must include circulation and traffic impacts, creek setbacks to avoid flooding, park locations, public services, neighborhood character and natural resources. This comprehensive approach to community planning must ensure that all constituencies have the opportunity to participate fully in the process.</p>
<p>Second, if the county does upzone some land, it should be accompanied with a downzone so that the remainder of our urban ag land is kept open space forever.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is not efficient to separate the department of Planning and Development; it merely leads to bad planning and inconsistencies with the General Plan.</p>
<p>County Split</p>
<p>The County Split proposal was placed on the ballot and financed by ultra-conservative special interests from Santa Maria and Orcutt. Even these oil companies and mega-developers who want unrestrained growth from the Gaviota Tunnel to San Luis Obispo County, no longer vocally support the Split movement they instigated.</p>
<p>Without the North County, the South Coast will be unable to maintain a decent quality of life. Mission County will be immediately saddled with extreme debt and reduced services without Santa Barbara. The only means to rapidly build the Mission County economy and increase their tax base would be to allow massive oil, commercial and residential development. The South Coast will be severely impacted by the resulting traffic congestion, air pollution and threat of unsafe oil exploration.</p>
<p>The benefits and challenges of each area of the county enrich us as a whole. I believe we have more in common with the average citizen north of the Gaviota tunnel than we are led to believe by these development interests pushing the county split. We sink or swim together. I will fight for our fair share of resources to meet the needs of the 2nd District with a mind toward meeting the needs of the County as a whole.</p>
<p>Emergency Preparedness</p>
<p>We've learned a lot from Hurricane Katrina and other recent local disasters. Being prepared for the eventuality of a natural disaster is one of the foremost responsibilities of local governments. We must be vigilant in our protection against the threat of fire, earthquake, flooding and other natural disasters.</p>
<p>As 2nd District Supervisor I will ensure that we have the tools and resources needed to protect residents and deal appropriately with disasters. I have a history of working with the Santa Barbara City Firefighters and Police Department so that they have the equipment and trained personnel to provide the best protection possible.</p>
<p>Thanks to reports in Santa Barbara Newspress the potential dangers of the Lauro Dam floodplain are better known today. I am committed to working with residents to see that there is a plan in place to deal with this potential emergency, and have voted for seismic improvements to improve the safety of the Dam.</p>
<p>Goleta Beach</p>
<p>I support science-based solutions. Science tells us that armoring the beach increases erosion of other coastline areas, rapidly contributing to erosion of both private property and publicly owned parks and beaches. It is irresponsible to dump rock and concrete at Goleta Beach because it is environmentally harmful and it is not the action of a good neighbor. Goleta Beach is alive and constantly changing. While it is receding now, eventually it will come back. We should not interfere with this natural process.</p>
<p>A solid body of scientific studies shows that seawalls, rock revetments, groins, jetties and breakwaters wash away sandy beaches and threaten public access to the shore. That is why the County's Local Coastal Plan discourages coastal armoring unless there are no feasible, less damaging alternatives to protect existing development. There are less damaging alternatives that can protect the sandy beach, preserve public access, and enhance recreation and natural resources at Goleta Beach.</p>
<p>The County must give up on the idea that recreation can exist independent of the natural resources that form the basis for the Goleta Beach experience. I do not support abandoning structures or utilities to the sea; and we may need to use revetment or rocks as an interim tool until vulnerable structures such as utility pipelines can be relocated or reconfigured.</p>
<p>The fact remains that if we chose to not have rock revetments, we may lose some of the turf park but in its place we gain more sandy beach area. This choice asks only that we recreate on sand rather than on turf. Goleta Beach is a community treasure that should be protected for its recreational and environmental value.</p>

<p>”El programa de la colectividad argentino árabe para toda nuestra sociedad”</p>
<p><br />
Desde El Aljibe recorre las diferentes expresiones y actividades de la colectividad árabe en la Argentina, poniendo el acento en el análisis de sus temas de interés y una mirada cultural, social y recreativa de cada uno de las actividades que merezcan ser destacadas.</p>
<p>El programa es conducido por periodistas en estudio y cuenta con columnistas y secciones permanentes. La idea es recrear en formato audiovisual una revista de actualidad de los temas que involucran a la colectividad en nuestro país, para tomar así contacto con sus diferentes realidades.</p>
<p>En este ciclo de interés general lo histórico, lo anecdótico, lo autóctono y lo actual de la colectividad se entremezclan de manera dinámica en cada una de las emisiones.</p>
<p>Este programa cuenta con el auspicio -entre otros- de la Cámara de Comercio Argentino-Arabe la Confederación de Entidades Argentino-Arabes de la República Argentina (FEARAB) y el Club Sirio Libanés de Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>Considerando principalmente el eje de la temática identitaria de la colectividad argentino árabe y su relación con la totalidad de sus compatriotas argentinos desde una perspectiva federal, y observando la representación en el imaginario colectivo que se viene generando en las últimas décadas, se hace imprescindible sumar una imagen y una voz argentino-árabe al amplio espectro cultural del Canal Televisivo estatal, a los efectos de :</p>
<p>1- Erradicar los prejuicios y preconceptos generados en las últimos veinte años alrededor de todo lo relacionado con el mundo árabe.</p>
<p>2- Revertir la antedicha imagen generada con respecto al mundo árabe, para así lograr el cambio definitivo en la representación social de la colectividad argentino-árabe en nuestro país.</p>
<p>3- Amplificar el campo de la interrelación entre la colectividad y el resto de la sociedad nacional, para lograr una plenitud en la comunicación e intercambio de necesidades y actividades que permitan el enriquecimiento cultural de todo el pueblo argentino, a partir del aporte de nuestra cultura milenaria.</p>
<p>El programa ofrece además un menú de información sobre servicios básicos y la agenda de los principales eventos que se desarrollan vinculados con la colectividad. Además de la cobertura y el análisis de temas de actualidad, el programa cuenta con diferentes secciones:</p>
<p>Noti-Arab: cobertura semanal de los principales eventos sociales, gastronomía, actos culturales y educativos. Intercambio: participación de embajadores y diplomáticos de los países de origen de la colectividad árabe. Información del intercambio comercial argentino-árabe. Turismo - Nuestras Raíces: producción de especiales y emisión de documentales realizados en países de origen de la colectividad árabe. Colectividad Federal: reflejar las actividades producidas por la colectividad en el interior del país. Habrá además como complemento segmentos de turismo social, alternativas para el turismo Cultural, Turismo Religioso, etc. Personalidades: se propone retratar en un tono intimista a un personaje importante de la colectividad por programa.</p>

<p>Bryan was born in the Port Huron hospital (Michigan , US) on July 10 of 1987. He lived with his parents and sisterin Croswell, Michigan until he was ten. He had all the friends he needed at wim. At the age of seven he became deeply in love with the band KISS.After that he moved to Palm Harbor, Florida. There he initially had no friends , distruaght from this he believed it was a way of God telling him not to take things for granted. He was in high hopes of this period of time in his life being over. But, to his intense dismay things stayed on that same road.</p>
<p>That is when Bryan ceased all religious propaganda from entering him. Before this there was little if any belief in a divine power in him, church was just another part of life. After three years of living in Florida Bryan discoverd Ozzy, Motley Crue, and nu-metal bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Limp Bizkit. This as his "peers" say is the spiral. He was highly into professional wrestling, music(which began to play on his own), and of course every lonely persons favorite thing... video games. Bryan even went on his high school band trip to win states and played the Georgia Dome.</p>
<p>Soon after for unforseeable reasons , he moved back to his home town. He formed a short lived band, and re-united with some of his old friends. He stayed back in Croswell for two years, then moved to the next town down , Lexington. After that his family(ecluding his siter in college) moved his mom's home town of Sandusky , MI. There he got a job and his diploma. He is still there, so go find him.</p>

Step 1: For each row (column), determine a penalty measure by subtracting the smallest unit cost element in the row (column) from the next smallest unit cost element in the same row (column).</p>
<p>Step 2: Identify the row or column with the largest penalty. Ties are broken arbitrarily. Allocate as much as possible to the variable with the least unit cost in the selected row or column. Adjust the supply and demand, and cross out the satisfied row or column. If a row and a column are satisfied simultaneously, only one of the two is crossed out, and the remaining row (column) is assigned zero supply (demand).</p>
<p>Step 3: (a) If exactly one row or column with zero supply or demand remains uncrossed out, stop. (b) If one row (column) with the positive supply (demand) remains uncrossed out, determine the basic variables in the row (column) with the least unit cost. Stop. (c) If all the uncrossed out rows and columns have zero supply and demand, determine the zero basic variables with the least unit cost. Stop. (d) Otherwise, go to step 1.</p>

<p>Review from snarl.org with kind permission from yellow peril (writer of the article) Empirion</p>
<p>Giving Them Drugs Taking Their Raves Away</p>
<p>Back in November 1993, three friends, a former rocker, a skater, and a snowboarder who all had their lives turned upside down by acid house, got together and released what was soon to become a huge selling anthem for drug-crazed clubbers across Europe. They called themselves Empirion and the 12" was Narcotic Influence, merrily sporting the catchy refrain "giving them drugs taking their lives away" sampled from what sounds like a conservative evangelist, over slamming hardhouse beats. Skip forward to 1995, the year of Leah Betts in the UK and Anna Wood here in Sydney, and despite the massive sensationalism in the tabloid press, the kneejerk government backlash, and the incredibly rapid response of the subcultural presses, club promoters, and record labels to distance themselves from drug-use, the refrain is no longer so refreshingly humorous. Within the techno scene a renewed focus upon "the music" has replaced what once was a collective longing for a utopian community. A community that was generated by a combination of the music, the drugs and the people - but now the whole game, the energy and the passion has, since Anna Wood, become cornered by too much seriousness, carefulness and ultimately conservatism. Add this to the crackdown on venues, and it is of lilttle wonder that "the vibe has gone".</p>
<p><br />
Speaking to Empirion's Bob, shortly after the local release of the band's debut album, Advanced Technology, essentially a collection of their superb singles to date, we agree that in terms of both music and punters, things have splintered; "I think now there a whole lot of different scenes, whereas before it was all different styles but under the one roof. Everyone's into their own little scene at the moment with their own little clubs and its all quite segregated. Its a shame in some respects but at least when you're paying your money you know you'll get something you're into all night long". Strictly on a hardhouse minimalist driving bent, Empirion's tracks are sharp clinical cuts, aggressive and searing, tracks like Jesus Christ, the title track Advanced Technology and Ciao recall the era of Nitzer Ebb, the aforementioned Front 242 (later responsible for early rave anthem T99's Anasthasia) and the Electronic Body Music movement that swept Europe in the late 1980s and is still the mainstay of Sydney's 'gothic' clubs. "Back in the late Eighties I was listening to a lot of industrial bands, Front 242, Ministry, and Jamie was deejaying electro-style music, and Oz was in a rock band then when '88 hit we all started clubbing together. A lot of those industrial bands went really 'rocky', too, and that's when I got lost in the whole dance thing".</p>
<p><br />
"When we had Narcotic Influence pressed up we had a run of 500 copies and got back to the house and though 'what the hell are we going to with all these?' then it just went from there. Before the re-issue at the beginning of the year [with remixes by Dave Clarke, Meat Beat Minifesto and Secret Knowledge] we had sold 5000". Recorded for UK label XL Recordings, Empirion have stepped into a major label deal; "we had the album ready with seven tracks, (minus Jesus Christ and New Religion), in 1995 and that's when [big label] XL stepped in and we put the extra couple of tracks in the nine or ten months it took to sort the contracts out . . . it got to a stage where we were getting phonecalls from all over the world saying 'where can we get your stuff' and we realized it wasn't getting very far at all being sold out of the back of three or four vans . . . . so we felt we had to get more professional and XL was up for letting us do what we wanted to do". Signing to a major has also had its financial rewards. . . . Live, Empirion have toured the UK extensively, and recently played some shows in Europe. Rumoured for the Big Day Out's Boiler Room, their live shows have been receiving rave reviews throughout the UK. "Over the last six months our live rigs have been growing. After signing to XL we invested in sorting the studio out at home so the production on the second album will be much higher. The last few gigs we've had a drummer that has played with us on a couple of tracks, Oz is playing guitar on some others, and a friend is putting together a MIDI triggered video thing".</p>
<p><br />
And for a final word on THAT sample; "we've been through the scene and we're still doing it now but you started off with a lot of friends and seen some of them mess their lives up. Have respect for yourself and do what you are doing but you mustn't let it take your life over. People can take what they like from the record and even if its just making people stand back for a second". Now if the Anna Wood Foundation would use it for their advertisements . . .</p>

<p>Benjamin Guy Babington, fiul medicului William Babington, a fost scolit la Charterhouse inainte sa se inroleze in Marina Roiala.</p>
<p>In 1812, dupa 2 ani de studiu la colegiul companiei East India in Haileybury, Hertfordshire, s-a inrolat in serviciul Indian. A invatat in scurt timp foarte bine limbile orientale si sanscrita, astfel incat la doar 20 de ani a publicat prima carte de gramatica a limbii Tanul ( dialect indian ).</p>
<p>Sanatatea sa a avut de suferit pe urma climatului indian obligandu-l sa se intoarca in Anglia. A urmat apoi medicina la spitalul Guy in Londra si la colegiile Pembroke si Cambridge, obtinandu-si doctoratul in 1831 si devenind mai tarziu membru al Colegiului Medicilor.</p>
<p>A intreprins numeroase investigatii in privinta holerei ce a lovit Anglia in 1832 si a fost primul de pe batrana insula care a descris exantema caracteristica acestei boli.</p>
<p>In 1837 a devenit asistent al medicilor la spitalul Guy, pentru acest post concurand si Hodgkin, lucru care a deschis o intreaga controversa si numeroase dezbateri. Probabil ca Babington a fost ajutat si de cunostintele familiei sale. Tatal sau a fost medic la acest spital iar sora sa era sotia lui Richard Bright. A demisionat in 1855 in urma unei neintelegeri cu administratia spitalului privind accesul studentilor in spital.</p>
<p>Babington a fost membru al Societatii Roiale, iar in calitatea sa de membru al Consiliului Medicilor din cadrul Consiliului General de Sanatate, a primit numeroase sarcini de investigare. In 1863 a devenit presedinte al Societatii Medicilor si Chirurgilor Roiali. Fiind convins de importanta studiilor privind epidemiile in 1850 a fondat Societatea Epidemiologica, a carui presedinte a fost pentru multi ani, si pentru care a publicat numeroase scrieri importante.</p>
<p>A inventat un stetoscop curbat, a intuit folosul oglinzilor in investigarile gatului, iar in 1828 a inventat un instrument care l-a numit 'glotoscop' pentru examenul laringelui - adica primul laringoscop, fiind si primul care a introdus laringoscopia de rutina. A scris despre holera, epilepsie si coree, si a fost unul din primii care a sugerat ca fibrina se formeaza in sange dintr-un precursor mai solubil.</p>
<p>A murit pe 8 Aprilie 1866 de afectiune renala si vezicala.</p>

<p>Dungeon Runners is a 3D Fantasy Mass Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game (<a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a>) currently under development by <a href="../../../n/c/s/NCSoft_e5e5.html" title="NCSoft">NCSoft</a>. As of May 2006 the game is in closed beta, and a game trailer was exhibited at the 2006 <a href="../../../e/3/_/E3.html" title="E3">E3</a> convention.</p>
<p>Mark Tucker, the leader designer for Dungeon Runners, revealed some basic information about the game at E3 in an interview with Gaming Steve:</p>
<p>- Players will be able to download and play Dungeon Runners for free. A great deal of game content will be accessible at no cost, while other portions of the game will require payment to access. Tucker explained that they are still working out the exact payment model, but emphasized that most of the game is totally free. There is no web-based interface; it is a stand alone downloadable client, including all the game art, sound, etc.</p>
<p>- The game is similar in look and style to <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diablo_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Diablo (computer game)">Diablo (computer game)</a>, according to Gaming Steve and players who have spoken to Tucker.</p>
<p>- Tucker says they are designing the game for the casual player, allowing for the ability to go in, play for 15 minutes, then leave and still feel like you accomplished something worthwhile. Depending on the area you are in or quest you are on, certain objectives will take much longer and will involve more intricate questing.</p>
<p>- At E3, Gaming Steve commented that the development team for Dungeon Runners is surprisingly small, "just a handful a people" compared to standard MMORPGs.</p>
<p>- The game is geared toward solo play, to make the game as accessible as possible for all players. Simultaneously, for players who wish to group, the dungeons are going to be made to dynamically scale based on group size and composition.</p>
<p>- There will be no PvP at launch, but it is "on the top of their to-do list" for post-launch.</p>
<p>- The game has three classes for launch: 1) A warrior class, which specializes in melee combat and aggro control 2) A sorcerer class, which specializes in magic use, including ranged attacks and area of effect spells 3) The Hunter class, who uses crossbows, poison and damage over time skills</p>
<p>- The game uses a randomized item generator (similar to Diablo) and randomized dungeon generation.</p>
<p>- Tucker explained that they felt they could fill a niche in "old school hack and slash" style games, creating a game that allows a player to get on and get into the action quickly. They hope to thus attract players who aren't normally attracted to <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a> games.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The AngelCode Scripting Library, or AngelScript as it is also known, is an extremely flexible cross-platform scripting library designed to allow applications to extend their functionality through external scripts. It has been designed from the beginning to be an easy to use component, both for the application programmer and the script writer.</p>
<p>Efforts have been made to let it call standard C functions and C++ methods with no need for proxy functions. The application simply registers the functions, objects, and methods that the scripts should be able to work with and nothing more has to be done with your code. The same functions used by the application internally can also be used by the scripting engine, which eliminates the need to duplicate functionality.</p>
<p>For the script writer the scripting language follows the widely known syntax of C/C++ (with minor changes), but without the need to worry about pointers and memory leaks. Contrary to most scripting languages, AngelScript uses the common C/C++ datatypes for more efficient communication with the host application.</p>
<p>AngelScript is completely free, released under the zlib license. I only ask for your recognition, nothing else. However, if you would like to make a donation I would be very grateful. Your donation give me more inspiration and will allow me to spend more time working with AngelScript.</p>

<ol>
<li>Cross platform - It has been confirmed to work on Win32, Linux, MacOS X, XBox, PS2, PSP, Dreamcast, and Windows Mobile.*</li>
<li>Compiler support - It works with MSVC++, GNUC, MinGW, and DJGPP. Other compilers haven't been tested yet.</li>
<li>Cross language - With the flat C interface, other languages, such as Delphi, are also able to use the library.</li>
<li>Maximum portability mode - When the library is compiled in this mode it should work on just about any compiler/platform that can compile standard compliant C++ code. Some features like native calling conventions are not available in this mode. It has been confirmed to work on Mac OS X with PPC processor in this mode.</li>
<li>No costs - The scripting library is completely free for all use, though donations are appreciated.</li>
<li>Well documented - Both the script language and library is documented.</li>
<li>Familiar syntax - The script syntax is similar to that of C or C++, with only a few differences.</li>
<li>Statically typed - Unlike most scripting languages that are dynamically typed this one uses the same static types as C++, and applications can register additional types.</li>
<li>Direct access - The script engine can directly access and use registered functions, objects, and object members without the need to write proxy functions.</li>
<li>Object oriented - The script language allows for declaration of classes, and will soon permit polymorphism and inheritance as well.</li>
<li>Object handles - Pointers are not safe in a scripted environment, so AngelScript uses object handles instead. Object handles are almost like smart pointers, that control the life time of the object they hold.</li>
<li>Run-time compiled - The library compiles the scripts into byte code and executes the byte code through a virtual machine.</li>
<li>Step by step execution - The scripts may be executed line by line, for controlled execution and debugging.</li>
<li>Detailed exceptions - When an exception occurs information about why and where can easily be obtained.</li>
<li>Line interpretation - The engine can interpret separate script lines using the currently compiled script. Useful for Quake like consoles.</li>
<li>Saving/loading byte code - The compiled bytecode can be saved and reloaded at a later time.</li>
<li>Modular - Scripts can be compiled into modules that can be dynamically linked with each other.</li>
<li>C and C++ interface - There is a flat C interface that can be used by languages that don't interact well with C++ interfaces. It is successfully being used in Delphi projects.</li>
<li>Sandboxing - The library provides a secure environment for the scripts, i.e. the scripts can only access what the application explicitly exposes, and any built-in script objects are completely secure.</li>
<li>Concurrent scripts - Several scripts can be executed in parallel, by suspending and resuming them one by one. This allows for easy implementation of multi-tasking schemes, or even co-routines.</li>
<li>Debugging support - The application can examine the call stack and the value of local variables while running the scripts. The line callback feature allows the application to use breakpoints, do profiling, etc.</li>
<li>Multithreading - The library can be used in a multithreaded environment.</li>

<p>Life Under Mike is a political documentary directed and produced by Canadian filmmaker James Motluk. It was released to theaters in September 2000 to generally positive reviews. The movie takes a critical look at the government of then Ontario Premier Mike Harris. It was partially funded by American Filmmaker Michael Moore. In 2001 it received a Media human Rights Award and in 2002 it was invited to open a series on political activist art at Northeastern university in Boston, MA.</p>
<p>The movie touches on themes common to many of Motluk's films such as the need for government to play a role in the economy, the need for a strong sense of community and support for strong trade unions.</p>
<p>It features an exclusive interview with economist John Kenneth Galbraith.</p>

<p>Dani has all the powers as Danny, but she doesn't have his Ghostly Wail. Also, unlike Danny and Vlad, overusing her powers would cause her to dissolve into ectoplam. This causes some Danny Phantom fans to think that Danny will eventually use his mid-morph DNA to satbilize her.</p>

<p>From the years 1996-2003, Shaun Tai was the president of Z.Team Yossi, an extremely successful and award-winning car club that led the 'import car culture' in Northern California and inspired the movie, "The Fast and the Furious."</p>
<p>"Drag-racing teams may not actually be populated by shiny-pated hunks like Vin Diesel or tough beauties like Michelle Rodriguez, but in other ways the film got it right. Diesel's chief rivals are a tough oriental gang; the real-life Z-Team Yossi, led by the fearsome Tai brothers, are one of the most successful drag-racing teams in California. Shaun Tai has got his nitrous oxide-powered VW Tessa under the 10-second mark in various official meetings, while the Yossi's group of sexy "Hunnies" are there to bring some glamour to the all-oriental team wherever they race." - Guardian Unlimited Film, UK</p>

<p>The Chin National Front was formed on 20 March, 1988, dedicated to securing the self-determination of the Chin people and to establish federal Union of Burma based on democracy and freedom.</p>
<p>The Union of Burma has been ruled by illegitimate military regimes that have suppressed all peaceful demands for democratic political change since 1962. The regimes have not only violated the basic canons of democracy, freedom, and human rights, but have also denied the Chin people to enjoy the right of self-determination to promote, protect and preserve the Chin national identities through peaceful political life.</p>
<p>The Chin National Front welcomes and invites any country, nation, organization, and individuals to join in the effort to restore democracy, freedom and federalism in the Union of Burma.</p>

<p>Samuel Curtis Rogers Middle School is one of two middle schools in the Moreland School District of San Jose, California that will be closed down after the 2005-2006 school year, due to significant budget cuts throughout the state of California. The school's mascot is a rhino and that is widely noticed due to the fact that a rhino is painted on the wall in the lunch area.</p>
<p>It is noted that Rogers is a "rival" of Castro Middle School, the other middle school in the district. Rogers has slightly lower test scores and has often been noted as the "bad" school in the district. Because of the closing of the school, it will be merging with Castro and the name will be changed to "Moreland Middle." Because Castro has a larger campus, its location will be used to house the larger population.</p>
