<p>Instinct theory does not site any real sources and is obviously made up. There is no book by Jacques Theroux named Instinct Theory, nor is there anyone by the name of Jacques Theroux. <a href="../../../e/i/d/User%7EEidolos_11aa.html" title="User:Eidolos">Eidolos</a></p>
<p><b>Question</b>: What do you mean by "obviously made up"? "Instinct theory" garners approx. 44,000 exact hits on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=s&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22instinct+theory%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=s&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22instinct+theory%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google</a> and is mentioned in several authoritative webpages, so there is at least such a thing. Checking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Instinct_theory&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Instinct_theory&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">page history</a>, many established editors have contributed to the article...it's not exactly "fake". If there's an accuracy problem, I believe this should be solved through regular editing, rather than deletion itself. +<a href="../../../a/2E/o/User%7EA.Ou_777e.html" title="User:A.Ou">A.0u</a> 04:11, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>: There is no one by the name of Theroux, nor does the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen have anything to do with this. "Instinct theory" may get a lot of hits on google because there are theories on instincs but how many come up when you type in jacques theroux? or the name of his book? "Due to its dubious credibility, many scholars doubt Theroux's theory. Because of a sore lack of citations, and a ludicrously short bibliography, certain scholars have come forward and declared their disbelief in these ideas." Oh, come on! There is no truth behind anything that has been written if you look into it. "certain scholars" "many professionals" there is NO proof behind this. <a href="../../../e/i/d/User%7EEidolos_11aa.html" title="User:Eidolos">Eidolos</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A.Ou's sentiments are well-intentioned, but the sense in which these authorities use the phrase is clearly not the way any portion of the article depicts it. Indeed, it depicts nothing, except a nonexistent author (Library of Congress catalog search confirms that it doesn't have anything by a Jacques Theroux). The first paragraph is okay; the entire first section is demonstrably false; and the "Popular Culture" sections are at best original research and at worst a joke ("The 2004 film Collateral, Tom Cruise's character Vincent sees a coyote on the street and, in a very metaphorical scene, it reminds him of himself."). And the "Musical Theatre" section none of these "established editors" have seen fit to remove? Get rid of this blight, then we'll see if there's something encyclopedic in the topic. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZenohockey_178b.html" title="User:Zenohockey">zenohockey</a> 04:17, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Changed to delete</b>User:Eidolos and the convincing ones who say delete convinced me to take another look at it by narrowing the search including Theroux, Kenkel, Jacques Thiroux. So just from googling I found there is or was a person by the name Jacques Thiroux but he seemed to have nothing to do with this theory and the other two don't seem to exist. This convinces me it's a hoax. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/103-4628464-0089426?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Jacques%20Thiroux" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/103-4628464-0089426?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Jacques%20Thiroux" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>

<dd>Yes, I did make this account to point out to the Wikipedia community that my friends made a false article. I admit to that, and there's nothing wrong with it. I also made this account to fix other errors and such as I see them. I simply had no reason to create an account before this, just to fix things anonymously. This is my first account. I did not make this one in addition to another just for this deletion. I just didn't have one before and I figured this was a good time for it. <a href="../../../e/i/d/User%7EEidolos_11aa.html" title="User:Eidolos">Eidolos</a></dd>

<li><b>Final Word Here</b> Well, this is really out of my comfort zone... Never done this before. I am only here to point out the site to you. Please make your own decisions based on what is in this article. I just feel that this is completely untrue and needs to be taken down. There are no such people as Theroux or Kenkel, it does not site credible sources (makes a lot of generalities like "many philosophers" or "certain scholars"), there is no such book as Assertations on Instinct Theory, the main writers/editors of this site do not have any other posts or edits, and the pop culture references are a stretch to say the least. Rumors on blogs about "Instinct theory: the Musical"? "Very few details are known about this future production, except that it will contain a score with every genre of music from jazz to reggae[citation needed]. The unnamed producer has little to say about this future film, except it might be released by mid 2008." There is no way this is feasible. I have looked for Instinct Theory and even if it does exist none of the sites have anything to do with topics described here. I am sorry for the excess of posting, I just want to prove my point in hopes of persuading you that this is fake. If you want to keep the site up and simply edit it to what Instinct Theory actually is, be my guest. A site I found from google searching (allpsych.com) says that Instinct theory says that we have innate instincts that help us to survive, like how spiders know how to make webs. It has nothing to do with comparing humans and animals. Maybe this topic could be expanded on rather than what is there now, but it does not seem nearly important enough to add.. <a href="../../../e/i/d/User%7EEidolos_11aa.html" title="User:Eidolos">Eidolos</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The nominator has been forthcoming about having created the account for the sake of nominating this article and seems to have done it out of legitimate concern. I don't think that should factor in to the decision - remember <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>? Anyway, this page is rife with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> as it makes no attempt to properly satisfy <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. In fact one of the references appears to be entirely fictional. As such I doubt anything here is salvageable by merging - the term "Instinct Theory" <i>may</i> be a valid topic but that doesn't mean keeping/merging an article about a made-up concept with a real name is valid. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:48, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: A joke on science? Really, how is reporting a site as false information worse than writing a false page as a joke? None of this on the page can be proven as real. This is simply a hoax with a real name, as Arkyan said. Looking at the sites you have given, every single page is a theory by a different person with different ideas, and are not a single unified scientific theory that should be given its own page. If it is decided to salvage what they can from different sites and just rewrite this page, then so be it. <a href="../../../e/i/d/User%7EEidolos_11aa.html" title="User:Eidolos">Eidolos</a>

<dd><b>ADDED</b> I made several edits to the pop culture section, which you can't deny as a hoax, and I made several grammar edits, but I did not make up the Jacques Theroux story.
