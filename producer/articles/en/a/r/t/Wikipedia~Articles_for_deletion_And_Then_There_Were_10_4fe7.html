<li>That was not directed toward the show, I was speaking for all shows in general. Your rationale states "does not establish notablilty outside of the TV show".

Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic." I don't see any "real-world context" or "sourced analysis", and I doubt there ever could be any. --[[[User:Phirazo|Phirazo]] 01:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll try this again. You want to delete this article citing it as "indiscriminate information". Then by your definition, <b>all</b> the episodes should be put up for deletion, since they follow the same format. You also say that this is not notable. Care to explain how it's not, seeing as it's the pilot episode and serves as the basis of the entire show? It's one thing to cite policy, it's another thing to prove where it violates it. <font face="Tahoma"><a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacific_Coast_Highway_7117.html" title="User:Pacific Coast Highway">Pacific Coast Highway</a> <sup><font color="green"><b>{</b><a href="../../../p/a/c/User_talk%7EPacific_Coast_Highway_d1ca.html" title="User talk:Pacific Coast Highway">The internet</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pacific_Coast_Highway_7847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pacific Coast Highway">runs on Rainbows!</a><b>}</b></font></sup> 02:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</font></li>

<li>1. This is not a mass AfD. Please discuss whether or not <i>this</i> article should be deleted. 2. The episode in question is non-notable because there are not enough reliable, 3rd party sources to write an article. 3. The article is a scene-by-scene plot summary of a TV episode.

<li>Where did I say that this was a mass AfD? I only said that if you're going to can this one, can them all since they fall into the same category that you have placed this one in. But I do credit you for giving an explanation. My stance still stands. I also took the time to read some of the discussions surrounding this issue and they all seem to agree that AfD's like this will cause more harm than good. And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBXQ_nBXFtk" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBXQ_nBXFtk" rel="nofollow">TV.com</a> no longer counts as a independent source?

There has been no agreement that it does fall into "indiscriminate information", only subjective opinion.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Some episodes of some series are notable - for instance, the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Enough_at_Last_261d.html" title="Time Enough at Last">Twilight Zone where Meredith breaks his glasses</a>. But every episode of every notable series is not going to become a part of pop culture. This means that these articles will never be anything beyond plot summaries and "special guest" lists, occasionally with an item or two of dubious-quality trivia. <b>While the information is interesting - sometimes even fascinating - to pour over</b>, I don't believe it belongs in Wikipedia. I'm not aware of a TV-related Wiki, but there surely must be one leading candidate to which this material can be transferred. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, however - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_I_Love_Lucy_episodes_e313.html" title="List of I Love Lucy episodes">airdates and episode titles of television shows are good</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a>. Episodes of television shows which have made a <i>timeless, lasting impression</i> on popular culture - and yes, I am a stodgy, pole-in-the-ass academic - deserve mention. The third episode of the fourth season of Aaron Spelling's Presentation of Stephen King's Suchandwhat does not deserve an article of its own. The "keep" vote above me seems to be based on a slippery slope fallacy, with shades of <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a>. I'm sure that my opinion is not the most popular one there is - but if <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, then I think it's best to begin backing that up with action - even if it means hundreds and hundreds of new AfDs. --Action Jackson IV 07:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or at worst merge. I am fine with almost any television show broadcast on a major network having its own article. If you don't want that, then I would be content with including the information on a page like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ben_10_episodes_8ee3.html" title="List of Ben 10 episodes">List of Ben 10 episodes</a>. But deletion? Nope. If you want other content, see if that can be added. Especially for the premiere episode, which could have a lot of information come out about it. Has this show been released on DVD with a directory's commentary? That would be quite useful in adding more content. But seriously though, if this is about a general issue, then it's important to note that isn't just an issue which would impact one series, but literally dozens. I suggest taking it to the Village Pump instead. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
