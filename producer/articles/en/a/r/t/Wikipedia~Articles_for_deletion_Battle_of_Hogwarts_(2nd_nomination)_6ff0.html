<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. The arguments made for deletion are thorough, compelling and cogent. The arguments made for keeping signally and uniformly fail to address a single point the deleters make. One of them even <i>agrees</i> on one of the substantive points! For the votecounters, even if I count every single vote, there's still well more than the two-thirds level and with any kind of commonplace treatment, it'd be higher still. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:40, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I’m renominating <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hogwarts_ed85.html" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> for <b>deletion</b>. I have stated most of these concerns on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Hogwarts_b4d1.html" title="Talk:Battle of Hogwarts">talk page</a> months ago but they have not been responded to. I’ll recap the highlights here.</p>
<p>First, I feel that a sufficient summary of the book exists on <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter">Muggles’ Guide to Harry Potter</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a> as well as the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikicities.com" class="external text" title="http://harrypotter.wikicities.com" rel="nofollow">Harry Potter Wiki</a> which are the appropriate places for a book summary which literally tries to include every substantive detail. I believe that not only is the article name non-canonical but the framing of this part of the book as a "battle" constitutes POV <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, essentially providing a blank check for fans to add non-canonical analysis and interpretations of the text.</p>
<p>I'll refrain from calling it "Potter-cruft" (but it is You-Know-What). In the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Battle_of_Hogwarts_95cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Battle of Hogwarts">first vote</a>, the result was no consensus; the key vote there was <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> who felt that the <i>material</i> belonged on wikipedia even if the <i>article</i> didn't. As I've stated above, the content is on wikipedia in other appropriate places.</p>
<p>There are three main arguments against deletion. The first is precenent: <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Battle of Endor</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Pelennor_Fields_69e5.html" title="Battle of the Pelennor Fields">Battle of the Pelennor Fields</a>, as well as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Windmill_%28Animal_Farm%29_44b0.html" title="Battle of the Windmill (Animal Farm)">Battle of the Windmill</a> all have articles, and the last article is a non-canonical name. I am fine with all of these articles, but I would like to point out that the key distinction is that the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Windmill_%28Animal_Farm%29_44b0.html" title="Battle of the Windmill (Animal Farm)">Battle of the Windmill</a> is canonically agreed to as a <i>battle</i> even if there is no definite name for it. That is clearly not the case with the Battle of Hogwarts. There is just as much justificaiton for making the end of HBP a battle as for making Battle of Home Alone for the end of the film <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Alone_1df3.html" title="Home Alone">Home Alone</a>.</p>
<p>The second is that this is an important part of the plot. That may be true, but this is not the proper method of article forking. The proper process should be to put all the plot content in the main article for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a>. Then, if there an overflow of notable plot details there the daughter article of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince plot should be created. However, the apparent community consensus judging by the first six books is that the main article should contain a shorter plot summary with a more detailed one in the Muggles' Guide.</p>
<p>The third argument is that this content is too long to be merged into the main article. That concern collapses into the second one which I have addressed above. However, I would like to add that part of the reason for the extreme length of this article is that the arbitrary format of a "battle" imposed on it. If this article were reduced to a mere plot summary, it would be shorter. And of course, even then, this would be an innapropriate method of content forking.</p>
<p>Please do not simply vote <b>merge</b> on this article unless you have read both articles and personally intent to merge the contests. Merges have been proposed in the past on multiple occasions but they are never followed through on and the merger notice is removed hourly by vandals. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 20:51, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Note</b> Don't know wnough to vote on this but if, as the article itself says, "the series of events are never referred to as the 'Battle of Hogwarts' in the books", the title/concept would surely have to have achieved a <i>lot</i> of currency to be legitimate. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 21:00, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree with Flapdragon. The <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbit_of_Caerbannog_6559.html" title="Rabbit of Caerbannog">Rabbit of Caerbannog</a> from <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail_3131.html" title="Monty Python and the Holy Grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></i> is better known as the "Vorpal Bunny" (a name never mentioned in the film), because the name gained currency that way. If everyone's calling it "The Battle of Hogwarts" even if the name isn't mentioned in the book, that's a sign that it's significant enough to become noteworthy on its own. As for myself, I don't have a vote on it one way or another.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 21:09, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sigh. I'm a fan of the books too, but as far as Wikipedia is concerned, this is definitely Pottercruft. <b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Avra deleta</b>. Battle is such a strong word. Scuffle, maybe, or altercation. Call this a battle and you'd call closing time in Southampton a battle. Seriously though, non-canon name for one scene that is covered elsewhere in wikipedia. Un-needed and unlooked for splitting.
