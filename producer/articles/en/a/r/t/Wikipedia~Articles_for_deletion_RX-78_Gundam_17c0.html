<dd>Actually, the only refs in the article at the time IslaySolomon made his comment were links to a Japanese language encyclopedia's book sales page on Amazon.co.jp. Since Islay made his comment, further reference links have been added, but these do not show "cultural influence" <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 15:24, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Obviously you did not read anything at all. Having appearance in another anime is good enough to be cultural influence, not to mention the Pepsi cap collection, garage kit model by independent parties and following series using its name <b>Gundam</b> as a subtitle for a series of mecha. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 15:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually I did read the references - being one part in a video game which is about anime robots anyway, being a "cameo" in another cartoon, and being part of a Pepsi promo campaign involving gundam toys are not I would call "cultural influence". You really need to tone down the attitude, if you want to persuade people by the way <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:00, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then what is this "cultural influence" references you are seeking for, you name it, I will show it to you. I am tired of me showing a bunch of references and deletionist keep saying those are not cultural references. BTW, the Sgt. Frog appearance is not just cameo, the main character in that series built a model of RX-78 and even got a suit that is exactly like RX-78(only the head is removed so that Keroro himself could be place there instead). This is enough to show "cultural influence" of this specified mecha as an cultural icon in anime for me. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 16:10, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>See <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simpsons.html#Cultural_impact" title="Simpsons">Simpsons#Cultural_impact</a> for an example of a sensible and substantive cultural influence/impact section. Promotional toys, video games that are directly about anime robots and a minor appearance in a cartoon ("cameo" was a term used by whoever wrote that part of the article, not just me) are things which belong in a other appearances in pop culture trivia section, and are not evidence that this robot has influenced other cultural activities in a substantial, meaningful way. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:12, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Two part&#160;!vote</b> For the "real life" section - properly reference and contextualize the claims to be a cultural icon by the end of this afd. If this is done - keep. If not, then delete. For the "In fiction" section-which-is-actually-an-excuse-for-a-mountain-of-unencyclopedic-fancruft - delete all the robot descriptions and pictures i.e. 95-100% of this section. Actually, since this robot thingy is NOT REAL, the whole point of an "In Fiction" section is somewhat misleading.

They should be the ones cleaning up this crap, yet I've never seen anything in this project ever get merged.

<dd>The X-Wings and the Millennium Falcon are very major spaceships and plot points in <i>Star Wars</i>. Even non-fans who have only seen the movies once over a decade ago know what they are, if not the specific technical details. On the other hand, non-fans of Gundam have never heard of this RX-78 Gundam thingy or the other thingamajigs mentioned in the template, and even after reading the article, it is hard to see what makes one of these robots more notable than another. <i>Star Wars</i> <b>does</b> include a number of vehicles and characters that are by far not notable enough for Wikipedia - you only have to read one of the "Ultimate Guide" books to see them. But saying "if you delete Golden Era Mecha Mobile Suit EVA XYZ-123(R) Mark II+ prototype (which was only ever seen once in one episode) then you should delete the Enterprise-E too" is simply a knee-jerk response from the Gundam fandom. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 11:24, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then its a case of clean up, not deletion. The RX-78 Gundam is the primary mecha in the First Gundam series. It is as notable as the examples I've given, without the Gundams, there is no show. Your ignorance of Japanese pop culture&#160;!= non-notability. This is a case of systemic bias, a focus on English language topics and the subsequent removal of ones from other cultures due to blatant ignorance. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 11:34, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The point is that things have gotten so out of hand with these articles that something needs to happen, something drastic. Transwiki it all, then slowly work back in the notable stuff. It will be a hell of a lot easier that way, and nothing will actually be lost. I can see the argument for the RX-78 having an article here, but then a lot of the article's content needs to be cut and trimmed. If we can propose a convincing plan of transwiki / mass-cruft cleanup, then I'm sure we'll be given more time before any final deletion decision.

<dd>Not being a Gundam fan, I did not know the RX-78 Gundam was the primary mecha of the First Gundam series.

<dd><b>Comment</b> and again, people who obviously have nothing to do decided to choose the path of deleting things that <b>they have no idea in</b> instead of <b>improving the articles about fields they are expert of</b>. This is wikipedia, we should not just go around and point at articles saying it is not worth while in it, instead, we should improve the articles in order to make it worth while. Yes, if somebody created a page of totally self generated original thought, we nominate it for deletion, that is what this process is for. However, nominating a cultural icon of some other country is simply just ignorant and arrogant. Face it, Anime has became a major cultural impact in a lot of countries, Gundam is always on the top of the list within Japan, whether you like it or not. RX-78 carries equal cultural impact if not more than <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-Wing_3d05.html" title="X-Wing">X-Wing</a> of Star Wars, it deserves to have its own page and <b>having a badly written page is never an excuse and reason for deletion</b>. To those who think that the WP:Gundam people are responsible for this, <b>it is not</b>. The project was not even called Gundam a few months ago. I agree that some of those articles in the list of Mecha should not stay, but going through hundreds of articles takes time and WP:Gundam people <b>are not professional wiki editors</b>, <b>We have a life to live</b>. From this every nomination, we can see that how ignorant people come to vote without even trying to understand the articles at all. <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a> up there is an excellent example. The article provide source, another anime showing the Mecha itself in it is enough evident of the impact on cultural impact, not to mention there is a <i>RX-78 4 blade Shaver</i> sold in Japan and Pepsi Caps collection. <b>Stop being ignorant</b> Gundam is not just any robot anime you see everywhere, <b>and deletionist ignoring the facts are <i>NOT</i> an excuse of the article does not contain any references</b>. I understand these nomintations can <b>never have any consensus</b> because <b>deletionists keep ignoring sources or keep raising the par higher and claim everything shown is not a reference</b> while <b>editors of the article need to waste all their time to defend one article so that they cannot improve other articles before some other deletionist nominate them for deletion</b>. <b>Understand the situation</b> People of the WP:Gundam wasted so much time on these AfD noms and have so little time in improving the actual articles. <b>Stop your nominations, start actually improving articles</b> <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 14:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're own obvious bias comes out pretty strong. Let's break your argument apart, starting with the overarching theme: <i>there is no cabal or conspiracy who is trying to delete manga/Gundam related articles! <b>This is about notability, nothing more!</b></i> That being said: <i>RX-78 carries equal cultural impact if not more than <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-Wing_3d05.html" title="X-Wing">X-Wing</a> of Star Wars, it deserves to have its own page and having a badly written page is never an excuse and reason for deletion</i>- frankly false. Wow. It's big in Japan. Just because it's successful commercially doesn't a notable article make. And your statement is stupid, I'm sorry. Quick google check for RX-78: 719,000 hits. Results for x-wing: <b>1,530,000</b>.<br /></dd>
<dd>Next. <i>but going through hundreds of articles takes time and WP:Gundam people <b>are not professional wiki editors</b>, <b>We have a life to live</b>.</i>- true. But if these articles are never going to get fixed from the craptastic situation they are in now, why keep them?<br /></dd>
<dd><i>and deletionist ignoring the facts are</i> NOT <i>an excuse of the article does not contain any references</i>- um... no idea what you were saying, grammar check?<br /></dd>
<dd><i>Stop your nominations, start actually improving articles</i>- um... I suggest you follow your own advice.

<dd><i>"Wow. It's big in Japan. Just because it's successful commercially doesn't a notable article make."</i> Actually it does become notable, especially when that success has lasted for decades generating several spin-offs, model kits, and etc. But then to go on and say that it isn't notable because it wasn't that popular in the US or other English language country reeks of <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a>.</dd>
<dd><i>"And your statement is stupid, I'm sorry. Quick google check for RX-78: 719,000 hits. Results for x-wing: 1,530,000".</i> But the problem with the Google test here is that the mecha in question isn't going to be called the "RX-78", but "Gundam" instead. In this case, the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html#Google_test" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Google test</a> is unlikely to yield results that are anywhere close to being accurate.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The references appear only to include the instruction books, so the article fails the requirement of "multiple independent reliable and verifiable sources." This much obsessive detail about technical specifications of fictional armaments is fine for a specific wiki devoted to the fictional universe, but has no place in a real-world encyclopedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Newtype is a reliable source for anime; it's one of the most important magazines covering the topic. Being in Japanese does not make it unreliable. (There's an English edition, actually, though I haven't checked whether it has the same articles -- I doubt it, since the releases aren't the same.) A cover feature story in Newtype is to anime what a cover story in Entertainment Weekly is to Hollywood. As for not showing cultural influence, I can only presume you are unaware of the extent to which anime and manga permeate Japanese popular culture. Something on the lines of 80% of published material in Japan is manga, and they're not aimed solely at children. Personally, I despise most of Gundam and its knockoffs, but there's no question that it's been among the most influential anime series ever produced. The article the two of you are discussing makes that clear: It's a retrospective which includes a series of drawings by an apparently-famous artist (whose name, I'm afraid, I can't read; I'm rather weak on the name kanji). There's also a section dealing with <i>Z Gundam</i>, which presumably is (or was when this hit the stands) the current show in the series. And one dealing with the theme song of that show, which seems to have catapulted the group singing it to some degree of stardom. Definite impact -- but then, I'd think the fact that "the series [is] still being produced in one form or another" after 30 years would make that clear. And this particular mecha is more or less the symbol of the metaseries. It's as notable within its series as the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship_Enterprise_3c8f.html" title="Starship Enterprise">Starship Enterprise</a> or the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Falcon_baaa.html" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a> are within theirs -- in fact, it's more so (the Enterprise and the Falcon didn't spawn huge arrays of spin-offs). The difference is that many editors are not familiar with Gundam as they are with Star Trek or Star Wars -- cultural bias, essentially. Not, mind you, a bad-faith bias against the article itself, but a lack of perception of just how important in Japanese popular culture this series and this specific mobile suit are. I don't even <i>like</i> most of Gundam, and I naturally lean deletionist, but there's not a question in my mind that the delete&#160;!voters in this case are mistaken. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 20:37, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> It's not so much the cultural impact (or lack thereof) that keeps bugging me, it's the obsession about the detailed tech specs. The fact that the RX-78 Gundam is a central item or character in an anime series that enjoys huge popularity in Japan is encyclopedic. A list of episodes it appears in is encyclopedic. A brief description of how a pilot would use it in battle is encyclopedic. But half a page full of numbers about how much the fictional metal armour weighs, how many horsepowers the fictional engine has, how long its fictional fingers are, a list of fictional model ID numbers of the fictional bullets it uses as ammunition is not encyclopedic. Such things are of interest only in a Gundam-specific wiki, where people can look them up from an in-universe POV, not from an out-of-universe POV that we have here in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 16:32, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply to Comment</b> If you look at the "improved" article, you'll see the specs have been removed. Even prior to this, fantasy specs are just as valid to those interested in the war-machine as they would be to say, someone looking up the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-15.html" title="F-15">F-15</a>. Do we really need to include the number, type and output of them? No. But I've yet to see a reason why not that doesn't simply boil down to "I don't like it". Its more encyclopedic to include stats for warships, even fictional ones, than it is not. These are weapons and not describing their capabilities in combat makes the articles incomplete. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 16:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Reply. The problem is, if a part of the article should be deleted, it does not belong to an AfD, instead, it should be brought upon in the article's talk page or the project talk page(since all of these mecha have these data). Also, I see no reason for not tagging in some of the information since those things never have the notablity to have their own articles, and they surely have some impact related to the series itself(For example, the output power is generally increasing throughout the whole Universal Century timeline). The specs are even written by a third party to begin with (Gundam Century itself was written by fans, published by Midori Kobou instead of Bandai or Sunrise) but just later adopted by official publisher. Meaning it is good encyclopedic sources of impact. Maybe more of these should be added in, but it will lengthen the spec part into what the original specs are and who they got changed thoughout the years, and I cannot add in any OR meaning not much could be written. The specs are there so that people have at least the slightest idea of how these fictional things perform. I personally don't care if these are kept or not because I know more places for these things, but obviously quite a large number of fans enjoyed it being here. These should be discussed in the project page instead. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 16:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is the defining mecha for more than three different TV series, several more mini-series, movies and books spanning more than 25 years of continuous history.

As for real-world significance, how about presence the dozens of model kits (of this particular one)? In fact, the gundam modeling community significantly different from the military scale modeling community, especially where I live. And as has been said, the RX-78 and the gundam series as a whole is a Japanese cultural icon. I won't go into details but essentially, the mecha itself and the series changed the direction of Japanese animation significantly. While it can be argued that not all mobile suit models deserve their own page (I agree with this), this one (RX-78) definitely does. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 21:16, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> How, specifically, does one prove that a movie or series is a "cultural icon"? How does one establish that <b>Star Trek</b> is a cultural icon? If you say by citing the amount of merchandizing, spin-offs, satirizing, documented influences, longevity, and etc., then Gundam is a shoe in. And since the RX-78 Gundam is a major element of the Gundam series, it actually passes <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> for inclusion. Buy why is substantiate if it is cultural icon necessary for inclusion to begin with? Granted that the article could use more sources, but as it stands at the moment, it is better sourced the most other articles on facial elements and characters. And with the recent cleanup, it's is a lot better off in regards to the "in-universe" perspective then similar articles of franchises that are more familiar to English editors. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 21:39, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>And cleanup</i>. This particular 'Gundam', 'Mech', or 'Armored suit', is the central robot of a number of franchised series. I think that template needs more pruning than my garden, and I think that most of the other suits should be merged and trimmed with extreme editorial prejudice for citation and bare-bones notation, perhaps 'Mechs of Gundam Series(es)'. That said, I think that any number of editors would try to re-write or recreate it if removed, and salting on this topic would be to show significant wiki-bias against anime.

<li>Notability is <b>NOT</b> how the nominator dislike the article. RX-78 Gundam got equal screen time than some of the major characters in the show(Hey, BTW, the show is called <b>Gundam</b>) It can well be thought as a character, a major one. <i>Promotional toys, video games that are directly about anime robots and a minor appearance in a cartoon ("cameo" was a term used by whoever wrote that part of the article, not just me) are things which belong in a other appearances in pop culture trivia section, and are not evidence that this robot has influenced other cultural activities in a substantial, meaningful way.</i> Sorry, Bwithh, this is not the case. If an anime robot appeared in another anime, and that anime was made over 20 years later(1979~2003), it is not just a pop culture trivia event. BTW, pop culture is culture, influencing pop culture meaning it got the cultural significance that people can recognise the icon 20 years later. And anime robots appears in so many shows, there are thousands of them, why RX-78 Gundam? why not any other robot in any other show, say convoy, or X-Wing? why this old, plain looking piece? Or, why is this particular robot along with MS-06 Zaku appeared over and over again in so many different stories, including non-Gundam stories? How did it got its own Credit card like Yoda?

<p><i>and deletionist ignoring the facts are NOT an excuse of the article does not contain any references- um... no idea what you were saying, grammar check?</i> Deletionist ignoring references exsisted does not mean that the references does not exsist. Somebody in this nom said the whole ref section was just instruction manuals, which is totally false, linking to a page of Amazon is valid that <i>The book in question could be bought in that link</i>, the article sourced from a portion of those books. Deletionist not having read the book is not an excuse of the article is not referenced. The books listed is in fact not all published by official sources, the only dependent reference book is the <i>Gundam Officials</i> and <i>Ms encyclopedia</i>. The others are published by various magazine publishers and reviewers, which are all not paid by the Gundam copyright holder company Bandai, or paid for any information from the company. These are called <i>independent sources</i>. I know some deletionist do not hold credit for fan written articles as sources, but a well established publisher publishing books having editors edit the articles is a good secondary source we can use in wiki. It does not matter if the writer is a fan or not, or the editors are fans or not, the fact is that they are independent workers and some third party company paid the publishing fee wishing to earn some money. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 09:39, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

The book's name having Gundam <i>does not</i> mean it is primary, and dependent. Also, wikipedia never have a par so high that only changing the language serve as a cultural influence, changing the whole modeling industry(and economy) itself is significant enough.(Where this is quoted from Sgt.

Wikipedia policy asks for sources of that field of expert, not from any other field and what is listed here are that field of expert in anime. You can never find a geographic magazine with anime related articles, right? Stop being unreasonable, the sources are not only verifiable, they are also perfectly valid according to wikipedia.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Highly notable -- it's practically a main "character" of its series, and has had a lasting influence on the metaseries. The RX-78-2 is iconic. The article is referenced, has independent sources, and covers out-of-universe topics. Some of the mobile-suit articles probably should be deleted or merged or what have you, but this is not a good test case.

Its exhibit sections consists of two parts, Character World and Gundam Museum. Though closed at August 31, 2006 you can say that Gundam is important one, at least for Bandai, as the third biggest toy company. I do not know for other people, but part of most my time reading encyclopedia, I look for something that I did not know before, and some may interest me , some not, that why I love random article menu. Here, of course I may have something that I <s>do not</s> know, I may share it. I believe that sharing is one of the most important feature in wikipedia, right? It is sharing that makes our wikipedia different from other encyclopedia. I admit that sharing is a double-edged sword. Some may talk about something which other may have no interest of them, some may talk about rubbish idea, and so on. As consequences, there also special interest groups who work and talk about that group, as Gundam Fan. Seeing gundam aired in America, at least there are prospects which make Bandai want to sell them there. Of course there are materials not available to non-japanese speaking "viewer". If they want to know more, I think Wikipedia is one of the good place to start for. They may realizes "oh there are these" and "there are those". That is why I insist to include many things seems not important for ignorant people, also per my global view as inclusionists. Well, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Roche_limit.html" title="Roche limit">Roche limit</a> may not important for common people but for astronomers, it is different. Well, if you think that non-fiction is not that important, don't forget that often we achive something from dreams offered by non-fiction. Alas, in my head actually a crazy idea is spinning, it is idea for splitting the Wikipedia into non-fiction and fiction as different project. It may called Wikipedia and Wikifictionary or Wikidreams or whatever. Too many I have seen non fiction article conflict like this. Sorry, if any of you do not like my long argument.
