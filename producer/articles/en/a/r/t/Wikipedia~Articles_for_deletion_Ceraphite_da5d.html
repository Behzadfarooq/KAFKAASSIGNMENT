The title of the abstract is "Ceraphite, a hard and high-strength new carbon material". The abstract is cited all of zero times.

<dd>Abstract: The surface resistance to damage of homogeneous hard carbons such as glassy low temperature isotropic pyrolytic (LTI) and Ceraphite carbons have been determined by the falling abrasive particle test using SiC grit. Surfaces prepared from within the bulk of the glassy carbon specimens exhibit wear resistance proportional to their microindentation hardness but material near their virgin surfaces shows a lower resistance to this low velocity impact wear. Both pure and silicon-alloyed LTI carbons and Ceraphite material show considerably greater wear than the bulk glassy carbons of the same hardness. However, all of the hard carbons exhibit much greater surface damage resistance than other materials of comparable hardness such as mild steel or soda-lime glass. Microscopic surface examination indicates that brittle fracture is the main wear mode of the hard carbons in this test and the results are interpreted in terms of the microstructural features and characteristic elasticity properties of these solids.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Um, nn allotrope? No, I suppose that won't do. How's this - the article is doomed to remain non-encyclopedic, because all sources repeat the same few short sentences about it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article was started in Dec. 2004, so it seems pretty clear (at least to me) that the Wikipedia article was derived from one of these sources and not vice versa. It also seems pretty clear that this is not a hoax, as the Los Alamos National Laboratory uses the term <a href="http://periodic.lanl.gov/downloads/PeriodicWebSite.pdf" class="external text" title="http://periodic.lanl.gov/downloads/PeriodicWebSite.pdf" rel="nofollow">here (pdf)</a> and UC Berkeley does so <a href="http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/chips_epo/carbon.htm" class="external text" title="http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/chips_epo/carbon.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (giving the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics and the American Chemical Society as the sources for the page). I agree that there is little in the primary literature, but we must remember that most of the databases of scientific articles only include articles dating back to the early '90s and there is no quick way to do thorough search on such an obscure topic. So, I vote to keep, because although obscure, an allotrope of carbon is quite notable and encyclopedic. <a href="../../../b/t/m/User%7EBtm_d07f.html" title="User:Btm">Btm</a> 05:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Both <i>Carbon</i> and <i>Wear</i> are awfully obscure Elsevier journals. Also note that the papers that go into <i>Wear</i> don't deal with the difficult subject of metastable phases in the phase diagram of carbon. The word isn't mentioned once in an ACS journal. As the editor who put the article up still hasn't put a source to back up his claim the entry ought to go; too many people have already wasted their time with it. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 14:11, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have done some more digging, which should settle the question. Ann. Rev. Mater. Sci. 1973, 3, 195 mentions the mineral chaoite as a recently discovered carbon allotrope. The article then continues to say claims were made than an identical material is prepared by subliming graphite at high temperature and low pressure. "In spite of these seemingly definitive reports ... several other groups have tried unsuccessfully to reproduce these experiments. Independent confirmatory work is obviously needed in this area, and at the present time white graphite appears to be the carbon analog of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polywater.html" title="Polywater">polywater</a>. <b>Delete and redirect to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaoite.html" title="Chaoite">chaoite</a></b>, or get rid of the spurious phase altogether. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 14:31, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but rewrite to cite the sources listed above, and document the confused nature of the primary literature, adn the absence of a clear source for the current description. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:34, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, definately. This was the article that lead me to learning of Ceraphite and if we delete this page we may as well remove it completely from the Carbon page as well. Also, with advancing scientific research we should soon be able identify a mollecular structure for it and maybe even get some pictures of it. Also there is no proof that ceraphite is chaoite. It says chaoite is grey or white whereas ceraphite is white, no mention of gray. User:Rickem
<ul>
<li>There is no proof that ceraphite even exists. It is mentioned in two conference abstracts, and the review cited in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaoite.html" title="Chaoite">chaoite</a> entry cautions that those reports were not reproducible at all. IIRC, chaoite is a carbyne phase. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 00:21, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
