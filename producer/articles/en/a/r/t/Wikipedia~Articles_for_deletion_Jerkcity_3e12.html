<li><b>Comment</b>. Right at the top of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> it says this. <i>"This page is a notability criteria guideline for Wikipedia, reflecting how the authors of this encyclopedia address certain issues. This guideline is intended to help you improve Wikipedia content. Feel free to update this page as needed, but please use the discussion page to propose major changes."</i>. I'm pretty sure that means it's official. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></sup> 01:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>False</b>. Policies are official. Guidelines are not. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 03:30, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Guidelines are made up by the community, and can be edited by anyone; they are not official policy. Verifiability is policy. Neutral point of view is policy. Notability is a guideline, not policy. Nowhere in <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDELETE_1b88.html" title="WP:DELETE">WP:DELETE</a> is Notability listed as a valid criteria for deletion. I realize that you guys do it everyday anyway, but that doesn't make it right. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriochiv_1456.html" title="User:Ariochiv">Ariochiv</a> 08:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WP:WEB isn't a policy per se, but it's nevertheless cited by many people as a keep/deletion rationale. The very outcome of many deletion debates may hinge on that. I'd say if you want to reject specific notability criteria, you have to then explain <i>what other criteria you use to explain to keep the stuff;</i> if you reject a long-standing guideline that's cited by a lot of people as it is, you have to find other footing to stand on. We're open to ideas, of course, it's just that WP:WEB happens to represent a bunch of rather well-tried ideas. So I'd like to ask is this: If you reject notability criteria, what else do you propose we do to stop us from being flooded with completely insignificant content? How do you help people from telling apart wheat and chaff? How do you help people find the <i>remarkable</i> content? If you yank the carpet from under our feet, you need to put another carpet in its place or people will keep slipping around on the bare floor.<br />
Also be aware that AfDs that manage to change the established procedures are few and far between - you probably need some excellent deletion-lawyering to wriggle out of this one... <i>meanwhile</i>, I propose you edit the article to say how it fulfills the <i>current</i> criteria for inclusion. You won't change people's opinions overnight - or within timespan of a single AfD debate. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> yes, I've heard of this, too, I think it's a wonderful comic, but we aren't building an encyclopedia of wonderful things we've heard of. No, this does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> which is a guideline. It also doesn't meet our official <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> policy "Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy." "If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it."

<li><b>Comment</b>. This nomination is honestly in good faith. I took a look at the article, the external links, etc and didn't see any claims of notability. Take a look at other highly notable webcomics; <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> for example states in the first paragraph that it <i>ranks among the most popular webcomics, and is the best selling original English-language manga</i>. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerkcity.html" title="Jerkcity">Jerkcity</a>, on the other hand, makes no assertions of notability. That's why I nominated it. To clarify, I'm not saying all articles need to be as notable as Megatokyo, but they need to assert some form of notability. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></sup> 06:14, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't mean to nitpick, but this is the entire part of the article about JerkCity: "Exploitation Now and Jerkcity mix pop-cultural criticism with dark, often sexual humor."

<li>I agree that it's a trivial mention, but even a trivial mention in a major media source is enough to demonstrate that the article's subject exists, which takes the "delete it, it's unverified, violating WP:V" idea out of bounds. That mention isn't enough to establish notability, of course, so you could still advocate deletion on those grounds, if that's how you feel. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 12:51, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> One of the most popular comics published on the web, it's been around for a number of years, still manages to publish daily after thousands of strips, and is pretty much the only place to find any insightful commentary about the internet era, in my opinion. Plus I like the jokes about sodomy.172.166.72.120 21:47, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm late to the debate, but this is a no-brainer. Verifiably notable, long-running webcomic that is, dare I say it, a part of net history. And I own the book. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolpo_125b.html" title="User:Polpo">Polpo</a> 02:49, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>Neutral</s>Conditional keep</b> (as long as it passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>'s first test. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines specify three criteria. If any one of these is satisfied, the article passes the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> test. My feeling is that to resolve this debate in favor of keeping the article, we should focus on (1), as this is Jerkcity's strongest case for notability. I think Jerkcity will have trouble passing /2 and /3, the former because I have not seen any mention of awards for the site in this discussion, and the latter because of the requirement that sites that show the work be independent of the creators of the work. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippy_339a.html" title="User:Zippy">Zippy</a> 03:00, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
