<li><strike><b>Keep</b> a 20 year old published comic, judged as a webcomic. Selfpublished doesn't hold it when it makes it to (Australian) real-life stores. They don't just take anything non-notable. There is so much wrong with that I can't even start to mention.

<dd>Any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> sources for any of this? 20 years old? Comixpedia says nothing about this<a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Terinu" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Terinu" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I can't seem to find it on the homepage<a href="http://www.terinu.net/Author.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.terinu.net/Author.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, which does confirm that it's self published and only available in a few specialist stores). Longevity, even if confirmed, is not a reason to keep.

<dd>In that case, a verifiability note would have come in handy. There's no word on that being untrue, it's just said it's considered non-notable (with the given information).

<dd>Yeah, well, the "twenty year" claim only stems from the supposed launch date in the infobox on the right, not from the main text, and so I at first missed that: otherwise I would have commented on it in my nomination.

<dd>"Terinu" is a significant, long-running Australian print comic that has been on sale regularly for many years, before it was a webcomic and before it was made available through Lulu. It was also included in the book "Operation Funnybone." Failure to win Awards in Australia should not be regarded as having any weight, as the Ledgers are fledgling (2 years so far) and controversial. It should definitely be retained in the Wikipedia! Ian T (in Australia) 12 February 2007</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, based on references added to article which I believe serve to satisfy the critricism that it doesn't meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Article needs a big hit with a cleanup stick though, but afd is not clean-up. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 18:22, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It would be rather hard for this to <i>only</i> be published through Lulu if it's been around in print since 1986. Fram, please investigate the subject better before putting up an AFD. Ian, can you provide any links or details about this? This may meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> after all, but it's hard for me to be sure. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 09:19, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Addendum: <b>Keep</b> based on the added sources now that I've re-reviewed the article. I count multiple independent and presumably reliable sources, which means that it meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. I would question classing this as a webcomic seeing as the print form seems to be much better known than the online form. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 09:22, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Pardon me, but which and where are the new sources removing all doubt? I saw the <i>Operation Funnybone</i> publication when I initially looked into this, but as it struck me as a bit-part inclusion in a charity publication, and I could hardly see it as <i>one of the mulitple reliable non-trivial independent etc..</i> (I have certainly seen similar publications containing contributions noone would use to establish notability). The other listed paper reviews, <i>Inkspot</i> and <i>OzComics</i> are.. well, whatever they are. Good faith ought to give time for these sources to become useful to the article, and I will neutralise my consensus flag, but what has yet, strictly speaking, changed? What in this article, apart from a Funnybone participation, is and will be <i>verifiable</i>? —<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1">M</font><font size="-3">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 12:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Whatever they are" being magazines about comics. A review is a non-trivial mention for an arts topic, and the sources seem (from what little I can dig up about them) to be independent, reliable, and published, which is what <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requires. (Being circulated outside Australia, or available online, are not conditions applicable to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.) That said, the article as written <i>does</i> need an awful lot of cleanup. It's an interesting contrast between this article and Greeneyes, which I've suggested does not meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> in its AFD; the Greeneyes article is fairly well-written, while this one is utterly awful. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 12:38, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Inkspot, as far as I can tell, is the members magazine / bulletin of the ACA, and isn't for sale. I wasn't able to check the Terinu review, since it appeared in #40 (not 41 as the article says), and only issues #41 and later are available online. It is a borderline case for a reliable source indicating notability (assuming the review is substantial, which I believe it is). The review was written by Ian Thomas, a comics creator and enthousiast, and also a contributor to Funnybone, and also a reviewer for Ozcomics, which makes me wonder if he has also written the Terinu review in that magazine (just a hunch, no way to confirm this for me). This would mean that the multiple independent reviews are not so independent after all... Can anyone shed some light on this? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:04, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I move that we extend discussion to answer Fram's question. Fram is not alone in thinking this may be critical. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 01:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not critical for me. Verifiability, a policy, is satisfied. Notability, a guideline, may not be. On which should we place the greater emphasis? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 10:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
