Even though I'm a strong keep for the latter, we don't necessarily need to cover all the gender/race/religion/sexual orientation/etc. combinations if we cover one in order to be fair or comprehensive, so it wouldn't be tragic to lose this. My feeling is that since "bands" are dominated by men, this is a bit like list of male mathematicians, where it is more convenient to list only the exceptions rather than the rule. <font size="-2">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</font> 00:54, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As said, to vague. The definition used is non-standard, and open to much dispute (e.g. including/excluding based on use of instruments).

The influence of this club can be seen in their structured mentoring program for gifted individuals, which fosters intellectual, spiritual and physical growth. They are an active participant in many events and there are frequent references to them in community newspapers, street press and University communications. You don't have to spend long in <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> to hear a story about a good deed they've done or a function they've organised. This organisation has been involved in the running and organisation of the prestigious Cascade Cup. Including rowing to several notable victories. They are known to stand for the strict maintenance of rules and standards in inter Varsity 'rograms. Most of the comments posted above seem to come from well intentioned but illinformed users from the other side of the globe. I appreciate their input and it's understandable that patent attorneys from the US would have little understanding of the cultural significance of such an organisation. The page stays because it contributes positively to the World of knowledge that is Wikipedia. <small>unsigned vote by: 165.228.46.130 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_165.228.46.130_001b.html" title="Special:Contributions/165.228.46.130">contribs</a>)</small></p>

<p><b>Save</b> It is clear to me that this article should be well and truly retained. The use of the term 'sockpuppetry' which all you deleters despise is just xenophobia towards people of the wider community intruding in on your little world. How many people do you think actually spend all their time critiquing websites? It makes sense that anonymous users should vote for this article, as it refers to and is known by people whose main concern is not the internet, or let alone wikipedia. Furthermore, comments like 'unverifiable' really pertain to the effort applied and the access to such knowledge. A quick search on google, an american centric search engine, is hardly enough evidence to rule that something well known, significant and verifiable in the city of Adelaide Australia, doesn't exist. The enthusiasm of some of the'sockpuppets' while over done, is indicative of the very real existence and influence of this club. The article editor obviously thought that Wikipedia was a global repository of knowledge- which is not something that is only approved and seconded by a small esoteric community of close minded internet dwellers. <small>unsigned vote by: 202.20.20.129 (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.20.20.129.html" title="User talk:202.20.20.129">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.20.20.129_3f7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.20.20.129">contribs</a>)</small></p>

<p><b>Save.</b> It's a good thing that the Cyberjunkie knows everything about Adelaide, bow down before the mighty intellect of the all knowing and wise Cyberjunkie who is so learned that he ended up at Flinders Uni. It's safe to say that the intellectual powerhouse that is Flinders has produced some well informed individuals over the years, but CyberJunkie must be foremost amongst them becuase he knows everything about Adelaide. I think it's safe to say that CyberJunkie hasn't bothered doing any research other than going to the comic book store or tapping away at the keyboard. If Cyberjunkie bothered asking around, or even looking in a few local publications, they'd see many references to this organisation. In fact only a few months ago they featured live on channel 7's sunrise program. I suppose when you are hacking the internet and deleting wikipedia articles all night, you don't get up early enough to watch morning TV. The sort of subjective generalisations that CyberJunkie is making are reason enough to delete everything he's ever contributed to Wikipedia, but since i'm not a vindictive busy body, I've got better things to do than conduct some sort of Cyber terrorism against legitimate encyclopedic content. It's safe to say that a little bit of knowledge(Flinders Uni) in CyberJunkie's case is a bad thing.</p>

<p>How is this encyclopedia-worthy? There's plenty of porn directories on the net, Wikipedia doesn't need to be one. Also, listing her real name, residence, employer, and link to her blog seems like a great way to get this girl fired, harassed by stalkers or anti-porn zealots, etc. Her blog says she is unhappy with the extent of exposure she got. So she had a youthful lapse in judgement, one that she'll have following her for years. Wikipedia doesn't need to play a role in that. There's nothing of scholarly value in this page, and it seems unethical in the extreme to list some of this information in this context. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Murple" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Murple" rel="nofollow">-Murple</a></p>

Of course with a page history the damage has already been done unless someone can scrub it out...

<li>I vote strongly for deleting this article and similar ones... but if it must be kept, how's this for a compromise. Delete the article so the history disappears and the girl doesn't have to live in fear of some Wikipedia stalker tracking her down, and create a new one that only has the "relevant" information and not her personal information. It seems to me that if anything bad happened to this girl as a result of her info being listed here, Wikipedia would be potentially legally liable. As far as the excuse "well its in her blog"... her blog isn't being advertised with her Jordan Capri name, so it's not making the link between her identities that this Wikipedia entry did.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I take your point but my central problem is that this stub neglects to even tell us WHERE this company is located - after all this time on the cleanup list!

<li><b>Delete:</b> It's hard to take an article seriously when the main word is consistently misspelled. In any case, unless the claims are substantiated, accusations of plagiarism are slanderous. Stating in a public forum that someone is a thief isn't a good idea. If the article is kept, it should be reworded, as MCB said. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">Cory Maylett</a> 04:43, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless I can see some court cases or confessions on the part of the "guilty" party. Since songs are copyrighted, plagiarism is illegal and should have led to a legal process. If it didn't, the "victim" probably couldn't prove it himself, making it highly dubious as "fact". <a href="../../../u/s/r/User%7EUsrnme_h8er_fa7c.html" title="User:Usrnme h8er">Usrnme h8er</a> 08:27, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A court did find that George Harrison's "My Sweet Lord" plagiarised "He's So Fine" by The Chiffons, but I'm not convinced that either song counts as "rock". I couldn't comment about the other songs named, but successful plagiarism cases concerning popular music are surprisingly rare... it seems doubtful that there's much potential for a worthwhile article on the subject. In any case, this piece, for all the reasons above, would not be a strong basis for such an article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 11:16, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Conditional Delete</b> - I support the idea set forth by <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a>, but at this point there is nothing of value in this article that could be built upon. I can see some value in the subject matter though and my opinion is that it would be better to write up a Famous plagiarism cases in popular music article from scratch. There are several cases not mentioned here (like Led Zeppelin's Lemon Song) where songwriting credits were belatedly granted. A decent article could be written if someone wants to take the time to do some research--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:14, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. First, because of the word "rock" in the title. People will just add other sorts of songs and then fight over whether it's rock or not, rather than on the evidence of plagiarism. Second, because it is doubly specific in that sense — what if a rock song is taken from another non-rock song? Third, because this kind of information does not stand usefully alone: mention the fact in the subjects' articles where it will have context rather than extracting random bits of information into yetanotherlist. Better, write a proper article on plagiarism in popular music, and put some effort into talking about the questions that were/are raised, the progress of the court cases, the implications of law and jurisdictions, and digital rights management. Lists when there could be articles are excuses for not doing the encyclopedic job thoroughly. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:53, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You know, after visiting the <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami-Dade_County_Public_Schools_0d01.html" title="Miami-Dade County Public Schools">Miami-Dade County Public Schools</a> article I've pretty much changed my mind on this. When viewed by themselves as stand-alone entries, elementary school articles certainly seem like non-notable trivia. But when viewed as one of a collection of sub-pages, of sorts, for large school districts, the aggregate value does become important. For example, for someone moving a family to Miami, a comprehensive set of important details on the schools in the area could be a valuable resource. This kind of detail might be impractical in a print encyclopedia, but Wikipedia isn't print. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">Cory Maylett</a> 17:21, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. While schools amy not be donut shops, neither are they cathedrals, art galleries, ancient artifacts, or lost treasures. Because we have memorable experiences in schools does not make the institution itself memorable, and the real fact is that the vast majority of students attending a school have only vague recollections of it years later, a fact especially true for elementary schools. if Iknothetrth had continued reading the arguments for and against school articles, s/he would have seen the point that "Rows of things performing identical functions are not responsible for nor creditable with the individual experiences of that function." It is the <i>people</i> in schools who "play a large part in determining what kind of society we have": people who fail speedy deletion criterion A7 and would not even make it to AfD. Cory Maylett says "for someone moving a family to Miami, a comprehensive set of important details on the schools in the area could be a valuable resource". I think "could be" is warranted here. This school article, like just about every one that comes this way, is devoid of any useful information about the school except possibly for the external link. This article has no information about possibly notable instructors, possibly notable students, possible special or exceptional programs, any historical noteworthiness, not even how many students it serves. If I were looking for an informative article from Wikipedia about a school my son or daughter might be attending, I would surely be disappointed with this one.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and I question the wisdom of nominating so many schools at once. The nominator does not appear to have had time to research each school individually, and instead may be promoting a blanket policy of "no elementary schools are notable". This particular school was the first to desegregate in its area. Surely that's even more notable than the average school. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 13:58, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>When the article came up for deletion it was the usual trite stub with address, principal and school mascot. The paragraph on desegregation was added only after the article was nominated.

<li><b>Keep all</b> articles nominated by Dismas this day. All were nominated in bad faith. This is a copy/paste mass nomination. I don't have time to read, analyze, and vote for every one. It's absurd somebody can remove large content from wikipedia, by simply nominating quicker than others can vote to keep. TWhat's really sad, is recently there was a hoax school created by a senior user. It took a lot of time and investigation to prove it was a hoax. Of course, inicidents like that make me want to spend more time for each school, to verify it should be kept. But, now I have to either quickly vote for every school risking some bad ones are kept, or let a bunch of good ones be deleted.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm sure there are reliable sources on many of the neighborhoods on earth. Certainly, census and economic data is probably available. I know for a fact that crime-related information is provided on the internet on the Woodstock neighborhood (and every other neighborhood in Portland, Oregon). Much of this information is probably encyclopedic. The real question here would be how to go about including it, if that's what we want to do: Give each neighborhood a separate article, or include such information in city pages? -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 07:09, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, neighborhoods appear to be unknown to the US census. <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/home/en/epss/census_geography.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://factfinder.census.gov/home/en/epss/census_geography.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> In very many areas, "neighborhoods" are not well defined entities that enjoy official status. (Portland, Oregon appears to be exceptional in this respect). For example, {{<a href="../../../h/o/u/Template%7EHouston%2C_Texas_d9f5.html" title="Template:Houston, Texas">Houston,_Texas</a>}} seems confusingly and somewhat arbitrarily divided into "neighborhoods", "districts", and "communities", which overlap or are given contradictory locations (e.g. article on Little Saigon locates it along western Bellaire boulevard, while citing as support a source that describes its location in Midtown, a completely different part of town.) Whether a location is Montrose, or Neartown, or Museum District depends on who you ask. What constitutes a neighborhood can be highly subjective... so a goal of an encyclopedic article for every neighborhood on earth seems to be a strech. --66.101.59.18 09:07, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

This article is utterly devoid of any useful information much beyond what you could find in a phone book. It's a pathetic article no matter how you look at it.

<li>The editor is countering your comment that the company's idea "failed to go anywhere". That a very similar method is used by eCRUSH is relevant to assessing the notability of DoYouDo. Innovations that turned out to be complete dead ends would be less notable. We should have an article on an innovative company that once existed independently but has now been acquired by another (e.g., <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_Hill_d3a2.html" title="Avalon Hill">Avalon Hill</a>). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 02:00, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I know it was a third company. MatchNet acquired DoYouDo, while a different company eCRUSH, is using "a very similar method", as I wrote. It goes to the notability of the general subject area.

<li>That's not evidence of advertising. My style just happens to be that I focus attention on a particular subject until the project is complete. That is how I wrote four featured articles (although I think it would be tough for this subject to reach that level). Just to clarify for the record, <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.217.105.2.html" title="User:205.217.105.2">User:205.217.105.2</a> and this IP are the same user. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 00:41, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I know this is not particularly germane to the AfD discussion, but you might consider registering a real user name. This will make it easier for people to communicate with you, and be less confusing all around. Also (whether it is justified or not), people tend to give less weight to comments left by anonymous users. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 00:55, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Oh, well, creating an account works well in the long run, but in the short run, it looks like a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a>. Moreover, I keep telling myself, "I'm done with this wiki; let me just make this one last edit" but then I end up posting more stuff, yet never starting an account. So that explains the anon edits. True, I did change my mind a couple times about the notability of my own article, but that was because I was doing research and learning more information. Some new info I gathered made it look non-notable, and then further info made it look notable again. So that (partially) explains why I changed my vote. The other thing was that I changed my mind about certain comments, and also got offended at people calling my article "spam" and "just crap," and responding to my comments with what I regarded as <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attacks, so I decided to remove those comments. So that explains the removed comments. I guess when people see unusual behavior, they tend to assume the worst, but in this case it was just eccentricity and ambivalence. There is a little more to it, but you probably would find those other aspects of the situation incredible. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 01:37, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ah, I'll tell you anyway, to clear the waters. My name is Nathan Larson and I have been a Wikipedian since around October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, and written numerous articles, including <a href="../../../j/u/j/Jujyfruits.html" title="Jujyfruits">jujyfruits</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylisascaris.html" title="Baylisascaris">baylisascaris</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont_Geriatric_Hospital_e3af.html" title="Piedmont Geriatric Hospital">Piedmont Geriatric Hospital</a>, and four featured articles. For a long time, I was toying with the idea for an <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_matching.html" title="Anonymous matching">anonymous matching</a> system, and a few weeks ago, I finally decided it was time to implement it, and went about looking to patent it. In the course of my search, I stumbled across <a href="../../../d/o/y/DoYouDo_da62.html" title="DoYouDo">DoYouDo</a>'s patent, which was startlingly identical to my idea. Defeated, I gave up but decided to use the information I had gathered to write a Wikipedia article, so at least my research work would benefit the public. Then my article was put up for deletion and I naturally voted "Keep," because I found the idea intriguing. Around that time, I was gathering information (e.g. looking at the internet archive of the failed website DoYOU2.com) that made the company seem less notable; moreover, in the course of my research for the article, I exchanged emails with Gil Sudai, who offered to help me get in touch with the owners of the patent and arrange to purchase it. In an effort to reduce publicity that might bid up the price, I changed my vote to "Delete." However, I then found out that <a href="../../../e/c/r/ECRUSH_e476.html" title="ECRUSH">eCRUSH</a>, having introduced their own version of Sudai's system in February 1999, which was prior to the September 1999 registration of the patent, had been grandfathered in and therefore was able to run their competing (and dominant in the market) system without licensing the patent. That made the patent seem less attractive to me, and at the same time, I also realized that eCRUSH's success made the system DoYouDo implemented seem more notable, because it had been tried by another company successfully and thus wasn't just an idea that never caught on. So, I had a mix of selfish and unselfish motives, but the end result was the same, and that's how we got where we are. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 02:03, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As stated earlier, the editor's removal of earlier comments have made this discussion page hard to read, and have also downplayed his earlier zeal, which really did make this seem like an SEO/advertising push. I agree with Brenneman that with all of his antics going on here (he first protested the deletion, then came back and said that the article should be deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FDoYouDo&amp;diff=23700324&amp;oldid=23699564" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FDoYouDo&amp;diff=23700324&amp;oldid=23699564" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, and then removed all of his comments, and is again pushing to keep or merge the article), it's beyond the regular assumption of Good Faith. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 01:14, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>This company is part of the <i>history</i> of this form of matching, but, because it was acquired, it's no longer a player (at least in its own name).

<li>So what? The issue isn't assessing any particular user's conduct. The issue is what arrangement of the information will best serve the reader. For detailed background on a particular pioneering company in this field, the choices are: put it in an article about the company (linked to from the article about the field and from the article about the company that acquired the pioneer); include it in one of those other articles, where it would be clutter; or suppress the information entirely. I consider the first option to be the most useful for our readers. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 18:25, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Getting a patent doesn't make you a pioneer. and <b>B)</b> It's not a "company" in any sense outside the most legalistic, and never was. Did ever have any employees? Did it ever have an office? Did anyone ever sit in a DoYouDo cubicle and sob silently at the utter mundane hell of their existance?<br />

<li>The extent of cubicle sobbing and other such information can be included in the article. The issue for AfD isn't how much moral credit the corporation deserves as a pioneer, but whether it's notable enough that readers might want to know more about it. From that point of view, the issuance of a patent is relevant. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:53, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm more than a little suspicious - as Malo says, this same review is on Amazon's site. The reviewer has a single title to his credit with a review that cries out "copywriter". I really would like to feel a little more confident about the source of this text. But it may be a moot point: its Amazon rank shows this to be an obscure title at best, and as a new title, cannot claim any notability. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 02:31, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Time and again as I randomly browse Wikipedia I come across entries about <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katma_Tui_cc38.html" title="Katma Tui">obscure</a>, fictional <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilowog.html" title="Kilowog">people</a>, <a href="../../../q/w/a/Qward.html" title="Qward">places</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths_b4fc.html" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">events</a> (all of which add to Wikipedias touted 700k+ articles) and when I finally do encounter an article about an interesting, non-fictional person, it is put up for deletion. If articles are going to be deleted based on importance, then surely the Wikipedia database will be cut at least in half as I hope the previous examples demonstrated. As stated in your guidelines, Wikipedia "is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information" and the line between what should and what should not be in this encyclopedia is hazy. However if you are deleting articles that are deemed unimportant, frivolous and fictional articles should be trimmed first before real world facts. Dr. Pozefsky is an inspirational individual and an excellent mentor. Her entry into the database is a worthy addition with lots of room for expansion. Konrad</li>

<p>Response from author: At issue here is wether a discovery which has yet to be validated by the scientific community is indeed <i>Pseudo-science</i> or a discovery with merit that has yet to be validated by the scientific community and become part of common knowledge.</p>
<p>I argue that the entry should be allowed to facilitate discussions in this regard. It is possible that ultimately, the claim will be dismissed as fraudulent and the entry for ORMUS may then show this fact to the benefit of everyone. Alternatively, a new branch of physics is about to open up.

<li><b>Delete.</b> This will, of course, get voted down and the article will return to the messy, un-working status quo. I'm voting delete because I feel the POV is systemic enough that this needs to be scrapped and replaced with a better descriptor and NPOV content. From the second paragraph: "It should be noted that the term anti-Polonism has not found wide currency in the English language...To the extent that people believe that Poles, Polonia and Poland continue to be treated as objects of ridicule, discrimination and exploitation, "anti-Polonism" and the kindred term "Polonophobia" may enter more widespread use." Think through the logic of this for a moment. It's a senseless justification for what is effectively a neologism. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 11:55, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was already voted on.The result was keep. " From the second paragraph: "It should be noted that the term anti-Polonism has not found wide currency in the English language.." Why not following sentence&#160;? . It has, however, appeared in some scholarly works ([1])and is listed as subject in Polish National Library index[2] Btw your changes are wrong since it is in the dictionary in Polish National Library.You removed that sentence. Also they are scholary works on the issue:</p>

Is there are a clear rule on forward-slashes somewhere? It seem to me there should be a clear rule for new articles. If there's no problem with the forward-slash, than I would naturally support it's use. But, I don't know what "largely harmless" means. I originally thought they were't to be used, since they seem to imply temporary sub-pages; but now I'm not sure. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 17:09, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In some namespaces, such as Wikipedia: and User: the slash creates a subpage. This facility used to apply also to article-space, but has now been disabled in that namespace. A sub-page has an extra navigation to the parent page at the top. For instance this page is a subpage of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>, so a the top of the page you'll see a navigation that look like this:

<li>I should qualify my vote, as it's probably vain to want the article kept solely because of my own attendance there. It's a very large elementary school - well over 1000 students<a href="http://osi.fsu.edu/schoolrecognition02.nsf/2faf10520008614c85256d44005441b9/c9350aa81df8080185256cca005e084e?OpenDocument" class="external autonumber" title="http://osi.fsu.edu/schoolrecognition02.nsf/2faf10520008614c85256d44005441b9/c9350aa81df8080185256cca005e084e?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. It's also one of the oldest schools in the region (the cite states that it is "a 74 year old historical landmark"). Unlike many of my colleagues above, I don't believe all schools are inherently notable. However, I long ago announced what I consider criteria for notable schools, including considerable size, and being in operation since before World War II. This school meets both of those. I don't know what other elementary schools on this list would be considered notable by my standards, but this one surely is. Plus, I went there. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 02:52, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Blanket keep</b> all of the schools nominated by <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a>. The nominator clearly has not had time to research all of these schools, and doesn't provide any evidence of his claims. Even if one doesn't accept that all schools are notable, several of these schools make clear claims on notability and the others are simply stubs which must be thoroughly investigated to prove non-notability. There is insufficient time to expect editors to research so many schools at once. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a>

<li>This page is called <i>Articles for deletion</i>, and it's the article that is judged here.

<li>With all due respect, that is a pile of steaming horse-manure. All of today's nominations by <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a> are nothing more than a mass-deletion attempt, as a weak effort to continue this absurd war of attrition against school articles. No effort was taken by this nominator to determine anything on an article-by-article basis - clearly demonstrated by a later nomination against a secondary (middle) school where the same nominator states (yet again) "Non notable elementary school". He did not even bother to read that the school he was including in his mass-nomination wasn't even an elementary school. The defense of this mass-deletion attempt is nothing than the usual deletionist scorched earth attempt to get school articles deleted.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 21:26, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>In my own defense, I did read the Nautilus article, I'm aware that the locals refer to it as a "middle school". To me, grades 1-8 are elementary grades. I didn't copy and paste those words. To me, it's an elementary. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:58, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Obviously I don't think there is much of a defense for this mass-nomination, but there has to be some objective standard. Grade EIGHT is not "elementary" by any definition I have ever seen. But I suppose I can now say that I consider grade 4 as Post-Secondary by this standard. Also, I think it's <i>really'</i> commendable that you typed out "Non notable elementary school" on all 23 of your nominations. As if that makes any difference whatsoever.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:53, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Firstly, lack of notability is not a valid criteria for the deletion of school articles as per WP policy. Secondly, your claim that there is an "organised bunch of who regularly stack such votes" (no comment on grammar is necessary, I think) is both false and unsubstantiated. Please provide evidence that there is any such "bunch" who "stack such votes".

<li><b>Keep</b> this is more than just a stub. Also, you said "Non notable elementary school", which is the same thing you said in all the other noms. Except this is a *middle school*. Please at least *read* an article before nominating. Don't bother telling me the grades count as elementary elsewhere, since it's obvous you copy/pasted the *exact* same text every where. For some time now, I've been finding wikipedia really slow and non-responsive, meaning a save can take a minute or two, and often-times out. Often, I have leave it for several minutes or longer. Now, you've gone and nominated at least 22 schools in one day, and I would have to spend hours, if I wanted to vote against each. That's as bad as cheating. We shouldn't make decisions based on who's faster at the computer. That's why have rules like 3RR. Also, you're pushing others into doing the quick vote-without-thinking approach, which I resent greatly. I think all the noms for today by this nom, should be withdrawn as bad-faith, and the user prohibited from further for a period of time. I've seen automated vandals cause less damage than this. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:45, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't copy and paste the words "elementary school" in my nominations. And yes, to me grades 1-8 are elementary schools. The only thing I copy/pasted were the tags so that I didn't mistype the tag itself. I did read the articles. This one, though longer than the others, is still in my opinion just a collection of trivia about a non-noteworthy school. I'll admit that I missed the line in the talk page about the previous AfD vote. If there is a policy that I have missed about not relisting an article for AfD twice, then the nomination for this school should be taken down. No, I will not keep relisting it until it is gone as has been assumed by some. When all is said and done though, I still feel that this article is "schoolcruft". <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:42, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Irrespective of your claims, this mass-nomination (which despite your denial includes a middle school as an elementary school) is not only <b>disruptive</b> but borders on vandalism. Further, this is a <b>clear</b> attempt to thwart any attempt at concensus (although I believe true concensus is impossible on schools) by purposely mass-nominating instead of grouping the schools together in a format where an AfD discussion on schools from Miami-Dade could reasonably take place. It is fine that you "feel" that schools should be deleted, but mass-nominations is not an acceptable way of expressing that "feeling".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 21:35, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, I find it hilarious that someone who cut-and-pasted exactly the same text as his vote in multiple nominations is such a state of high dudgeon over what he sees as cutting-and-pasting of text. Find a dictionary and look up <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chutzpah.html" title="Chutzpah">chutzpah</a> to see what I mean. Secondly, while you've got that dictionary out, look up "disruption", "vandalism", and "clear", since I do not think those words mean what you think they mean. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:07, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

However , the creator didn't explain anything. And I haven't the time to research this, given the information is partly off the free web (but referencable). I don't want to make statements I can't yet cite sources for. So, I'm taking back my vote, since this nomination has consumed enough of people's time, given the small content, and inevitable conclusion.

<p>There is nothing culturally significant about Blue Bell Ice Cream as opposed to other brands of ice cream.

<li>Nonnotable. Abram Kamensky was Molotov's supervisor during early years of revolution. He charted the Soviet Republics. He funded the red army. Later he was demoted to somewhat lower posts by Stalin, because of having briefly joined the Trotskyst opposition. Finally he was beaten to death while imprisoned by Stalin's chief of the KGB, Lavrenty Beria. This is an important piece of history.
<ul>
<li>There were millions of bolsheviks who were each other's supervisors. Molotov was young sometime and over time had several stacks of supervisors hardly making all them notable for this reason. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:41, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Vanity. That is slander, and goes against the "assume good intent" Wikipedia policy. Unprovable, since the subject of the article is notable. I believe that this accusation is motivated by personal bias.
<ul>

<p><b>Conditional keep:</b> If he is notable, it doesn't come across in the article — just one of countless (unfortunate) casualties. However, the additional information from the author, below, does seem notable. Assuming it's factual, the author should add it to the article. Just a suggestion, but I'd change the tone of the article away from reading like a family history piece and make it read more like a neutral observation — avoiding judgmental descriptions like "heroic" and "slaughtered." Maybe more about the man and what he did and less emphasis on his less-notable decendants. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">Cory Maylett</a> 17:58, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

I just created the article, and <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> was on it within <b>seconds</b>, before I even had the chance to make a few edits.

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b>. I don't see a strong case for notability as of yet, and right now much of the article is not verifiable... but it's existed for a matter of hours here. I've found vague reference to Abram Kemensky (with a date of death in '38 not '37 shown in the article... but surely the same person) crawling the web. I'm going to say this article should stay for now; give the author a chance to make a case for it's inclusion. If in say 60 days there is not a greater assertion of notability, then perhaps bring it back for AfD.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:39, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: the reference you found is probably the entry in the summary Russian Jewish Encyclopedia cited above. There are apparantly some mistakes.

<dd>Well, here's the history. You created this AfD page at 17:32 on September 16 and then deleted it less than an hour later at 18:23 on 16 September.

I looked at the deleted version history, saw you as the original creator and believed it had been deleted in error (not realizing it was a from-scratch recreation by LevKamensky), and restored it.

<p>This concept does not exist in a form well-enough defined or widely-enough used to justify an article. The article's creation looks like an exercise in POV-pushing (see <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">main user</a>'s involvement with <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercion.html" title="Coercion">coercion</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_monopoly.html" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a> for that user's point of view) - which seems to have been rather successful. Almost every single usage of the term in the sense described the article is traceable either to wikipedia's article or to people who use it informally (blogs etc) and have probably picked it up from there.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Coercive+monopoly%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Coercive+monopoly%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> A single-figure number of more serious uses (usually with actual or implied inverted commas) do not justify the article. An encylopedia is supposed to reflect existing knowledge, and the very existence of the article makes a claim to an existence of an established concept, which claim is simply untrue. The actual meaning of the phrase "coercive monopoly" is "a monopoly on the use of coercion", in discussions of the state. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 17:02, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Addition. I've only just bothered to read the article - I'd nominated on the conceptual issue alone.

</li>
<li>In view of my experience with RJII in the past, merely noting articles I've seen him involved with was quite restrained. As for the Greenspan link, this is another (occasional) usage of "coercive monopoly" which does not support the existence of an independent article, because it is used synonymously with <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government-granted_monopoly.html" title="Government-granted monopoly">government-granted monopoly</a>. Funnily enough, for a year <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercive_monopoly.html" title="Coercive monopoly">coercive monopoly</a> was a redirect to that - before RJII came along and started defining it as something there is little evidence for. And as RJII brings up credibility; this sort of thing is (in my experience) typical of him - using isolated examples that don't prove his case to support sweeping generalisations. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 22:20, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In my experience with R2d2, he has fought allowing any mention of pro-capitalist laissez-faire arguments in articles he edits. For example, in <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_monopoly.html" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a> I had to fight tooth and nail to even mention that not everyone agrees that natural monopoly is a legitimate argument. Finally there is a paragraph in that article presenting the laissez-faire position. Obviously, here he thinks that an article identifying the term "coercive monopoly" is a threat to his POV as well. He wants it deleted as if the concept and term does not even exist. What is he afraid of? Maybe he works as an economic regulator? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:35, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

A search on my part showed that this term was used by Ayn Rand in an article on antitrust <a href="http://www.capitalism.org/faq/antitrust.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.capitalism.org/faq/antitrust.htm" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. While she used it in conjunction with government-regulated monopolies, the term certainly predates Wikipedia. Perhaps this is an politically sensitive &amp; economically debateable term. But it exists independent of this site and I think it deserves entry, not deletion. (My first post here ever, so please forgive errors.)

<li>It exists, but not as a well-established or well-defined concept - see my remarks above. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 09:26, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>That is a false remark from from the nominator. The term is very well defined and conceived. It's a monopoly that is maintained by the use of coercion, rather than by any other method, such as competitiveness. Very simple. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 13:09, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I should point out that I do see a <b>potential</b> use for the term "coercive monopoly", in relation to things like the mafia. But the creation of an article which lumps together mafia and government is so jawdroppingly POV I'm disappointed people don't seem to recognise it. And regardless of whether a mafia-related usage <b>would</b> be useful, <i>such usage is not established, and it is not up to Wikipedia to establish it.</i> <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 14:28, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I find it "jawdropping" that you can't stomach the fact that governments engage in coercion. "Coercive monopoly" is a well-established term thas has been in use in political and economic philosophy for a least 50 years. And, if I'm not mistaken it was in use even over 100 years ago in political-economic philosophy of some liberals --I'll have to make sure on that. Admittedly, if your education is limited to that supplied by a university, you might not have been exposed to it. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:44, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I haven't heard of the term either and a search on few economic glossaries &amp; text books didn't return a result either. Rewriting to reflect only coercive practices of a monopolist or renaming the article to <i>coercive practices of monopolies</i> would address also the concern, the term is not invented. <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pamri" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pamri" rel="nofollow">Pamri</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pamri" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pamri" rel="nofollow">Talk</a></small> 10:17, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It is an established concept. For example, Nathaniel Branden wrote about it in the The Objectivist Newsletter. <a href="http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/articles_essays/question_of_monopolies.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/articles_essays/question_of_monopolies.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This article seems to talk about it in much the same ways as Nathaniel Branden did back in 1962.

<li>Rd232 is correct in that the term is not used in mainstream economics, however there is a small but politicaly active group associated with Rand and the objectivist/laissez-faire camp that champion the concept. He is also correct that the term was created largely to advance a political agenda. However, I don't no if that is enough to warrant deletion. I would say <b>keep</b> only if the article explains who uses the term and why, otherwize <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/y/d/User%7EMydogategodshat_753f.html" title="User:Mydogategodshat">mydogategodshat</a> 03:00, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Now there's a shock - RJII missing the point. To recap what I said above on the Greenspan link: "this is another (occasional) usage of "coercive monopoly" which does not support the existence of an independent article, because it is used synonymously with government-granted monopoly." <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 22:03, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A government-granted monopoly is just one form of coercive monopoly. Not all coercive monopolies are necessarily government-granted monopolies. A coercive monopoly is one that coercively prohibits competition. It can include government-granted monopolies, government-monopolies, or firms not connected with government at all that are engaging in coercion to prevent competition. It would help if you would read an article before you nominate it for deletion. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:03, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>(See link in amateur writing.) The Sound of Poetry, is the same thing, only done to CD instead of paper by poetry.com's parent company, The International Library of Poetry. Being a self-published poet does not make one notable unless people actually buy the book, and I've seen no indication that anyone beyond his friends and relatives have even seen the book. To quote from the Better Business Bureau file on the company:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The company is a vanity publisher of hardbound anthologies, which feature amateur poets, of paperback volumes of poetry by single authors, and of a magazine for amateur poets. The books are not distributed and cannot be found in bookstores. They are only distributed to those who pay to have their work included. The quality of the poetry does not appear to be a significant consideration for selection for publication. However, according to the company, poems containing obscenities or offensive language are rejected.</dd>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> under A7 -- the article does not assert his notability. (Anyway, it's probably a hoax.) --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 21:48, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b>, I originally tagged this article for speedy deletion. There is no meaningful content in this article. It's also insulting as all else, even if it is a fictional person/name. In addition, this prompts the question as to what length has to regards to insults, aside from it being noted as a critera. For example, if a page was made insulting Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell and it was three pages long, would it still not merit speedy deletion under Article 6? Disparaging is disparaging whether it is three words long, or three pages long. Further, I understand the need for following the rules to the letter, but surely the spirit of the rules has some say, if not, it is gravely concerning. In any case, I feel the policy needs to be updated to strike the word "Short" from it to prevent occurrances such as these which turn a simple affair into a long, drawn out and complicated one. <a href="../../../j/j/j/User%7EJJJJust_79de.html" title="User:JJJJust">JJJJust</a> 22:19, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mark, I learned more from your post about Sprucefield than I did from reading the article. From what I can tell of Spucefield from the article is that it's completely non-notable.

<li>This is a shopping mall. It's a listing of location and shops. There are many thousands of such shopping malls - none of them noteworthy enough for an encyclopedia article. The fact that the planning process was controversial is completely average. A planning process that went completely as planned would be more unusual. The second argument - that a site becomes notable just because a notable crime happened there - also fails to convince me. The site might be mentioned in the article about the crime but does not automatically deserve its own article. And to be honest, I'm not convinced that this is a "notable" bombing. It was one of many in a very long string. We already have the relevant encyclopedia article at <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troubles.html" title="Troubles">Troubles</a>. This is trivia.

<p>Tagged for speedy as <i>"This article has no potential for expansion, and all the necessary information contained here is also available in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhammer_40000_Imperial_Guard_Equipment_and_Weaponry_8e4e.html#Trademark_Item" title="Warhammer 40000 Imperial Guard Equipment and Weaponry">Warhammer_40000_Imperial_Guard_Equipment_and_Weaponry</a> article"</i>. Now, whilst that is certainly no speedy criterion, I would advocate <b>deletion</b>.

<p>Google search for "ice metal" finds results related largely to car wheels, and a few insignificant music links. Sonata Arctica, the band the article cites as a prime example of ice metal, can be easily classified as power metal.
