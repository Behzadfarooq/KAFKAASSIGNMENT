<li><b>Delete</b>. Chris sums it up nicely. Thing is, this is a vocabulary stub, and when you look at the <a href="../../../v/o/c/Category%7EVocabulary_and_usage_stubs_f505.html" title="Category:Vocabulary and usage stubs">stub list</a> you see a lot of articles with similar problems.

<li>When <a href="../../../s/u/b/Category%7ESubstubs_f911.html" title="Category:Substubs">Category:Substubs</a> was being deprecated, it became clear that there were a lot of stubs that would either have to be dumped sight-unseen on Move to Wiktionary or would require a "holding pen" until we had time to go through them all to check which ones needed transwiki-ing. That holding pen is <a href="../../../v/o/c/Category%7EVocabulary_and_usage_stubs_f505.html" title="Category:Vocabulary and usage stubs">Category:Vocabulary_and_usage_stubs</a>. The list is slowly being winnowed, and you are likely to see a lot of them turn up here or at the Move to Wiktionary page. In other words, it's a temporary thing. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 01:40, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>

<li>I'm still in the delete camp, but I have to correct this. There's nothing "incorrect" about Latinizing a Greek word. You'll find lots of reputable authors doing so. Nowadays, it's easy to provide text in non-Latin alphabets, but it wasn't always so. And there's something to be said for accomodating readers to whom ŒöœÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ is just chicken tracks. ¬∂ Incidentally, the "correct" spelling of my last name requires use of <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrilic.html" title="Cyrilic">Cyrilic</a> -- but since I can't spell it that way myself, the rest of you are exempt as well! ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 00:04, 25 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, there is, and those "reputable authors" (which classification apparently does not include the authors of any Greek language dictionaries, since they don't do this) and you are both wrong. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html#Writing_system" title="Greek language">The Greek word is in the Greek alphabet</a>. It's that simple. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:42, 2005 May 25 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It isn't that simple. transliterated words are valuable in their own right, we are trying to make the most complete and most useful resource that we can, and transliterated words are commonplace on the internet as well as in some published works. - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDaveRoss_9fbf.html" title="User:TheDaveRoss">TheDaveRoss</a> 19:12, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>(<i>edit conflict with Dave</i>)However, on Wiktionary, the Latinised form should be redirected to the Greek form. Why? Regardless of prescriptivist values of 'the right form' (which in this case I subscribe to), the Latinised form is used often enough, especially in an online context, which is precisely what Wiktionary is. Also, many dictionaries list Greek words in etymologies in their Latinised forms, which annoys me at times, but that doesn't mean it isn't done. --<a href="../../../w/y/t/User%7EWytukaze_ca30.html" title="User:Wytukaze">Wytukaze</a> 19:15, 25 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you're going to go all prescriptivist, the only correct way to write classical Greek is ALLCAPS, no accent marks, and no spaces between words. That's the way the Greeks wrote! ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac –†–∞–±–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á</a> 06:13, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 8 "delete" votes to 4 "keep" or "merge" votes (one probable troll vote discounted). The current article is an orphan which, seeing that it's a technology topic and Wikipedia has a known bias toward the creation and linking of such articles, I take for weak evidence that comparatively few people are interested in this topic.</p>
<p>I am going to call this one as a "delete" decision but without prejudice if someone wants to add the reference into the <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_Online_d3b0.html" title="America Online">America Online</a> article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:27, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 4 explicit "delete" votes and 4 "move and cleanup" votes. The clear concensus is that an article on this topic would be acceptable but the current content is not it. The decision comes down to a question of whether Wikipedia will get the desired article by starting over (deleting) or by leaving this as a starting point. Looking again at the content and noting that no one has made any edits (other than the VfD tag) since the article was created over a month ago, I am going to exercise my discretion and delete this version. I will update any inbound links to the correct location.</p>
<p>This decision should <b>not</b> be used as precedent to delete a future version of this article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:38, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>FWIW, you're right about that. The Druids were preliterate. Julius Caesar wiped them out first, and Hengest and Horsa bashed them later, and then Augustine the Lesser after that. There is a <i>tremendous</i> amount of poppycock claiming to be Druid or "white goddess" stuff floating about. Anything that uses a Tolkein term and was "described" after Tolkein needs to be closely scrutinized. A scholarly reference would be a huge help. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:19, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Are you suggesting that the word "awen" is a derivation from Tolkien? It's worth bearing in mind that he based Sindarin heavily on Welsh, so it's actually the other way round.&#160;:) As for a scholarly reference, my dictionary ("Y Geiriadur Mawr", 1989 ed.) states (with no mention of druids): <b>awen</b>, <i>eb. ll.</i>-au. 1. afwyn, llinyn ffrwyn.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a fellow Welsh-speaker of <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a>, I'd suggest adding the reservations expressed to the entry - whether or not the original prechristian Druids would have recognised the term, if it has a present-day use, doesn't it still merit an entry? I also have a feeling that I've heard this term used in English as a borrowing from Welsh, meaning "inspiration" or "muse", and not by Druids either, as far as I know. You'd say that something or someone has "awen". I can't substantiate this, though, so it may be a figment of my imagination; annoying. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 22:31, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The community concensus was clearly to delete this article. However, an anon user converted it to a redirect to the subject's webcomic on 23 May. I believe that was an acceptable solution and am going to exercise my discretion to override the strict vote count.

<p>When I originally came across this article, I thought that it could become a good article if substantially cleaned up.

<p>In my opinion, the dominant article for deletion is not the fact that the article is a stub nor that it sounds like advertising. The real reason for deletion is the lack of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> content. The only reference that anyone found during the extended discussion period was the company's own website - in Norwegian. The might be sufficient for the Norwegian Wikipedia but presents problems in the English version. Noting that no one came forward during the discussion period to translate or confirm any of the alleged facts, I am going to call this one a delete but without prejudice against re-creation <b>if</b> the author comes forward with more verifiable content. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:32, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><small><b>Keep</b>. Leeroy recently got airtime on G4 TV. The phrase "Let's make like Leeroy and do this thing" was said during an aired unreal tournament piece. If THAT doesn't say Leeroy has seeped his way into gaming culture, then I don't know what does. Secondly, there's really no reason to remove the page. Anyone looking for information on Leeroy Jenkins can easily show up here; and as previously stated, there have been people looking for information. Removing this page is a disservice to the citizens of the internet. The same goes for any other popular internet meme entry in wikipedia. ‚Äî <i>(Unsigned comment by <a href="../../../1/5/5/User%7E155.246.15.34.html" title="User:155.246.15.34">155.246.15.34</a>; user's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.246.15.34_2d91.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.246.15.34">25th</a> edit.)</i></small></li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> page.</b>. Those of you argueing that this event should only have reference on Wikipedia if it is notable in a certain amount of time have an invalid arguement. Wikipedia browsers should not be restricted from obtaining information because the Wikipedia editors are waiting to see if a topic is still significant in "2 years". Ridiculous. The Tsunami of 04' was not omitted from the <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsunami.html" title="Tsunami">Tsunami</a> Wikipedia page simply because someone said it may not be significant in "2 years". Also, I don't see how you have the authority to decide that a search is meaningless simply because it does not contain quotations. Leeroy Jenkins without quotations returns 13,600 results on a <a href="http://www.Google.com" class="external text" title="http://www.Google.com" rel="nofollow">Google Search</a>. "leeroy jenkins" generates 294 <b>unique</b> results out of the <b>total</b> 3,040 results found using the Google search engine. Also if you follow the "show omitted results" link at the bottom of the search for "leeroy jenkins" you will come up with 10,400 results. I do agree that the event is not large enough yet to deserve it's own article but I do believe this event should be mentioned on the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> page. Also, the article is expressed from a neutral view point in accordance with Wikipedia's deletion policy. The article is also not expressed in a way that the subject of the article, "Leeroy", will experience any personal gain from this article.--65.40.72.15 19:26, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A search without quotes is meaningless because it doesn't search for the exact phrase <i>"leeroy jenkins"</i> ‚Äì it finds any pages that have instances of the terms <i>leeroy</i> and <i>jenkins</i>, no matter how far apart they are in the page. Since Leeroy and Jenkins are rather common names, this is going to generate a <b>lot</b> of false-positive hits. Also, unique hits are a better overall barometer for web "presence."</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Moronic? The author of this article actually produced some fairly subtle and intelligent humour. I would challenge any of the "delete it" crowd to produce something which would bring a smile to as many people's faces. Irrelevant? Um, last time I checked every article on this site was irrelevant to almost all of the population. The reason things merit a Wikipedia entry is because they are important to SOME people. As this article clearly is. I say it should stay.</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, or retitle (decapitalize last two words) and add definition of "ancient", for which 476 C.E. is better than 1300. Why are these structures sorted by height, and why is height data included rather than who built each structure, or estimated year of construction, or purpose of each structure? List may not be completable, unless a minimum size of "structure" is defined; in any case it's incomplete, as there are many surviving pyramids from various Egyptian dynasties, plus some Assyrian ziggurats and Inca pyramids and such, that are older and larger than most of these entries. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:07, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Since the Lighthouse at Alexandria no longer stands, this article if kept would also need a consensus on whether it includes structures surviving to the present.

<li>I didn't really know what year draws the line for "ancient", but I just put in an arbitrary year and landed on 1300. If 476 is better I have no problem with it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 07:38, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

The "5%" is used in a symbolic sense to describe how few people know of the True and Living God. 10% refers to those who know, but they do not teach because they "profit" off of the ignorance of the remaining 85%; the Blind, Deaf, and Dumb ... the masses.</li>

<li>Delete: I'd have to say that it's better covered at its master topic (propaganda). Propaganda is state-sponsored, so "racist propaganda" is a little strained. Racially based state propaganda is quite possible, but that's too long a name. Plain old racist caricature and stereotyping isn't propaganda. (And yes, the US did try race-based propaganda against the Chinese with the Yellow Peril, and of the Japanese, but state-sponsored and designed racial typing for propaganda purposes is rare in the US, even as casual and private racist slurs are far too common.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:38, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I count 8 clear "delete" votes. I count 6 "keep" votes but three of those were problematic. The anon voter got an id, behaved consistently and shows no evidence of sockpuppetry. I counted his/her vote. I did not grant the same benefit of the doubt to the probable troll. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a>'s opinion was impossible to determine. He explicitly voted "keep" at the top of the list but endorsed deletion at the end. I was forced to consider his vote as too ambiguous to call. That leaves the decision at 8 to 4.</p>
<p>To further complicate matters, it was partially rewritten on 3 June (well after the discussion period ended) to make it more neutral. I am going to call this one as a "no concensus" which defaults to keep for now.</p>
<p>I will add my own opinion that this is not the right place for this content. Despite the current length of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> article, this content belongs on that page.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_Capitalism_5864.html" title="Anarchism and Capitalism">Anarchism and Capitalism</a>. It's conjecture that it was written by anarcho-capitalists. One who edits an article about anarcho-capitalism isn't necessarily an anarcho-capitalist. Even if it is written by anarcho-capitalists, that should not matter. If it's written POV, then that's what the "edit this page" button is for. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:43, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Incidentally, it's not true that this page was written entirely by partisans of one side. Most of the second paragraph, at least, was written by <a href="../../../2/3/x/User%7E23x.html" title="User:23x">User:23x</a>, an anti-anarcho-capitalist edit warrior. This page was created as a break-out from the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> article, for the purpose of cutting down on size and making that article flow better. Its existence should be entirely a question of what the most expedient placement of this information is (although it might be better with a different title). I think it kind of conflates two different issues by including both the "a-c vs. rest of modern anarchism" issue and the "disputed ties to 19th century individualists" issue. But that, as RJII say, is a problem that you solve with the Edit button. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 18:58, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The single biggest problem with Wikipedia is that some topics are filled with POV disputes that never end. This is one of them.

<li>The whole point of having this page -- or addressing the subject elsewhere -- is that some people are afeared that the one will be confused with the other. Certainly, if there was a chance that people would get the impression that apples and oranges were the same, it would make more sense to have an article or section discussing the differences. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 02:13, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It may be a pain, but it's necessary for voting. You need to sign the votes you made above or they don't count, and you need to vote only once, and qualify the rest as comments.

<li>Much better, I'm just trying to make things easier for you, because it is common practice to dismiss anonymous votes.

I'm placing it on vfd now, although I made this an article and think it should be kept - the subject was a powerful and important figure in the school system, and there was some controversy over a school being named after him while he was still serving on the board. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="blue"><b>talk</b></font></sup></a> 16:47, 2005 May 20 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'll reserve a vote until the article contains enough notable information about why Michael Krop should have his own article. If his importance is due to his stature in a local school board, then I would think his profile would best belong in the article on the school (where it already is) or an article on the school district.--<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 17:49, May 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Being on the local school board is very much like being a director of the Education department over here, a role which is equally short of the "You must be this notable to ride Wikipedia" mark. That, and no evidence presented of having done anything other than being on the school board. (I've sat in on a few meetings of the education committee in my local council - nothing that they do separates them out from other local councillors). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 02:53, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

And Krop was on the board far longer than the average member - most board members don't get high schools named for them (a pretty hefty honor - even if he did have a hand in the naming). --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="blue"><b>talk</b></font></sup></a> 04:59, 2005 May 21 (UTC)

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The strict vote count would lead to a delete decision. (I count 8 delete to 4 keep as merge or redirect.) The current content is a mere dictionary definition and, based on the evidence presented during this discussion, is a neologism. Personally, I see no possiblity of expansion past the dicdef. The exact content is in the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a> article (though that is a recent addition to the article and may not last).</p>
<p>I am going to call this one as a delete decision with a qualifier. If the definition remains stable in the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a> article, please contact me so that I can restore the article and turn it into an appropriate redirect.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. Several voters said "merge and delete", a vote that is inconsistent with the GFDL requirement to preserve attribution history. No one, however, argued for the preservation of the article as is. I am going to call this as a qualified "keep" in the sense that both merges and redirects are variations of keep.</p>
<p>Switching hats to my role as an ordinary editor, I have turned it into a redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_539c.html" title="The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>. I have not merged it into the artice because I personally consider the topic trivia (that is, not encyclopedic). If, however, anyone wants to merge content, you may easilty retrieve it from the page history. You may also change the redirect to point to one of the sub-articles rather than the main article if you think it appropriate. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:13, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

The result of the debate was ambiguous. The nomination was unsigned (but that was probably an oversight). One person explicitly voted delete, one explicit keep and one conditional. Looking at the article, I am going to call this a "no concensus" defaulting to keep.</p>
<p>Next, as an ordinary editor, I am going to convert this article to a redirect to the parent. It is very difficult to produce non-stub articles on a subsidiary but a good article should eventually be possible on the parent company. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:15, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as duplicate content. To me the split was an excellent idea because it hugely reduced the latency in page loading times. Perhaps we just need a "previous day" link placed at the bottom of each page? ‚Äî <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 16:30, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: Perhaps we could do like 18th c. publishing, where there was a catchword to aid the printers. The first word (in this case entry) of the next page was at the bottom of a page. We could have the last entry of a day restated as the first entry of the next day. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:29, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
