<p>This was nominated in 2004 and kept (not without controversy). My Google skills are not the best in the world, but I've just spent ten minutes trying to find any references to this game outside WP and minor blogs, without success. It looks to me as if it's either a very minor cult, or a <i>nihilartikel</i> (it is heavily self-referential). I'm happy to be persuaded otherwise, but if this <i>is</i> a meme, it seems to me to be a minor one, and largely founded on this article. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 19:12, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I really like this game<a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.188.173.96.html" title="User:195.188.173.96">195.188.173.96</a> 11:25, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I found out about the game ages before I heard about this page, its only after a couple of years of anguish (from a large number of my friends), that someone actually bothered to Google <b>The Game</b> and found this page and told us about it on our website. Hence the page may have created the cult (I don't know how old it is), though The Game is now self-perputuating and the will continue to exist regardless. Though perhaps it should be taken down purely to save others from it's unforgiving grasp. 195.173.15.12 13:31, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Everyone keeps talking about how they can't stop playing this annoying game. Me, this Wikipedia article was the first place I <b>heard</b> about it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. 684 students play it at Cambridge University alone, and that's according to facebook society figures when only about half the university are members of facebook.

<li><b>Keep</b>.Even though we are all losing the game in talking about it. If it must be deleted can it go to uncyclopedia or is it too sensible for them. I feel it belongs somewhere in the wiki family.Signed in 18:15, 28 November 2005 (UTC) <small>User's third edit</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> even though I'm irritated about having lost. Again. At least a dozen people I know offhand in the midwest United States know of this game independent of my knowledge of it; this is of course ancedotal, but the game is viral in nature. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Deken_ff24.html" title="User:Stephen Deken">Stephen Deken</a> 18:20, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I love the game, even even though it is a source of eternal torment. Anyway ths site is supposed to be a comprehensive online encyclopedia and if you delete a widely known phenomenon as this is then the site will not be comprehensive.

<li>No, I'm stating that it has been through AfD before, it was deemed notable enough to keep then, and but for the actions of a few idiots it remains so. I base my judgements in AfD on deciding whether a <i>topic</i> is worth keeping, not necessarily the <i>content</i>. The Game is real. I'm not an avid player, but I'm smart enough to know that memes (which The Game is, essentially) propogate very rapidly through blogs. Of course it's going to turn up in lots of non-notable blogs; that doesn't make it non-notable of itself. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 23:40, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, it's notable and widespread. And much like Color or Country, this article can be informative in an unusual way: if you knew of the game, you now know that it's <i>not</i> just something stupid your friends came up with.
