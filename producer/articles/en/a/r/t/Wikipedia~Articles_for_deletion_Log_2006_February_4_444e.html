This page does not provide any useful corporate information, and is more of an advertisement for a specific NML office.

<li>Addendum: Apparently there are many such articles, such as The Bohannon Group, The Stewart Financial Group, Theodore Financial Group, The Waltos Group, The Effner Financial Group, The Columns Resource Group... and they've been created/edited by the same people, most recently <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_38.192.2.179_9eb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/38.192.2.179">38.192.2.179</a> (see his/her contributions page). It would not surprise me if this was a person merely interested in increasing NML's presence on Wikipedia through these "spamvertisement" means. These are simply local insurance offices with no relevance to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwestern_Mutual_95ad.html" title="Northwestern Mutual">NML corporate</a>; while adding information about NML as a corporation would be helpful on their main page, these are local agent offices, and information on them would be better off deleted than merged. (After all, imagine having a list of every <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allstate.html" title="Allstate">Allstate</a> agent on their page... yikes!) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 02:08, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Naturally I'd advocate keeping this as I wrote it, but I do have some logical reasons i'd like to share: <b>1)</b> This most certainly isn't an advert as I don't have any connection with the group whatsoever other than having taken advantage of their trial. <b>2)</b> The group is a significant news provider to the financial world in the London and NY markets, as and such merits mention as a journalistic group. <b>3)</b> It's of interest as a wholly web-based news group, as an example of the move of such niche journals towards the net and away from classic hard-copy publishing. <b>4)</b> Its syndication in notable traditional news sources (eg WSJ, Sunday Telegraph) vouches for its quality above "specialised news ticker" status. <b>5)</b> Verifiable information is available to support the statements made in the article, and nothing vague or unsupportable has been written. <b>6)</b> Finally, any such article about any news journal might be considered promotional if this one is to be deleted. How can the articles on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Week_e083.html" title="The Week">The Week</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_%28magazine%29.html" title="Arena (magazine)">Arena (magazine)</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Face_6a4b.html" title="The Face">The Face</a>, or <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_%28magazine%29.html" title="Heat (magazine)">Heat (magazine)</a> be justified? None of these articles provide a comparable level of impartiality (The Week: "witty, smart, and nonpartisan"), represent journals with significant links to other fields (finance), or relate to an unusual or atypical publication (Heat, the Face and all other glossies and lads mags are essentially identical and trivial and perhaps do not merit seperate description). Upon re-reading the article, I can see how it might seem like an advert, becuase I stuck only to facts I could find, and included no commentary of my own. But that's an argument for edits and revisions, not deletion. Those were my reasons for starting the article, and they are my reasons for voting to Keep it. --Corinthian 02:31, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: The nominated article does not read like an ad. It describes post-secondary education related to a "denomination", similar (though not identical) to a Jesuit education.

<dd>No, it does not describe "post-secondary education related to a denomination." In fact, if you read it carefully "independent Baptist" simply means "independent" of main Bapitist ministry. Therefore, this article encompasses any broad Christian/fundamentalist/Baptist, as the article notes with "Bob Jones University"-- which is not Baptist. The Jesuit education article is a good one that describes a particular denomination. This article does not describe a denomination. My assertation is that the article is so broad it is worthlessly undescriptive since "independent" Baptist is NOT a denomination. The Jesuit article is perfect criteria to follow and this article falls far short of that. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 04:29, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A Bible college is different than the Independent Baptist Colleges. A Bible college generally would have a much narrower curriculum, with more specific training for ministerial careers. The colleges described in this article, while preparing most for ministerial careers, may offer a broader education, providing a independent Baptist setting and also providing other areas of study - for example Tennessee Temple University offers a majors in biology and in mathematics. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 22:46, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Comment not meant to be controversial. I did a review of some of Bible colleges offerings of majors and then offerings of of independent Baptist colleges (IBC). Some of the IBCs are "Bible" colleges, while some have more general offerings. Point was that there is a difference. Some IBC are Bible colleges, while some are not. The "Bible colleges" terminology that I am referencing is that being used in the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_college.html" title="Bible college">Bible college</a>. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 00:58, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>See, my problem is, I've clicked on a bunch of those links, and most of the schools do not identify themselves as "independent" anything.

<dd>I am willing to bet Jason Gastrich sent you here like on the other AfDs. Please explain what is "helpful" about it, that is, what criteria is it describing? How many schools mentioned in the article actually define themselves as "Independent Baptist" (I know the answer)? The how many call themself an "Independent Baptist <i>College</i>"(different from the previous question)? Explain how/why this is "important"? What is the criteria (other than the name) for an "Independent Baptist College," no one has said this and its absent from the article. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 20:05, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, that's not enough to justify deletion since there is no proof of bad faith. Correction, maybe, but not deletion. I don't have time to go hunting through books. If you believe this is gobbledygook then replace the offending content with something that is not gobbledygook -- you seem familiar with the above book, so I would start with that. I do agree with Agateller, below, that perhaps a renaming of the article is in order and change Hyperspace itself to a disambiguation page that leads to this article and to the science fiction concept. The fact that there may <i>allegedly</i> be factual errors in this article is not grounds for deletion. That's the same as saying the article on <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelina_Jolie_ff96.html" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> should be deleted because someone erroneously stated that she was the first woman to walk on the moon.

Or, alternatively, an expert opinion (from a physicist) on whether there is merit to the article. What I find concerning is that CH gives the appearance of being on a personal vendetta against this article. The comments on the talk page are not very friendly and the followup to every comment here is disconcerting. (the equations seem legit as far as they go but don't seem to explain much about how one would do anything useful with hyperspace). If this article is kept, I suggest that the disambig be reversed to make the article currently at <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperspace_%28science_fiction%29.html" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">hyperspace (science fiction)</a> the proimary one, and have it point here. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 23:17, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Lar, the references are to popular works.

As for "personal vendetta", I don't know who (plural) wrote that article, so it can't be personal. In fact, my motivations are concern for reader who come here seeking an <i>encyclopedia</i>.

<dd>Most basic concepts are not really mentioned, there are key errors, and the article doesn’t even contain the extremely useful “hyperspace” refutation of general relativity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hyper dimensionality and hyperspace are generally opposites, dimensional collapse (into 3 dimensions) is not mentioned, curved verses flat hyperspaces are not mentioned, “sub-space” theories are not mentioned.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>And of course there are none of the big arguments in favour of HS either, like the unification of the macro and quantum worlds, or the solution to the various problems with gravity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia would have to be very brave to have a real article on the subject anyway, and not only because it would upset a lot of scientists. This stuff was all once part of everyday science in the 1950’s, but men with short haircuts in black suits came along and it all disappeared.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Incidentally</b> the correct category for an article on hyperspace is surely “speculative science” - the same category as gravity engines, cold fusion, time travel, over unity machines, “intelligent” design, and (the other theory I have been working on for 15 years) - Strong AI.</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I read the wrong article entry. As for your claim; a "Jesuit school" entails a easily defined group. Indepedent Baptists are not a particular sect, but simply have no affliation. The analogy you put forth does not hold water. As for "Independent Baptist is different that Baptist as Jesuit is different that Roman Catholic," you might want to re-read what an independent Baptist is. A Jesuit is a denomination. Catholic is a denomination. Baptist is a denomination. An indepedent Baptist is still a Baptist, just one that does not have ties to the main organization. That is why this list is AfD. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 04:00, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A few comments about accreditation. I don't think it is relevant one way or another that many of these schools are not accredited. They are religious schools. Many religious schools choose not to go through the accreditation process, because they wish to remain independent, not necessarily because they are diploma mills. This group of Baptists is VERY independent, so it is not surprising that these schools are not accredited. Even for them to join the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Baptist_Convention_a9e3.html" title="Southern Baptist Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> would be for them a form of compromise. <a href="../../../h/2/o/User%7EH2O_a495.html" title="User:H2O">H2O</a> 00:15, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

This looks a lot like an attempt at Gastroturfing - the first one I checked with a Wikilink (rather than an external link, whihc I'd say is questionable, since why would we list places not notable enough for articles?) was Providence Baptist College. I checked on its accreditation status, and can't find any evidence of accreditation (which may be defective searchign skills or not). I suspect that this mix of redlinks, weblinks and wikilinks is part of the Southern Baptist walled garden.

<p>This person is listed as the author of several books, but of the two where the publisher isn't listed as unknown, one is a church, and one is "Pentland Press". If that's Pentland Press, Inc. of North Carolina (there was apparently a UK publisher named Pentland Press that went into liquidation) the only information I can find about the publisher is its imprint Ivy House, which describes its "mission" as "to offer an investment-based program, whereby an author has every chance of financial recuperation. You would fully invest in the first edition of the publication."<a href="http://www.ivyhousebooks.com/index.php?pid=publish" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ivyhousebooks.com/index.php?pid=publish" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> I'm sure this was written by someone who thought Dr. Kring was a wonderful person, and you know what? I'm sure they were <i>right</i>, I'm sure he was a great guy. But being a great guy, and being notable enough to merit an entry in an encyclopedic, are different things. If the greatest claim to the subject's encyclopedic notability is having some books privately printed, which it currently appears to be, that's not really enough. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:36, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>His claim to fame is also in his pottery which was shown at the World's fair, and for the 'Kring Red' Glaze he invented as well as his work on Hermen Melville. He was a Minister for most his life and was in the Navy during 2 major battles as a Chaplain. I will edit the wiki when I can get more information. I also have alot of his books he published here, that I will need to dig out to get the ISBN and publisher, the information on the wiki now is just what I could find on web. Thank you for the book information, I will update his complete works ASAP and I agree that his published works should be at the bottom of the page. This is my first page I have done, so some help would be appreciated. He was also involved with the 'Timothy Leary Acid Tests'. I will need to get information about this, but he also had some influence in the NYC area regarding 'Malcom X' and the 'Black Panther' movement of the 60's. I also have the audio version of his funeral service on MP3. Zothip</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The above post is by Zothip, the author of the page in question. Please sign your comments (four tildes). Also, there is nothing rude about the nominator's comments, IMHO. He simply pointed out that, while the subject may be a decent human being who had an impact on the lives of some, the information is not worthy of encyclopedic entry here at Wikipedia. (As per my vote above, I agree. I must also point out that the additional information you provided above does not make it more so, either.) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 07:24, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why? <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Melville_9326.html" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a> is encyclopedically notable; there is little question about that. But notability is not transitive; one does not automatically become notable just by writing about Melville. Also, in regards to your now-removed statement that you would like to tell me "where to go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum" rel="nofollow">shove it!</a>" I will say two things: first of all, how in your mind would it be possible for <i>anyone</i> to raise <i>any</i> question about whether this person is encyclopedically notable, without you assuming that the question is so "rude" that it fully justifies you being so very rude in return? secondly, please read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>; if you intend to stay and contribute to Wikipedia, you will have to do so in a manner befitting a mature adult.

<li><strike><b>Keep and expand</b>.

<li><b>Comment1</b> All the opposition is coming from power hungry wikipedian editors who have no outside life, but somehow yeild ultimate influence on trivial matters such as this and need to make decisions here to make up for the lack of say they have in thier own lives. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelium_f92f.html" title="User:Steelium">Steelium</a></li>
<li><b>Comment2</b> The above warning, that suggests people are being "puppeted" into supporting this page is an unfair advantage to the delete side of the debate, I suggest it be removed.

<li><b>Comment3</b> I have posted valid reasons for keeping the article, I have referenced the details in question and made attempts to have the page fit the standard.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Also, as to <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelium_f92f.html" title="User:Steelium">Steelium</a>'s earlier points: Comments 1 and 4 are irrelevant and seem like violations of the Wikipedia rules about not engaging in ad hominem attakcs. As for Comment 2, are you advocating the censorship of comments regarding possible meatpuppetry/sockpuppetry/stuffing? Let people look at the evidence and decide for themselves. Now as to Comment 3: "Real place at top three University in Canada" - so? by this standard we would have literally hundreds of building and dorms that would need to be added. "1000s of people have lived there" - same problem as before. "at least 2 famous people are associated with the building" - again, hardly a big deal, and while John Candy may be the famous, the other individual is not at all. "major movie satirizing contemporary North American college life was inspired by events at this Hall" - This has already been dealt with by Metropolitan90, so let me just add that many colleges and dorms at colleges claim to be inspiration for animal house. " Building has 45 year history" - 45 years is hardly a long enough time to contribute to noteworthiness. "There are FAR more articles that should be recieving more attention for deletion than this one, this article is pretty innocuous" - this is simply irrelevant. If there are articles you feel should be deleted then nominate them (please however refrain from engaging in revenge AfD, they are seriously frowned upon). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:04, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as there is no solid evidence that it is the inspiration for Animal House, and even if that were the case, it would only be worth a mention in the Animal House and/or McMaster University article. That a famous person, John Candy, lived there is not exceptional. Medium and large universities that have been around for a while are bound to have famous almuni who stayed in the dorms, but that does not confer notability them, or even much to the university. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:09, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - articles such as this would be so much less troublesome if they were just redirected to the university to which they belong.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Halls of Residence, University Colleges are important places and there are many articles on WP about them. To those people who want to delete them, I ask you to be consistent. There are about 11 articles on Halls from this university alone. They have links from the main university page. This is just one. If it is worse than the others and it is indeed a poor article, it can be improved. If you want to delete all of them, then give reasons why Halls are not notable. I finally suggest that WP will be the poorer without good NPOV articles on Halls and Colleges so prospective students can look at them as an alternative to the POV articles from the university concerned. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 11:19, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was every ounce of deletionism in my soul is crying out against it, but it's a <b>keep</b>er. The nomination rests on the article being a) trash, and b) unverifiable, and the article has been both cleaned up and verified. Verifiability wipes out a swathe of the good arguments for deletion straight away (for all the three people who argued for deletion). I would discount <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">User:Jcuk</a>'s views because he hasn't bothered to provide an argument, but it doesn't really matter. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 14:11, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, notable operation, and definitely not an "advertisement" since it doesn't even exist anymore. A few weeks ago I heard "ls magazine" mentioned on <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> and then a pedophilia forum, and wanted to know what it was and whether it was legal without accessing it, so I came to Wikipedia and was enlightened.

<dd>What are you talking about? We define the operation, who made it, and how they got arrested, and then we list their productions. No different then having a list of movies produced by a defunct film company.</dd>
<dd>I wasn't talking about the external links to alleged child pornography, which I would agree should be removed. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 00:42, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I also agree that such links are not a good idea here. I had originally included the LS Forum and LS Models links to provide verifiability to the listed productions. Perhaps simply mentioning them without links in the intro paragraph (as has been the case) is sufficient.<a href="../../../z/e/b/User%7EZebruh_2342.html" title="User:Zebruh">Zebruh</a> 00:55, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>My objections are that outlining the productions would allow people to track down the material through mechanisms such as the <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayback_Machine_934e.html" title="Wayback Machine">Wayback Machine</a>. It is particularly troublesome if links are provided so that people can track it down from the article. Unlike productions from a defunct moviehouse, this material is illegal and Wikipedia should not be seen to be promoting it in any way at all. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 02:07, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How would naming names allow people to track it down through the Wayback Machine? We document information -- that's not promoting it -- and that's that. Morals concerns are irrelevant to whether or not we should censor Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>By the way, if we list the productions of a movie house, people could potentially use that information to find the movies. Maybe I have moral concerns about that. Should I use that as justification to delete information from the article? <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 02:28, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

His one claim to fame apparently was that he was a semi-professional cricketer for <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shropshire.html" title="Shropshire">Shropshire</a> in the 1960's. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricinfo.html" title="Cricinfo">Cricinfo</a> had nothing on him however and it has information on every professional cricketer that ever lived. The impression that this is a hoax is heightened by the fact that a Google search showed Mikael Hopkins as a student at the <a href="../../../o/s/w/Oswestry_School_e7c8.html" title="Oswestry School">Oswestry School</a> but in the class of 2003 not in the 1950s as claimed. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Ufc&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Mikael+Hopkins%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Ufc&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Mikael+Hopkins%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I feel it only reasonable to defend the work that I have submitted. I can appreciate that it may be difficult to understand the significance of Mikael's life from the article whilst not being a resident of Oswestry. I can perhaps also see now that not enough emphasis was placed on his actual charity work, such as the organisations he set up and the events that he hosted. Given time, this article can be reworked and further research can be carried out to correct this. As for a Google search showing Mikael to be a graduate of Oswestry School in 2003 may simply be sheer coincidence. As for the lack of a listing on Cricinfo, it may be that Mikael was merely an amature as oppposed to a "semi-professional" as he claimed, again in that case more research is required. It seems as though the complaints you have with the entry can be fixed easily by the inclusion of some of the more significant achievements in Mikael's life and a correction of a few minor details. It can therefore be turned into a useful article for those even outside of the Shropshire area to benefit from. --Kesnel 12:22, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, Calton, since you are so keen for my comment on this, here's one. When you first used the term "the provinces" it was pretty clear that it referred to all of Japan outside Tokyo. Now you want it to mean <i>only</i> (if I'm still allowed to use this word!) Kitakyushu. If I may be permitted a soccer metaphor here (ha ha, how appropriate) I would say that is moving the goalposts, or making the goal much smaller if you prefer (that reminds me, our team could do with some bigger ones!). Oh, and I think you should clarify whether you mean Fukuoka <i>prefecture</i> or Fukuoka <i>city</i> in your last comment above. Presumably you mean that Fukuoka prefecture has 4% do you, because there is not such a great difference between the population of Fukuoka city (about 1.4 million) and Kitakyushu (just under one million in the recent national census.) --<a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistorian_91b7.html" title="User:Historian">Historian</a> 07:54, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I support your decision, Perfecto. Looking at <a href="../../../d/e/m/Category%7EDemo_albums_f727.html" title="Category:Demo albums">Category:Demo albums</a>, the dearth of actual articles about demo albums doesn't lend credibility, in my opinion, to keep.

<li>OK. But it sure <i>read</i> like you were casting aspersions in your first comment, especially since I used the term "suggested criteria" rather than "policy". Perhaps you'll want to be more careful in your wording going forward to avoid even the appearance of not assuming good faith. But more to the point, I'll repeat my implied question: do you think they're useful criteria or not? If not, you should comment on them, in the appropriate place, I think. If so, then don't you agree they suggest keep for this article, and several others you nominated? ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 07:16, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I fail to see how gently pointing out they are not policy can be taken as not assuming good faith. I have absolutely no doubt about your good faith whatsoever; I trust you have no doubt in mine. To answer your question, I don't accept those recommendations as policy, hence my nomination.

<li>I fear you've chosen to answer a question I did not ask. I didn't ask whether you accept them as policy, I asked if you think they're <i>useful criteria</i>. Not everything <i>useful</i> has to be <i>policy</i>. Mixing the two concepts up as you appear to have done, is what is, to my view anyway, giving the appearance of a lack of good faith, by appearing to cast aspersions on my use of them for invalid reasons (remember, I declaimed them as merely suggested criteria). I hope that clears up why I have concerns about the way you worded it, and apologise if not. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 07:38, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I apologise then. I've been up all night so failed to grasp your point. As for the criteria, no I don't agree with them in their entirety but I think they could be a useful starting point.

<li>How does it meet numbers 1 and 2? All we have are references from the Sydney Morning Herald, a fine newspaper certainly, but a regional one and one with a seeming penchant for micronation stories. This falls <i>way</i> below the bar proposed in points 1 and 2, unless there are other sources which haven't been listed in the article. (If there are, please insert them. I'm not trying to delete for the sake of it). Point 3 I feel is too vague with it's either/or, and this 'micronation' only meets it by virtue of having been involved in court cases. I'll make my point about that on the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Category_talk%7EMicronations_5136.html" title="Category talk:Micronations">talk page</a>. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 19:35, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am pretty sure that I've seen the Syndey Morning Herald at some international oriented newsstands in California in the US and an Australian oriented shop in Vancouver in Canada, though I can't say as I bought it or have photos of it there. That's three countries, if my memory is correct. If it gets that much coverage it's likely also in England and perhaps other places. I can't disagree that the SMH seems to have a penchant for covering micronations, but it also seems like Australia has a penchant for creating them, as a national quirk. It might be interesting to study whether the press coverage is disproportionate for the amount of activity actually going on, but for now it seems sufficient to me. Your mileage may vary, this posting should not be used as a control mechanism for air traffic control or nuclear facilities. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 19:51, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - satisfied them too weakly I think.... changed my thinking from the above after doing a fair bit of digging (it's amazing how many copies of Wikipedia text are out there now!!!).. I found evidence this state grants medals, honors, and possibly degrees, and added that stuff to the article. But I could not find more than that... I'm coming around to thinking that this one should be in a Minor Micronations article along with a few others. Of all the micronations out there, maybe only 10 or so deserve articles of their own. Does this one make the top ten? Now I'm thinking maybe not... so I changed my thinking. Wow that was longwinded! Deal! However I could still be convinced to change BACK.

<p><b>Delete</b>While some singles are certainly worthy of an entry in Wikipedia, this one is not. Withholding my personal reasons as to why i think this should be deleted due to it's very low "musical" quality, it is perfomed by a forgotten winner of a talent contest and didn't chart (well I thought it didn't, the author of the article seems to think it made it to 39 in the Australian top 40, &amp; he would know seeing as he has done the research) I think it should be deleted because no-one in Australia has any interest in the single or artist, let alone the rest of the world(<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhanada_85c2.html" title="User:Khanada">Khan</a> 05:13, 4 February 2006 (UTC))</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Too many singles already and I am Australian &amp; I have never heard of this song but if you read the lyrics on the net, it seems as if a four year old wrote them, "people did you come here to get nuts tonight?

<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b>There are more hits for my local restaurants &amp; real estate agents on google than "crazy people rock", should we make an article on them? Sorry MC Survery aka MC Brown Shoes, either you are Scott Cain or probably his only fan, I agree this 'song' is possibly the worst song I have ever heard but that is certainly not why I put it up for deletion, if that was the case I would be putting everything from NSYNC, Backstreet boys, Britney Spears etc up for deletion, the song itself is simply not notable enough to have its own entry in wikipedia. Your article was very well written, but I dont even think there should be an article on all the Beatles singles(which there isnt) let alone this Scott Cain person. Seriously though cant we just have less articles like this on wikipedia, where will it end? Just merge them under one article under his name. And I am not familiar with the term "gee mate"?

<li>Three of us were scheduled to meet this morning to collaborate on the entry. I posted the shell (you call stub) last night so the others could read through and prepare their thoughts - and see how the system works. We have cancelled our meeting - let us know how your vote turns out (or I guess the page will just disappear). Does seem kind of strange that promotional is OK as long as it is "notable", and that Google is used as a gauge of worthiness. --Mark 16:01, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Promotional is beside the point. The criteria is notability. If an article is promotional but the subject is notable, the stumping in the article will be removed but the article will remain. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 19:01, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article reads mostly as ad copy. Googling on Grey Out as an industry term <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%28%22grey+out%22+OR+%22gray+out%22%29+AND+%28%22tub%22+OR+%22shower%22%29&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%28%22grey+out%22+OR+%22gray+out%22%29+AND+%28%22tub%22+OR+%22shower%22%29&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">1</a> returns some hits, but the articles found seem to always mention "Tub-Rite". It seems less of an industry term and more of an advertising term for one company. <a href="../../../v/s/l/User%7EVslashg_16cb.html" title="User:Vslashg">Vslashg</a> 20:39, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article could be edited such that it focuses more on grey out, rather than solutions to get rid of it. The polymer chemistry described is patented and is not marketing hype. The frequent reference to "Tub-Rite" is where I see the potential marketing problem, and this could easily be addressed in an edit of the article.</p>

<dd>I'd be happy to correct the English, but only as part of a merge with the general hydroponics page, or as a redirection to a new page on passive hydroponics (avoiding being named after / devoted to the trademarked name). In this context I think it would be fine to mention someone who's done a lot to promote, and enable, hydro techniques to a niche audience, i.e. orchid growers. --BarryNorton 06:36, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

As the owner of this website (Unregistered to Wikipedia, though I am available via my e-mail available on the site), I can assure the above that none of my authors created this, and as such, this is in no way advertisement. Remove it if you will, but your gratuitous assumption is baseless and insulting.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I reviewed all of the links provided by those who say delete and find that the article doesn't really meet any of these reasons at all.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Keep this because people are idiots for attempting to delete something about a site. Why not delete other sites wikipedia like newgrounds.com? How about vgcats? Just because a site is specified on wikipedia doesn't mean it has to be deleted. Why don't you people who want to delete it think about every other site that is on wikipedia and attack those too. Otherwise it is being prejudice to this site only.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The WP:VSCA states advertising for small companies. Gametrash isn't a small company and as mentioned in it's description, no one at the site is paid and no advertisers pay the website to advertise on the site. The site doesn't sell any product and the article in question is simply a description of the website.</li>

<dd>was a page on a japanese actress. i'd saved a first state and was in the middle of getting info for the second when it was deleted by User:Lucky 6.9 with the rationale "So-and-so is an actress. It's also a weblink placeholder. Other than that, it's just groovy." it contained date and place of birth, kanji for the subjects name, and a filmography -- all three things IMDb currently lacks. my personal feeling is that if Luck 6.9 truly felt it should have been deleted it should have been listed in afd. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateji77_10a2.html" title="User:Nateji77">Nateji77</a> 09:44, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As the author of the page, this vote is naturally going to be percieved as biased. The comments about Gabe vs memeorandum are understandable, however, in this context Gabe is the sole founder and operator of memeorandum. Aspects of the article deserving extension (I have reclassified it to a stub) include the fact that the work undertaken so far on this project has been entirely at Gabe's expense and unfunded, and it is making a big difference to the way the many people who use the service consume their news. This is expected to increase as more people are engaged in Blogging and reading news in this way, and as such is provides an increasingly important community service for the wider internet population. With technical consideration, Gabe has developed a number of aspects of this technology and its algorithms which are highly unique, and from a commercial perspective it is quite likely that he, as a person, will receive significant notoriety in the context of a investment revival in dot com fortunes, as he is engaged in discussions for aquisition at the moment that may make him a pin-up boy for the Web 2.0 movement in a similar light to this Business 2.0 article of this month: <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/01/01/8368130/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/01/01/8368130/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> this hoax and <b>sanction</b> the hoaxing IP. Ifnord 20:29, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> His seminal work on Gadamer? The piece was narcissistic at best, at worst... Still, this having been said, both mine, and the user in question's opinion were just that, and merit no inclusion in the article, unless one can find another Philosopher (preferably of superior renown to Fischermann) who criticise him for this. I seriously doubt that anyone here who claims to know Colin Fischermann is telling the truth, the stuff on "Marcy Boy" is ridiculous, I can find no reference to Karl, or any of his relatives at all (this includes the sleeves and dedications of his book, which don't mention his family at all for some reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is more, is that this information, even if true, is utterly irrelevant to anyone beyond his immediate circle of friends, why was it included on Wikipedia in the first place? Basically, all the information on his family can, and should be cut as irrelevant, if not a hoax. However, Wikipedia should not be so hasty as to delete the entire article, the article, like his work, may have some merit in it. I think one can be reasonably sure it passes the professor test, and in theory is verifiable (Can someone upload the front cover of one of his books, or at least get me a digital camera (or not)? A photograph, like the one in the article, is not nearly enough to go on, I personally don't know what he looks like. I can see someone constructing a case for deletion based upon lack of importance within the philosophical and theological community, but constructing a case based upon the vandalism and hoaxing of one user as if that somehow condemns the entire article to being a hoax, utter rubbish! I am genuinely surprised he is not on Google, the name isn't misspelled, and from his ego-centric ramblings in "'Truth and Meaning' - forcing open Pandora's box?" he seems like the type who would love to get his name somewhere (okay, so it's opinion, it's not in the article, so I suppose he's fair game) I just looked at the deletion page, most of the comments come from one IP address, an address that has been engaged in vandalism before, and it looks like someone has been trying to get this article accepted as a hoax by creating inane additions to it. So basically, don't delete immediately, ignore the vandal, and wait for verifiability. When (if) the verification is provided, then take down the hoax tag, let users expand on the article, and then debate whether he is significant enough to have on Wikipedia. I think he’s important enough to keep on Wikipedia (just), that significant numbers of people know of his books suggests he was widely published, I’ll look into it.</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. The subject "philosophy of life" lends itself well to the original intention of Biology (the study of life) which has become a study of living things. More hard science has been done which has allowed more knowledge to be accumulated about things common to all life. "Philosophy of Life" literally means, "knowledge about life" and this is the obvious place to put that knowledge which is common to all life. This would include how Diatoms changed early Earth's atmosphere, examples of how life is found almost everywhere liquid water exists, how life survives through hostile environments, how life forms more complex life forms, what effects life has on the physical universe, etc.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 01:00, 5 February 2006 (UTC) <i><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> (<a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerryeo_1d27.html" title="User talk:Terryeo">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Terryeo_4125.html" title="Special:Contributions/Terryeo">contribs</a>) is the article's author.</i></li>

<li><b>keep</b> I don't think any article should be deleted because of how famous someone is. As long as someone can be bothered to do a page for someone, then it should remain on the site. I have already heard fellow fans of Kat recommend others to have a look at this page. I would personally like to see a page for every celebrity (no matter how big or small). I have been disappointed numerous times after searching for people I see on TV only to find that no one has created a page for them. At the moment, this is the best place for information on this person and many fans of her will be glad that there is a place to read a bit about her. She is already very popular among the viewers and is mentioned on forums as being a favourite presenter of theirs. If someone isn't on IMDB or Google, it then means that Wikipedia may be the only source of information for certain celebrities. This website will generate hits from people interested in such minor celebrities as it has information exclusive to Wikipedia, who may then go on to contibute on topics (that you deem important) that they may have new information on. I don't think it is fair to single out this article for deletion, this is missing the whole point of Wikipedia, this site is here to list information on as many things as possible (the perfect Wikipedia would be one where everything in the world that exists will have information available). Kat Shoob has many loyal viewers and fans and many people will be glad that this page exists. If you want to go around deleting things on this site, I suggest looking around video game pages and deleting all the articles on unknown characters that don't warrant a page of their own. Plus, someone needs to edit all the useless information on professional wrestler's pages. Many users go around adding what happens each week in the WWE on the pages for individual pro wrestlers without even realizing that these are all storylines that don't apply to the actual performers. If this attack is due to webspace concerns - then the definition for pages up for deletion are Wikipedia user pages - these are full of information on people who only one person in the world has heard of; theirself. A page on Wikipedia is justified even if all the information available is one sentence informing people on who someone is. Wikipedia should be a one-stop-shop for information. If someone wants to find out who Greg Scott is for example, all they need to do is type his name into Wikipedia and they will find out that he is a TV presenter on ITV1. This should apply to every celebrity imaginable. To me, the reason for Wikipedia's existence is to be a superior source of information to everything else, due to the fact that it can be a source of information on subjects or people that would never find themselves in a published encyclopaedia. (Someone like John Cena (the wrestler and music star) is hugely popular but would never make it into an actual encyclopaedia even though people would be interested in reading about him). It is my personal opinion that pages like this; <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindel.html" title="Sindel">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindel</a> on fictional characters in a videogame, are ridiculous and totally undeserving of their own entry, but it's not about what individual people find worthy. Some people feel it is interesting and worthwhile information. People with nothing more than a single spoken line in a film should have pages. There will always be someone who searches for some obscure celebrity that neither me or you knows in an attempt to find extra information and it's only going to increase Wikipedia's relevance in the grand scheme of the Internet. Wikipedia is about bringing all information togther in one place, not about deciding who's fit to be included. Maybe if Kat left the industry and wasn't employed for a certain length of time, I could see a reason for deleting this article. But while ever she is in the public eye (in any capacity), then there is no real reason to get rid of this page. To summarise then, the contributions people make are to improve Wikipedia, I don't see how deleting information will make Wikipedia a better website. ---<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.bonus_7fef.html" title="User:Mr.bonus">Mr.bonus</a> 21:46, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Go Ahead and Abuse Your Power</b> Like I didn't know this was coming (deleting it without any more discussion). Just because you can't accept that these are valid points and you are nothing mre than people who waste their lives on the Internet by going round looking for something to do to feel important. Where does it end? You can't possibly find, warn and then delete all pages that you don't feel are relevant (I've seen hundreds just like my own) and if you didn't stumble across it, you would be none the wiser and it would still be up there. Bottom line is you want more red links throughout this site than blue ones. If Wiki follows the same rules as regular encyclopaedias then I suggest you lot of fools make it your life-long career to go and remove the piles of trash people have written about fighting game, RPG and Anime characters, unknown companies such as Sit-Up, and some random videogame (almost any one that can be named) that has more text written about it than all the world's politicians combined. These certainly wouldn't justify inclusion in the encyclopaedia Brittanica. Even though the amount of garbage on this site makes a mockery of what you have done to my page and what is written on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> if that's what this site is "supposed" to stick to, I'm not contributing anything more (even though I have rewritten sections of "important" articles that you would deem worthy), It's a pointless exercise. I only discovered Wiki recently but it is not what I thought it was. It turns out it's just a terribly sub-standard version of actual encyclopaedias, with no distinct selling-point and a place that Internet amoebas populate and destroy just the same as any forum. So go ahead and delete the page it's not like I'm ever going to return here and while you are at it go and delete your webspace wasting user-profile that nobody with anything resembling a life gives a toss about. And look at this; the only person that says 'Don't Delete' doesn't possess a user profile. That speaks volumes. The only proof you need to see that you singled out my page solely to abuse your 'power' and delete it, is this; you use the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> against me in order to justify my page's deletion, yet ignore it completely when you want to create a page about <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Kid_6b75.html" title="Star Wars Kid">Star Wars Kid</a> or any given wrstler from OVW (a non-televised wrestling promotion). If you pretend it doesn't exist in these circumstances, it allows you to make a page about such a worthless non-entities. Which catergorization from the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> are people abusing to allow random porn 'stars' to be included? Pornstars can't be seen in any mainstream media. My article is about someone who can be seen on British TV every week.. This site is a complete mockery. You can't apply these rules to one page but not to another. Why the HELL I persist with the Internet when it's full of people like you lot I have no idea......<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 86.129.40.122 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.129.40.122_2b4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.129.40.122">contribs</a>) 19:29, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> I find it curious that more 'commercial' podcasts such as TWIT and Diggnation are happily seen as notable. Those guys make a living off of what they do and the GamersDaily hosts make <b>nothing</b> whatsoever, they do this for their passion of videogames. I can understand that Wikipedia is not a a web directory, but it <b>is</b> meant to be an encyclopedic record of the world we live in, which includes podcasts, one of the fastest rising methods of people having their say on the world around them. Given that GamersDaily do get the number of listeners they do (and can prove it), as well as lasting as far as 52 episodes to date with no signs of letting up, I do not see the grounds for which they are non-notable whatsoever. They are just as notable as any other podcast of its age and fanbase.</li>
<li><b>KEEP!</b> For all the people who say "Not Notable" why not shut up and listen to Episode 52.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Low on production values, but high on content - this podcast is relavent.</li>

<p>Weaselriffic. This is a review of Halo 2, not an article about a controversy. Currently, it's pure original research, and laden with weasel words. Rather than a description of a groundswell of negative criticism, it's a laundry list of complaints, some of which are vague and purely aesthetic (e.g. "Other fans complained that the plot of Halo 2 was less appealing than that of Halo.")</p>
<p>I would suggest that it be merged into <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html" title="Halo 2">Halo 2</a>, but that article is already a trainwreck, and this useless pile of OR and weasel words would do little to improve it.

<dd>This list has only just been created (and is still work in progress) - to split up the former parent page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom_2206.html" title="List of Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom">List of Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom</a>.

<li>1. 6 month (or a different interval) segments.</li>
<li>2. By SI number - so grouping perhaps 1-1000, 1001-2000 etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>These separate pages could then be linked to from each other as a "page 2", "page 3" link etc.</p>
<p>The idea I had was that (eventually - when someone wants to create the pages) the most important/controversial/interesting etc. pieces of legislation could be linked to internally, as well as providing the links to the full-text versions of the legislation (externally). We cannot host the full-text versions here as they are crown copyright. The other items in the list are useful as a resource.</p>

<dd>But the external links are only there to provide full-text versions of the Instruments (as they are Crown Copyright and cannot be reproduced in full here).

<li><b>Keep</b> SI's are important, and there is no reason to justify deleting them.

<li><b>Delete</b> this and related pages: there is one for 1995, 1992, 1996 etc.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Reasons like "this ridiculous list"; "Statutory instruments are by definition non-notable - if the issue is important an Act of Parliament is required instead."; "The list is already available on the OPSI website"; "is basically listcruft, with no encyc. nor useful content" show that those claiming them are either ignorant of Wikipedia's policies or of what SIs are. There are many lists that I would consider "ridiculous" on Wikipedia and yet I have never nominated them for deletion. Claiming deletion on that basis is not in line with Wikipedia policy. Claiming that SIs are by definition non-notable is extremely ignorant. A great deal of important legislation in the UK is promulgated by SIs. For example much of current copyright law, road sign law, standards for road vehicles, and pretty much all EU legislation is implemented via SIs. The SIs with (Amendment) and the like in the title do tend to be less important, but that is not a reason for excluding them from the list. It is a reason for not writing an article about them yes, but not for excluding them from the list. The list on the OPSI website is reproduced here at the moment, but if you take a look at the list you will see that there are many, many, many gaps in the numbering sequence. As Richard B says, this is those SIs published in 1996, which number about 2,100 Instead of there being 2,100 odd SIs, there are a large number of local SIs not listed on the OPSI website. I know of no easily accessible list of those but having one on Wikipedia would be useful for those who try and track legislation. Wikipedia is indeed not merely a collection of external links, but many of those SIs could easily have articles written about them. Failing that they could be redirected to main articles, say about copyright law for example. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>, and while this list could perhaps be further sub-divided to make it less unwieldy there is no call for deleting it. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 16:40, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

If he's elected, we should definitely include an article, but until then, I'm not too sure.

<li>Welcome to Wikipedia! We generally don't include biographies on politicians unless they recieve significant press attention or until they've been elected. Someone running for an office doesn't guarantee that they should recieve an article; once s/he is elected, then things may change. The reason the other one isn't marked for deletion is because no one has noticed it until now; I'm going to nominate it for deletion right now.
