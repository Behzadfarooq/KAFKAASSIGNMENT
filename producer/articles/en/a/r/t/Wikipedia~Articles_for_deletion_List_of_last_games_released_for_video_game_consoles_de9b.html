<p>Listcruft. There's no significance attributed to the <i>last</i> game for a console. If anything, I think it might just be indicative of what company was slowest to get their product to market, and nothing more. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 03:32, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a list of trivia. As the nom says, there is no encyclopaedic significance associated with being the last game for a console. GassyGuy 06:51, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If we can have a <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launch_title.html" title="Launch title">launch title</a> article, which lists all the first games for consoles, then why can't we devote a page to the <i>last</i> games of each console? There are so many other lists filled with semi-obscure information on the site that I can't see how this one isn't valid too. Phediuk 20:44, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Quite a few of those should be deleted. Plus, your logic could be used to justify any article. "We have a game on the first and last games for consoles, so why can't we devote a page to the <i>ninth</i> game of each console?" GassyGuy 23:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> The reason we shouldn't have this article is because there's no <i>significance</i> to the last game for a platform. The <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launch_title.html" title="Launch title">launch title</a> article asserts the significance of these games by saying "Because they provide first impressions of the console's features and technical abilities, they are extremely important in the video game industry, and many launch titles have been killer games." <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 03:31, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. The last games released for consoles typically give us a look at the maximum potential of those consoles (as they are released at a time when developers have mastered a system's hardware), and also show us the extent of the support/lifespan of that console. In that respect, they are significant. Phediuk 14:05, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If this article is about the life cycle of a console, then it should be about the life cycle of a console and the last game released for that console is irrelevant. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 23:17, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Expand</b> The problem as it stands now is that it's so small. I hate to throw around the word 'useful', but it's actually something that could be used as a point of research, which is what an encyclopedia is for, is it not? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 12:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Extremely useful, as it's a great way to show and compare the commercial "lifespan" of each system. I don't understand the nominator's reasoning, especially the part about being slowest to market. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:10, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. What I meant by that is the <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launch_title.html" title="Launch title">launch title</a> for a console is a big deal. It's probably chosen because it showcases the capabilities of the new hardware, and there is often a lot of buzz surrounding them and their release is highly anticipated. Not so with the last game for a platform. I doubt a lot of production companies have "Yay, we're last!" parties. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 03:31, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe they aren't throwing parties, but the last games let us see how long and extensively a console's life cycle is, and they mark the end of support for a given console (marking the transition to the next generation of consoles.) In that respect, they are significant and are deserving of recognition. Phediuk 22:15, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<li><b>Merge</b> trivia factoids to respective console main articles. Not much use combined in a list. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:03, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This info belongs in the individual articles for each system. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocSigma_1aee.html" title="User:DocSigma"><b><big><sub><font color="#0000FF" face="comic sans ms">Doc Sigma</font></sub></big></b></a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDocSigma_6857.html" title="User talk:DocSigma"><font color="#888888" face="arial"><sup>(wait, what?)</sup></font></a> 14:08, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Expand</b> This is useful and interesting information. There just needs to be more of it and it needs to be sourced. Phediuk 14:09, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'll be honest, I think this information would be better with the "First and Last" releases, to get a view of the system lifespan, and I think it's missing some notable consoles, like the Atari and Sega ones. Sure, this information could be in the individual console articles, but consolodating it is useful too. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:45, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would state that any system that doesn't have the info certainly should -- and without even checking would be willing to bet all the ones listed do; however, I still think that this list is worthwhile as stand alone info consoludated into one article, as well. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 15:58, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Weak reason for deleting an article. The "don't need" reasoning can be applied to anything on the site. Phediuk 22:21, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom; worst-case, <b>merge</b> per Bwithh. "Interesting" is a highly subjective but non-encyclopedic criterion, which is much more indicative of triviality than anything. As for "useful", which is also rather subjective, beyond the mere assertion that it is I don't buy that this is any more useful than any other trivia or indiscriminate material. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:42, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Launch titles have some verifiable significance; last games released have none except that being projected/ginned up here. Listcruft. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:26, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "verifiable" problem is easily solved through sourcing, which is the only problem with this lsit right now. As for significance, my other comments sum up my view nicely: "the last games let us see how long and extensively a console's life cycle is, and they mark the end of support for a given console (marking the transition to the next generation of consoles.) In that respect, they are significant and are deserving of recognition." Phediuk 22:19, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (or <b>merge</b>). The mere fact that something is potentially <i>interesting</i> does not mean that it belongs in an encyclopedia. Unlike lists of launch titles, lists of last titles can be extremely hard to verify, and may even become inaccurate without anyone noticing if a minor geographically-restricted release occurs after an entry for a console has been added. In short, unmaintainable. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 09:16, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, failing that <b>Merge</b> into respective console articles. These are valuable factoid when discussing the consoles in question; I'm not sure if needs an article if we're just listing the <i>very last</i> releases. Would be a very interesting article if it listed <i>some</i> of the very last releases, as well as the <i>conditions</i> that transpired (<i>Sunday Funday</i> is an unlicenced game, what's the last <i>licenced</i> release for NES? What was that homebrew game again that was released for Jaguar years later and sold in US and profits went to charity, if my memory doesn't fail me?) but even then, these factoids are <i>probably</i> best if they're stowed in the individual machine articles. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 15:05, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
