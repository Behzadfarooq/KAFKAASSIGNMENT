<li><b>Comment</b> This article is a mess and need some TLC. The subject is a journalist (not really an author per nomination), and some of his articles have been about Wikipedia and controversy around lack of accuaracy in our articles. Clearly the refererences within the article to G-hits etc. is odd, but telling as to potential notabillty. Why is the professor test being citied above? I don't see any reference to a teaching career. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 22:13, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There has been a lot of work done to the article this afternoon by the original author and myself. WP notability is not a rigid nor rigorous standard. This subject has won an award for his journalism, is a recognized expert who is invited to speak at hi-tech conferences, moderates panels, and has developed a second source of notability as an author and expert on the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Man_8f2f.html" title="Burning Man">Burning Man</a> festival. Along with this there is an assumption of notability that can be inferred from the hi G-hits. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 01:42, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Better, and no longer <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>, but I am still unconvinced. His award is from the local chapter of a notable organization. I don't think this rises to the level of awards suitable for determining notability by Wikipedia standards. As for the book, <a href="http://www.dramainthedesert.com/project_credits.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dramainthedesert.com/project_credits.html" rel="nofollow">his contribution</a> was as one of three members of the "Prose Editorial Team" and one of over <i>30</i> "writing contributors". It is also the <a href="http://www.raisedbarnpress.com/products.html" class="external text" title="http://www.raisedbarnpress.com/products.html" rel="nofollow">only product</a> by its publisher, which appears to be basically the <a href="http://www.raisedbarnpress.com/mission.html" class="external text" title="http://www.raisedbarnpress.com/mission.html" rel="nofollow">personal project</a> of the book's producer, Holly Kreuter. He has written a lot, because he's a staff writer. He has a lot of Google hits because he's a staff writer for outlets that provide their material online. Nearly all longtime staff writers for the <i>Washington Post</i> or the <i>New York Times</i> would have similar Google footprints, for example, but probably also do not meet the current notability standards. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 03:00, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(ec) Journalists are governed by the base <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which requires, roughly, multiple independant coverage of the person's work. Terdiman is a prolific journalist, and seems very likely to be the kind of person who will evenetually meet the standards, but <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">doesn't yet</a>. Whether or not <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> serves the best intentions of the encyclopedia is <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">a separate issue</a> from the article at hand.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not going to vote quite yet until i think about this one, but I want to note that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s mention of the "professor test" (which is included there, not simply in the notability for academics) does not specifically state that the person needs to actually be a professor or academic. The article in question <i>does</i> assert that this journalist is an expert in certain fields, which would seem to be close enough to argue for it on this basis. I also note that the professor test, which merely requires that a person be more published than the "average college professor" is a fairly low bar (I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the "average" professor probably publishes zilch, or close to it...) <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 14:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - He doesn't seem any more published than <i>any</i> local reporter though (who normally writes a story or two every day). All of the "sources" given in the article are either written by him or merely mention him in passing, certainly <i>not</i> fulfilling the "primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works" central criterion. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 20:51, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Wickethewok, the <i>"primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works" central criterion</i> which you cite above is prefaced with the statement: <i>"This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted."</i> We have evidence that he is notable in other ways.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The references became confusing when they were moved into the footnote feature and the subjects were masking the more pertinent sources. The format has been changed so that the footnotes more clearly describe valid support for WP:BIO.</li>
<li>The most notable single item is his award -- multiple (two or more) awards or reviews would make him notable per WP BIO. Serpent disparages the award above, but WP BIO doesn't say that it has to be a national or international award. We need another award or review.</li>
<li>I think that we could to look at the Businessweek discussion of his expertise along with his mention/demonstration as an expert in game technology as a cumulative review by multiple non-trivial sources.</li>
<li>Per WP Notability, <i>"Notable here means "worthy of</i> <b>being noted" or "attracting notice"</b>, <i>not "important" or "famous". It is not synonymous with fame or importance. It is not measured by Wikipedia editors' own subjective judgements. It is not "newsworthiness".</i> This subject has clearly attracted notice as exemplified by the discussion of him online and many references to his work in blogs etc.</li>
<li>If I won't be chastized for citing blog material, I can give a bunch of references to his notability, but I have avoided this source. Most of what I'm hearing here is that we need to establish <i>"importance"</i> and that clearly contradicts the guidelines.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and continue the cleanup (which seems to be going well). Not every journalist is notable - showing up in the New York Times as a one-off contributor may not establish notability in the same way that it would if he were the subject of the article. But here the person seems to be a widely published journalist with work in major publications. It's possible in some cases that a person can write for one or two of these publications without becoming notable (if he were, say, nothing but a journeyman). But I don't think that's the case here. Given the breadth of publication of his work, it seems that he meets the WP:BIO standards. I think it should be kept, and want to thank those editors involved in the cleanup effort - good work, guys.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 01:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The following links represents the articles about Terdiman found in the first 6 pages of Yahoo listings (60 listings) on a search for “Daniel Terdiman”; there are <s>8</s> 7 articles which are about him rather than by him, this represents about <s>13</s>12%,. Considering the thousands of g-hits on hundreds of pages, this demonstrates that a lot of people are talking about Dan T. and/or his work.

<li><b>Re claim of expert on Second Life.</b> Here is the quote from Business Week: <i>"I also owe a great debt to</i> <b>several writers who have pioneered coverage</b> <i>of what are now very real places to millions of people: Julian Dibbell, author of My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World, about his experiences in the classic text-based world LambdaMOO, and also author of the upcoming book Play Money; Edward Castronova, author of the essential book on online games, Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games;</i> <b>and CNET writer Daniel Terdiman, who seems to cover every significant issue inside Second Life.</b>" Within the context of the article this seems to assert his expertise, but maybe there is a better way to describe his knowledge of Second Life. Any ideas? --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 14:18, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> as now revised. I really do not see why the professor test was invoked. He's ot a professor. He's a broadcast journalist. If he were a professor of journalism it might be applicable, but he isnt. Apparently there is some idea that everyone who gets a masters degree is a professor. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:14, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
