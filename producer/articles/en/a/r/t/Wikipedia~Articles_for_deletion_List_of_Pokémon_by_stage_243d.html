<li><b>Keep (Partly)</b> - The National Dex one has to stay, even if its the only one that does. But personally I feel List of Pokemon by stage should stay, it is different enough. As it clearly shows pokemon evolutions all on the same page. National dex order, with the new evolutions of old pokemon, wouldn't do this. But the other three could probably go.

<dd>It's a good idea to cover the several Pokedexes, as it's perfectly reasonable to assume that users could look articles up using any of them. I can't see a convenient way to merge them into one big list, either. As long as it's reasonable that people are using these to find the information they're looking for, I see no reason not to keep them. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:45, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It isn't Wikipedia's fault there are several Pokedexes. The reason the "regional" Poxedexes exist is since the collection mechanic is integral to the games, but not every Pokemon will fit in every game (especially the original Game Boy ones). By having regional Pokedexes, gamers can feel like they "caught them all" even though they only collected the ones in their particular game. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> The different classifications are useful. For example, if someone is only interested in the first generation, there will be no mention of Munchlax or Smoochum and so on. The one by stage is useful too. And by name is quite useful as well, because people are more likely to know the names rather than the numbers. The ones by individual pokedex could be put on the same page. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelritchie200_69e6.html" title="User:Michaelritchie200">Michaelritchie200</a> 17:56, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>: I think something some people don't realize is that these aren't just the same lists with all the Pokémon rearranged. The lists contain different <i>sets of Pokémon</i> that can only reasonably be sorted into separate lists.

<li>They are all needed. They can't be merged as they are too long. Aslo they are not the same list they are the lists based on each generation. National is the only one that is compleate becuse it is the only one that has them all. NOTHING SHOULD CHANGE!!! (Translation KEEP!)

<li><b>Keep</b> Stage article, <b>Merge</b> Number and Name articles per DanPMK; I would suggest merging them into an article with a title like "List of Pokémon by number" or into the National article. Also, I would like to <b>comment</b> that I was the one who separated these lists in the first place. The reason was that with all these lists - listed seperately, mind you, with a section for National and a section for Jhoto and so forth - made a gigantic and rather cumbersome article. Putting everything on a table and arranging them by either National number or alphabetically would solve that problem rather nicely. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparky_the_Seventh_Chaos_dc6c.html" title="User:Sparky the Seventh Chaos">Sparky Lurkdragon</a> 10:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Addemendum: In my haste to explain myself, I forgot my rationale for keeping the Stage list. Well, while the various number lists just present the Pokemon reordered by whatever strange whims the designers had in the different generations (and Jhoto doesn't even <i>have</i> numbers, per se), Stage presents an entirely different set of information, and personally I like seeing the different evolutionary families arranged in an easy-to-see manner. I wouldn't be crushed if the final decision was to add a 'Stage' column to DanPMK's table, but I'd prefer the Stage list to stand on its own. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparky_the_Seventh_Chaos_dc6c.html" title="User:Sparky the Seventh Chaos">Sparky Lurkdragon</a> 10:35, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> per <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanPMK_ec28.html" title="User:DanPMK">DanPMK</a>. This person's got the right idea. The pokemon would come, most importantly, in National Dex number, while still keeping their other dex numbers. Alphabetical order is completely useless; that was the one that should have been nominated, not National Dex order. The only list left is the by stage. That can be merged onto the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_evolution.html" title="Pokémon evolution">Pokémon evolution</a> page, possibly. It can replace the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_evolution.html#External_links" title="Pokémon evolution">external links</a> on that page (both of which are already obsolete). It is, after all, a chart relating directly to Pokémon evolution. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!">You Can't See Me!</a> 04:57, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Looking back on what I wrote, it doesn't seem very clear. What I mean is to merge the Dex-ordered articles together in DanPMK's neat little table, merge the Stage list with <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_evolution.html" title="Pokémon evolution">Pokémon evolution</a>, and delete the Names list altogether, even though <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_name_5344.html" title="List of Pokémon by name">List of Pokémon by name</a> was not nominated for deletion (I still don't see why National Dex, the most commonly used pokemon order, was nominated, but not alphabetical order, which is rarely used with pokemon). Hopefully that was less vague. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!">You Can't See Me!</a> 05:04, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That really doesn't seem that useful. It seems much too jumbled and the numbers by themselves are pretty pointless. I think it would just be better to leave the other numbers out of the National Dex, and just delete the other Dex pages. If someone wants a number, they can just look at the single Pokémon articles.<a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 21:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It can still be useful. Just because it will end up ordered only one way doesn't mean that one should ignore the other ways it can be ordered. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!">You Can't See Me!</a> 23:04, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems like it'll just cause clutter to me. Take a look at DanPMK's test page. It looks really squished and untidy. If the other pages are deleted, the information just ends up being pointless. If we're going to keep the numbers, we might as well add the types or something.
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, it looks rather clumsy and confusing. The internal Hoenn numbers are there so there won't be blank spaces, but if we add Shinou numbers, there WILL be blanks, since it doesn't have internal Shinou numbers past 151. Adding the types would mean we would have to keep the page one vertical column, or else it would be too wide. This would make it far too long. As of now, the page is very large. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanPMK_ec28.html" title="User:DanPMK">DanPMK</a> 06:43, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The adding the types comment was to show how pointless the numbers are. Alone, they really aren't that important, so if we're going to remove those lists, I think the numbers should just be on the single pages. And just think how ugly it'll look with all of the blank spaces. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 10:14, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b>, failing that, <b>Keep</b>. Listing Pokémon in order they're listed in various games <i>is</i> a reasonable excuse to set up a list in my opinion. Not sure if they warrant their own articles <i>even</i> if it means there'll be a huge article.
