<li><b>Comment</b> A lot of the voters here don't seem to understand why this was listed for deletion. The <i>current</i> notablility of the subject is not being argued. The <i>future</i> notability is. I quite doubt that this case will have any lasting impact on anything, or that anybody will remember or care about it in four months. --<a href="../../../a/u/r/User%7EAurochs_96ed.html" title="User:Aurochs">Aurochs</a> (<a href="../../../a/u/r/User_talk%7EAurochs_1f75.html" title="User talk:Aurochs">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Aurochs_092d.html" title="Special:Blockip/Aurochs">Block</a>)</li>

<li><b>Well, it has been SIX days and there is no consensus to delete. Not including comments and sockpuppets, There are 8 votes to KEEP, 4 votes to DELETE, 1 Vote to DELETE/REDIRECT, and 1 OBJECTION. Adding in the 7 sockpuppet votes, there would be 15 votes to KEEP, and still only 4(5) votes to DELETE. 8-4 (or 15-4) do not make a consensus to delete, and this page should be KEPT, and the AfD notice removed. I have to go and do something at the moment, and only have a few minutes to write this, but, if it's not done sometime soon, I'll review the AfD policy and follow the instructions to remove it myself.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a> 04:03, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</b>
<ul>
<li>I count 8 keeps and 6 deletes (57%-43%) so I guess there is no consensus and it should be kept. I disagree but such is the result of the process. Hopefully the article will someday be a true biograpical article but I don't see how. So, does a moderator close the debate and remove the AfD notice after verifying the vote and eligibilities to vote or does it fall to the nominator (me)? It was my first nomination and I'm still not sure about the procedure in full.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 16:05, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, There is nothing objectionable about it. Even though she is a minor, her name has already made it into the news. This article has not exposed anything new that would cause further harm, but has instead stuck to a news-based perspective. This article is based on the publicly known facts of the case and has refrained from making judgements on the case. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 150.201.116.125 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_150.201.116.125_b1a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/150.201.116.125">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>The AfD isn't about objectionability so much as relevance. Kara Borden is not deemed relevant enough to have a Wikipedia article at this time, and probably will never meet that standard (what seperates her from the thousands of other children of murdered people who don't happen to have Wikipedia articles?) --<a href="../../../a/u/r/User%7EAurochs_96ed.html" title="User:Aurochs">Aurochs</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; Her name is all over the place anyway. We don't know that she is a victim yet, and if she is, as unfortunate as this may be, her name will continue to be all over the news until this nightmare is over.
