<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This manhunt is making news beyond just Upstate New York. Even if Phillips is considered to be an obscure thug, this story has made national news. It's been the top story in western and central New York for months and it's been well-reported in neighboring regions (one of which I am writing from). To approach it from another angle, there are hundreds -- if not thousands -- of Wikipedia articles dealing with items of only regional interest (which, by the way, contributes to Wikipedia's greatness, in my opinion). If this article is deleted for lack of notoriety, there are hundreds of others that must be deleted for the same reason.</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. This man is the most wanted man in New York State right now, having killed one state trooper and critically wounded two others since escaping prison 5 months ago. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 01:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> certainly passes the verifiability test, though notability is a little fuzzier. This may be a case where we should keep for now, then re-visit the issue in a few years to see how it holds up. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 02:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I would say this is definitely notable enough to keep for now. This was a top story on www.cnn.com a few hours ago. 5 Months on the lam after breaking out of prison is a lot. The article needs some serious wikifying and clean-up, but I suspect this story is (or will be) nearly on the footing of an <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Robert_Rudolph_420e.html" title="Eric Robert Rudolph">Eric Robert Rudolph</a> or the like. I agree with Starblind that we should keep it and see how much more coverage it gets. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIrongargoyle_444b.html" title="User:Irongargoyle">Irongargoyle</a> 02:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The title should also be changed. His name is Ralph Phillips, Bucky is just his nickname. So if the article stays it should probably be re-names to Ralph "Bucky" Phillips since that is how his name is being displayed. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 02:18, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><del><b>Transwiki</b>.</del> My suggestion&#160;: the text currently in the article should be moved to Wikinews, while a (preferably short) article on Bucky should be left here. The article should contain a sentence each of 1) who Bucky is, 2) what crime he has done that made him NY State's most wanted man, and 3) his current status as a wanted criminal. And it should cite references and further reading from Google news searches etc. Add a current event template and a link to the Wikinews entry, and that should round it up nicely. Nevertheless the text currently in the article is most definitely unencyclopedic, since it is original research IMHO. But it is a nice <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_style.html#Feature_style" title="News style">feature article</a> (without a d); which belongs in Wikinews. --<a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemi4_b950.html" title="User:Lemi4">Lemi4</a> 02:19, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Seeing as with all the cleanup already done, I'm switching my vote to <b>Keep</b>. The way I see it, it seems that we pretty much have a consensus that Bucky Boy's significantly encyclopedic enough. Can an Admin confirm this? What else is needed to close this case? --<a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemi4_b950.html" title="User:Lemi4">Lemi4</a> 11:18, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>* He was the top story on all the news channels today. He has been on the national news. He has shot 3 police officers and been on the lam for months. $250,000 reward is on his head. New York's most wanted criminal. Even after he is caught he will still be notable. KEEP! At least for now. Alot of people are interested in him. I live in PA, and at the state line they have a roadblock set up looking for him.

<li><b>Keep</b> To me, this is a very relevant current event. I don't really understand why it would be deleted. This site is a place I went to for more information about the man. I'm from the area he's alleged to be hiding out in. I want the kind of info this site may be able to provide. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.61.74.96 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.61.74.96_791e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.61.74.96">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Its an outrage that this article is considered for deletion. A few days ago, this article did not exist. I came tonight to make one as I heard of the news of one of the NYS Troopers deaths. The article does really need clean up, but its our duty to keep it up. <a href="../../../z/r/u/User%7EZrulli_8ff1.html" title="User:Zrulli">Zrulli</a> 06:49, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article really should be kept. This story has just recently made national news and should be kept on the basis of him shooting a state trooper. Also, federal agencies have now become involved. It should be kept, but should be edited and improved. Mfullererie 07:35, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, unencyclopedic. I'm sorry for the family of the trooper he shot, but Wikipedia is an <i>international encyclopedia</i>, not an American current-events site, and this story seems to be of interest only to a limited section of Americans. Moreover, Wikipedia is not a current-events site at all: that's why Wikinews exists.<br />
The inability of most of the posters above to admit that this is not what an encyclopedia is for will inevitably lead to this being kept for now, but I propose re-listing it in a couple of months, not a couple of years -- because I'm willing to bet that's how long it'll take for him to be forgotten, even by the limited section of Wikipedia's users who have ever registered his existence. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 11:42, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable and newsworthy. Yes, Wikipedia is an international site, but that doesn't mean we ignore things of "regional" interest otherwise half the TV show articles, and virtually all articles on politicians, philanthropists, etc. would have to go too. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:39, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I really have to agree with the importance of keeping articles of regional interest; one of the greatest thingsd of wikipedia is learning about things that aren't popular or in the news anywhere near you, but still significant. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 18:48, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I'm a reporter who has been following the Phillips manhunt for the last 5 months, and am surprised it's taken so long for Wikipedia to have an article on the subject. When this ends, Phillips will die among the ranks of some of the most successful fugitives in American history. The national news has already begun covering this, though I'm surprised it took them so long as well, so it's by no means just of a "regional" interest. I have not come across a single fugitive's story that has been the same as Phillips'. — Pfanelli <small><a href="../../../p/f/a/User_talk%7EPfanelli_6cbb.html" title="User talk:Pfanelli">Talk</a></small> 11:32, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>STRONG KEEP - This fugitive is number 1 on the New York most wanted list with current reward of $250,000 and has been on the run for months on a mission. There is enough interest in his cause to justify this entry.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Irongargoyle. I did a quick removal of POV and unencyclopedic content, but this article needs to be completely rewritten; the text appears to be a copyvio <a href="http://www.amw.com/fugitives/case.cfm?id=39219" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amw.com/fugitives/case.cfm?id=39219" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 18:39, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Apparently Nufy has excised the violating material, so I'm changing it to <b>Keep</b>. This guy is a most-wanted fugitive in a state with a population larger than many countries.

<li><b>Keep</b>There are numerous sources, the events surrounding Phillips are notable, he is quickly developing into a cultural symbol in nearby areas (an entirely seperate reason for an article). Also, this is an article about a person, so it would not fit in at Wikinews. In responce the Haeleth's comments, this version of Wikipedia is in english, intended for all english-speakers, of which America makes up a significant portion. I would non delete an article of equal importance elsewhere, but it would obviously recieve less attention if it occured in a non-english-speaking country. <a href="../../../u/r/u/User%7EUrukagina_64db.html" title="User:Urukagina">Urukagina</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> media has publicized him. In a month or two run if through AfD and see if it survives. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickieee_7713.html" title="User:Nickieee">Nickieee</a> 19:38, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is the biggest manhunt in New York State since something like 1973. This has been huge news in Upstate New York for months now, and longer he goes without being caught, the bigger it is getting. As Nickieee said, lets wait another month or so and then see whether or not this will remain wiki-worthy. At this very moment, however, it is. <a href="../../../s/k/u/User%7ESkudrafan1_6e41.html" title="User:Skudrafan1">Skudrafan1</a> 21:24, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep,</b> though with a bit of Clean-Up. He's a nationally-publicized (via "America's Most Wanted") wanted fugitive accused of shooting three law enforcement officials (one fatally) who has (unfortunately) been perceived as some kind of rouge (anti-?) hero. Personally, I think the article here is warranted and doesn't put him in some unjustly deserved positive light, maybe it will even keep people looking for him. Plus I'd like to say (&amp; No Offense Intended) that I think the "Wikipedia is international, not just American" &amp; "not a current-events site" are silly, to put it mildly.

<li><b>Keep</b> This guy is making nation headlines on CNN and MSNBC, he shot 3 state troopers and killed one.this should be kept. Waluigi300 21:10, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep,</b> he is of partial Native American ancestry &amp; has been traveling between 3 different Native Amarican territories in Western New York. This is a much different situation than if he were, say, a non-Native American just finding refuge in 3 different counties in the state. While these territories are not out-of-bounds to the rest of the public there is a pronounced difference in culture inside the territory. The most that any non-Native American usually sees is the gas station/cigarette store right inside the territory. If you are not a Native American &amp; you go driving farther into the territory, you are going to be noticed. If this event is cast in the light of the historical events over the past 50 years (that have profoundly affected the Native American territories in this region), one can gain understanding of the reasons why he would be sheltered &amp; befriended for most of his time on the run. <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECabreet_0427.html" title="User:Cabreet">Cabreet</a> 01:33, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
