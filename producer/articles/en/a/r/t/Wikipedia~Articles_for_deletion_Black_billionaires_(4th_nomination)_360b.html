<li><b>Delete</b> as trivial. The ethnicity of a billionaire is an arbitrary distinction, like billionares over 6 feet tall. There are also problems over who should be called black, as seen on the talk page. Finally, it could spawn other articles, like Asian American billionaires, German billionaires or articles based upon religion, like Catholic billionaires or Mormon billionaires. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 08:38, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I forgot to mention original research, as the information is culled from a wide variety of sources that are not on the subject of black billionaires, but just mention the person's wealth or are about the state of blacks in general (none of the sources I checked (about half of them) were specifically about the subject of black billionaires, but there might be a couple).</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with Kjkolb, however I also have to look at the fact that people may use this article for research purposes for specifically looking for black billionaires. Ideally, I would make a new article called List of billionaires by ethnicity (see:<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_billionaires_by_nationality.html" title="List of billionaires by nationality">List of billionaires by nationality</a>) to avoid singling out just black people and have it list actual names instead of just numbers. Perhaps the page could be moved to the new name, and have what is currently there under a section for black people, and allow others to add people of other ethnicities. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 11:20, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, but thanks for nominating it. Everytime this article gets nominated for deletion, it comes out better-sourced, better-writen, and better-balanced. One more nom. and we'll have a GA.

<li><i>Poorly written</i> isn't a criterion for deletion, but rather for improvement.

<li>The article alludes to the fact that being a <i>black</i> billionaire is especially notable because black people were uniformly denied economic opportunity until the 1960s (that's not my POV, that's history, see <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crow_laws_6b62.html" title="Jim Crow laws">Jim Crow laws</a>, etc.).

<dd>Comment (in reply to Coasttocoast): People should not be denied the right to write about an issue just because there is nothing worthwhile to say about a corresponding white phenomenon. If such a policy is reinforced, wiki contributors better get busy composing articles about white civil rights movements, white minority struggles, white racial profiling (uhm, and how about an article on DWW, "driving while white"?), or the corresponding article about such issues in the black community would risk being deleted or not given a place. There is nothing remarkable whatsoever about being included in the rank of the billionaires while being a white male, the reason being that the odds are stacked in your favor. Beating the odds makes for notability. I also want to add: if a child is told to stop dreaming and set realistic goals because there is no such thing as a black billionaire, in my opinion that child should be able to type the phrase "black billionaires" into a search engine and a wiki article should pop up that addresses this issue in a NPOV, encyclopedic, as well as non-Eurocentric, way. And that child should not have to search through a long list of billionaires to try to figure things out. <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPia_L_f99c.html" title="User:Pia L">Pia</a> 23:50, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If you can find multiple, reliable sources about white billionaires specifically, feel free to write the article. I suspect you'd have a dilly of a time getting such an article past <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> unlike this article, which passes it with flying colours. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:45, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Very strong Keep</b> This article is extremely necessary and an excellent addition to numerous wikipedia categories including pan-africanism, development, lists of people by wealth, Africa related lists, and just about anything relating to race, economics, black issues or any combination of the above. If we can have articles called <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_military_and_naval_figures_by_wealth_at_death_58fb.html" title="List of British military and naval figures by wealth at death">List of British military and naval figures by wealth at death</a> we can most certainly have an article on Black billionaires, especially since, as Mareino pointed out, being Black and a billionaire is especially noteworthy because until very recently Blacks were institutionally excluded in many countries like virtually no other race, and with the possible exception of certain dictators (which Forbes could not confirm) Black billionaires did not even exist until the 21st century; so for members of the most historically oppressed race to reach to reach the pinnacle of success in a trait as universally worshipped as wealth is noteworthy in the extreme. This topic is even more noteworthy when one considers that currently the world’s only Black billionaire is a woman and self-made, and historically it’s virtually unheard for a woman to rise independently to the highest economic level in any race, ethnicity, or culture. In addition, this article fills a necessary void, since virtually all the articles about racial economic inequality are confined to specific places (i.e. America, Africa) and limited to discussions of poverty. This is probably the first article to discuss Black economic inequality at the highest level, and the fact that it does so from an international perspective makes it all the more relevant. Considering how noteworthy the topic is, and considering how extensive, useful, and well sourced the information is (relying on authoritative business magazines like Forbes), and considering how many categories this article fits into to, only a fool would advocate deleting it. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 17:44, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this article is far from noteworthy. It's relatively poorly written, and(from a non-white), VERY bias and POV. The article tells one side of many different examples.(Like the oprah arriving past CLOSING time of a store and getting denied access, but it only depects OPRAH'S side, not the side of the store or the employees, very POV) Black Billionares is a bad idea for an article. Where are the White Billionares or the Asian Billionares, or Jewish billionares? Just because there are very few doesn't mean that the article is noteworthy. And no matter how "oppressed" a race was(which by the way, oppression is relative, and I personally believe that, by FAR, the Jewish race was the most oppressed), just for the fact that it was oppressed does not mean it should have an article, unless that article specifically deals with oppression. <a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidtenmillion_a062.html" title="User:Liquidtenmillion">Liquidtenmillion</a> 23:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> POV is not a deletion criteria. Also the person who wrote the article not being white is defently not a criteria. By that logic a person that playes video games should not be allowed to write an aricle about one. --My old username 23:14, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There's an article on German billionaires. If you think Jewish billionaires are just as worthy of an articles as Black ones are then do something useful and create one, don't do something destructive by voting to delete this one. I think an article on Jewish billionaires would be excellent and quite note-worthy and provide helpful information to those interested in Jewish wealth, just as this article is useful to people interested in Black wealth.

<li><b>Delete</b> With only one definitively Black billionaire, this article is hardly merited. <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah</a>'s article provides sufficient information in that regard, and the rest of the article is full of near-Blacks, near-billionaires, not-quite-billionaires, would-be-billionaires, and wide-ranging speculation about race, economics, apartheid, athletes, and celebrities. The article is written in a decidedly POV fashion, and I'm not sure that any number of attempts at neutrality could redeem it. Save the topics this article touches on for in-depth discussion <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html#Economic_Status" title="African American">elsewhere on Wikipedia</a>. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 02:53, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There's only one Black Billionaire right now, but there's been more than one in the past and this article documents that and is historically informative. Why is okay to have an article on <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a> that covers only one country during one year, but not an article on entire human race that is a tenth of humanity, spans every continent, and is described over history? And not everyone who wants information on black billionaires will know to go to Oprah's article nor will they only be interested in the current Black billionaire. This article is full of facts and figures and is more encyclopedic than most <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 03:54, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Who ever said it was 'okay' to have an article on <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a>? Is everyone assuming that <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a> has received Wikipedia's infallible approval just because it's article isn't on the AfD page yet? I think it's ridiculous as well. However, this is an AfD for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_billionaires.html" title="Black billionaires">Black billionaires</a>, and the existence or nonexistence of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a> neither explicitly nor implicitly condones the necessity or lack thereof for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_billionaires.html" title="Black billionaires">Black billionaires</a>. I see that many made the claim repeatedly that if one exists another ought to as well; that is a weak claim, and people voting on this AfD ought to make more cogent and less specious arguments. A given article does not exist to give complicit license for another article's existence. Also, this isn't a popularity contest, and it's not about cutting down Blacks and lifting up Germans; don't misconstrue it as such. My own stance is that both articles are unmerited and I'll vote "Delete" on <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a> as well if someone cares to put it up for deletion. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 07:07, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> These two claims are equally unsound. Wikipedia does not need an article on One-armed cello players simply because there are very few, and the only interest to be derived from such can be saved for circuses and talent shows. As far as relevancy goes, I don't think either are relevant, and this isn't about which one "gets deleted first". As I stated above, this is not a popularity contest. It's also not <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tit_for_tat.html" title="Tit for tat">tit for tat</a>; this isn't some sort of "trade" for deletions. Consider this article and vote for or against deletion on its own merits. I think they both deserve the axe, and if you care to nominate <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a>, I'll vote to delete it regardless of how <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_billionaires.html" title="Black billionaires">Black billionaires</a> results. I think it's <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">Wikipedia:Listcruft</a>, uninteresting, and unencyclopedic. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 07:07, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't think either article desrves the axe and certainly not this one.

<dd><b>Comment</b> If the article were called Half-Chinese gay mechanics in California in 2006 then I could understand its lack of relevance. But an article about how members of arguabley the most oppressed people of all time, a tenth of humanity, joined the most elite, admired, successful and powerful demographic on Earth, and currently the only Black member comes from the most oppressed gender, is an article of far reachinmg global sociological and historical significance. When was the last time a woman has been the richest member of her race? To compare it to an article on One-armed cello players demonstrates a lack of perspective and an ignorance of history. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 19:02, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Are you claiming that one-armed cello players don't face social adversity? But you're right, I did trivialize a bit, and my analogy isn't spot on.

This article is arguabley more note-worthy than that one since more people aspire to wealth than to political office, billionaires are the people who pretty much decide who gets to be president so if presidents are noteworthy, billionaires are too, and Black related articles are just as relevant as American related articles, since many Blacks are American and the global Black population outnumbers the American population 2 to 1. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 22:21, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>:We are not here to argue about whether or not the American president article, which has N O T H I N G to do with the Black Billionaires article(except for the fact that it is a list). 1. There have been MANY american presidents, and they are static, sourced, and encyclopedic, in that it doesn't go off on 20 tangents. 2. Just because people aspire to something doesn't mean that it is noteworthy. I'd say VERY few people aspire to sexually abuse children, but yet we WAIT, we have an article for it. We'd better delete it then, since nobody want's to aspire to it, it MUST be non-noteworthy. 3. Billionaires make up significantly less than 1% of the population, so it'd be hard to get that few people to influence the stupid and poor majority, except through advertisement, which probably wouldn't sway anybody too far from what they initially believed anyawy. 4. I am the person who pretty much decides what food I will eat today. So if food is noteworthy, then I am too. 5. This article is not up for deletion because it is "black related". That's, well, fucking stupid. There are many, many "black related" articles that are not up for deletion at this very second. Maybe this is just a specific aritlce that is being specifically targeted for deletion for specific reasons, unrelated to ethnicity? 6. Asians are Americans, and the global asian population outnumbers the American population 6 to 1. <b>Where is my Asian billionaire article?</b> Your argument offers more arguments about why the American Presidents article should be DELETED than why the black billionaires article should be kept. I think it should be deleted simply because its POV, and there has been no effort to make it NPOV, and because it is more of a list of non black billionaires than it is of black billionaires themselves. <a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidtenmillion_a062.html" title="User:Liquidtenmillion">Liquidtenmillion</a> 00:30, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please try and calm down. First you asked where your Asian billionaire aricle is? In fact the richest Asians are not limited to one article, they get five, without any controversy: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Singaporeans_by_net_worth_745b.html" title="List of Singaporeans by net worth">List of Singaporeans by net worth</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Rich_List_ca04.html" title="China Rich List">China Rich List</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_East_Asia_Rich_List_ade8.html" title="South East Asia Rich List">South East Asia Rich List</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Korean_billionaires_and_multi-millionaires_9bde.html" title="List of Korean billionaires and multi-millionaires">List of Korean billionaires and multi-millionaires</a>,List of Hongkongers by net worth. And yet a single article on Black billionaires generate four nominations for deletion. Never mind the fact that Black economic developement was stunted by slavery, colonization, and apparteid, segration, Jim Crowe laws, and world-wide racism that is as old as recorded history and so Black billionaires are a special case. Never mind the fact that the Asian articles deal with highly specific sub-groups, while this article is broad enough in scope to focus on the entire Negroid race-one of the three broadest racial groups in anthropology and ten times more relevant because of its international population. And this article is extremely well sourced in that it relies primarily on Forbes magazine wealth valuations, the most authoritative business magazine. And how is this article any less static than the presidents one. The current president changes once every several years and so does the number, and identity of Black billionaires. And as for your earlier charge that this article is biased towards a non-white POV, this article depends on Forbes which is run by rich White Republicans. The articles cites several examples of corrupt Black billionaires and half-billionaires including dictators who allegedly exploited their own people. Yes the section about racism may be a little one-sided, but in the case of Oprah, the store's CEO agreed she was right and apologized on her show, so all an encyclopedia can do is report the official statements. The part about racism preventing Michael Jackson from reaching billionaire status does come off as paronoid POV, but at the same time many in the Black community are paranoid about racism holding successful Blacks back, and so this is a noteworthy perspective that needs to be reported on in a neutral way. If you feel the presentation was too biased, then the constructive thing to do is find alternative sources that present alternative opinions. It's not helpful to try to delete an article that deals with an important Black demographic that no other article can discuss in detail. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 02:05, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: As you said <i>Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place.</i> I believe the events described in the article meet this criteria. Take Tiger Woods for example. The prospects of him, a part-Black man becoming a billionaire athlete in a White dominated sport is considered virtually inevitable by the numerous sources discussed and is so noteable that a popular magazine created the chart cited in the article about Tiger's march to $1 billion. And you also have the whole race to become hip-hop's first billionaire. The is not "future history" or extrapolation. It is simply reporting on a much hyped note-worthy competetition that provides much insight about the cultural value the idea of a black billionaire has in hip-hop culture and society at large. I really think you need to step out and look at this from a different perspective. There's more than enough encyclopedic content to produce an article on Black billionaires. It's not just the number of Black billionaires themselves but it's their changing net-worth as a fucntion of year, it's the yearly change in the percentage of Black billionaires among the total number of billionaires, and there's the constantly changing comparison between the net-worth of the richest or only Black billionaire compared to the richest person period. There's also data on Billionaire with partial Black ancestry. The data is far too detailed and far too international (see the membership chart) to be limited to the discussion of African-American economics. And the discrimination against Black billionaires is on a totally different level than the discrimination against Blacks at large, and what better place to discuss it than artice about Black billionaires. Everyday Blacks are discriminated against because they are assumed to be poor or because they may appear physically threatening. But alleged discrimination against Black billionaires appears to be resentment that "these people" having surpassed society's expectations for what a Black can accomplish and attempts to knock them down a peg. If you feel this is too POV then balance with quotes of people claiming Blacks are just paranoid. But I find it the most fascinating discussion I've ever seen in wikipedia and do not wish to see it marginalized to just a sub-section of another article. There are all kinds of Black scholars who have all kinds of theories of why ther aren't more Back billionaires. You may call that a POV launch pad but I call it sociological theories, and reporting on theories is what encyclopedia's do. If you feel the theories are too slanted to the political left, then feel free to add right-wing theories. But please stop advocating the deletion of this article because it's my favorite article on wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 05:29, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
