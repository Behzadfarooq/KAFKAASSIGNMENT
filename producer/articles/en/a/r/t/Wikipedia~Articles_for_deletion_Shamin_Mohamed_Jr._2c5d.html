<li><b>Delete</b>. Fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> as Mr. Mohamed has not been "subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." For example: Toronto Star link is to a trivial mention, the Toronto Sun article is not avaialable without paying, and the Google news link doesn't work. The National Post article probably counts, but that's only one. A Google test turns up unimpressive results (863 hits, none that jump off the page). My guess is that the trajectory of this individual will make him notable from a Wikipedia perspective at some point, just not quite yet. I wish Mr. Mohamed well, and also suggest that he read <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairsing_4fac.html" title="User:Fairsing">Fairsing</a> 06:00, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thank you for pointing out the problem with the Google News link. It has now beein fixed. The Toronto Sun article is a non-trivial published work which appeared in the Toronto Sun newspaper, as well as on its web site. The fact that the Toronto Sun charges for access to older articles does not change this. In light of these things, I think he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and is notable. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 08:25, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would just like to state that all of the information mentioned about Children's AIDS Health Program is very credible. If you visit the main website, under About Us (www.LetsStopAIDS.org), you will see they are some videos from Significantly important Canadian Television Stations. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Smjr2000 (<a href="../../../s/m/j/User_talk%7ESmjr2000_09c1.html" title="User talk:Smjr2000">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Smjr2000_8d36.html" title="Special:Contributions/Smjr2000">contribs</a>) 03:38, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As a mattre of fact, the organization has been around for more than two years, we are coming close to THREE years, in October. We have been around for awhile and we are established quite well. Visit <a href="http://southafrica.LetsStopAIDS.org" class="external free" title="http://southafrica.LetsStopAIDS.org" rel="nofollow">http://southafrica.LetsStopAIDS.org</a> , if you want to see proof from on-site locations. 70.49.221.171 16:52, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. First, this anon. user has never before made a contribution to WP except to support this AFD. Second, "We" have been around for two years, or three, or whatever, is not criteria for establishing that your organization deserves an article on Wikipedia. The criteria, as has been stated above, is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>, which requires something more than being a local organization doing good works in the community (or in Africa, or elsewhere). That, in and of itself, is laudable and commendable, but not notable from an encyclopedic standpoint. Links to your *own* organization's Web sites do not help to esablish notability. You need multiple, non-trivial examples of coverage by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairsing_4fac.html" title="User:Fairsing">Fairsing</a> 17:04, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are many reliable sources of Children's AIDS Health Program, available on their website, espeicially Live Footage from RELIABLE tv stations, CBC and CTV. Today actually, the organization was mentioned on MTV Live (MTV Canada). A link off hand&#160;: <a href="http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=2c31e917-c965-4bba-9d9d-2c95d130dfdd" class="external free" title="http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=2c31e917-c965-4bba-9d9d-2c95d130dfdd" rel="nofollow">http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=2c31e917-c965-4bba-9d9d-2c95d130dfdd</a> , also, if you read the Kaisernetwork Transcripts, the organization's website is mentioned. As well, <a href="http://www.letsstopaids.org/en/content.php?page=aboutus" class="external free" title="http://www.letsstopaids.org/en/content.php?page=aboutus" rel="nofollow">http://www.letsstopaids.org/en/content.php?page=aboutus</a> , for a list. The notability of this information is valid. This is encouraging other youth to educate others about arts, sports, hiv and aids prevention and leadership. This organization is making differences, and has built a reputable credibility. Smjr2000 02:24, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. In regards to the recent Toronto Sun Article: Articles cannot stay available for free forever, the full version of this article is available at <a href="http://www.letsstopaids.org/en/content.php?page=aboutus" class="external free" title="http://www.letsstopaids.org/en/content.php?page=aboutus" rel="nofollow">http://www.letsstopaids.org/en/content.php?page=aboutus</a> .

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Delete, Comment</b> Don't vote Keep twice. It's obvious your anonymous posts are made by you. You're missing the point again. Because your organization does good works does not establish notability from an encyclopaedic standpoint. Have you been reading the references that have been repeatedly posted on your talk pages? The conflict of interest is born especially from the fact that you are the pages' creator. Understand that Wikipedia is not a place for promoting your organization, or your achievements. It's not meant for human interest articles, but factual representation from a neutral point of view. I'm sure your organization will survive without the publicity it's garnering from Wikipedia at the moment. Wait for someone else to write about you.70.24.144.235 02:59, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
