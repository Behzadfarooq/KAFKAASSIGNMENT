The Prague Uprising started on 5.5. 1945. ItÀàs trigger was the morning broadcast of Czech radio. It said: "It is just sechs hour" in the mixture of Czech and German. People knew immediatelly what that means. Soon after that a group of Czech policemen came to seize the radio building on Vinohradsk√° road. The thing they were not aware of was that there already was a strong unit of German SS soldiers. The first succes was therefore followed by a long and though fight. The radio started to call for help while sounds of shooting mixed with the speaking voice. Many people came to help. They were armed mostly only with small arms or even axes, but they were brave and ready to help. As the situation went bad for Germans they decided to send one secretary on the roof of the building. They told her to announce any hostile movement around that building. But the women kept saying there was nothing going on. When Germans realised she was lying they had trown her of the roof. At last Germans were pushed into the cellar and washed out by Czech firefighters. Germans tried to destroy the whole building on the next day and so they send a plane to bombard it. Dozens of defenders were killed and the radio itself was destroyed. But there was another one that started to broadcast just few minutes later.</p>
<p>At about 1AM on the March 6 1945 the radio asked people to build barricades and in one night there was over one thousand of them created. The resistance managed to seize half of the city before Germans managed to react. But the next hours were criticall, because rebels were running out of ammo and had only a few AT weapons while Germans had a lot of tanks at their disposal. Many people died for nothing, because American army had already been in Pilsen while Russians still had some hundred of kilometers to go.</p>
<p>Eventually on the March 8 1945 Russian army arrived to Prague and the city was free.</p>

<p>British government founded in 1905 English High School (EHS) as the Eton of Istanbul in the capital of the Ottoman Empire. In Istanbul EHSB (English High School for Boys) was in Nisantasi later changed to Nisantasi Anadolu Lisesi (NAL) and EHSG(English High School for Girls) was in Beyoglu and was changed to Beyoglu Anadolu Lisesi. The school was very famous not only due to its academic achievements but also in sports and had a huge sports complex in the area called Okmeydani in Istanbul. UK dynasty(Queen Elisabeth,Phillip,Charles,Anne) visited these schools in 1972. So many famous people graduated from these schools from 1905 until 1979.They were transformed to Anatolian High Schools. For many years it was the best school due to having highest percentage of student entrance to universities. Also in this school,many foreign students were available as the children of diplomats,managers,etc. Once this school was closed due to financial problems in 1979, there were no more any British school in Istanbul which served to many empires as capital. After the closure of these British schools.Britons decided to foundation of a school which would just serve to students of foreign nationals living in Istanbul.

<p><br />
Commonly used to describe Napoleonic British foot soldiers, the British Regular was known for his flambouyant red uniform (It took three hours for a typical British soldier to prepare his attire for "parade") and well-disciplined combat performance. Known famously in American folklore as the infamous "Redcoats," these crack soldiers were the backbone of Great Britain's military might in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>

A Gnooly is a fictional creature created by Roald Dahl for the children's book, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. The beings are described as invisible demons who devour "Minused" souls and visitors to Minus Land, where the creatures abide. With Willy Wonka's new Wonka-Vite invention that allows people to gain twenty years of their life back, it seems as if <i>he</i> was actually the one to create Minus Land and the Gnoolies for when someone overdosed on the pills and lost more years than they had actually lived. In the book, after Grandma Georgina overdosed and became "Minused" by two years, Charlie and Willy had to travel far below the factory to Minus Land to try and "plus" her by using the "Vita-Wonk" spray, another medicine that Willy invented to give the taker of Wonka-Vite back the years they had lost. Minus Land, as described by Charlie, is "like a hell without heat." It's a misty and foggy domain where the invisible Gnoolies live, ready to wolf down the next person who enters their realm. "Gnooly" is pronounced the same way "newly" is. The "G" is silent.</p>

<p>Insert non-formatted text here== <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster_Cable_0dd4.html" title="Monster Cable">Monster Cable</a> ==</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Monster Cable Products, Inc. was founded in 1979 by Noel Lee, who was then a laser-fusion design engineer at Lawrence-Livermore Laboratory, as well as an audiophile and professional drummer. Lee discovered that wires of different constructions produced varying degrees of audio performance when hooked up to loudspeakers. From this discovery, he developed a high performance speaker cable, named it Monster Cable, and literally created an industry. The invention of Monster Cable created a new product category that revolutionized the audio market. Prior to Monster Cable, most stereo systems were wired with ordinary "zip-cord," the same cable used for electrical household and lamp wire. Their inferior construction and cheap materials restricts power, dynamic range and clarity in the lows, mids, and highs.</p>
<p>Lee chose the name "Monster" because it sounded strong and powerful. It became an immediate hit with consumers. In fact, the name Monster Cable is so synonymous with high quality and high performance, customers often assume that any cable they purchase in reputable stores would be Monster even though there are other cable brands.</p>
<p>Monster is now the world's leading manufacturer of high performance cables that connect audio/video components for home, car and professional use as well as computers and computer games. Monster Cable is an indispensable component for music lovers, audiophiles, recording studios, sound professionals, musicians, custom-installers and home theatre enthusiasts. Monster's audio cables increase the clarity, dynamics and power of the audio signals that travel through them. Monster video cables deliver the sharpest, clearest picture possible with naturally vivid color from traditional and digital television, projectors, home theatre and satellite systems. Monster Game products lets enthusiasts enjoy the ultimate gaming experience by maximizing sound and video quality of a gaming system. Monster Power, a division of Monster Cable, delivers cleaner AC power to A/V components and computer products and high joule surge protection for maximum performance.</p>
<p>Monster Headquarters Monster's New Product Development division draws upon years of audio design and critical listening experience, to create the innovative, high performance cables and accessories that make Monster the leader in the industry. Already holding over 200 US and international patents, Monster is continually striving to discover and develop new, advanced technologies and designs to meet the needs of the ever-advancing consumer electronics industry. Monster offers over 4000 products and is sold in over 80 countries worldwide.</p>

This film was shot in Kazakhstan. Due to several problems (weather, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) of people who were responsible for filming etc) it took very long time. After about two years it was finally showed at the theatres around Kazakhstan. What would you expect of the film made in a place in which only a couple of movies a year are shot and which changed three directors? Would you expect it to be smooth and silky? A lot of questions about this movis want to be answered. Like, why most of main heroes were acted by non-kazakhs? So that it can be marketed more easily around the globe? But it wasn't marketed around the globe and I doubt it ever meant to be. Why did it come out just before the presidental election in Kazakhstan? Just don't tell it was a coincidence. The movie wasn't very accurate about the historical facts too. In the end it turn out to be somewhat childish.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-09_a4f9.html" title="Edit section: generation/derivation of sentence meaning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">generation/derivation of sentence meaning</span></h2>
<p>According to Kreidler, sentence meaning is derived from the meanings of its constituent lexemes and from the grammatical meaning it contains. The linguist claims that if the <b>lexical</b> and <b>grammatical meanings</b> of a sentence are known, it is known the meaning of the very sentence, and vice versa. Moreover, knowing the meaning of the sentence, one knows what conditions are necessary in this world for this sentence to be true. The derivation of sentence meaning is closely related with <b>truth-conditional semantics</b> that is based on the notion that the core meaning of any sentence (any statement) is its truth conditions. The analysts of this approach are interested in the instances when the language of the message implicates some additional meaning that accounts for the inference. There are definite rules for combining the meanings of lexical items. Palmer reminds us detailed derivational rules by <b>Katz and Fodor</b> (1963). The rules of combining individual lexical items into the meaningful sentence are called <b>projection rules</b>. The process of combination is called <b>amalgamation</b>, and it is the combination of <b>markers</b> and <b>distinguishers</b>. <b>Paths</b> are the structural analysis of the meanings. Thus projection rules are used to state what can be amalgamated with what, and in what order. The order of lexical items in the sentence depends upon the grammatical status of the elements. According to these rules, we combine adjective with noun, noun phrase and adverb with verb, etc.. As soon as the grammatical status is established, the paths of various lexical items are amalgamated. The next step in this analysis is to state the markers and distinguishers. The markers are general components, and the distinguishers are specific characteristics. After the amalgamation of paths of various lexical items, we combine the meanings into sentence (much alike predicate calculus). Such kind of analysis provides us much more satisfactory results than <b>componential analysis</b>. To sum up, generation/derivation of sentence meaning is based on the rules of componential analysis and amalgamation procedure (the later proved to be more trustworthy and plausible). The meaning of a sentence is generated by adding lexical items according to projection rules discovering restrictions for the situation, and so the meaning of the whole sentence is built.</p>

<p>Nelson Bros Funeral Services was established in 1858 and is now a fifth generation family owned and operated business in Melbourne, Australia. Robert Simeon Nelson moved to a small town called Linton, outside Ballarat, in Victoria's goldfields in the hey-day of the mid-19th century gold rush. He established the town's local general store and cabinet works. As the town's carpenter, he also made the town's coffins and thereby became the local undertaker. He then made his own hearses and coaches. By the 1920s, his grandchildren had expanded the business into Melbourne and had several funeral homes across Melbourne suburbs. Theo and James introduced pre-paid funerals and were inaugural members of the Australian Funeral Directors Association. Through the 20th century, Nelson Bros established themselves as leaders of quality and innovation in the industry. Until the 1970s, they even continued to build their own coffins, caskets and hearses. Today, five generations on, the Nelson family continues to own and operate the business. With a distinctive black Rolls Royce fleet and funeral homes in Elsternwick, Footscray, Hoppers Crossing, Sunshine and Williamstown, this funeral company remains a leader of quality and innovation.</p>

The Big Country should not be confused with the Big Bend Country, which lies further west.</p>
<p>The main city of the Big Country is <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abilene%2C_Texas_eb38.html" title="Abilene, Texas">Abilene</a>, the (current) county seat of Taylor County and originally a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroad.html" title="Railroad">railroad</a> town.

<p>Apart from Abilene, most towns in the Big Country are relatively small. Much of the land is dedicated to farming or ranching. <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses.html" title="Horses">Horses</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a> (including <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longhorn.html" title="Longhorn">longhorns</a>) are common sights, although one can also find more exotic creatures being raised, including <a href="../../../o/s/t/Ostrich.html" title="Ostrich">ostriches</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/u/Emu.html" title="Emu">emus</a>, and <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dromedary.html" title="Dromedary">dromedary</a> camels. Much of the Big Country is scrubland, and most lakes are manmade. The highways are lined with barbed wire, cacti, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluebonnet.html" title="Bluebonnet">bluebonnets</a>, and <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesquite.html" title="Mesquite">mesquite</a> trees. The Big Country rural lands and Abilene State Park provide wildlife refuges for species such as <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobcat.html" title="Bobcat">bobcats</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Cougar.html" title="Cougar">cougars</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitetail_deer.html" title="Whitetail deer">whitetail deer</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Striped_skunk.html" title="Striped skunk">striped skunks</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/y/Coyote.html" title="Coyote">coyotes</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_foxes.html" title="Red foxes">red foxes</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_cottontail.html" title="Eastern cottontail">Eastern cottontails</a>. The Big Country is home to numerous types of birds (including numerous migratory species) and is home to the Big Country Audubon Society. Smaller wildlife abound, and each year the Big Country witnesses the beautiful migrations of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch_butterflies.html" title="Monarch butterflies">monarch butterflies</a>, for which special gardens are created.</p>
<p>The dominant languages spoken in the Big Country are <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish.html" title="Spanish">Spanish</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a>.

Allaahu 'alam means Allah knows best. This phrase is commonly used by muslims all over the world when they are asked about an isssue they are not quite sure of. For instance it is common to have the phrase at the end of fataawa - islamic rulings.</p>
<p>Question: is such and such allowed</p>
<p>Answer: According to the qur'an and the sunna it seems to be like this... Because of these evidence I think it is allower, Allaahu 'Alam. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p><br />
-Do you know if Abu Bakr needs this fishing rod?</p>
<p>-Allahu 'Alam, better ask him before you borrow it.</p>
<p><br />
-Do you know where Abdus Salam is?</p>
<p>-Allahu 'Alam</p>
<p><br />
Also the companions of the prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to answer in a similar way when asked about something difficult. This is propably the origin of the practice. However during those days they used to answer Allaahu wa rasuulu 'alam - Allah and His messenger know best. Nowadays, since only one of the two is alive, a shorter version is used.</p>
<p><br />
Here's a hadith from Sahih muslim where the phrase occurs. "It is narrated on the authority of Mu'adh b. Jabal: I was riding behind the Prophet (sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam) and there was nothing between him and me but the rear part of the saddle, when he said: Mu'adh b. Jabal: To which I replied: At your beck and call, and at your pleasure, Messenger of Allaah! He moved along for a few minutes, when again he said: Mu'adh b. Jabal: To which I replied: At your beck and call, and at your pleasure, Messenger of Allaah! He then again moved along for a few minutes and said: Mu'adh b. Jabal: To which I replied. At your beck and call, and at your pleasure. Messenger of Allaah He, (the Prophet) said: <b>Do you know what right has Allaah upon His servants?</b> I said: <b>Allaah and His Messenger know best.</b> He (the Prophet) said: Verily the right of Allaah over His servants is that they should worship Him, not associating anything with Him. He (the Prophet) with Mu'adh behind him, moved along for a few minutes and said: Mu'adh b. Jabal: To which I replied: At your beck and call, and at your pleasure, Messenger of Allaah! He (the Prophet) said: Do you know what rights have servants upon Allaah in case they do it (i. e. they worship Allaah without associating anything with Him)? I (Mu'adh b. Jabal) replied: Allaah and His Messenger know best. (Upon this) he (the Prophet) remarked: That He would not torment them (with the fire of Hell)."</p>

<p>Late Dr. Raj Shankar (1947-2000), Late Professor, Department Of Biochemistry, Institute Of Medical Sciences (IMS), Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi-Uttar Pradesh-221005, INDIA</p>
<p>His main fields of specialization were Neurobiochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry.His contributions on neurochemistry are well recognized and he had been invited to deliver lectures in various prestigious conferences.Professor Raj Shankar's contribution is in developmental neurobiology with special reference to undernutrition during brain growth spurt period.His work had clearly established that undernutrition during brain development causes some irreversible changes.In 1991,work carried out in Texas and Yale with Magnetic Resonance Imaging by other workers confirmed some of the conclusions of Prof Shankar's work.Work done during last few years on developing brain show that signal transduction mechanisms are affected due to nutritional stress during brain development.Professor Shankar's other work involved biochemical aspects of mode of action of drugs on C.N.S.Apart from work on reserpine done earlier and published in NATURE and BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY,in 1987 he established that the barbiturate pentobarbitone affects protein phosphorylation in brain.This work is significant from the point of view of views on signal transduction.His work also concerned with mode of action of drugs like haloperidol and trifluoperazine.Professor Shankar's work in clinical biochemistry was mainly concerned with lipoprotein metabolism.Professor Shankar has over 50 publications in international and national Journals of repute.</p>

<p>He worked for one year (1966-67) in the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute,University Of Delhi,India on the Lipid Metabolism In Mycobacteria.In 1967,he went to Kinsmen Laboratory of Neurological Research,University Of British Columbia,Canada to work under Prof.J.H. Quastel, F.R.S. for PhD degree in Biochemistry.There he worked On "Cerebral Metabolism during Anoxia and effect of some Neurotropic Drugs".This work clearly showed that tetrodotoxin strongly stimulates anaerobic glycolysis and these findings led to the conclusion that at the onset of anoxia,and in the absence of tetrodotoxin action potentials are generated. The above work has been cited in various publications by a number of workers.In 1971,he returned from abroad and joined Department Of Biochemistry ,Institute Of Medical Sciences,Banaras Hindu University,Varanasi,India.There he initiated work on undernutrition and brain development.His early work was concerned with developing a suitable model for study of effect of undernutrition on cerebral metabolism during the brain growth spurt period.Ultimately the method of restriction feeding time of the suckling rats was adopted and he found that transport property of isolated cerebral tissue is altered in developing rats .This was perhaps first demonstration of the fact that undernourishment during brain growth spurt period causes changes in the membrane organization resulting in altered transport properties.It was also found that a key membrane enzyme Na+K+ ATPase show decreased activity in addition to changes in pattern of oubain inhibition which was reversible on adequate rehabilation.This work along with some other findings of him show that these changes are presumably due to the free radical induced damage to developing brain.</p>
<p>Studies on incorporation of C14-acetate into brain lipids of undernourished rats in vivo carried out by him showed that inspite of lipid deicit, 14C-acetate incorporation is slightly higher in experimental animals.This finding ultimately led to the observation that operation of pentose phosphate cycle is altered in the brains of undernourished animals.Gultathione and ascorbic acid was also studied in undernourished brain. From 1980-84 he worked on a project "Drug Action ,brain development and behavioral changes in the mammalian system "financed by CSIR(India).This work mainly led to the finding that action of some CNS acting drugs are potentiated in undernourished animals.They also observed that the drug reserpine is a strong inhibitor of lipid peroxidation and protein phosphorylation in brain.This project was mainly concerned with interaction between drug action,monoamines and membrane phenomenon which could later be extra polated to behaviour.Since various gangliosides are involved in binding of cerebral amines the contents of different species of gangliosides and neuraminidase activity was established.He established that the drug reerpine effects the cationiv content of rat brain and proposed that changes in cationic content may be playing a part in release of monoamines at the synapse.It was further shown that transport property of isolated cerebral tissue is altered in chronic reserpinized animals which further pointed out the membrane action of reserpine.In 1980 he established that there is a relationship between high density lipoproteins and premature atherosclerosis in patients with renal failure.The work on lipoproteins was also carried out with patients suffering from anxiety neurosis.He was one of the coinvestigators in an international study on protein energy requirements in indivisuals of this country and this work was supported by the United Nations University.In addition he was involved in a number of collaborative studies with various groups in the institute.The studies include Biochemical and Immunological studies in chylurya,placental oxidative enzymes in pregnancy anemia,Lecithin-Sphingomyelin ratio in fetal lung maturity etc.Till August 2000 he was involved in study of protein phosphorylation in brain.He had shown that protein phosphorylation is adversely on rehabilation .Attempts were in progress to characterize specific proteins by SDSPAGE and radioautography.He had shown the effect of pentobarbitone on cerebral protein phosphorylation which is not due to to its action on electron transport chain.Work was also in progress in his laboratory till August 2000 to study effect of a number of CNS drugs on protein phosphorylation in brain and to examine if specific proteins are effected.This would have helped to establish exact role of cerebral phosphoproteins in neurotransmission.Mechanism of action of some antiepileptic drugs on brain metabolism was also in progress.In 1999 he conclusively established that in conditions like Alzeihmer's disease there is phosphorylation related folding problem of proteins.This is responsible for cognitive and other defects.Similar situation exists under severe undernutrition during brain growth spurt period and similar mechanism involving protein phosphorylation may be involved here also. In 2000 along with his student Kalyan Goswami,he showed that sites in proteins damaged due to free radicals can be accurately determined by carbonylation studies and may be developed as an accurate method to denote relation between chronological age and biological age after free radical induced damage.(Kalyan Goswami,B.D. Bhatia ,Raj Shankar, 2000)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Twister</b> was once a documentor of several <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a> exploits. Although many suspected his intent was to ruin these games, he ran under the premise that these companies needed to be held accountable for their sub-par products. While his approach was disliked, it has become an unignorable point of debate among MMORPG enthusiasts that still holds truth today.</p>
<p>During his heyday, there were only a couple MMORPGs around. It was common for MMORPG developers to not properly test or update their games. This meant that critical bugs were found quite often. Some of those exploits would remain for long periods of time. Essentially, Dr. Twister forced these exploits into the limelight, putting a lot of pressure on developers to get them fixed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (or fortunately), his site did not last more than a couple years, as his hosting went under along with many others during the <a href="../../../d/o/t/Dot-com.html" title="Dot-com">dot bomb</a>. He was not heard of again since, until he re-emerged as a writer for <a href="http://www.wtfman.com" class="external free" title="http://www.wtfman.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wtfman.com</a> in mid 2005. This time, he promises no more exploit expos√©s.</p>

The Ferentari were a group of normally low or none-income Albanian males. The group is responsible for numerous Murder-Rapings that was a cause for the accusations of terrorism on behalf of the Serbian Security Forces. A small instigator in the conflict that caused ethnic cleansing against the normally Muslim Albanians and eventualyl international involvment. The gang later went on to be a small contributor to the larger groups of Albanian sepreatists. The Ferentari were famous for ignoring the age of their victims, young or old none were discriminated when it came to the rape-murders. The gang was not completely restricted to attacking Christian victims as their particpation in the war on behalf of the Albanians implies. Muslim's who did not pay protection were targetted aswell. The term "Ferentari" is still feared today among the inhabitants of the former area of Kosovo.</p>
<p>Ferentari were exposed by <b>London Times</b> reporter Nigel Wellington. Wellington conducted interviews with former members of the gang for his article in the paper.</p>
<p>Entertainment: In the movie "Behind Enemy Lines" one of the gangs is reffered to as the "Ferantari" whic is inaccurate as the Ferentari were disbanded by that point in the War.</p>

<p>Cretan shepherd, b.1920 in Asigonia, Crete, war hero and writer rewarded BEM from the British government after the war. He served as dispatch runner between Petro Petrakas and Papadakis behind the German lines for the Cretan Resistance Movement and later for the British Intelligence Service 1941 ‚Äì 1945. Through his remarkable narrative "The Cretan Runner" he gave the Cretan runners a face. His later commander Patrick Leigh Fermor described the book as equivalent to an Arab version of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. After the war Georgios Psychoundakis wrongly was sent to prison as a deserter, where he was confined for 16 months until the bureaucratic error was discovered and led to his release. The book was written when he was in confinement.</p>
<p>The Cretan runners performed amazing feats and made essential contributions to the British operations in the Mediterranean. Pheidippides who in 490 B. C. ran 42, 195 km from the battle of Marathon to tell about the victory over the Persians died just after delivering his message. In comparison Georgios Psychoundakis ran from Kissamos on the North Western coast of Crete to the Paleochora in one night. The distance along the present main road is 70 km. Trough the wild and rugged landscape with deep ravines, where he had to run to avoid the Germans, the distance may be three times this.</p>
<p>After the war Georgios Psychoundakis became a coal burner Cretan mountains to support his family until his book was published in 1955. It is translated to a number of foreign languages.</p>
<p>He later wrote "The Eagles Nest" which deals with the life and customs in Cretan mountain villages. This book has so far not been translated to a foreign language.</p>
<p>Georgios Psychoundakis‚Äô may be greatest achievement is his translation of Homers works from old Greek language to Cretan dialect. Seen on the background of about his two or three years of occasional village education, this is remarkable.</p>
<p>He lives today in the outskirt of Xania overlooking the Souda Bay.</p>

<p>Started in 1872 when the Union Pacific Railroad insiders formed the credit mobilier construction company. They hired themselves to build the railroad and thus paying themselves a lot of money. They feared intervention from congress , therefore they sold some stock to important congressmen. Congressional investigations and a newspaper expose exposed the scandal. Two congressmen were censured and the Vice President under Grant was also involved.</p>

<p>A Blue Slip is an opinion written by a Senator from state of residence of a federal judicial nominee. Both Senators from the state are sent a blue slip in which they may submit a favorable or unfavorable opinion of a nominee. They may also choose not to submit one. The Senate Judiciary Committee takes Blue Slips highly into consideration whether or not to confirm a nominee. It is a means through which the practice of senatorial courtesy is carried out.</p>

<p>Lee himself commented "I am well and truly delighted to be joining an ambitious and forward thinking club such as Dewsbury Celtic. The club is currently run by people who have a huge pedigree in the game and their enthusiasm is infectious. I can't wait to get started and I'm glad to be part of it. Dewsbury Celtic have made some huge transitions in recent times and it is for us all to concentrate on establishing Dewsbury Celtic as a summer club and building a solid base for the future. It's an exciting few months and years ahead!"</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-09_a4f9.html" title="Edit section: The Metric Tensor and Field Tensor Problem">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Metric Tensor and Field Tensor Problem</span></h3>
<p>Let us assume the most general possible metric tensor in (x,y,z,t) space:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/a/c/4ac2d703e82fafd1f49a4395ca7aadb0.png" alt="[g] = [g_{\alpha \beta}] =   \begin{bmatrix}     g_{xx} &amp; g_{xy} &amp; g_{xz} &amp; g_{xt} \\     g_{yx} &amp; g_{yy} &amp; g_{yz} &amp; g_{yt} \\     g_{zx} &amp; g_{zy} &amp; g_{zz} &amp; g_{zt} \\     g_{tx} &amp; g_{ty} &amp; g_{tz} &amp; g_{tt}   \end{bmatrix}" /></p>
<p>We will not assume any coordinate symmetries, nor any symmetries in the metric tensor; we will solve the problem in the full 16 metric tensor variables.</p>
<p>We will also need the inverse metric tensor, which in this case would be obtained by treating the tensor as a matrix and inverting the matrix.</p>
<p><span class="texhtml">[<i>g</i>] <sup>‚àí 1</sup> = [<i>g</i><sup>Œ±Œ≤</sup>]</span></p>
<p>We note that the metric tensor <span class="texhtml"><i>g</i><sub>ŒºŒ±</sub></span> times the inverse metric tensor <span class="texhtml"><i>g</i><sup>Œ≤Œº</sup></span> yields the Kronecker-Delta tensor. This is equivalent to a matrix times its inverse being equal to the identity matrix.</p>
<p><span class="texhtml">[<i>g</i>] <sup>‚àí 1</sup>[<i>g</i>] = [<i>I</i>]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/b/6/9b63f7e1a364bc1d8620e98ea342a879.png" alt="g^{\mu \alpha} g_{\beta \mu} = \delta^{\alpha}_{\beta}" /></p>
<p>Now that we have postulated the metric tensor, we have a lot of algebra to do in order to arrive at the Einstein tensor. The first thing to calculate are all of the connection symbols.</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/7/b/47b1462ed5a391ef6e5e59bd0311e2d5.png" alt="\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu \alpha} [ \frac{\partial g_{\gamma \mu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} + \frac{\partial g_{\beta \mu}}{\partial x^{\gamma}} - \frac{\partial g_{\gamma \beta}}{\partial x^{\mu}} ]" /></p>
<p>Since there are 4 indices (x,y,z,t) that could be assigned to the connection symbol indices <span class="texhtml">(Œ±,Œ≤,Œ≥)</span>, then there are 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 different connection symbols that need to be calculated (since we are not assuming any coordinate symmetry, nor even any metric tensor symmetry). The index <span class="texhtml">Œº</span> is an index that is repeated and it is an example of the Einstein notation, which specifies summation over all possible values of that index. For example, consider the product of the factor in front with the first term in brackets. What the repeated index really means is a sum of the form:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/1/9/7199ed9de3b59befe1cd38e3aa559cb3.png" alt="g^{\mu \alpha} [ \frac{\partial g_{\gamma \mu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} ] = g^{x \alpha} \frac{\partial g_{\gamma x}}{\partial x^{\beta}} + g^{y \alpha} \frac{\partial g_{\gamma y}}{\partial x^{\beta}} + g^{z \alpha} \frac{\partial g_{\gamma z}}{\partial x^{\beta}} + g^{t \alpha} \frac{\partial g_{\gamma t}}{\partial x^{\beta}}" /></p>
<p>This is the sort of summation that is going to occur a lot in this article. Basically, whenever 1 repeated index occurs, it implies the sum of 4 terms, one for each of the indices (x,y,z,t). Whenever 2 repeated indices occurs, it implies the sum of 4 x 4 = 16 terms. In this fashion, the expressions that occur in the algebra of general relativity can quickly become millions of terms long.</p>
<p>Note that first derivatives occur in the formula for the connection symbol. These are expressions that are going to be replaced by finite differenced first derivative expressions. We will talk about the numerical aspects of this problem later.</p>
<p>Now that the connection symbols are all calculated, we move on to the Riemann tensor components. These are given by: <i>&lt;Wide image hidden&gt;</i> For this tensor, there are 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 = 256 components to calculate (since we are not assuming any symmetries whatsoever). Also, the product that occurs with the <span class="texhtml"><i>g</i><sub>ŒºŒΩ</sub></span> factor times the terms in the second set of brackets, involve a sum over 2 indices, and so this means the sum of 4 x 4 = 16 sets of such brackets, in each and every one of the Riemann tensor components.</p>
<p>Note that second derivatives occur in the first set of brackets. These are expressions that are going to be replaced by finite differenced second derivative expressions.</p>
<p>Next, we must calculate the Ricci tensor components. These are given by:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤</sub> = <i>g</i><sup>ŒºŒΩ</sup><i>R</i><sub>ŒºŒ±ŒΩŒ≤</sub></span></p>
<p>There will be 4 x 4 = 16 such tensor components. Each one will involve a sum of 4 x 4 = 16 terms.</p>
<p>Next, we calculate the Ricci scalar. This is given by:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>R</i> = <i>g</i><sup>ŒºŒΩ</sup><i>R</i><sub>ŒºŒΩ</sub></span></p>
<p>Finally, we form the Einstein tensor:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/9/d/c9d02748bc35efaf002c1ec5c388e9d5.png" alt="G_{\alpha \beta} = R_{\alpha \beta} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha \beta} R" /></p>
<p>To get this far, in terms of writing out useful finite difference expressions, a tremendous amount of algebra is required! Probably, this is too much algebra to write down by hand, or even to code by hand. There will be an awful lot more before we are finished. It is suggested that the user code this expressions within a symbollic computation program such as <a href="../../../m/a/p/Maple.html" title="Maple">Maple</a>. One would start by coding the metric tensor exactly as we defined it at the start. One would then calculate the inverse metric tensor by simply calculating the inverse of the matrix, possibly using Kramer's Rule, or possibly using a built-in matrix inversion function. Note that calculating the inverse metric tensor alone is probably too much algebra to do by hand. Then, each set of tensor elements may be symbollically coded, until one finally has got symbollic expressions for all 4 x 4 = 16 components of the Einstein tensor. Next, all occurrences of first and second derivatives must be replaced with finite differenced expressions, which we will discuss toward the end of this article.</p>
<p>Eventually, we will end up with a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Residual.html" title="Residual">residual</a> tensor, and we will want to convert the symbollic expressions for all related elements to computer code, such as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortran_77.html" title="Fortran 77">fortran 77</a>. This is one good reason to use <a href="../../../m/a/p/Maple.html" title="Maple">Maple</a>. Maple is capable of automatically converting symbollic expressions to optimized code. The result will be code that is not human-readable. However, the Maple worksheet that has led to the auto-code will hopefully be somewhat human-readable, for error checking purposes.</p>
<p>We have got about half the material we need to formulate the Einstein equations, namely, the Einstein tensor. The second half of the material is the energy-momentum tensor for an electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>We must start with the electromagnetic field tensor:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/c/6/4c681df92a1f14ed32f800c90a9c6c83.png" alt="F^{\alpha \beta} =   \begin{bmatrix}       0   &amp;   b_z &amp; - b_y &amp; - e_x \\     - b_z &amp;   0   &amp;   b_x &amp; - e_y \\       b_y &amp; - b_x &amp;   0   &amp; - e_z \\       e_x &amp;   e_y &amp;   e_z &amp;   0   \end{bmatrix}" /></p>
<p>The quantities <span class="texhtml">(<i>e</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>,<i>e</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>,<i>e</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>)</span> and <span class="texhtml">(<i>b</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>,<i>b</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>,<i>b</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>)</span> are the components of the electric and magnetic fields respectively, in our rectangular coordinate system (x,y,z,t). Since these are the field components that make up the field tensor, and hence which will make up the energy-momentum tensor, one might think that these were going to be the source variables. But this is not how we will formulate this problem! The field variables are going to be added to the list of dependent variables, and they are going to appear in the Maxwell equations, which will be added to the list of equations. And in the Maxwell equations, the field variables will be expressed in terms of the source current densities. The source current densities are going to be the sole source variables in the problem! This means that the entire problem is going to be solved based on the magnitude and direction of the source electric currents. These currents might possibly be an electric current running through a set of coils, or plasma running through some kind of plasma conduit, or whatever electric current source one might postulate was used in the actual Philadelphia Experiment.</p>
<p>In any event, we now need to calculate the energy-momentum tensor components. This components we require are given by:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/d/6/ad69520fe7ad26309bdc46a92cb027ec.png" alt="T_{\alpha \beta} = g_{\alpha \nu} F^{\mu \nu} F_{\beta \mu} - \frac{1}{4} g_{\alpha \beta} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}" /></p>
<p>Note that this formula uses the <span class="texhtml"><i>F</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤</sub></span> form of the field tensor. This is given by:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>F</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤</sub> = <i>g</i><sub>Œ±Œº</sub><i>g</i><sub>Œ≤ŒΩ</sub><i>F</i><sup>ŒºŒΩ</sup></span></p>
<p>We finally have all the info we need to formulate the Einstein equations:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>G</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤</sub> = ‚àí 8œÄ<i>G</i><i>T</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤</sub></span></p>
<p>where G is the Universal Constant of Gravitation.</p>
<p>We need this equation to be in residual form. Therefore, let us define the residual tensor to be:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>r</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤</sub> = <i>G</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤</sub> + 8œÄ<i>G</i><i>T</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤</sub></span></p>
<p>Therefore our gravitational field equations are simply:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>r</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤</sub> = 0</span></p>
<p>We stated earlier that we needed the Maxwell equations. In their general relativistic form, the Maxwell equations are:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/b/5/7b5f5023919c9849bcfe6907e755b253.png" alt="F^{\mu \alpha}_{; \mu} = - J^{\alpha}" /></p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>F</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤;Œ≥</sub> + <i>F</i><sub>Œ≥Œ±;Œ≤</sub> + <i>F</i><sub>Œ≤Œ≥;Œ±</sub> = 0</span></p>
<p>The covariant form of differentiation we have used here are expressions of the form:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/9/0/890ae5cb82656758641bd26daa73516e.png" alt="F^{\alpha \beta}_{; \gamma} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\gamma}} F^{\alpha \beta} + \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\gamma \mu} F^{\mu \beta} + \Gamma^{\beta}_{\gamma \mu} F^{\alpha \mu}" /></p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/1/7/117657482051054b8c1174b49a386afd.png" alt="F_{\alpha \beta&#160;; \gamma} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\gamma}} F_{\alpha \beta} - \Gamma^{\mu}_{\gamma \alpha} F_{\mu \beta} - \Gamma^{\mu}_{\gamma \beta} F_{\mu \alpha}" /></p>
<p>Since both forms of the field tensor are antisymmetric, it turns out that the two Maxwell equations may be expressed in the simplified form:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/8/3/98311ef931500191da8f006204ecfdb9.png" alt="\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}} \sqrt{g} F^{\mu \alpha} = - \sqrt{g} J^{\alpha}" /></p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/3/e/13ecc0f753a367705192f6e1be2dab52.png" alt="\frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} F_{\beta \gamma} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} F_{\gamma \alpha} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma} F_{\alpha \beta} = 0" /></p>
<p>In the first Maxwell equation, the scalar <span class="texhtml"><i>g</i></span> is the negative of the determinant of the metric tensor <span class="texhtml">[<i>g</i>] = [<i>g</i><sub>Œ±Œ≤</sub>]</span>. Since a square root of the determinant occurs in the equation, we will not use this form; we will use the previous more complicated form. The reason for this is that we will be bending space by gradually increasing the magnitude of the source current <span class="texhtml"><i>J</i><sup>Œ±</sup></span>. As this is occurring, there is no telling how the metric tensor will change. We will start it off as the Minkowski metric tensor for flat space. However, as the source current is increased, space will bend, and the metric tensor will change. If the metric tensor changes to something such that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/2/f/62f16fbe1ba0d192039c696ddd898932.png" alt="\sqrt{g}" /> is imaginary, even just temporarily within the numerical code, then this will invalidate the computation. Therefore, it will be numerically simpler to use the previous more complicated version of the equation where <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/2/f/62f16fbe1ba0d192039c696ddd898932.png" alt="\sqrt{g}" /> does not appear and hence this problem will not occur.</p>
<p>The second Maxwell equation, however, is considerably simpler and does not contain any such troublesome term. We will therefore use the latter simpler version of this equation.</p>
<p>At this point we assume a source current density of the form <span class="texhtml">(<i>J</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>,<i>J</i><sup><i>y</i></sup>,<i>J</i><sup><i>z</i></sup>)</span>. These will be the only source terms appearing anywhere in the equations. Expanding the first Maxwell equation into 3 equations, one for each source current density component, we obtain:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/2/a/b2a3c674c498fbc10a7eb4a8e4817792.png" alt="F^{x x}_{; x} + F^{y x}_{; y} + F^{z x}_{; z} + F^{t x}_{; t} = - J^x" /></p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/5/1/55185b9a7320cdf88ff5fd6b62975b2a.png" alt="F^{x y}_{; x} + F^{y y}_{; y} + F^{z y}_{; z} + F^{t y}_{; t} = - J^y" /></p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/9/0/d9018f7661e6f8ca7c28f0a061e622e6.png" alt="F^{x z}_{; x} + F^{y z}_{; y} + F^{z z}_{; z} + F^{t z}_{; t} = - J^z" /></p>
<p>Let us expand all the covariant derivatives in these equations to obtain: <i>&lt;Wide images hidden&gt;</i> In order for these equations to be useful in the numerical solution that will be described soon, they must be in residual form: <i>&lt;Wide images hidden&gt;</i> Expanding the second Maxwell equation into 3 equations:</p>

<p>However, we want equations with the <span class="texhtml"><i>F</i><sup>Œ±Œ≤</sup></span> form of the field tensor, and so the above equations become:</p>

<p>These equations are already in the residual form we require. We simply need to expand the derivatives with the product rule: <i>&lt;Wide images hidden&gt;</i> At this point we have got 22 equations in 22 unknowns. The 22 equations are the 16 Einstein equations:</p>

<p>The solution will amount to the metric tensor and the electromagnetic field components being specified at all points in 4D space. In order for us to be able to visualize this space, and the bending of space that has occurred, we would need to map out the space by solving the geodesic equation for the paths of rays of light. The geodesic equation is:</p>

At this point we have covered all of the fundamental mathematics that is required. Next, we move on to describe how this problem would be solved numerically.</p>

<a name="The_Numerical_Mathematics" id="The_Numerical_Mathematics"></a>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-09_a4f9.html" title="Edit section: The Numerical Mathematics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Numerical Mathematics</span></h3>
<p>The fundamental mathematics that has been covered so far is straight out of any of the accepted texts in general relativity.</p>
<p>Now, we discuss how the problem may be solved numerically. The 22 equations contain first derivatives of the metric tensor components and electromagnetic field components. They also contain second derivatives of the metric tensor components. We have carefully written all expressions in a form such that these first and second derivatives appear explicitly. Therefore, in a symbollic computation program such as <a href="../../../m/a/p/Maple.html" title="Maple">Maple</a>, these derivatives may be replaced with finite difference expressions; there should be no need for long partial derivative expansions.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that the quantity <span class="texhtml"><i>h</i></span> is either one of the 16 metric tensor components, or one of the 6 field components. Let us consider first and second derivative expressions with respect to coordinates <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>y</i></span> in the rectangular (x,y,z,t) space in which the finite difference grid is defined.</p>
<p>Suitable central first derivative expressions are:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/0/3/2038d3b4388f6a9e19470eb1d83254a1.png" alt="( \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} )_{ijkl} = \frac{h_{i+1,jkl} - h_{i-1,jkl}}{x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}}" /></p>

<p>Suitable central second derivative expressions are: <i>&lt;Wide images hidden&gt;</i> Substituting finite difference expressions like these into all the first and second derivative expressions in our 22 residual equations, amounts to a set of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/0/e/f0e02228597a47dd8ee1fc188eba3cb4.png" alt="N = 22 \times (n_x \times n_y \times n_z \times n_t)" /> nonlinear algebraic residual equations that must be solved. This problem is going to be very large. Even with only a modest 100 grid points per dimension, the problem ends up being in terms of 2.2 billion variables.</p>

<p>The obvious boundary condition to impose on all the grid boundary surfaces, is flat space (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Minkowski_space.html" title="Minkowski space">Minkowski space</a>) and zero fields. Flat space is described by the metric tensor:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/6/0/560abc3d12fcd0c55009ff054e8f3ef5.png" alt="[g] = [g_{\alpha \beta}] = \begin{bmatrix}                              +1 &amp;    &amp;    &amp;  0 \\                                 &amp; +1 &amp;    &amp;    \\                                 &amp;    &amp; +1 &amp;    \\                               0 &amp;    &amp;    &amp; -1 \\                            \end{bmatrix}" /></p>

<p><span class="texhtml">(<i>e</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>,<i>e</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>,<i>e</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>) = (0,0,0)</span></p>

<p>The obvious initial conditions are flat space and zero fields, the same as those given above, but imposed initially at all grid points.</p>

<p>The only source terms are the source current densities:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>J</i><sup><i>a</i></sup> = (<i>J</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>,<i>J</i><sup><i>y</i></sup>,<i>J</i><sup><i>z</i></sup>)</span></p>
<p>or in terms of a magnitude and a unit vector:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/c/1/ac1d0c3bc2fdc9f921902fc7062bd448.png" alt="J^a = J (\hat{j}_x, \hat{j}_y, \hat{j}_z)" /></p>
<p>The source current geometry is most likely the only geometry that needs to be specified. An interesting source current geometry might be a hoop current, or two hoop currents, separate by a given distance, or possibly a helix current.</p>
<p>The source current direction vectors <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/1/4/41449ac504421964d14de40095e757e4.png" alt="(\hat{j}_x, \hat{j}_y, \hat{j}_z)" /> should be assigned values that describe any one of these possible current geometries. In a given time frame, a hoop current, say, will have the geometry of an ordinary hoop in ordinary 3D space. We will assume that this same hoop geometry will exist at all time frames within the simulation. Therefore, this same hoop geometry should be replicated for all time points in the 4D grid. In this way, we will have specified the source current direction vectors over 4D space. The source current direction values will have appropriate values where-ever the hoop resides in 4D space, and will be zero everywhere else.</p>
<p>The source current magnitude could be any function in time. It could be a non-zero constant value for all time. It could ramp up over an initial time interval and then stay constant at a non-zero value for all time there-on. There might be many interesting source current magnitude patterns that could be studied. In any event, at every point in 4D space where a non-zero source current direction vector resides, an appropriate source current magnitude should be specified.</p>
<p>We might want the hoop current, or the helix current, or whatever, to encircle a metal military hardware structure like a ship or an airplane. However, we may most likely ignore the geometry and the composition of such a metal structure, for purposes of our simulation. In order to bend space, we will need very very strong source current magnitudes. The very very strong electromagnetic fields that will arise as a result, will most likely take the magnetization of any metal structure way past magnetic saturation, so that for purposes of computation, the metal structure may be neglected.</p>

<p>Our system of nonlinear algebraic equations could very well contain 2.2 billion variables. For a smaller problem, we might attempt a numerical solution using a Newton nonlinear method. However, in order to use this class of methods, we would need to formulate a <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobian.html" title="Jacobian">Jacobian</a> matrix, and we would need to solve it often. However, for a problem size on the order of 2 billion, the Jacobian matrix is likely to contain on the order of a trillion non-zero entries. Such a matrix would most likely be too large for early 21st century computers.</p>
<p>A simpler method that might work would be to let the problem variables relax to whatever steady-state values they will take. In order to make this happen, we would invent a hypothetical time paramter <span class="texhtml">œÑ</span>. We would change our 22 residual equations to a system of coupled first order equations in time <span class="texhtml">œÑ</span></p>

<p>The general idea is to pick a time-marching scheme that will advance these equations through our hypothetical time <span class="texhtml">œÑ</span>, until all the right-hand-sides have relaxed to zero. When this occurs, the first derivatives on the left-hand-sides are also zero, meaning that the original residual equations are satisfied, and that all problem variables have relaxed to the solution values.</p>
<p>Perhaps a time-marching scheme as simple as the <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runge_Kutta_d8a4.html" title="Runge Kutta">Runge Kutta</a> Method would work here. Perhaps an adaptive Runge Kutta algorithm would be required, though perhaps a simple dumb Runge Kutta algorithm would work.</p>
<p>If the set of equations turned out to be a <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stiff.html" title="Stiff">stiff</a> set of equations, then a solution might be impossible for early 21st century computers. A time-marching scheme for stiff systems requires a Jacobian, and then we are right back to the practical limitations that made the Newton nonlinear class of methods impractical.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-09_a4f9.html" title="Edit section: Mapping the Solution Space">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mapping the Solution Space</span></h3>
<p>Assuming that we do end up with a numerical solution to this problem, we will need to map the warped space in order to be able to view a 3D projection of it. A suitable 3D projection could be the bent paths that light rays take through the 3D space, at each and every time frame. In fact, the mappings for each time frame could be strung together into a movie so that we could watch how the space warps as time advances. This could be particularly interest if we were using a source current magnitude that ramped up from zero to a very high value strong enough to warp space.</p>
<p>In order to map the bent paths that light rays would take through the system, we would need to take our metric tensor solution, and use it calculate all 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 connection symbols. Then, we would use the connection symbols to formulate the geodesic equation:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/9/a/b9aa772fa9c8bd3704dea030fb5efc13.png" alt="\frac{d^2 x^{\alpha}}{d \rho^2} + \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\mu \nu} \frac{d x^{\mu}}{d \rho} \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d \rho} = 0" /></p>
<p>The derivatives in the geodesic equation are taken with respect to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proper_time.html" title="Proper time">proper time</a> <span class="texhtml">œÅ</span>. The proper time is a parameter that expresses the distance travelled along a given geodesic.</p>
<p>The geodesic equation is second order, and hence requires an initial coordinate and an initial velocity, for whatever geodesic we wish to calculate. For a light ray, we could pick an initial coordinate to be a point on one of the boundary surfaces. We could pick the initial velocity direction to be pointing inwards from the boundary, into the problem space, and perpendicular to the boundary surface. We would pick the velocity magnitude to be that of the speed of light. Within this unitless system, the speed of light would be of unit magnitude:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml"><i>c</i> = 1</span></p>
<p>The geodesic equation would perhaps also be solved using a Runge Kutta Method.</p>

<p>The body of math covered in this article would be laborious, but also straightforward, to use to construct a numerical solution of the general electromagnetic field problem arising from an arbitrary source current density distribution. The math would be useful for a very general class of applied physics problems.</p>
<p>However, it is hoped that this body of math will be used one day soon to clear up the mystery that has surrounded the conjectures that have been made for decades now on the Philadelphia Experiment. The math covered in this article is the genuine science behind the science fiction. A numerical solution of this problem would clarify for the world, once and for all, what would have really happened over the course of the experiment.</p>
<p>My own conjecture is that the math will demonstrate that the source current magnitude that it takes to bend space significantly enough for the unusual effects of general relativity to occur, would be so large that they could not be generated by man-made machinery on Earth. Quite possibly, it is only current magnitudes on the astrophysical scale, such as spinning charged stars or black holes, that will prove to be large enough.</p>
<p>This, however, does not make this body of math useless for man-made applications. it is quite possible that the very small general relativistic effects arising from small current source magnitudes, do or will carry some importance in the development of novel technologies.</p>
<p>On a practical note, in order for a computer to hold 2.2 billion variables in memory, with each variable being a 32 bit real number, the computer would have to have 70.4 Gigs of RAM. The time-marching schemes like the Runge Kutta methods, typically require that 5 or so copies of the solution vector be held in memory at any one time. For 5 copies of the solution vector, the computer would have to have 352 Gigs of RAM, meaning that for good measure this amount of memory should be doubled, so that a computer having on the order of 700 Gigs of RAM would be necessary to solve this problem.</p>
<p>That is one powerful and mighty computer that is required. But this is, after-all, the 21st century, and these are the sorts of applied physics problems that it is time to attempt.</p>

<p>was founded in 1. august 1924 in church "Sveti Sava" - Vracar, and he start competition one year later. In that time Belgrade league had three levels, and Obilic was in "first level" in season 1928/29.</p>
<hr />
<p>This was a "gold period" for football club Obilic. In sesaon 1932/33 he finished season on second place, and three times he was on third place - 1931/32, 1935/36, 1937/38. During the "Second War World II" they continued competition, but in abnormal conditions. FC Obilic was always on third place(1941-1944), behind famous teams in that time "BSK" and "SK-1913"</p>
<hr />
<p>After the "Second War World II" it was baned to use name of Obilic in country. Because, football club had name "Cuburac" till 1952, and in year 1952/53 "Cuburac" and "Sumadija" made a compact and return the name "Milos Obilic". That year club started in I"B" level.</p>
<hr />
<p>First big success is coming ten years ago. With good results, he is coming to "third level", and member of "second level" became in sesaon 1991/92. In "stage two" Obilic became in season 1993/94. Then in FC Obilic is coming new leader of the club, Zeljko Raznatovic. He is making a reconstruction of the club, he is making a new stadium, and he brought big energy and spirit of winners.</p>
<hr />
<p>In season 1996/97 Obilic is first in second division with many, many pts. ahead the second place team, and big difference between other clubs.</p>
<hr />
<p>New team in first division, but for Obilic that is not a problem. In his first season, he persist battle against "Red star" and "Partizan", an he won championship, first time in history of the club.</p>
<hr />
<p>Great success is associated with Mr. Zeljko Raznatovic, manager, big football fan, man who know everything about football, man who was the whole day on stadium, and he made one big team, team for Europe and world.</p>

<p>Luke Hemming lives in Pen-coed (the hyphen has been added for the annoyance of the council, its also pencoed not COYD by the way). he's in college at the moment and is still,which suprises even him,dating Hannah Williams.Life really should have decided he can't be that lucky by now.But she's his lover, his best friend and he can say "I've got a girlfriend" a lot.</p>
