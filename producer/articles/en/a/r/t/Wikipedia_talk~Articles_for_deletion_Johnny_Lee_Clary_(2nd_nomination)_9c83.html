<dd>I can't say I really find the idea of being a leader of a contemporary KKK organization all that notable by itself. It's like leading a chapter of the <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotary_Club_af49.html" title="Rotary Club">Rotary Club</a> (in terms of people influenced - obviously I'm not equating the Rotary Club with the KKK). Also, those sources are no good for verifiability - they're all from JLC's own site. And the fact that there is no coverage from independent, reliable sources that we've been able to find is another indication that the activities were not that notable. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User%7ESiobhanHansa_73ec.html" title="User:SiobhanHansa"><font color="Orange">Siobhan</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa"><font color="blue">Hansa</font></a> 12:48, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Although not everyone’s cup of tea, people go through wrestling bios specifically; to have this merged could be beneficial for Clary's bio as Wrestling fans would go there, but it seems that his KKK and Christian activities are much more notable. For instance Sting became a Christian but remains a wrestler and his bio is mainly about that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_%28wrestler%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_%28wrestler%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_%28wrestler%29</a> Also Nikita Koloff is now a preacher but is more known for his wrestling.

<p>The only reason I tried to get JL Clary and others going is because I wasn’t sure of Wiki Policy. I never put the article up, but asked Admin what I should do seeing Feldspa was deleting almost everything I was doing on Wiki and was stalking my posts. It was kindly suggested by Catherine what to do. So I did it I drafted User:Potters house/Johnny Lee Clary and have written to everyone who was involved in the original delete.</p>

<dd>Hi Nick. I don't think you've run afoul of a conspiracy, just the policies of Wikipedia. It's not about keeping Clary and related topics out, it's about remaining neutral, verifiable, and reliable. If you can write a good article that meets our policies (not always straightforward or easy for a newbie, especially on a topic that has already prompted admin action), it might have a chance. I am NOT giving you or Clary any sort of guarantee that a new article will be kept -- it might end up going through the Deletion process again -- but I think a new, thoroughly encyclopedic article written from scratch will at least give people a fresh look at the subject.</dd>

<p>I think it was deleted because Clary had written his own bio and wasn’t using Wiki correctness. This got him in trouble. (I did this on The Potter’s House aticle when I started but thankfully just went unoticed and have since grown in understanding, phew!)</p>
<p>I actually thought at the time that Neo Nazi’s were against the article being on Wiki, that is why I created some more (J L Clary etc), just to see who would delete it, and then do a witch hunt. I have learned that it is mostly to do with Wiki policy and understanding Wiki manerizims now, although there is an alarming amount of pro KKK, Nazi and White Supremist stuff on Wiki. Clary often recieves death threats and hate mail etc, so you can understand, if you look into these groups and consider exactly what Clary says about them, why I thought this <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotters_house_0b0e.html" title="User:Potters house">Potters house</a> 08:21, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The extra article creations were not malicious, although their were against policy. After a month of the article being worked on in his own userspace (with help from me and others), I nominated it for re-creation and it was accepted.</dd>

<dd>The current article state is: rough draft, needs work. It's no better or worse than many other newborn articles. The only complicating factor is that there isn't much published material which isn't autobiographical.

<dd>Yes, Nick, you <b>did</b> assume, with absolutely no proof, that <b>anyone</b> who was opposed to Johnny Lee Clary having an article on Wikipedia <b>must</b> be a Neo-Nazi, and that is why you sent a message to over thirty editors accusing me of being a "covert racist" and alleging that because I reverted two edits by a banned user to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> back in 2005 that means I must be a Kerry supporter who was on a vendetta against Clary because Clary was a Bush supporter.

<p>Antaeus Feldspar has continually followed me around Wiki deleting articles and reverting my posts. I put my foot down recently on the Potters House site after I proved that the person running the site that Antaeus Feldspar and Tillman insisted be put up ran another site claiming that I was a homosexual and had left my church and was an internet porn freak etc, etc. I had to make a similar site about Rick Ross (which I have since deleted) to get them to remove the links. I tried mediation but no one helped. I complained to many, many people but Adhoc was the only help and he is not even an admin. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Potter%27s_House_Christian_Fellowship" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Potter%27s_House_Christian_Fellowship" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Potter%27s_House_Christian_Fellowship</a></p>
<p>Also I never said that he WAS a Nazi or anything but concluded that because he wanted to delete the Wade Watts article so quickly that PERHAPS he has an issue with Clary. Clary receives death threats daily and I myself am beginning to receive emails from race hate groups concerning my recent association with him and my stand against the KKK in our area see www.kkkau.com</p>
<p><b>This was my original post to Admins:</b> Hey there, my name is Nick, my username is Potters house and I have encountered a problem with trying to provide any information about Johnny Lee Clary. I have posted this post off to other staff members also. I am not sure if this is the best route to resolve this, but can think of no other way.</p>
<p>The article Johnny Lee Clary has been deleted. I have known Johnny through telephone conversations and email for a short time now (about 3-4 months). He recently came and shared his life story in for our church group for the first time just two weeks ago. Before I met Johnny I became interested in his story i.e. his conversion from the head of the KKK in the US, to being a Christian Minister who now teaches against race hate groups. I found the article Johnny Lee Clary as it still is today, deleted, except for some small talk. If you read the talk you see what I have said at the time (notice I have gotten no reply, probable my fault as I don’t know heaps about WIKI policy). From my understanding Johnny Lee Clary was posting as The KingOfDixie and looks like he tried to change a few things on Wiki concerning the KKK. While this is a controversial subject, Johnny being the former leader of the KKK would probably know a thing or two and be able to contribute, but that’s another story. He eventually made an article about himself i.e. Johnny Lee Clary. Johnny being quite new to Wiki and ignorant of rules of conduct found himself at odds with some admins and had his site deleted.</p>
<p>Whilst observing Johnny over the last 3-4 months I have noticed that he is very outspoken against race hate groups such as the Neo Nazis, Skinheads, KKK etc. This, more often than not, lands Johnny in the hot seat. He has experienced persecution from racist groups for his departure from the KKK and voiced opinions against these racist organizations on his webpage, www.xkkk.org. Johnny has also received multiple death threats.</p>
<p>Because of his bold stance against these racist groups Johnny has become accustomed to hatred directed at him by those same groups. Johnny concluded that perhaps the guy who deleted the page Johnny Lee Clary was a white supremist. I am hoping to clear this up. Before he told me this, I started to create J L Clary, after hearing nothing from posting in user talk on Johnny Lee Clary's article. I wasn't 10 minutes into the J L Clary article when it was issued a deletion notice, and then before I had time to reply (about 5 minutes) it was deleted! I was amazed. I told this to Johnny and he said the main reason he was told that he couldn't have an article was because he was not prominent enough.</p>
<p>Johnny has a very famous testimony and has been on multiple TV shows like Oprah, Donahue, Jerry Springer, etc, and even recently when he preached in our town he made front page news, a double spread on his life, and the local ABC interviewed him live, which is not bad for our town (LISMORE NSW Australia) See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a> .</p>
<p>When David Wilkerson came to our town hardly anyone knew or cared, yet David Wilkerson is allowed an article (and rightfully so), but more people know of Johnny. As to whether he is famous or not, just Google search him and see all the TV interviews and radio interviews he does. He hangs with some of the most prominent Christian leaders in Australia. Besides this, just being the former KKK leader should be enough for an article (he doesn't even get a mention in the KKK one, and would be deleted). He was also a Pro Wrestler. So he is prominent in Christian circles, he is prominent amongst race hate groups, and he is also prominent in the WWE wrestling.</p>
<p>Johnny asked me to test the waters for him to see if he was being persecuted by someone from a race hate group. So I created some sites, John Clary, Wade Watts and Operation Colorblind - the name of Johnny's Ministry. These have been fine until yesterday. I cannot understand why these sites are just issued a deletion notice? Just because they mention JLC? I was hoping to discuss these things but they are just deleted. The one on Wade Watts is about a black gospel preacher who was one of the leaders in the civil rights movement in the US and was good friends with Martin Luther King. He took Johnny Clary under his wing and even ordained Johnny as a minister (to this day Johnny is the only white man ordained in the All Black Baptist Church). But his article is up for deletion because I mentioned Clary and had a link.</p>
<p>That is why I am writing to you to see if you can help. It seems to me that the person(s) deleting all articles which even mention Johnny Lee Clary has an agenda. I thought that wikipedia admins had to keep a neutral stance on every article. It seems like this guy has a vendetta against JLC. Why delete the Wade Watts article. That is guilt by association and could be proof that all deletions are because of racial discrimination! I hope this is not the case and would think that it is politically motivated, as Johnny is a strong supporter of George Bush and Antaeus Feldspar of Kerry.</p>
<p>See:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a> This shows how Antaeus Feldspar supports Kerry, which is fine, but Johnny is a strong supporter of Bush.</p>
<p>My hope is that Johnny will be able to have an article like any other famous person, minister, former KKK leader, or pro wrestler, and that Johnny and anyone connected with him and his ministry will in future have certain rules set in place that do not allow the wholesale deletion of the articles associated with him, but that they will be at least discussed.</p>
<p>I thank you for reading this long winded post. I have only been using WIKI for about a year myself so I need your help, I don't really know what else to do. I hope you can help. I personally think that Johnny's story is one that is beneficial to the cause of reconciliation between races and to the3 unity of society as a whole. It would be a shame if WIKI became known for having covert racists. Of course I hope that this is a misunderstanding and that all will be cleared up soon.</p>

<p>Also note his contributions: Featured articles: • African American literature -- My first featured article. Thanks to everyone who gave feedback. While I didn't start the article, I obsessed on it for an entire month and wrote most of the copy. • Ku Klux Klan -- I began work on this article after it became a featured article. Since then I've mediated several editorial disputes on the article (including one of which kept the article from being delisted as a FA) and made a large number of edit.

<p>Please note that this was immediately after the Deletion of Operation Colorblind and when Wade Watts was up for deletion. I assumed (wrongly) that someone may have a racial agenda, but concluded that it is most likely a political agenda but not conclude that it is because I am part of the Potter's House Church which is falsely considered a cult by Rick Ross (a sensationalized 'cult buster') who Antaeus Feldspar defends and (seems) to work for.</p>
<p>I am apologise that it does seem like I am accusing you, but your behaviour towards me has been very bad. The stalking has to stop. I tire of trying to defend myself agaisnt this man.</p>

<dd>Gee, let's see. Potters house is informed <i>several times</i>, by different editors, that his failure to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> of Antaeus Feldspar and instead to level baseless accusations that Antaeus Feldspar is a "covert racist", a fanatic John Kerry partisan, and a stalker, is <i>not</i> acceptable Wikipedia behavior and should be apologized for. Which of the following happens?
<ol>
<li>Nick actually apologizes for his hurtful misbehavior.</li>
<li>An anonymous editor shows up out of nowhere (not unlike the three-and-counting editors who have come out of nowhere to cast "Keep" votes on Nick's article!) to tell Nick "you're right! You don't actually need to <i>apologize</i> for your own poor behavior! You are instead entitled to perpetuate your attacks on the people who tried to <i>clean up</i> after your poor behavior and didn't do so in a way that perfectly pleased you!"</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Anyone who thinks it's the former doesn't know Nick. I have to wonder if 220.233.86.223 would have shown up, had Nick been aware that administrators can check whether 220.233.86.223 is the address he logs in as "Potters house" from. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 12:51, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have to agree that the assumption of bad faith is offensive, and the anon IP's behavior is suspicious. I am also curious as to why, if Clary is allegedly so prominent in the US, support needs to come from an IP in Australia. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:20, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Firstly, the only person accusing me is you Antaeus Feldspar. You don't like me because Timan, Ross, Fossa and others have beef with the Potter's House Church. That's fine we all have our own religious beliefs and personal views. But to claim that Kev who is 220.233.86.223 is me is misleading, and the type of thing you seem to accuse me of yet I am always the one who has to apologize! I know this guy personally and he was on Wiki way before me. He also goes to the Potter's House and has had major contribs. If you show me where this is fact perhaps I can explain! Until then the only reason I can think is that he runs many web sites that I make and I may have logged on once at his home, but I doubt that and I am asking you to prove this accusation to me, or else apologize for lying and claiming that I am a liar. Clary has spent the past 8 Months in Australia and is a hit here appearing on major TV, Radio and Newspaper interviews weekly. So I apologize for assuming that Feldspa could have been acting in a discriminating way when deleting Wade Watts' bio. But is it not the same when he now calls me a liar, deceiver and also earlier stalked me. I have constantly requested mediation but his buddies Timan, Fossa, and others seemed to gang up on me. Hey I may not have all the Wiki language down, and may not say things right. But Feldspar has been harassing me. How can I make a formal complaint on wiki about him? As you can see, this whole deletion thing is his idea and now I am wasting huge amounts of time (once again) trying to defend myself for this guy. He trys to get people offside with me but why? Because I am a Christian and he is a cult buster.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, this guy has wasted about 20 hours of my time in the last 2 months by deleting my articles in which I have to continually have to defend and explain myself.</dd>
<dd>He has been vandalizing my articles by following me around Wiki harassing me, refusing mediation and making no compromises whatsoever, not even talking about the issue when I have continually requested it and even deleting the posts I put on his talk page requesting mediation and then saying things like "Hey, Nick! When were you, you know, planning to let me know that you'd opened this case? Hmmmm? Opening a case against another party and not notifying them -- not a real indicator of acting in good faith." when he DELETED the talk I put on his page a few days before so it looked bad for me.”</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This guy has been at it longer than me, but never lets me breathe. Just delete, revert, and accuse and I am tired of it! He was trying to get links approved that are written by a guy that claims that I am no longer a Christian, that I am a homosexual, that I am addicted to Net porn, that I hate the Potter's House secretly ect. It was RIDICULOUS! This is wiki bullying. How can I get away from it? I suppose he hopes I will tire and give up.

<dd>"Firstly, the only person accusing me is you Antaeus Feldspar." Of personal attacks? That's completely incorrect; you have been advised by both Ed here and also Ten of all Trades to apologize for your personal attacks and probably by others, but rather than apologize, you've just continued with the attacks.</dd>
<dd>"You don't like me because Timan, Ross, Fossa and others have beef with the Potter's House Church." No, I dislike you because I find your actions sleazy and unethical, such as when you started a website devoted to slandering a public figure so that you could use that website as a bargaining chip on Wikipedia. It's not that I don't like you because of Potter's House; it's that that I don't like <i>Potter's House</i> because of <i>you</i>. And even that wouldn't be the case if not for the fact that they <i>are</i> a church and promote themselves as being able to lead Christians in their quest of learning how to act in more godly ways, and then they produce someone like <i>you</i>.</dd>
<dd>"But to claim that Kev who is 220.233.86.223 is me is misleading, and the type of thing you seem to accuse me of yet I am always the one who has to apologize! I know this guy personally and he was on Wiki way before me. He also goes to the Potter's House and has had major contribs." Yes, I admit my suspicion that 220.233.86.223 was you was incorrect. If I'd checked 220.233.86.223's contributions more carefully I would have realized sooner that he was User:Truth Over Relationship, who in the past caught a block for posting another user's full name, address, phone number and the church that he attends and followed up with threats such as "I will not use your real name here again - however I think you should probably be thinking before bragging next time - I have marked you and will look at other attacks on the internat against church groups and if any come from you after todays date - I will follow through with litigation!" Certainly a <i>fine</i> person to talk about issues of 'stalking', yes.</dd>
<dd>"Clary has spent the past 8 Months in Australia and is a hit here appearing on major TV, Radio and Newspaper interviews weekly." So produce evidence instead of just assertions. If you'd done that in the first place then the original article might have been kept even despite Clary's own interference and misbehavior.</dd>
<dd>"So I apologize for assuming that Feldspa could have been acting in a discriminating way when deleting Wade Watts' bio. But is it not the same when he now calls me a liar, deceiver and also earlier stalked me." Ah, so you <i>finally</i> apologize for calling me a racist to thirty different people, but you <i>continue</i> to call me a stalker?</dd>
<dd>"I have constantly requested mediation but his buddies Timan, Fossa, and others seemed to gang up on me." Pfffft. Fossa is my "buddy" now? Man, if you knew the history there, you'd realize that any time you can get me <i>and</i> Fossa agreeing on anything, it's a rare day.</dd>
<dd>"Hey I may not have all the Wiki language down, and may not say things right. But Feldspar has been harassing me. How can I make a formal complaint on wiki about him?" See, this is the part that you don't get. Feldspar has been cleaning up after the mistakes you make because you not only don't "have all the Wiki language down", you also don't 'have the rules of decent conduct on Wikipedia down'. And when someone tries to explain those rules to you -- rules such as "when an article has been deleted through the AfD process you can't just create the same article under a different title", "no, it's not okay to create an article titled <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wade_Watts_9977.html" title="Wade Watts">Wade Watts</a> which has twice as much about Clary as about Watts", "no, just because you personally know the person who put together a slander site doesn't make it a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>", "no, hosting the slander site personally doesn't make it reliable either", "if you cannot, even when challenged, demonstrate proof that someone said a particular thing, you are not allowed to keep inserting the false claim that they <i>did</i> say that because you think it's the sort of thing they <i>would</i> say" -- well, what they get from <i>you</i> is not a sincere attempt to learn but rather accusations -- accusations that they are racist, neo-Nazi, stalkers, secret employees of the Rick Ross Institute, whatever comes into your mind <i>except</i> the possibility that they are simply <i>people who know things about Wikipedia policy that you do not and who are trying to teach you.</i></dd>
<dd>"As you can see, this whole deletion thing is his idea and now I am wasting huge amounts of time (once again) trying to defend myself for this guy. He trys to get people offside with me but why? Because I am a Christian and he is a cult buster." See above. Nick actually seems to think it's his <i>right</i> to announce lies like "he's a covert racist" and "he's a neo-Nazi" and "he's a John Kerry fanatic" and "he's an anti-Christian".</dd>
<dd>"He has been vandalizing my articles by following me around Wiki harassing me, refusing mediation and making no compromises whatsoever, not even talking about the issue when I have continually requested it and even deleting the posts I put on his talk page requesting mediation and then saying things like "Hey, Nick! When were you, you know, planning to let me know that you'd opened this case? Hmmmm? Opening a case against another party and not notifying them -- not a real indicator of acting in good faith." when he DELETED the talk I put on his page a few days before so it looked bad for me." Man, I just <b>love</b> people who ask themselves "What Would Jesus Do?" and answer themselves "Why, Jesus would lie like a rug in order to slander someone else, of course!" FACT TIME, NICK: You left <b>a</b> message on my talk page. It was a <b>useless</b> message, since it was an <b>exact duplicate</b> of a message you also left on an article talk page. In fact, if you read my user talk page header, you <i>knew</i> that I would delete a duplicate message. Does this mean that I deleted the message where you told me you were starting a mediation case? No, it does not -- because THAT message, you never left. So, basically, you're trying to lie to the good people here. "Feldspar claims I never told him I was starting proceedings against him! But HE DELETED the message I left for him! -- which didn't tell him I was starting proceedings against him but I want you to ASSUME it did!"</dd>
<dd>"See the mediation which I had to initiate. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-08-07_The_Potter%27s_House" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-08-07_The_Potter%27s_House" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-08-07_The_Potter%27s_House</a> – This was a lie to make me look bad." No, it is a lie you're telling NOW. Or are you claiming that when you leave a message stating "I would prefer to discuss this <b>without mediation</b>." <i>(emphasis added)</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=67960548&amp;oldid=67944155" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=67960548&amp;oldid=67944155" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> that you actually expected me to take that as "Hunh, he must be starting a Mediation Cabal case against me?" Exactly how did you expect me to figure out which title you had chosen for the page, so I could join the discussion that you started without me? Check your contributions -- oh, no, <i>wait</i>, that would be <i>stalking</i>, unless of course it's <i>you</i> who does it.</dd>
<dd>"This guy has been at it longer than me, but never lets me breathe. Just delete, revert, and accuse and I am tired of it! He was trying to get links approved that are written by a guy that claims that I am no longer a Christian, that I am a homosexual, that I am addicted to Net porn, that I hate the Potter's House secretly ect. It was RIDICULOUS!" Those lies you're telling? Yes, they <b>are</b> ridiculous. What <i>I</i> was trying to do was get you to <i>stop</i> inserting into the articles links to a slander site which accuses someone of being a homosexual based on possible ways he <i>might have</i> but <i>didn't</i> complete the sentence "I have previously ..." So, once again, your arguments really boil down to "he is CLEARLY in the wrong! Because he did things that are completely acceptable when <b>I</b> do them but obviously WRONG if anyone else does them!"</dd>
<dd>"This is wiki bullying. How can I get away from it? I suppose he hopes I will tire and give up. Like look at this deletion review, I have wasted hours and hours just trying to explain myself, and why? Because he want's me to just give up." No,I want you to <i>shape up</i> and start acting like an <i>actual</i> Christian and not like a spoiled sixth-grader who still hasn't figured out that the world isn't all about him and that he <i>isn't</i> entitled to lie and cheat and slander when the world isn't set up for him to have his way.</dd>
<dd>"Why am I then seen as the bad guy?" Um, because spreading lies and slander <i>makes you</i> a bad guy?</dd>

It couldn't <b>possibly</b> be because I'm violating the rules! It <i>must</i> be because he's (insert inflammatory baseless accusation here)!"</dd>
<dd>"If Fan-1967 was interested in the situation he would read all the mediation, look at all the talk at the Potter's House and also look at his and my history to see if this is true. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotters_house_0b0e.html" title="User:Potters house">Potters house</a> 13:59, 1 September 2006 (UTC)" Well, gee, for starters, I hope he starts with the message you left on my talk page -- you know, the one you falsely claim notified me of the Mediation Cabal case you started against me? I think that is an <i>excellent</i> place to start for anyone who wants to find out whether your accusations are based on truth.</dd>

When I tried to find sources for Papania's claims, what I found is that in fact Papania's account is disputed; writer Rocky Scarfone claims that many of the stories Papania tells as happening to <i>him</i> were actually taken from Scarfone's book <i>House of Cards: The Curse of Alphonso</i>. I revised the article in accordance with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> to reflect that these are the claims Papania makes about his life, but they are disupted by others such as Scarfone.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tom_Papania&amp;diff=59718775&amp;oldid=59047970" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tom_Papania&amp;diff=59718775&amp;oldid=59047970" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> As <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> makes clear, Wikipedia articles should characterize debates, but they should not assert that any of the sides are right or wrong.

<li>What I am interested in is why no Americans seem to think Clary is prominent. The people arguing that he's a notable crusader against the KKK are Australians who have never seen a klansman in their lives, except maybe a brief clip on the international news, and all they know about Clary is what Clary has told them. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 14:08, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Firstly no Americans seem to think Clary is prominent? See Oprah, Montel, Jerry Springer, Rikki Lake, Phil Donahue, Sally Jessy, Pat Robertson's 700 Club, Billy Graham's Radio show, Geraldo Rivera, Queen Latifah, Carol and Marilyn Real Friends, Montel Williams, A&amp;E Investigative Reports, ABC World News Tonight, Bertrice Berry, Rolanda, The Today Show, A Current Affair, NBC's Donny Deutsch The Big Idea, TBN's Praise The Lord show, many national and international Newspapers and National TV Shows in Australia, England, Holland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Sweden, and Wales. He has appeared all over the Nation of Australia on ABC Radio as well as ABC's "Enough Rope" hosted by Andrew Denton also appeared with the Australian KKK leader on the Today show in Australia.</p>
<p>Secondly Check out these links www.kkkau.com and www.fightdemback.com Also see clarys site.</p>
<p>Thirdly I suggest we delete this site then: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilman_Hausherr" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilman_Hausherr" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilman_Hausherr</a></p>

<li>Interesting that you direct me to Australian websites, yet the article is devoted to his supposedly notable fight against the klan in the US, where he hasn't even been this year.
