<li>It is not an advertisment. This site has a history that people who visit are constantly curious about. There will be things added to it in the future. You have no right to delete it. It is not an add.

<li>Sorry, but this link even fails to get a mention on the external links page of the Article it is about.

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> Seems like a borderline notable website, though the article does need a more encyclopedic tone.

<li><b>Delete</b>, article about a game fansite with an alexa rank of over 200,000. Not one of the most visited runescape sites, no claims of notability in the article. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 16:15, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Looks ok to me, it's well written and informative. Who cares if it's not one of the most visited sites for Runescape? You definitely give a very bad impression when you admit stuff such as the "Liger" article and that stuff. That article is not an advertisement and it's informative enough. These people tell what it is, it's purpose and some background information on it. It should stay I think. --Cotusa 17:28, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The point though is if Runevillage's wikipedia article recently got deleted, and it has more traffic than this, why keep it? <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J.Sagnella_6796.html" title="User:J.J.Sagnella">J.J.Sagnella</a> 17:33, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am terribly sorry about the actions of my fellow crypters. I'm trying to edit the article now and I've eliminated whole sections of the article. I have started citing sources and following wikipedia guidelines. I can clearly see where you would think this was an ad, so I've completely changed the tone of the article. I don't know if I can change the article to conform to Wikipedia standards; it's written from as neutral a perspective as I can get, and research is backed by some sources, though it is not possible to verify some bits of material. Kevin; Original Writer</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Delete</b>: There have been many improvements to the article on 30 January. These deal with many of the criticisms above. I would have voted to delete the original version (and the flaming above doesn't help its cause), but I think the current version is not a bad article. I don't feel qualified to judge about the notability of the subject matter, but that is often subjective anyway. If you voted before 30 January, you may want to reconsider your vote. -- <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvenue_4731.html" title="User:Avenue">Avenue</a> 23:43, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've changed my mind, having looked into the notability aspect more. Of the 5 fansites listed at the end of the <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> article, four of them have much larger membership than this one, and none seem to have articles on Wikipedia. So this one doesn't seem notable enough to keep. -- <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvenue_4731.html" title="User:Avenue">Avenue</a> 15:07, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
