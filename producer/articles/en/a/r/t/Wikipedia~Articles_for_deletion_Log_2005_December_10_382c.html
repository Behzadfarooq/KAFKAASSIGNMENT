<li><b>?</b> - Yes, it's just a local computer club, similar to other local computer clubs listed in Wikipedia. The group did create their own website, and has maintained it for a number of years(see the external link.) It is also searchable in Google, as suggested. If it was decided that local computer clubs with over 500 members should not be listed in Wikipedia, then they should be removed.

<li><s><b>Comment</b></s><b>Keep</b>. This is <i>far</i> from a speedy or vandalism(!). It's not spam, it's a valid stub. It's just their address and a list of their bands, with no claims or boasts made. It doesn't even give their web site. Some of those bands are notable -- Even I recognized <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamb_of_God_%28band%29_3090.html" title="Lamb of God (band)">Lamb of God (band)</a> which has six records out and a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_That_Remains_4b7a.html" title="All That Remains">All That Remains</a> has an article. I don't know if the others do -- I checked some but not all, not finding any more articles (which doesn't prove a band is not notable). Prosthetic Records gets a lot Google hits, too. I don't know what the policy or precedent is on record labels, so I'm not going to vote, but its an artistic endeavor so I'd tend to give the benefit of the doubt. I'm gonna leave it to others who are more familiar with this sort of thing, though.

<li><b>Comment</b> - However, domain hacks are somewhat growing in popularity and probably merit an article. I wasn't aware of that name for them (I've only seen del.icio.us and I was in fact wondering if that sort of technique had a name), but if del.icio.us is a domain hack then j@mes.com is certainly an "email hack". Unfortunately, I've never seen anybody use an "email hack" before, so I can't comment on whether it's a practice as widespread as domain hacks or whether it's non-notable and therefore worthy of deletion.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I have a hard time accepting either <i>domain hack</i> or <i>email hack</i>, <i>English language hack</i> maybe. If the terms are used, they both need disambiguation. <i>domain hack</i> could also mean <i><a href="../../../d/n/s/DNS_ed5f.html" title="DNS">DNS</a> hack</i>. I have never heard the term <i>email hack</i>, but I think it would imply doing something technically clever with an email (the message or the software handeling it, but not the address). If these things are to be regarded as hacks the terms <i>domain name hack</i> and <i>email address hack</i> would be more accurate. But the hack is not in the realization that a word can be divided into parts or that the character '@' looks a bit like an 'a', it's in the idea of choosing it as a name. Thus in my opinion the best name for both things would be <i><b>name choice hack</b></i>. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBergsten_f850.html" title="User:Bergsten">Bergsten</a> 22:00, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you re-read my nomination, you'll see that I do very much doubt that this is the standard definition. If there is any standard definition, it derives from "hacking email" (e.g. "An email hack has been going around the office, make sure your virus definitions are up to date!"), not from some cute typographical game.

<dd>Well, this is the difference between "hack" and "hacking". A "hack" is just a way to change something - it doesn't imply any criminal behaviour. While "hacking" often does. "Email hack" therefore means as per this definition while "Hacking in to e-mail" is what you are suggesting. I cannot imagine anyone saying "Oh no, someone did an e-mail hack!". No, they would say "Someone hacked my e-mail" or "My e-mail has been hacked". Thus they have different meanings. Of course, this kind of thing is covered already in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_hacking.html" title="Computer hacking">computer hacking</a> where you can read up more about the difference between criminal hacking versus just changing something. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 06:29, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this should be covered by Wikipedia, but I don't think we need two separate articles on what is really just one topic. What concerns me is the names of the articles. As described above I think they are unclear and some what misleading. But the references for them are no good either, the only ones to mention the terms <i>email hack</i> and <i>domain hack</i> are the ones related to the site <a href="http://xona.com/domainhacks/" class="external text" title="http://xona.com/domainhacks/" rel="nofollow">xona.com</a>. The said site makes no claim (as far as I can see) that the terms are in wide use, they also use us as a reference for the term <i>domain hack</i>. This makes me think one of two things is true, either the term was coined here and they started using it, or more probable they coined it and use us to push their term through. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBergsten_f850.html" title="User:Bergsten">Bergsten</a> 01:52, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.

<li><b>Comment</b> <b>Keep</b>. The presentation I made will be posted by Monday 12th. The term came about from a section of cognitive psychology which studies intentionality.
<ul>
<li>Intentionality in psychology is sometimes referred to as 'thought without representation' eg. if I said 'it is raining' you can assume that I am referring to where I am, so you change what I said in your head to 'It is raining where he is' There are many cases in conversation where we don't explicitly state things but the meaning carries because of conventions or our knowledge.</li>
<li>The intentional web refers to information which are intents of the visitors that is not physically represented in information the web.</li>
<li>The intentional web initiative site (which is linked in the article) is meant to be a community site for developers to be able to work together to enhance user experience, working from the site user perspective instead of what is usual the content creator/publisher side. The site will house, aggregated blogs on intentional web topics, forums, and articles. Amanuelt 15:01, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> We chose this term because it will not be confused with other existing terms. I know it has a low hit count on google, that is a good thing for now. When <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microformats.html" title="Microformats">microformats</a> was announced and posted here there was very little in google until about a month or two went by. But thanks to wikipedia I was able to contact the people working on it right away. The term has so far received positive remarks at the presentation, and on IRC channels when discussed. Amanuelt 15:23, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> not enough hits. Amanuelt, I appreicate your enthusiasm, but notability must come <b>before</b> the Wikipedia article, not after. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 18:01, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Exactly. Wikipedia's mission, as every encyclopedia's, is to list information on already notable subjects. An encylopedia's purpose isn't to make those subjects notable. Therefore, if your argument justifies anything then it is the deletion of the article, which is more than deserved. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 18:33, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I thank you all for your input and reactions. If you feel it is wiser to repost this once the term enters regular use, I will accept your decision as I am new to posting on the wikipedia.

<li>I suggest then, as others have, that you consider creating or enhancing a site for it elsewhere (presumably enhancing <a href="http://intentionalweb.org/" class="external text" title="http://intentionalweb.org/" rel="nofollow">this</a> site), to capture the information about it in more detail than could be done here (encyclopedic means a precis, not in depth exposition), and Google will find it. Over time if the term and concept catches on and is used in real life, people will be falling over themselves to create this article. But for now, it seems self promotional, something that Wikipedians tend to frown on. Also, it may be useful to disclose your affiliation when you argue for or against deletion... as the primary author of this idea/term some would expect some bias in favour, which you should make explicit so your words carry more weight (advance disclosure defuses revelation by others). Note also that the concept itself seems fascinating and seems to have a lot of potential, and if it can be reduced to practice, might be a very important advance. Wikipedia is not the place to publicise things, though. Hope that helps (all IMHO only of course)... ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 22:55, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Original Research, Not notable and vanity. The term, as defined in the article, overlaps with my (day job) research area; and it's not one I've heard at all. It seems just a term for a simple application of Semantic Web principles. Also, I note that despite Amanuelt's claims, there doesn't appear to be any tools that actually use this term to describe themselves.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am against judging articles by arbitrary notability standards (as is WP policy) and measuring a topic's worthiness by its number of Google hits is just plain dumb - presumably an article about the Roman Army in the 2nd Century would also get deleted since you're unlikely to get many google hits about that! <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynical_3d57.html" title="User:Cynical">Cynical</a> 12:34, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The importance of an expression is measured by the number of people that use it. The importance of other things is established by other criteria. Therefore, when trying to check the notability of an expression, technical term, neologism etc, it is worthwhile to argue on its Google hits, though other criteria should be considered as well (eg. if the expression is common on TV more than on the Internet).<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 06:34, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Assumming the premise of the article is right (and part of the reason for posting was to try and get some good peer review), when all oil and gas runs out in some 30+ years - won't it be the biggest event in world history since the fall of the Roman empire?

<dd>Major characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If the article on the work itself becomes long, then giving major characters an article of their own is good practice.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Peachlette. Because of T T going together, this actually has a wide variety of independent origins, and is used to mean several different things. It is similar to Formal Friday, a term coined on <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_J_376a.html" title="Triple J">Triple J</a> radio a year ago that is now in common use. Thursday can be a good day to go out and drink since Friday is just one day, and on Thursday nobody else is doing it. Much better than going out to drink on Wednesday or Tuesday or something. lol.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thirsty Thursday is a legitimate college phenomenon with several years, at the very least, of history behind it.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is not a college phenomenon, it is a slang term for <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binge_drinking.html" title="Binge drinking">binge drinking</a> regardless of the night that it takes place on.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> as unverifiable.</s> I would accept such a list <b>only</b> if there were a criterion for "large-breasted" and if every entry were accompanied by a bra size and a verifiable source citation indicating its accuracy.

<li>Object on any grounds you want. There are many ways to set criteria for this list that would allow <i>verifiability</i>, just like with any other list. The point is, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lara_Croft_4ba5.html" title="Lara Croft">Lara Croft</a> as well as many fictional female characters, are known for breast size- a fact that also significantly inflated Angelina Jolie's bank account. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:27, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>OK, I've edited the article to make it possible to achieve verifiability; listed the single character for which we currently have a source citation; and moved the rest to the article's Talk page. If nobody reverts my changes and there's general consensus that the criteria I propose (bust measurement of 38 inches or more, attested by a verifiable source citation) I'll change my vote. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:00, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I, for one, have no problem with any criteria you want to impose, although I believe it's more a matter for contributing editors to hash out over time on the article talk page.

<li>There is nothing indiscriminate here.

<li>Undoubtedly there is scope for an article on the fictional representation and objectification of women. No question. Whether it can be done without straying into OR I don't know, it probbaly can.

<li><b>Delete</b> - POV, or rather, two POVs. Seriously, in many cases, verifying a "38-inch breast" would be difficult to do for many fictional characters... and virtually impossible for cartoons. Does <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blondie_%28comic_strip%29.html" title="Blondie (comic strip)">Blondie</a> qualify?

<li>Difficult? Indeed it is very difficult. Fact-checking is always difficult. <i>But it is what is needed to build an encyclopedia.</i> What's required, of course, is not a measurement of Blondie's bust, but a good verifiable source citation in which someone says what her bust measurement is. It can be an estimate, but it needs to be a <i>published</i> estimate by someone reasonably <i>authoritative.</i> It can't just be the opinion of a Wikipedia editor. Perhaps there's an interview with Chic Young somewhere or something like that. If you think a specific bust measurement sets the bar too high, you could argue that all that should be required is a verifiable source citation describing Blondie as "busty" or "chesty" or "large-breasted." (Might be easier to find such a citation for L'il Abner's Daisy Mae... <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Newmar_b55c.html" title="Julie Newmar">Julie Newmar</a>...

<p><b>Delete</b> this metal pseudo subgenre. This article basicaly describes the band Mastodon, which already has an article. Spearhead 12:30, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It seems to be used by some people, but it is hard to say how many exactly. It gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22noise+metal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22noise+metal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">23,000 Google hits</a>, but most of them are things like "noise: metal" (when will Google notice that colons change the meaning of an expression?). AMG does not use "noise metal" in its <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:sjd4vwpla9ek~T1" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:sjd4vwpla9ek~T1" rel="nofollow">Mastodon article</a>. Finally Open Directory has no category for that. Heavy metal is famous for its many short-lived subgenres, which seem to come and go at the critics' taste. Let's wait more before having an article for this one. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 07:07, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Spearhead. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 14:43, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Deleting this would create one of the only red links in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heavy_metal_genres.html" title="List of heavy metal genres">List of heavy metal genres</a>. I also note that the nom redirected the article without discussion, then nominated for AfD when the redirect was reverted. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:25, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There are other red links/not linked genres on that list. Second this seems only to refer to Mastodon and lists a whole bunch of red links otherwise... Apparently not a notalbe genre, and if Mastodon uses it themselves, it can be mentioned in their page (which I did add to that page btw). A good reason nevertheless to delete or redirect is is the article state "There aren't many noise metal bands" Spearhead 18:52, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>JJay, I don't quite understand your point. If this is deemed not to be noteworthy, can't we simply delete its reference on that list? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 19:03, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Guys please check <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heavy_metal_genres.html" title="List of heavy metal genres">List of heavy metal genres</a> again. This is a great and long list with only two redlinks as far as I can see. Why create more? Furthermore, there is an entire paragraph on Noise Metal in that list. Deleting that info is a matter for discussion with the editors of the list. Also, if Noise Metal exists as a genre, and even if Mastodon is the only Noise Metal band (not that I believe that), then it deserves an article. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:20, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hum, I see what you mean now. Sorry. I thought it was a real <i>list</i>, with nothing but a sequence of genre names, when it actually provides a small description for each. I've left a note on its talk page asking people to join the discussion here. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 19:35, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That's cool. If the editors of that list (who know much more about heavy metal than me) decide that Noise Metal shouldn't be there, then I would probably vote delete here. But if the genre does exist, then I don't think the article really hurts anyone. Maybe you should switch your vote to abstain or keep, in the interim. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:45, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>FYI I actually am an editor of many metal related articles and I have been trying to clean many pseudo metal subgenres. Also not that the list it is on says "These genres are not generally acknowledged as metal genres" Spearhead 19:49, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Spearhead, I have noticed you are an editor there as well, and I don't mean to say you know nothing about this. I just think that more heavy metal editors would provide a better discussion. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 19:56, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article doesn't say anything not said elsewhere in a better way, it just sort of rambles its was through variously flavoured slices of piffle. It is also factually incorrect; "Any other account of changes within populations (or the emergence of new populations) of life is Creationism, not Science" when alternative scientific theories have been proposed to account for evolution (they were wrong but they were nevertheless science).</p>
<p>It is on VFD to circumvent aggressive bullying tactics from certain users. — <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 15:54, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It would be a great loss if there were not some article on Acharya S. She is an important figure in contemporary religious debate. The extent to which she has been a subject of often vituperative controversy is a measure of her significance. It is unfortunate that because of her controversial nature that she has been subject to treatments that are obvious hatchet jobs. To have no reference to her whatsoever, however, would do the curious reader, as well as the realm of religious polemic, a great disservice.

<li>I concur with Lobo....erase the disparaging remarks represented by Zarov and while you are at it...delete him too. This person is not worthy of receiving ANY respect as an editor or "professional" writer, any more than a zoo monkey. If I sound disparaging of him, it is because he deserves it. Spreading information about her personal life is tantamount to the tactics of a "National Enquirer", not the professionalism of what claims to be an Encyclopaedia. She is a living breathing person and anyone should have her permission to say anything personal about her in a respectable forum such as Wikipedia claims to be. The last time I looked, the Acharya S. site as laid out looked reasonable enough, but apparently, the monkey is busy changing it. I might suspect he is a stalker, what with his fixation on the author.

<li>I concur that this piece should be permanently deleted, on the grounds that it was written as a propaganda/hit piece by user:Zarove. In addition, others have colluded with this intent. User:Crazy Eddie (an admin?) writes that this is about what he can "get away with" in an effort to make the author "look like a nut".

<li>I think it should be made clear that the article has been cleaned up to make it "fair" <i>while this deletion process is going on</i>, to give it the "best chance" for survival. So no, the current version does not reflect the last eight months, which included blatant factual inaccruacies, that were pointed out time and time again and were consistently ignored. It has been suggested to Zarove by an admin that he refrain from adding back the "unresolved issues" until after the deletion process is over. If I haven't misread... why is there need to present a whitewashed version during the deletion process if it wasn't understood to be unfair in the first place? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> (<a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User_talk%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_9e00.html" title="User talk:^^James^^">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_68b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/^^James^^">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dl>
<dd>Perhaps Zarove isn't the best person to write the definitive version, since he appears to have an axe to grind. For the same reason, neither should anyone from Acharya's group.</dd>
<dd>To bemoan some "conspiracy" against her is to trivialize the word. The talkpage entries are there for the world to see. I'm currently conspiring to check my email, and will do so within the hour. Later this evening I've conspired to do some laundry.</dd>
<dd>Many criticisms of her work exist, in varying quality, and it's ludicrous to expect Wikipedia to wave them away with one token sentence and two links. Check out the wiki entries for L. Ron Hubbard, David Icke, Lyndon LaRouche, Mother Theresa even. (Granted, the neutrality of the Mother Theresa entry is in dispute. Apparently she's the victim of "malicious gossip.")</dd>
<dd>I don't think Zarove's final version was particularly hostile to her, although Zarove himself is. (It's not difficult to see how he might have gotten that way.) Points that were simply factual and emotionally neutral have been construed as attacks. Anyone who can't tell the difference is not up to the job of editing his work.</dd>
<dd>He's essentially correct in this: it's not about him. Pull him out of here, let someone else attempt a consensus version, and what will happen? Anything that doesn't function as a press release for Acharya S will be challenged by her followers until it does.</dd>
<dd>Or until Wikipedia tires of listening to them. Given its vindictive reputation--if the Church of Scientology can live with criticisms of L. Ron Hubbard, the church of Acharya S can do the same. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.104.35.169 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.104.35.169_c0dd.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.104.35.169">contribs</a>).</small> 21:49, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The author of the above claims to have just come here on a whim being neither a "wikipedian" or a member of the "church of Acharya". The above person did not leave a username, so shall be named "dual personality", since they dont know the meaning of conspire! Dual (for short), has no idea of what is transpiring in this wikipedia "rumor-mongering' and "libellous" affair. Neither has "dual" taken the time to learn more about how others have been victimised in a personal way that has affected their reputations by lies posted here. Apparently "dual', apart from the condescending nature of the post, shall not be the one to develope a fair consensus, because said person has already made up their minds.</dd>
<dd>Zarove didnt become the way he is because of Acharya's defenders. He is simply that way by choice, spreading personal and defamatory information and otherwise being fixated in the manner of a stalker. He better take seriously what he is doing because it could end badly for him with legal force being set on his tail. He has made insinuating and downright threatening statements to the effect of getting more personal information on her. What has that to do with what should be a simple matter here at Wikipedia? He has the defense of being anonymous right now, but he will be found out and tracked for the statements he has made and has no business doing so. If the founder of Wikipedia does not take serious action about how things are done here, he could find his reputation and Wikipedia's going down the toilet.</dd>
<dd>I do not believe in censorship, but when it comes down to some nobody or anybody, hiding behind anonymity, failing to uphold expectations of quality with civilised behaviour and academic standards...they deserve the "boot". In the real world, a journalist or writer would interview the subject, do the research (supposing they have that capability) and address matters without prejudice. Zarov has clearly represented himself, NOT to have these high standards at all. Yes, this is about him, because he is the AUTHOR of the wikipedia site on Acharya. His bias and the strings to which he is attached are in question....just as the above "dual's" lack of understanding of the harm this forum has by unprofessional fruitcakes. In fact, I consider "dual's" blase attitude insulting.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Acharya S is, from my POV, a notable kook, and on that basis deserves an article. If I am wrong, and she is <i>not</i> a kook, then she needs an article even more. I agree that both Zarove and the followers of Acharya have been very argumentative (<i>very</i> argumentative!), but that does not mean that a quality NPOV article can not be written. If anybody has a problem with individual contributors, then they should take out an RfC against them - not try to delete the article itself, just because you are unhappy with the current version.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now that finals are over, I'm planning on investing some time and attempting to work out a suitable compromise that everyone can agree to. (The criticism section needs reworking - we have criticisms from three main primary sources, and Acharya was kind enough to write rebuttals. The criticism section needs to both better summarize the criticisms - with sources! - and provide summaries of those rebuttals. Zarove also wants a biography section - something I agree with in principle, although I am not happy with his current version.)</dd>
<dd>Yes, I am biased, and I freely admit to that. But I am also willing to work with my opposite numbers. And I <i>might</i> just be a bit more open minded than you think. And no, I am not an admin, I wouldn't take that job if you offered it to me. I'm just an experienced wikipedian. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 19:19, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hello, I disagree. While you may think the scope of this website is limited, it is very well known in some circles of the gaming community for how bad it is when someone makes a post there (those that attended <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lan_party.html" title="Lan party">lan party</a> like <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quakecon.html" title="Quakecon">quakecon</a>). Even though it does not meet the criteria of 5000 registered users per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, it is at 4,700 which is only 300 less than the stated amount. And as such, it would have 5000 registered users, but it is notorious for anyone out side of the "old school" ut99 community to register and post there, as it is the pit of the internet gaming (which is WHY it isn't posted on unrealtournemnt.com, because it has the notorious reputation of having a large group of flamers who show no respect to Epic Games). As Beyond Unreal<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> is the home of all fans of the unreal engine and its universe, prounreal is the home of competitive unreal. CombatCarl, Dawgpound, lotus, cursive, and many other professional videogame players make regular posts there (or formally did before the decline of unreal tournament and it's subsequent lacking communities). As for its alex rank, unreal tournament has long been out of favor with videogame players, as they have flocked to more realistic titles (even quake 4 has bombed after its intitial success with only 700 players online, at peak times), it was previously much more popular. <a href="../../../g/h/r/User%7EGhrog_ac50.html" title="User:Ghrog">user:Ghrog</a></li>

<dd>Eh, you're right. I'm probably just a little frustrated that their are so many biographies of noteworthy, deserving figures, whose articles are in such poor shape, and yet we have editors who think that a two-month-old baby deserves his own <i>encyclopedia</i> article. Look at the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> article, and then compare with people such as <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Curie_c34c.html" title="Pierre Curie">Pierre Curie</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Percy_Robertson_c4c0.html" title="Howard Percy Robertson">Howard Percy Robertson</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I created this article because I feel that it is an important concept that needs to be included on Wikipedia. Much of the widespread controversy in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> revolves around certain nations denying <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s right to exist, and that exact phrase is indeed very widely used, as <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> will demonstrate. I certainly do not deny that my article needs some work and improvement, but that is what the collaborative <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> process is for. I don't know what was there before when it was deleted last time, or how bad it was, but I deliberately tried to include arguments for both sides and include sources, because of the rules specified on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This article documents a key point in the issues around Zionism and modern anti-semitism. The article is at great risk of becoming a home to slanted, POV coverage, but the risk goes with the territory and has the potential to help divide up better this difficult-to-get-right topic.

<li><b>Prove it.</b> The author says he has no idea what was there before. He's not an admin, so he doesn't have access to the deleted version.

<li>Not for me. Those two cites show merely that the phrase is in use in something approximating this context. They do not sufficiently substantiate the contents of the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Several participants asked why we need a new AfD.

There was a majority of particpipants in that DRV discussion who thought that the article this AfD treats, which is a new article broadly taking the shape of the old article, was sufficiently different from the article previously deleted that the new article could not be speedied and so needed a new AfD. The main argument for the article's difference is that the new article has credible sources that the old article lacked. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 15:50, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

I say the right to exist is much broader than Israel and the Middle East, it is about the right to eat, its about the right not to blown by up terrorists (Israel may be included in the article), school kids or grownups with guns, or be depressed by a totalitarian government. The right to exist belongs to everyone, let’s not tie it exclusively to Israel!

<ul>
<li>Yes, but a case has to be made that it is necessary. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fuck" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:fuck">fuck</a> already has a large number of translations, and even organizes them by meaning. Given that this is the sort of dictionary article that garners a <i>lot</i> of attention, it's only worth the hassle of transwikifying this article if it will provide a significant number of additional translations. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:12, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - interesting and useful. There is actually quite a bit of academia surrounding the word, its origins, and derivatives. I know of several full books on the subject.

<ul>
<li>The academia surrounding the word and its origins and derivatives can go in the main article <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a>. What we don't need is a list of translations, which is what Wiktionary and interwiki links are for.

<ul>
<li>On the contrary, the <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> article recently moved to have the main article split in to sub sections, one of which was <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_fuck.html" title="History of fuck">History of fuck</a>, the second being List of translations of Fuck (this article). This article's creation was specifically as a result of a consensus by users/contributors of the <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> article so as to prevent the <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> article from becoming too lengthy or too subjectively talking about individual aspects of <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a>. <a href="../../../f/u/c/Talk%7EFuck_3934.html#Problem_with_trying_to_find_swear_words_in_other_languages" title="Talk:Fuck">Talk:Fuck#Problem_with_trying_to_find_swear_words_in_other_languages</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 04:12, 11 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From actually reading that talk page it is clear that there was <i>no</i> consensus for the translations to be split out. Several editors expressed the opinion that the section should be simply removed outright, and <i>not</i> split out into a sub-article, because this was Wiktionary territory, pure and simple. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:39, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The themed party can only be considered a major event inside the Derwent College and maybe to some extent in other colleges of the university of York. The event is trully not notable outside of that. Therefore that doesn't give it sufficient notoriety to deserve an article on an encyclopedia. Besides, what I defined as "obscure" was the Derwent College and not the University of York. To put it simply, the school is notable but the place where they teach two courses isn't by itself all that notable. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 13:15, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Indeed JJay, it is perhaps the most well know event at the whole Univeristy, certainly the biggest and hosted by the first college to be opened at the Univeristy of York, one of the top univeirsties in the UK.

<li><b>Comment</b> Christian Science, and its Reading Rooms, are much more familliar in the U.S. than elsewhere.

Rainha D. Leonor, 15-A Loja, 1600-683, and open Wednesdays from 2 to 5:30 p.m. Telephone 217 571 451. Or at least that's what <a href="http://www.churchofchristscientist.org/worldwidedirectory/" class="external text" title="http://www.churchofchristscientist.org/worldwidedirectory/" rel="nofollow">the search page</a> says he lives. Of course you have to misspell the city name as "Lisbon." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:23, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There's one across the street from my law firm. And consdering there's a million Christian Scientists worldwide, and non-believers like me are allowed inside, I bet there's thousands of rooms worldwide.

<li>Really obvious <b>keep</b>. This is just a special name for what most people call a "church" and for what I call a "church building." It's just as real and valid as "mosque," "cathedral," "synagogue," "temple," "shrine," and (for Jehovah's Witnesses) "Kingdom Hall." Seeing an AFD notice for this was shocking. The "cult" assertion is utterly irrelevant. The fact that the submitter calls it a "room" when it is really a building shows he didn't check up on it much. In fact, the article should make this more clear. Would also like to see someone <b>expand</b> the article with more information on the assemblies held in reading rooms (what other people would call "worship services"). <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 23:04, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right, but I think you miss the distinction between Christian Science <b>Reading Rooms</b> and Christian Science <b>churches.</b> You may be confused because the term for people who conduct Christian Science services in Christian Science churches on Sunday is "readers." The churches hold worship services on Sundays and usually look recognizably like churches. They say "First Church of Christ, Scientist" on their façades, except for the Mother Church in Boston which is <b>The</b> First Church of Christ, Scientist. I don't think Christian Science Reading Rooms conduct organized group worship. We do have an article on <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Christ%2C_Scientist_837b.html" title="Church of Christ, Scientist">Church of Christ, Scientist</a>, by the way. IMHO the nomination could have been more courteous. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:24, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for clarifying. I was definitely confused. So the Reading Room is more a library, then?

<p>well i see your points. if i can get a promise an entry for the webcomic list won't be non notable I'll write one about it. it really is an interesting site--Aubiekat 00:05, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I suspect no one can promise you that. But you yourself could review the notability guidelines and the deletion criteria and decide for yourself if you feel the site is notable before you invest time in writing an article. Some thought starters: (don't answer here, just think about them): How many users does the site have? What other sites reference it? has it had articles written about it in printed media? have notable webcomics authors cited it as an influence? Does it provide a meaningful service that other sites do not? Does it have industry presence? Are the owners included on convention webcomic panels?These pages may also help: <a href="../../../g/d/_/WP%7EGD_ec47.html" title="WP:GD">WP:GD</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> If you conclude that the site would not be judged notable enough for a Wikipedia article, consider an article at Comixpedia Hope that helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 17:11, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or at least seriously amend it. Webmonkey Ash might well not be worthy of an entry, but then he has coded the Weebl and Bob website which gets millions of hits (meshinks), although I would say that the webcomic list doesn't warrant a seperate entry, although certainly on Comixpedia.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There's a lot to say about thru-hikers and thru-hiking, and in the backpacking world this is a huge topic. The article doesn't start to address it, but an article on the subject is a great idea. Although thru-hiking is probably most closely associated with the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appalachian_Trail_bbbc.html" title="Appalachian Trail">Appalachian Trail</a>, it's relevant to other long trails, so I think it deserves a standalone article. (I may try to work on it but will be out of town for a few days.) <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 21:45, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b> and <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thru-hiking.html" title="Thru-hiking">Thru-hiking</a> and expand. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 22:19, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> As it stands, the article is nothing more than a dictionary definition and is also defined in <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appalachian_Trail_bbbc.html#Hiking" title="Appalachian Trail">Appalachian Trail#Hiking</a>. This could possibly be expanded into an actual article but I would suggest to <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> (comment above) that the scope of the article be expanded to include such terms as "section-hikers," "north-bounders", "south-bounders," trail names adopted by the hikers, and other things involved in hiking the long trails. In that case, the article name and concept could be expanded to something like Hiking the North American crest trails or something similiar. Be sure to include Canada and Mexico if they have such trails. I could provide some photographs from a friend who has done extensive hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington and Oregon. •<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 22:22, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete or Merge into something that gives some context, and is less geo-limited, like <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long-distance_trail.html" title="Long-distance trail">Long-distance trail</a>. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.17.48.241.html" title="User:24.17.48.241">24.17.48.241</a> 01:04, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I (re)wrote the article, and while a lot more can be said, I think it is a decent start. I would support moving to <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thru-hiking.html" title="Thru-hiking">Thru-hiking</a> and redirecting the existing page per Pburka, but I'm not sure if that's appropriate during AfD, so I'll wait till this closes. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 01:08, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm amenable to withdrawing the AfD if the above objections are all met. It's certainly beyond a dicdef. One question: Is <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thru-hiking.html" title="Thru-hiking">Thru-hiking</a> the right name for the topic, or is it "geo-limited?" | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 01:34, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's a good question, but I don't have any knowledge of this outside the US, nor am I able to find any equivalent terms in a quick scan through UK/Australia trail info.

<li>If it's applicable to hiking throughout the U.S., I think that's broad enough for Wikipedia. I got the impression from an earlier comment that it might be a regional U.S. thing. Needless to say, I think any distance long enough to require the verb "hike" is best traversed in a car. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 05:15, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>yeah, and that's unprecedented too. It's not all the time a victims family sues the killer. Plus the MO of the crime parallels the abduction of Polly Klaas in 1993. Furthermore, the case is unique because Westerfield doesn't fit the typical mold of a pedophile. He wasn't a dirty man with a history of child molestation. He was a successful guy, an engineer, self-employed was living a good life at the time. Sure Samantha's mom made a foundation in her memory but it's not the first. It doesn't promise anything differently then the Jacob Wetterling Foundation or Klass for kids. <small style="color:darkgoldenrod">Preceding was another unsigned comment by TripleH1976</small>
<ul>
<li>The foundation may not be particularly unique, but it does make a continuing impact on the surrounding community. Wrongful death suits are hardly novel. The main reason they aren't pursued all the time is that often the killer has no assets worth recovering. At most your arguments would mean that the article should be merged into that of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Westerfield_3c13.html" title="David Westerfield">David Westerfield</a>, but the relevant details seem to already be there.

<li>ok do a redirect then. I think the article is worth keeping. In no way do I see it as a memorial, I simply gave a brief introduction to the girls life and then went into describing the events of her murder. TripleH1976 9:29, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (Sorry,Caerwine! Cover your eyes if you don't want to read it again. <b>1.</b> This article should not be candidates for deletion per policy since it has encyclopedic information in it. Merger should be discussed on the talk page of the article. <b>2.</b> We're not writing for the future, we're writing for today. Today a large segment of the U.S. population wants to read about child murder victims not just the killer. Let's make this article an example of how to do it right. Please, think this through. This isn’t a smart move. Picture this: Someone writes a nice article about a child murder victim. They proudly announces it to people that care. It's deleted for lack of notability. Someone looks for the article, can’t find it, reads the deletion page, and notifies high profile child victim advocates. John Walsh, Marc Klaas, Nancy Grace, Dan Abrams, Greta Van Suteren, and more. Now picture this: Newspaper articles. Talk radio. Jimbo paired off against one of these advocates on cable news explaining why we delete well written articles about child murder victims, but keep thousands of dreadful articles. A foolish way to discover notability. <b>3.</b> This is a famous case. In modern society we remember people and events by writing the facts down. If we don't put the information in encyclopedias and textbooks, she will be forgotten. <b>I suggest we close this deletion case ASAP and move the discussion to the talk page.</b>--<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 04:18, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"'Thank You FloNight."' I also do not understand why this article, is being considered for deletion. This case got more coverage then the Samantha Runnion case(referring to CourtTV coverage), yet that is not being considered for deletion because her mother dedicated a non-profit organization in her memory. --TripleH1976 12:01 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>This article should not be deleted. If you feel the information and the way it's presented has too much of the tone of a memorial, edit it.

<li><small>I'm the newbie who wrote the article. Sorry it's kinda weak (I'm new here - first post&#160;:). Anyway, I heard the term today, and came to wikipedia for a definition, none found, so did some research in to where it got started, and posted the artcle based on what I saw here about "Metrosexual". <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERock808_2034.html" title="User:Rock808">Rock808</a> 22:11, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small><b>Delete</b>. Not a personal attack, but a neologism created by a non-notable blogger.

<li><small>Well, in defense of my article, "<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrosexual.html" title="Metrosexual">Metrosexual</a>" is also listed in "unwords.com" and IS listed here in Wikipedia as well. "<a href="../../../u/b/e/Ubersexual.html" title="Ubersexual">Ubersexual</a>" is also listed on Wikipedia and is called a "neologism" even in it's definition here!! Other wikipedia entries include <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomosexual.html" title="Pomosexual">pomosexual</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pansexuality.html" title="Pansexuality">pansexuality</a> Also, everyone is "unknown" until they become known, so that point seems rather invalid. It seems that if people are using the word as much as they are, they should be able to look it up here. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERock808_2034.html" title="User:Rock808">Rock808</a> 22:25, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li><small>It is true that metrosexual[ity] is also a neologism. However it's a neologism which has achieved widespread use (over 1600 unique google hits and another 150 google news hits). It's also true that everyone is unknown until they become known (in fact, it's a tautology), but Wikipedia's goal is to document notability, not establish it. If you can find some instances of sapiosexuality used in print or the media I will reconsider my vote. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 22:41, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small>Sapiosexual is used in this film review by <a href="http://www.slantmagazine.com/Film/film_review.asp?ID=1402" class="external text" title="http://www.slantmagazine.com/Film/film_review.asp?ID=1402" rel="nofollow">SlantMagazine</a>. It gets 1,550 hits on Yahoo. On OkCupid.com (dating site) there are 27 people who list <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/interests?i=sapiosexual" class="external text" title="http://www.okcupid.com/interests?i=sapiosexual" rel="nofollow">Sapiosexual as an interest</a>, 0 as ubersexual, only 12 <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/interests?i=metrosexual" class="external text" title="http://www.okcupid.com/interests?i=metrosexual" rel="nofollow">listed as metrosexual</a>, 2 listed as pomosexual. These other words are already in Wikipedia yet used less! Social networking site Tribe.net has <a href="http://sexygraymatter.tribe.net/" class="external text" title="http://sexygraymatter.tribe.net/" rel="nofollow">126 people in a sapiosexual tribe</a>, whereas ubersexual and pomosexual have no tribes at all.

<ul>
<li><small>Actually, yahoo only has 103 unique hits. If you keep clicking "next", it stops on page 11. And a lot of the hits that it did find appear to be duplicates. I think that yahoo's duplicate detection isn't as sophisticated as google's. However I think that you're making a strong argument for the deletion of ubersexual and pomosexual. I'm going to list ubersexual, but I think that pomosexual is borderline notable. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 00:33, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small>Well, after reading the policy of "Wikipedia is not a dictionary", then I see how it's possible there is not enough data on this yet to get an ENCYCLOPEDIA entry, but it bothers me that no admin here suggested moving it to the Wiktionary (which I knew nothing about). <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERock808_2034.html" title="User:Rock808">Rock808</a> 02:13, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>Well, Sapiosexual seems to be used more commonly than other similar terms which HAVE been accepted in Wikipedia. If a word is being used and I don't know what it is, then where DO you suggest I go to look if not here?? 70.112.22.25 03:36, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</small>
<dl>
<dd><small>Google? Or ask the person you saw using it? There are plenty of communities (Internet and otherwise) that have internal jargon/slang that doesn't appear in general references. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 17:02, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</small>
<dl>
<dd><small>That's ridiculous. If someone used the word "love" and I did a google on that I'd have millions of links to pages where people use the word, but that does not DEFINE it. How many hours of looking at how people use it would it take to get just an "idea" of it's many possible meanings. That's why we have a dictionary or encyclopedia. A single source to directly get an answer as to the meaning and enfluence of a word or topic, it's history, evolution, and references.</small></dd>

<li><small><b>Delete</b> - wiktionary's popularity has made it a launching pad for meme wannabes; it takes no time whatsoever any more for a new word to appear on some blogs/sites.

Unlike some neologisms it also fulfills a need for such a word-expression and, I note, pre-dates blogosphere, etc. Additionally, re <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a>'s comment above, there appears to be no intent to use WP as a 'launch pad' as this is a term with pre-existing widespread usage on multiple continents. --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">Vamp</a>:<a href="../../../v/a/m/User_talk%7EVampWillow_2eb2.html" title="User talk:VampWillow">Willow</a> 16:58, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</small>

Even if it is only beginning to be used off Livejournal, is almost 500 people still not notable enough to merit an entry? Wikipedia is not paper, and once a word has this kind of following it deserves a write-up. Yes, it is not as big as metrosexual but Britannica will probably have a metrosexual article if it doesn't already. Including emerging words like 'sapiosexual' makes wikipedia better than britannica. If the word falls out of use what's the harm -- we can revisit this in a years time and discuss it again then. There seems to be substantial support for keeping this article as well as substantial support for deleting it -- I certainly see no consensus at this time. <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodfox_2c77.html" title="User:Todfox">Kit</a> 05:29, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I first heard the word two years ago at a party (in real life). I have since heard it often (in real life). I know people who own the T-shirt (though I wish I knew where they got it). I've used the word to describe myself to other human beings (in real life). I would estimate that of the people I know (in real life), aproximately 300 of them would know exactly what I'm talking about when I say "sapiosexual", because they've heard and used the term before. I know this mainly because they attend the same parties where I hear and use the term. &#160;:) Maybe it's just a Seattle thing, but the word seems like it's here to stay. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunaverse_6a9e.html" title="User:Lunaverse">lunaverse</a> 06:01, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd like to add a comment to my comment: I was flipping through the replies to the original "sapiosexual" LJ post, and saw that someone there stated, "I've had similar success spreading the fabulous word <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infornography.html" title="Infornography">infornography</a>". This is a word I have <i>not</i> heard in real life or general usage at all (outside of the anime show <a href="../../../l/a/i/Lain.html" title="Lain">Lain</a>), yet obviously there is a Wikipedia article devoted to that particular neologism. Granted there are more Google hits for "infornography", but seriously... how many have ever actually <i>used</i> or heard this word IRL? Remember that once upon a time, words were created and spread into common usage long before Google or the internet were developed. People still speak to each other face to face, and this should be as much (if not more) of a yardstick than number of Google hits. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunaverse_6a9e.html" title="User:Lunaverse">lunaverse</a> 06:27, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Previous AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Robert_of_basevorn_f8be.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robert of basevorn">here</a> was sort-of set aside by Deletion Review in light of the recreation we now have. The people there expressed some concern that it may still be original research. Reading the article, it doesn't appear to offer external sources for its claims about the various things it talks about, unless that one reference at the bottom says all this. AfD should consider carefully whether this is still original research: and delete it if it is. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:23, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hmm, the subject of the article looks like a real book. The work used as the only reference looks like it's real. Looking at the article, yeah, a lot of the content should probably be removed or fixed. But I don't see a reason to delete, unless the argument is that what's there is unsalvagable and we're better off not having it as a starting point. I don't see a reason why that's true, so I say <b>keep and clean up</b> for now. I'll take a few whacks at the article over the next few days. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:36, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep/clean-up</b> I'm one of the two people who voted to delete the first time this was AfD, I also voted to undelete on deletion review (are the voting comments there not archived, they would be relevant to this vote also). The article was contributed by a graduate student as part of classwork (University of Waterloo) on the history of rhetoric. It's encyclopedic material, I'd say the problem is more verifiability than OR. It really needs the student to come back and add references of some sort. It's my understanding that this will most likely happen sometime early next term. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 01:59, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are two cited sources, and I don't see how this qualifies as "novel narrative or historical interpretation". I'm interested because I've been mulling over the idea of asigning WP work to graduate students as part of their course work. While I would not have done it in the way that the prof associated with this article did, I am mindful of some of the problems they might run across. I'm trying to understand how you think this qualifies as OR, Splash, Xolos, can you explain your reasoning? It just doesn't make sense to me. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 07:53, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This should not have been listed; it's a manifestly encyclopedic topic, a seminal work on medieval rhetoric. If there are too few citations then more should be added.
