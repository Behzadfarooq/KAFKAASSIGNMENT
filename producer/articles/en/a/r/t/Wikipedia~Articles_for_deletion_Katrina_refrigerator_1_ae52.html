<li>There's sourcing both for the name (the first source) and from a reputable source that reports frequently on Katrina (NPR). I understand the objection, but I disagree. With some wikifying and a little more sourced information, this will be a perfectly fine article. <b>Keep</b>. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara"><font color="#F0B400">Che</font> <font color="#004411">Nuevara</font></a> 02:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> due to references but rename. I don't see much evidence for the term "Katrina Refrigerator" (one source isn't enough IMO), let alone with a second capital letter (as with proper nouns).

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> for now. The article needs more sources and citations for some of its more outrageous claims (spoiled food = corrosive toxic blobs?), but I'm inclined to give it a shot to be improved.

<blockquote>
<p>I wrote this article and the article on <a href="../../../f/e/m/FEMA_Trailer_980c.html" title="FEMA Trailer">FEMA Trailers</a> because I felt that Wikipedia had inadequate information on the ongoing recovery from the storm, of which, the collection of <b>"Katrina Refrigerators"</b> was a ubiquitous first step. This term was in widespread use in the immediate aftermath of the storm, but seldomn mentioned now because nearly all of the refrigerators were destroyed. The appearance of these refrigerators was a one-time event, and getting rid of them was part of the cleanup phase of the recovery effort. This is a real term, and the local new media did report it using this name. The local parish governments passed ordinances and posted instructions on their websites concerning these refrigerators. Understand that all this took place when the city was still in a state of emergency, and online information was updated frequently. I've been unable to relocate the original onilne city debris collection schedules.<br />
<br />
It tried to emphasize the fact that debris collection was a major crisis throughout the disaster area. In New Orleans, every neighborhood looked like a <a href="http://cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/10/05/hurricanes.toxins/index.html?eref=sitesearch" class="external text" title="http://cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/10/05/hurricanes.toxins/index.html?eref=sitesearch" rel="nofollow">landfill</a> because of the volume of storm debris and flood-damaged appliances. Landfills outside the city were shutting down because they couldn't handle the volume of incoming debris. There were serious concerns of an outbreak of disease. In fact garbage collection is still a crisis in many parts of the city <a href="http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/viewStory.cfm?recID=15723" class="external text" title="http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/viewStory.cfm?recID=15723" rel="nofollow">right now</a>.<br />
<br />
I understand why this article may need to be deleted, since <b>"Katrina Refrigerator"</b> is a recently coined word that only storm victims seem to use. I suppose what we really need are two new articles, <b>Evacuation from Hurricane Katrina</b> and <b>Return after Hurricane Katrina</b>, describing the month-long exile experienced by New Orleanians when our city was forcibly abandoned, and when we returned one month later to a city in ruins. These two articles would cover specific aspects of the disaster not already covered in <b><a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction_of_New_Orleans_cc1b.html" title="Reconstruction of New Orleans">Reconstruction of New Orleans</a></b>. That way, this refrigerator business can be incorporated into a larger article. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinstonho0805_9baa.html" title="User:Winstonho0805">winstonho0805</a> (2006 Oct. 17). <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metairie.html" title="Metairie">Metairie</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Oh, come on. This article is nothing more than a description written by a single person of a phenomenon that occurs after any major natural disaster. Where is the evidence that the term is in use beyond the author and the author's friends? None of the so-called sources make any mention. The article is clearly meant for something like Uncyclopedia, not Wikipedia. â€”<a href="../../../c/u/i/User%7ECuivienen_fddf.html" title="User:Cuivienen">Cuivi</a><a href="../../../c/u/i/User%7ECuivienen_Esperanza_0e62.html" title="User:Cuivienen/Esperanza"><font color="green">Ã©</font></a><a href="../../../c/u/i/User_talk%7ECuivienen_9aca.html" title="User talk:Cuivienen">nen</a> 14:17, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, I suspect that something like this happens every time several hundred thousand refrigrators, some of them opened by floodwaters, are left without power for several weeks in more than 90 F heat.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and clean-up. Maybe eventually merge with something. The mass disposal of contaminated refrigerators after Katrina is a verified phenomenon, although I'm skeptical about some of the claims, such as melting plastic. It was significant for a population of hundreds of thousands of people. (The New Orleans metropolitan area had a pre-Katrina population of around a million.) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardamon_ba9d.html" title="User:Cardamon">Cardamon</a> 23:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge into more general article</b>. It has been notable enough to have at least one book published on the subject (entitled "Spoiled") as well as various media and web attention. Actually, I think this would be better as a section of a broader article, something like <b>Folk responses to Hurricane Katrina</b> or something else covering the early months of people returning to the disaster area. Yes, this could be made more encyclopedic, and should (and I hope to participate in making it so). In the mean time, the article contains some informative information and is doing no harm that I can see. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 22:51, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
