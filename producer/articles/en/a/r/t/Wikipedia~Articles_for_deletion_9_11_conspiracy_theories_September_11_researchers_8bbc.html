<li><b>Comment</b>: There are two articles of similar title: <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_September_11_researchers_9e36.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories/September 11 researchers">9/11 conspiracy theories/September 11 researchers</a>, and <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>. Also, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_researchers.html" title="September 11 researchers">September 11 researchers</a> redirects to <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>. All of this should, in my opinion, be merged into one article. I prefer "9/11 conspiracy theories" as the lump-in article. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 17:09, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That works for me; I think that was the recommendation of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_September_11%2C_researchers_0575.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/September 11, researchers">Previous AfD</a>. The content then at <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_researchers.html" title="September 11, researchers">September 11, researchers</a> was to be merged into <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>. That never happened, and the articles developed for a while as different versions of the same topic. I found it a few weeks ago and finished the merge, but there is a question now whether <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_researchers.html" title="September 11 researchers">September 11 researchers</a> should be kept, since it has developed independently since the last AfD. That's not my view, so I would prefer someone else present that case. I think the content at <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_September_11_researchers_9e36.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories/September 11 researchers">9/11 conspiracy theories/September 11 researchers</a> should be merged into <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, and that <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_September_11_researchers_9e36.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories/September 11 researchers">9/11 conspiracy theories/September 11 researchers</a> should then be deleted. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 18:12, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, because the merge recommended by the previous deletion has been completed. I think I need to make some things clear as well, since Durin and Tom are obviously unaware of some things that I did:
<ul>
<li>In response to the consensus favouring a merge after the last discussion, I tagged <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_researchers.html" title="September 11 researchers">September 11 researchers</a> for a merge with <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>.</li>
<li>When nothing happened, I moved the article to <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_September_11_researchers_9e36.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories/September 11 researchers">9/11 conspiracy theories/September 11 researchers</a>, to make it clear that it was there only temporarily and could be deleted once the merge was complete.</li>
<li>The merging recommended above by Durin has already been completed.</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - Yeah the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> bit at least recognises the <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> theory. I said it was Saddam Hussein from the moment the planes flew in, and I don't get why people think its so hard to believe. The 9/11 one mentions it, whilst this other one doesn't. That theory should be expanded a fair bit though. Oh, also, I saw no mention of anti-globalisation terrorist group S11 being a theory. They were widely blamed, and the group was totally destroyed as a result. Oh and don't forget China. China had a motive to do it, so as to destroy the American economy to precipitate an invasion at a later date. After all, China was very annoyed at America then after they had shot down one of China's spy planes, and China is America's biggest challenge to world dominance, and the most likely country to take over control. These 2 theories do need to be mentioned. But since I personally believe the Saddam Hussein theory, I think that that needs to be explored an awful lot more than it is.<a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 22:07, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

For example, it now includes physicist Steven Jones. The <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> article is way too long at 76 KB, so there's no good reason for the list not to be split off as a separate article (not a section or a subpage). I propose that it be <b>moved</b> to <a href="../../../r/e/s/Researchers_questioning_the_official_account_of_9_11_872c.html" title="Researchers questioning the official account of 9/11">Researchers questioning the official account of 9/11</a>, as this is an NPOV title, and it also avoids the concerns that some had about the old "September 11 researchers" title.

<li><b>keep</b>: The Wiki is all about dissemination of knowledge, not the suppression thereof.

I'd strongly suggest replacing their biographies with their conclusions about <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> as the conclusions are much more relevant to the rest of the article. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:54, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Everyday there are more researchers joining the 9/11 truth movement and getting the courage to speak up, particuarly academics, like Steven Jones.
