<li><b>Keep</b> What purpose does it serve to delete this entry? Able and Baker's entry was not made to plug the webcomic, nor was it made out of sheer fandom.The article was not made to help the webcomic from failing, in fact quite the contrary is true. Able and Baker's entry was made to provide information on a webcomic that is beginning to become very popular. It is completely informative in nature and should stay. SenatorVidal

<li><b>Keep</b> Size is no assertion of quality, the cartoon is well written adn thought out, generally quite high-brow. It is unique amongst web comics for its style and content. I take it you wish to delete Betamax from the Wikipedia for not being as big as VHS? It does suprise me how small minded some people are? Are comics not a work of expressive art? I read a lot of Webcomics regularly, but this is the only one I can get friends and family to read or be interested in. Sport Monkey (www.sport-monkey.com)

<li>We've had our fair amount of analogies on these threads, and that is by far the worst. What about this? "I take it you wish to delete Thimbleberry Drive, because it's not as wide or as well travelled as the M1?" Yes! - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 14:45, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, I'm not making an analogy of such ilk. And for you to think you are somehow better than me is offensive. We are not talking about comparing roads, but art, shoud I say delete Damien Hurst because I just don't get it? You are a little child who wants his own way and I don't see why starting an argument on this is fair to anyone. Grow up son.
<ul>
<li>How have I offended you? Have I claimed that I am a whole lot "better" than someone I don't know. Just as you have no idea who I am? Comparing roads to art? You compared art to betamax, I was just drawing a parallel with your broken argument. I don't get a lot of stuff that <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracey_Emin_061e.html" title="Tracey Emin">Tracey Emin</a> does, by don't get, I mean, I think it's crap. I'm not going to delete that though, just because I don't like it. I nominated Able and Baker, because I don't think its notable. So far, the only establishment of notability, is that it is on the Dayfree Press network, is google rank number 1 for its own name (how is this notable?) and is mentioned once by the creator of dayfree press. To me, this isn't notability. Just as a local artist being mentioned in the local Hammersmith Daily News is not notability. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 17:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Also: Wikipedia is trying to destroy your hard work! Readers put together such a badass page and now it is up for deletion! Go tell them what you think.</i></dd>
<dd>Now, why is it that one comic creator can do this and have no wikipedian backlash while another cannot? I'm going to propose a few thoughts:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>both these AfDs prove the utter uselessness of Alexa in determining a comic's popularity.</li>
<li>both of these comics have been around for a long time and have rather huge archives. They both unquestioningly meet proposal B and their non-compliance with the <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">regular proposal</a> is questionable at best.</li>
<li>I'm not going to use this page to refight <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Built_for_Comfort_79ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Built for Comfort">another comic's AfD</a>, but I will say this: <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a>, why don't you just lay off with the deletion votes? You obviously don't really know what you're talking about. Both this comic and the previous one have connections with Dayfree Press which, if you are unaware, is a rather large comic-publishing page. Both have readers who have been <i>spamming</i> their votes for deletion pages. But guess what? That means that they're both well-read. What's next?</li>

<dd>My own comic, "8 1/2 by Eleven" publishes at <a href="http://www.lucastds.com/webcomic" class="external free" title="http://www.lucastds.com/webcomic" rel="nofollow">http://www.lucastds.com/webcomic</a>. According to Alexa, my site ranking is 334,578. That's actually pretty close to my comic being accepted as a noteworthy article by Wikipedia!! How deceiving is that ranking? Hmm... let's see! I'd venture to guess that Most People have not even ever <i>heard</i> of my comic. I've got about 500 readers a <i>week</i>. I'd bet anything that Able and Baker, which is WAY more respected in the webcartooning community than I am and is a member of <i>Dayfree Press</i> for goodness sake (which most people admit they must have heard of) has more readers than me. And yet, with a few more American Internet Explorer users reading my comic, I could warrant an entry in Wikipedia while Able and Baker can't. Able and Baker is SOMEHOW <b>way</b> farther down on the Alexa rankings. Who knows why? And you're wondering why this system is absurd to me? Please, someone create an encyclopedia entry about my comic!! The AfD would be hard to prove on that one, even though no one in the webcomic community has even <i>heard</i> of my comic.

<li><b>Establishing Notability</b>... just reread <b>A Man in Black</b>s "comment"... which in fact wasn't a comment at all, but a derisive note about how much he thinks this comic is non-notable.

<p>What counts as <b>notability</b> in the case of Able and Baker, then? Just an Alexa rating?

Who knows. Apparently Alexa is the only thing that counts for notability around here. But then again, apparently Wikipedia editors don't consider rational arguments at all, and instead make derisive comments about comics despite a huge public outpour against deletion and several repeated comments establishing the notability of these comics that <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> seems to enjoy putting up for deletion so much.

<li>A one line mention by the dayfree press creator in a list of 25 people in 2004 is not notable. Huge public outpoor, how many websites out there cannot manage a "huge" public outpoor. Any forum with what 30 active members could contribute to a huge public outpoor. And a reply to some other posts made about me above, since when have any of my arguments been, this webcomic is rubbish, let's delete it because I don't like it. The reason for the my nomination is lack of notability, I don't just nominate randomly. For example, I didn't nominate <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus_Envy_c4aa.html" title="Venus Envy">Venus Envy</a> a keenspace comic, because Google shows up some mention in the outside world. But in my eyes, just being part of a online comics group just isn't notable enough. And I've been accused of an over reliance on Alexa. You're right Tedzsee, I wouldn't nominate a comic with your ranking, because I know Alexa to be inaccurate. But I also know, that a reasonably popular website, no matter what kind, would have an Alexa ranking less than 1 million. I wouldn't put it past me, for some lame webcomic readers to install Alexa just to rank up their comic now&#160;:( - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 17:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Reply</b> "A one line mention by the dayfree press creator in a list of 25 people in 2004 is not notable" &lt;-- How is it not notable? Do you realize the source I am quoting is Comixpedia? Comixpedia is one of the most respected SOURCES of webcomic's journalism... Along with Digital Strips, Phil Kahn, the Webcomics Examiner and Websnark, it is basically the pillar of webcomics journalism. If you don't know that, and don't realize that being mentioned in an article by them is enough to make the comic notable, than I suggest you don't even bother voting in debates like this! As for <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a>'s remark that an article about my comic wouldn't be deleted because my Alexa number is respectable, I can only laugh now!

<dd>Today, Able and Baker was linked to by <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionable_Content_a910.html" title="Questionable Content">Questionable Content</a> in a completely unrelated-to-this-deletion-debate link. I still don't understand what constitutes this mysterious "notability" in the eyes of Wikipedia editors...
<ol>
<li>This comic has a dedicated fan base.</li>
<li>This comic is mentioned by a top webcomic journal.</li>
<li>This comic has huge archives and has been updating for several years.</li>
<li>This comic is a member of Dayfree Press, which is represented at every major webcomic convention.</li>
<li>This comic is linked to by a site with an Alexa rating of under 20,000.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>However, because this comic does not have an Alexa rating of under 200,000 itself, it is seen as non-notable. I don't understand the logic!! <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 05:43, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some possible responses to think about:
<ol>
<li>Doesn't it matter how big the fan base is? How can we tell that? (I'm asking the latter literally--can you suggest a good way to tell, besides Alexa?)</li>
<li>Top webcomic journal? That's not quite a newspaper, is it? It's about webcomics, so of course it will discuss many webcomics; more even, perhaps, than Wikipedia should have.</li>
<li>Lots of people have been doing lots of things for several years. I respect all of them, especially those who do things like writing a comic that require skills I'll never have. But still, is this notable in and of itself?</li>
<li>Dayfree Press might be notable on its own; that doesn't necessarily mean all its members should have separate articles.</li>
<li>Again, having a link from a notable site doesn't mean notability. It ought to depend on context, I think?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>To use an analogy, let me talk about something that doesn't deserve a Wikipedia article: <i>me</i>. However, I can say:
<ol>
<li>My name appears on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Science_Foundation_f301.html" title="National Science Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> website, and the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annals_of_Improbable_Research_2f3e.html" title="Annals of Improbable Research">Annals of Improbable Research</a> website, both of which I'm confident have excellent webtraffic ratings.</li>
<li>I have done physics research, day in and day out, for a number of years. All of this is documented and verifiable.</li>
<li>I am a member of the <a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Toroidal_LHC_ApparatuS_2b4c.html" title="A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS">A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS</a> collaboration, which is funded by several dozen countries to the tune of at least $500 Million.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Perhaps the issue is that "notable for a webcomic" is a different standard than "notable for a general encyclopedia"--which is why there's a wiki site just for comics now. Please understand none of this is an attack on this comic in particular, it is part of a larger discussion on how many webcomics should be documented in the encyclopedia.

<dd>See, this is part of the problem. Being NOTABLE FOR A WEBCOMIC doesn't require that much. Webcomicking is a pretty small community. And, unfortunately for staunch Wikipedians, as their popularity picks up, I think that Wikipedia is going to face an increasing challenge regarding what sort of comics are seen as noteworthy. The main problem, however, is that Wikipedia's policy concerning webcomics is REALLY REALLY REALLY iffy. <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a> definitely meets both Alternate Proposals no prob. By association and notability in the webcomics community, it could be argued that the comic meets Proposal A as well, in a way. Really, the problem is with Wikipedia's policy. And I figure, until the policy gets sorted out in a firm manner, a campaign to simply oust every webcomic article deemed to be hangnails should be stopped. I'm not saying that you're attacking any particular comic, but I am saying that what is going on here really, in a way, contravenes the spirit of Wikipedia. As found on the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EWeb_comics_f741.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Web comics">talk page</a> of webcomics, inclusion in NOTABLE collectives such as Dayfree Press and winners of awards and such are probably a good place to start with expanding Notability to something "based on something other than popularity or longevity". In the meantime, deleting possibly-notable comics while such bickering is going on seems to be rather sketch.</dd>
<dd>Also, it should be noted that mention in Websnark or Digital Strips or Comixpedia.com is rather like being mentioned in a top music mag in comparison. In terms of webcomic notability, it definitely a big plus. Whether this counts for anything in a "general encyclopedia" is what is in question. However, as I said, if this encyclopedia is going to include webcomics at all, then it should include webcomics that are deemed noteworthy by the webcomicking community. And I think there's no question that this one is. --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 07:17, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One other thing... the argument about YOU being non-notable is an interesting one. See the above discussion with <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> comparing MY comic to the <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a> article to see the futility of using an Alexa-based system to verify the importance of a webcomic. According to <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a>, an article on my comic would be difficult to delete because of its Alexa ranking despite my comic not being notable at all in the webcomic community. It should be noted that if enough people undertook to write an article about your scientific research and work, and could back it up and connect you to the top names in the scientific community and you were working with those top names in some sort of collective, you might very well be notable if you had an effect on the small area of study that you were researching. Certainly, if you were cited by a top scientist (the way, say <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a> was linked to today by <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionable_Content_a910.html" title="Questionable Content">QC</a> and mentioned in a list of 25 notables last year on Comixpedia and working with a collective such as <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree</a>, I'm sure the argument could be made that you were notable in your community. This is essentially the argument that I am making. If that makes sense... --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 07:24, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps it isn't obvious, but the criteria at <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> are <i>proposed</i>, and the "alternate proposals" are not generally recognized as being workable by the community as a whole--see, for comparison, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The main proposal is no good either, because of problems with Alexa, but it aknowledges the important fact that a webcomic must have a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> exceptional readership base (if no other verifiable assertion of notability is given). Anyway, there are some regular wikipedia editors who feel that the most lenient proposals are appropriate, and they're the ones who work (and write their views) on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_eab2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics</a>.

<dd>I do have to say that being in the top webcomic mag is a very different thing from being in a top music mag, based on basic things like total readership--my point is precisely that only the <i>most</i> notable webcomics meet the general Wikipedia notability criteria.</dd>

<li>Wow...you know, I never thought it would be possible for an AfD to be more untidy than the BFC one. Then I saw this.
<ul>
<li>Yes, amazing isn't it. Tedszee mentioned it up above, but one of <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a>'s claim to fame is being mentioned in a top 25 list. Can I clarify that it was mentioned once in passing, and the actual top 25 list was referring to the founder of the <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree Press</a>, who just said that Able and Baker was a new cartoon. It has been compared to being mentioned in a music magazine, that does not make it notable. How many bands have been mentioned in music magazines that no one will ever hear about, and no one will be influenced by? How many bands have had their recordings played once or twice on the late John Peel's show at 1am in the morning? What about all the unsigned bands which get a song or 2 onto XFM? Being a member of the Dayfree Press does not mean instant notability, the comics should be assessed one by one, and assert it's own notability. Just as a band on the same record label as <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moby.html" title="Moby">Moby</a> doesn't mean it's instantly notable, and a book published by the same company which publishes <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> isn't notable. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 14:10, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hanchen's attempt to get another point in nonwithstanding, what happened is that the comic in question linked directly to this AfD page, and told everyone to "come tell them what you think." Thus we had a bunch of newbies who looked like sockpuppets to me, so I noted them. Then, when I realized my "mistake" (I still think the info is useful), I tried to explain what was going on to the newbies actively editing the page. I've done the best I could...&#160;:P -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 14:58, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, nn, and in any case websites and webcomics shouldn't be given the slightest hope that they get their own ego-boosting articles on Wikipedia kept by rounding up all their supporters and sending them directly to vote the VfD--it shouldn't even come up. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 21:42, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
