<dd>And once again, Anynobody, your "intuitive abilities" would have failed you. I have no objection if you pick my arguments apart though I think you would get a larger audience if you did it on the main page. You need to figure out, Anynobody, that I object to your picking my motives and intentions apart. That borders on <a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">WP:PA</a> and, besides, you are wrong.

<dd>Why not; everything else does, but that's too bad. If you have it ready, I would very much welcome your list and your input. Best, <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 08:04, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a bit puzzled, you attribute "intuitive abilities" to me, yet doubt them at the same time. Sadly this time I fear you'd be incorrect, it's only after you were unsuccessful in defending some of your faulty premises that rational discussion ceased. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html#RFC_on_.22Biographical_information.22" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara_Schwarz#RFC_on_.22Biographical_information.22</a> At that point, I had to doubt one of the following: your neutral POV, your intelligence, your sanity, or your honor. I think you have a COI affecting your POV. To be clear: You seem intelligent, you don't seem crazy, and any dishonorable actions you might commit (note the future tense) could be explained by your desire to defend your faith (believe me that is not an insult, people sacrifice honor in the name of religion quite often without realizing it). In short, in picking apart your arguments there is a certain amount of logical error I'd want to point out. Since I'm sure you're not an idiot, I'd have to explain the gaps in logic as being overlooked by your strong POV. For example, comparing Barbara Schwarz to the "McMillan Electric Co." is a prime example of faulty logic and actually kinda hurts your argument anyway. Comparing one individual who generates more "paperwork" than an entire electric company REALLY illustrates how far she has taken her claims. Despite the fact that it's an apples and oranges comparison, (1,497 parking tickets for hundreds of individual employees is actually much less than the sum total of all the pages she has filed in FOIA requests and related <i>pro se</i> litigation). <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 08:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is there to be curious about? Clearly it is a template that is outdated but <i>convenient</i> to one side of an ongoing small faction war over <i>cult</i> related pages which has adopted the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> page as one of its battle fields. I hope it is entirely clear to anyone reading that template that it is pretty much 99.9% meaningless. While canvassing isn't particularly ethical behavior there is no way of ever knowing if the people responding to an AfD are "representative of Wikipedians". Its absurd and I find it rather offensive that someone would want us to believe its possible. That's my comment.<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelleSmith_2335.html" title="User:PelleSmith">PelleSmith</a> 22:34, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The template <a href="../../../%21/v/o/Template%7E%21vote.html" title="Template:!vote">Template:!vote</a> is widely used. I was unaware that <a href="../../../s/u/r/Wikipedia%7ESurvey_notification_9562.html" title="Wikipedia:Survey notification">Wikipedia:Survey notification</a> was no longer active, but the wording of the template itself is still most appropriate. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smee</a> 00:47, 12 March 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I'd never actually seen this particular template before, but the extremely similar template {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_a_ballot_89d1.html" title="Template:Not a ballot">not a ballot</a>}} sees regular use when there is reason to believe that someone may (whether in good faith or not) tried to deliberately solicit participants from a specific side of the issue in order to sway the discussion. Since such solicitation <i>is</i> in fact counter to Wikipedia policy (not "outdated" in any way, not "99.9% meaningless") I really can't imagine why anyone acting in good faith would treat the act of placing a template alerting people to this point as if <i>that</i> was somehow counter to Wikipedia policy. I also find the allegations about "<i>convenient</i> to one side of an ongoing small faction war" extremely interesting, as it would seem to be a pretty blatant violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:41, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Respectfully <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>, the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> process is designed to let neutral editors vote after reviewing reasons to delete or keep an article. The idea of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is what putting the pro/con arguments together addresses. By moving my points about notability to the bottom, it could be argued that you don't want neutral editors to have both sides of this entire discussion.

<dd>Do what you have to do, <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>. My reading of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> suggests that this is a place to discuss both the reasons to delete AND to keep. Since you initiated the AfD I didn't feel it appropriate to put the my reasons above yours, but please understand I only want editors to know all the facts as seen by both sides.

<dd>All I did was move your remarks out of the middle of mine and to a proper and prominent position. And if do not please stop your "analyzing" you may find <i>yourself</i> on the wrong side of a User RfC. As in "Your actions up to this point seem to indicate you do not." This is part of my good-faith attempt to get you to stop.

<p>With all due respect, I think you are minimizing your error here. If the "proper and prominent position" were the middle of the page, why was it kept at the top? <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>, it's not really "analyzing" to see that moving relevant info about the AfD as a whole away from the top is an attempt to hide reasons NOT to delete the article. It's behavior like this that led me to believe your ability to make neutral decisions relating to your faith is compromised because your strong feelings for it cause you to be impartial. (Seriously, and I mean no offense, how can you logically conclude points made in the middle of the page, sandwiched in between votes, have a prominent position on the page? Considering that the page itself scrolls top-down.) <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 06:13, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The user has a history of disrupting the project in the past, issuing legal threats to users, and creating so much of a problem that even past <i>talk pages</i> on articles had to be hidden from view and archived only available to be viewed by Administrators - because the banned user's posts were so inflamatory and offensive.

<li>Justan has been criticized for abusive use of edit summaries in the past. This most recent one: <i>How about we put the section break where it belongs according to the history of the AfD. Nice try. Subtle.</i> - is <i><b>highly</b></i> inappropriate. I was simply creating an <i><b>Arbitrary</b></i> section break. In fact, I am quite fine with the way you had changed it. You could have simply said in your edit summary: "Changing section break as per history of AFD." But you didn't. You chose to make it about me somehow. In the future don't be so quick to assume... Thanks. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smee</a> 18:17, 12 March 2007 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>That is because you cherry-picked where to put your new section break to maximize any positive impact it might have. You can protest all you like, that is my opinion and I stand by it. It was a nice try. And it was somewhat subtle - someone would have to look at the edit history to figure out that your new "section" should not have included the last four "Keep" votes. You were seeding the section kinda like the <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging.html" title="Begging">panhandler</a> puts a buck in his cup so people will get the idea. But hey, worth the try, right? Anyway, if you objected to my Edit Summary then you should take it here, not misuse the Edit Summary for a comma. That is all. Just wish you wouldn't try things like that - I would love to just leave this AfD alone and let it run its course. Thanks. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 18:28, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Again, your assumptions were incorrect. Rather than making accusations in the edit summary, <i>you</i> should have taken <i>your</i> complaints here, and only stated in the edit summary: "Changing section break as per history of AFD." But you didn't. What you call your "opinion" is a <i><b>very</b></i> highly inappropriate usage of the edit summary, and it must stop. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smee</a> 18:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>I doubt it was "<i><b>very</b></i> highly inappropriate" but perhaps I should have put it in a more NPOV way as in '<i><b>Moving section summary inappropriately placed so as to include the last four "Keep" votes. That could be interpreted as an attempt to influence future voters'</b></i>. Yes, you are right. I should have said that instead. Sorry.

</dl>
<p>I understand your position now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not Notable: Barbara Schwarz has been noted in the press but is not notable. Barbara Schwarz has been noted in the press to a very limited extent but is not sufficiently notable for inclusion. (edited - ja) Her private search for records for her private reasons gained her mention in a couple of news outlets. That is all. Below is my comment when I solicited comments at Talk:Barbara Schwarz#AfD (4th Nomination): I am sorry but the more I look at this article, the less it seems to belong here. Her sole "claim" to notability is that she had an article or two written about her as filler for a local paper. Sorry, but lots of people are mentioned in the papers. They are not notable. For instance, I can Google "most parking tickets" most+"parking tickets"[1] and learn a lot about "McMillan Electric Co." reasons for racking up 1,497 ticket worth $74,375 in San Francisco, as covered in some depth by the San Francisco Chronicle (correct &amp; add - ja). Certainly that does not make the firm notable enough for an article here. I could then Google them a bit more and maybe find out that they had some OSHA violations or filed a lawsuit or two. Still does not make them notable. But if a few editors here had a non-notable feud and dislike against "McMillan Electric Co." then they might be able to make an article that almost (but not quite) seems like it belongs here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I omitted the USENET part because that is not her primary claim to notability, in my mind it'd be tertiary. What I am curious about is how you arrived at this position from here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I agree that she meets the barest minimum of notability requirements. Of course, the only real reason she is here is because some editors here have an agenda to discredit Scientology so the fact that this poor woman was once associated with Scientology and that Scientology plays a prominent part in her delusions and her internet abuse guarantees her a nice long article here going into considerable depth to the non-notable parts of her story. I, as a Scientologist, could care less about her having an article (and I wonder what part the "deprogramming" played in here current condition, but that is beside the point). As a human being, the nature of the article is somewhat offensive to me in its purpose, and "need" to drive home her illness in every single section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess the meat of my question is, what changed? <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 03:40, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, that is easy. I changed from this:
<blockquote>
<p><i>"I agree that she meets the barest minimum of notability requirements."</i></p>
</blockquote>
to this:
<blockquote>
<p><i>"I am sorry but the more I look at this article, the less it seems to belong here. Her sole "claim" to notability is that she had an article or two written about her as filler for a local paper. Sorry, but lots of people are mentioned in the papers. They are not notable."</i></p>

<ul>
<li>But <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother,</a> it does not clear up this matter since <b>your nomination statement is wrong,</b> as can be seen when the list of citations in the article are examined. She had had more than two articles written primarily about her, and the articles were not merely filler for a local Salt Lake paper. The Salt Lake Tribune article of May 2003 was placed on the AP news-wire and appeared elsewhere. Nor are the newspaper articles about her FOIA quest her sole claim to notability. Why do you exclude to mention the other two newpaper articles and two online newsletters meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> when assessing the amount of primary coverage she got in the <b>English speaking</b> news media?

<li>I did not see anything that would make me change my mind again. Maybe there is a deus ex machina just waiting in the wings, though. If it shows up I will consider it but for now I am comfortable with my reasoning. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 06:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It still doesn't answer the point that your second statement above, on which this AfD is your cited basis, is wrong: <i>"Her sole "claim" to notability is that <b>she had an article or two</b> written about her <b>as filler for a local paper</b>.</i> The media coverage citied in the article has been pointed out to you on many occasions. So I am furiously trying to assume good faith and presume you have made an major error, since if I didn't, I would have no other choice but to conclude you are lying. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 07:06, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I wrote the nom I believe that we had two print sources in local papers (Oregonian and Salt Lake) and one local TV station. I wrote my nom to reflect that. I think another local print source or two has been uncovered since? Like I said, not anything to make me consider her notable, simply slightly newsworthy. Horse rescued from ditch gets more coverage. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 12:05, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, the other two articles were cited all along. They were clearly cited in the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_Archive_8_4de9.html#Remove_page.23" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz/Archive 8">talk page archives</a> after much discussion in August 2006. In fact, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">User:ChrisO</a> told you her media background went back over 20 years, when you agreed she met <i>"the barest minimum of notability requirements"</i> in the edit cited above. If you had spent as much time reading the archives and researching the subject at that time as you did supporting the attempts by <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">User:BabyDweezil</a> to bully <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">User:Tilman</a> from editing the article with a nonexistent COI issue because he answered the questions you both put to him (and in doing so, pointed to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> citations you both didn't like) you would have known this. In any event, you <b>should</b> have read the article's Talk page archives before beginning the AfD process, and especially before writing your Nomination Statement. Did you read those archives? It's <b>your</b> responsibility to get it right and to make sure your AfD has legitimate premises, and <i>Articles for deletion/Barbara Schwarz (4th nomination)</i> <b>does not.</b> <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 13:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry to disappoint you Orsini, but it is not my responsibilty to muck about in talk page archives. I am permitted to evaluate the article as presented at the time of the AfD and that is what I did (and after working with the article for 10 days). If others know of other material then they can incorporate it into the article and/or mention it in the AfD discussion. I could care less, Orsini, about your concepts that I should have added as many barriers to the process as needed so as to dissuade myself from filing the AfD. I did my due diligence. I did not make a career out of Schwarz as some apparently have. And if you feel that I did not do my due diligence then you can take any remedies that you care to. But being a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a> about it with me will not be one of the more fruitful avenues. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 23:55, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother,</a> as I have stated from the beginning, this disruptive AfD is based on faulty and misleading premises. To use the process properly, your premises for arguing for deletion must be factually correct, and here, they're not. If the premises are manufactured and unsupported by evidence, it points to an abuse of process. Please see and read <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Renominations_and_recurring_candidates" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">the policy for recurring AfDs.</a> Due diligence includes properly researching the article's Talk page archives before nominating articles for deletion. When the faulty premises are removed from this AfD, it leaves only two reasons I can see for the article being nominated: 1. editors with a strong pro-scientology POV view it as an embarresment to scientology; and 2. the subject doesn't like it. Neither of these reasons are <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Abuse_of_deletion_process" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">valid grounds</a> for deletion. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 02:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is what I said after a bit more minor press coverage was unearthed and I placed it prominently beneath my nom statement:
<blockquote>
<p>Barbara Schwarz does not meet notability standards for an encyclopedia. and she did not even meet the much lower newsworthiness standards for more that a few local outlets despite one story apparently going out on the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> (AP) wire, a cooperative tool for filling up newspapers and airtime. <i>Were she truly noteworthy, the AP story would have been picked by perhaps hundreds of member and non-member news organizations. There is no evidence that her story showed up as more than local filler in a small handful of outlets.</i></p>
</blockquote>
I stand by that and I stand by my nomination. So you now have everything you need from me to pursue any recourse you think appropriate. I am not backing down one inch. Take it or leave it. That is my final statement on the subject unless you come up with the seven-part mini-series <i>Barbara Schwarz - Legend of the Legal System</i> or the <i>Time Magazine Special Commemorative Barbara Schwarz Issue</i>. Or anything more notable than "local filler in a small handful of outlets." Please let me know if you do. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 03:06, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The additional press coverage was noted all along; it wasn't suddenly unearthed, so this premise is flawed and shows a failure to carry out due diligence. The issue of her notability for inclusion in Wikipedia was answered by three previously AfD debates, and a far wider community consensus in this AfD still favors keeping the article. It is noted also the community is becoming fed up with those pushing to remove the article by abuse of consensus-building processes. Trying to make the article painful enough to Wikipedia that it is deleted is abuse, and doomed to failure. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 03:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

I think that this one is interesting and a strong case is made for "Delete". You would say that a strong case is made for "Keep". That is OK. It is not a voe; it is a discussion. Anynobody, I hope these words help you with your fixation that you need to prove me "wrong". It is not as black and white as you might like or think. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 04:20, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> I'm not trying to prove that you are wrong to anyone else but you. I'm hoping that you'll see the way you've arbitrarily ignored a concept like <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> to pursue the course you have here and realize that if all editors were allowed to do the same thing, Wikipedia would break down. I am not advocating the AfD be removed, at this point to do that would be advocating censorship. I do look at the votes, both sides of them. I sympathize with those who feel this article is insulting to her, but respectfully disagree with those who say she is notable or non-public. I also note that the resounding majority seems to be in favor of keeping the article, as they have in the past 3 AfDs. If you won't acknowledge your behavior in proposing an AfD without making new points violates <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a>, you must see that community sentiment hasn't changed. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 05:53, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i><b>I'm not trying to prove that you are wrong to anyone else but you.</b></i> That is offensive, Anynobody, after I have already heard your arguments and rejected them. So all you are doing is beating a dead horse, wasting everyone's time, and upsetting yourself needlessly. That is my point. Give it up, man. If another editor does not agree with you then you point them at the policy, explain your interpretation, maybe a bit of discussion, and then you leave them to their, in your opinion, misguided ideas. If they then continue to edit inappropriately, in your opinion, based on those misapprehensions then you follow standard <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> procedures, you do not incessantly fixate on proving them wrong to themsleves, you let the community help you. But you are not taking that path and it, in my opinion, is not good for your state of mind. I am really trying to help you out here, Anynobody. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 14:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Leaving someone to their own misguided (in my opinion) ideas is not a problem for me, unless such misguided ideas form the basis for an abuse of process. On the contrary, <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother;</a> it is several people now who have heard your arguments and rejected them as being valid explanations. Encyclopedias exist to coldly record facts, not to twist them, or make them up to support a POV.

<p>I'm sorry you are offended, <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>. I honestly can't think of a way to describe what you did by putting up the AfD without making new arguments. I invite you to read <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a> which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This does not mean that Wikipedia ignores precedent; for example, editors should not continuously nominate an article to WP:AFD until it reaches their preferred outcome. However, an issue that was decided in the past can always be discussed again, especially if there is new information to discuss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that your actions are exactly what the section <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html#.22Asking_the_other_parent.22" title="WP:CCC">"Asking the other parent"</a> is describing. To be clear, if the previous AfDs had been closer to even, I would have no issue with you bringing up the subject again. The AfDs in this case were strongly in favor of keeping, one even resulting in a Speedy Keep, which does not indicate an evenly divided community. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 03:10, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well good. That is one of my hobbies too. I saw a Buddhist monk sitting in Barnes and Nobles the other day, walked over, introduced myself, mentioned that I was a Scientologist, and we had a very nice conversation. I hope that your study includes more than the study of internet misrepresentation of Scientology because that would only be a study of what critics believe about Scientology. If that is all you want to know then you can probably stop now as your comments indicate that you already know what they believe. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 13:40, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

Not every editor who cites your behavior as inappropriate is an "anti religious extremist," "bigoted", or even anti-scientology; it is more from a viewpoint derived from your observing your own conduct and patterns of editing.
