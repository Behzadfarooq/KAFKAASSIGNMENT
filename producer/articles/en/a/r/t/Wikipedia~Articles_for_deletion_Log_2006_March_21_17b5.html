<li><b>Delete</b>. Just quotes some sources that used the term.

<li>Are all those saying "keep and cleanup" planning to do the cleanup themselves? How are we going to know that the work will be done after the article is kept. Wikipedia is maintained and improved by users, not magical faeries, and saying "Keep, I hope the magical faeries fix the article at an undisclosed point in the future" just seems silly from where I'm standing. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 21:02, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, this doesn't make me any more inclined to do it myself, but Wikipedia has some brilliant users and yes, I expect someone will. (Perhaps they're waiting to see the outcome of the VfD first.)

<li>You do have to admit "keep per this rewrite" is a much better argument to keep than "keep and hope someone else will come and fix it". -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 11:23, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't understand you. Neither of those is an argument, they're both suggestions you might make. If the problem is that the article is badly written, but you do believe that an article on this subject should be there, I do think that keeping it for editors to improve is a better idea than deleting it. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Johnson_fe0a.html" title="User:Robin Johnson">Robin Johnson</a> 12:58, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Soap dispensers are pretty separate from soap as a whole, and I'd be interested in knowing more about them - for instance, when they started appearing in public restrooms, how they work, various types, etc. This article could be expanded to include that stuff, and the soap arrticle could link to it. Excellent topic for an encyclopedia; if I can find any info I may write this up myself. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.">Bobby P.

<dd>Soap and soap dispensers have a different relationship from Pez and Pez dispensers. Soap has a whole history and life outside of soap dispensers, whereas Pez doesn't have any real history outside of Pez dispensers. Soap and soap dispensers are just not as inextricably tied together as Pez and Pez dispensers. The two subjects are less "of a piece" and don't <i>need</i> to be in the same article in the way that Pez and Pez dispensers did. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<dd>update 3 I am still concerned about the sources being verifiable but the article itself looks nice now... If it's merged in to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_Branch_27d0.html" title="Princeton Branch">Princeton Branch</a> it may well dominate that article and people soon may want to split it out again. Smile. The editors actively working on this asked me not to do the merge just yet so I didn't. I still marginally think merge is the right answer, but I won't at all be too upset if the result is keep. Not delete entirely though... if whowever closes wants to delete entirely, userify it to my space instead, and I'll take care of the merge. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 19:59, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this should definitely be kept. It is a rather well-known thing around Princeton and it does have historical significance as the last time a train was similarly held up in the North-East, and perhaps even the US. I've edited the article quite a bit. The robbery took place in the spring of 1963, not the fall of '60 as originally cited. I also tracked down a list of names from an alum friend, that seems to jibe with an article in PAW that I added to the links list. Scharferimage 10:43, 24 March 2006.</li>

<p>I tagged this for speedy, but, in view of an objection raised on the article's talk page, I figured I ought to bring it to AfD. Essentially, the text is a Sikh story taken from <a href="http://www.srigurugranthsahib.org/guru-teg-bahadur/discovery.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.srigurugranthsahib.org/guru-teg-bahadur/discovery.htm" rel="nofollow">this website</a> (I don't think that there's a copyvio issue). Were the article a summary of the story, it would perhaps be appropriate; it seems summaries exist here for sundry Bible stories (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_%28Old_Testament%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_%28Old_Testament%29" rel="nofollow">Genesis</a>. As it is, though, the article reads essentially like a fictional account (I should say that perhaps my atheist tendencies got the better of me when I added the speedy tag, inasmuch as I wrote that the text was "like a fictional story"; I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Harisingh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44760191" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Harisingh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44760191" rel="nofollow">do not mean</a> here to suggest that the story is apocryphal, only that the fashion in which it is currently presented is non-encyclopedic and akin to that one would find in a novel or the original source). Moreover, were the text of great religious import, it would, I think, appear in some form on more than one website; a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Once+while+he+was+returning+home+%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Once+while+he+was+returning+home+%22" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> for a short portion of the text, though, returns just one result, the website supra.

<li><b>Comment</b> As the writer of this article, I make the following comment: It is interesting to note that this article was tagged by Joe for <b>speedy deletion</b> as <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> thought that the article <b>"appears to be a fictional story"</b> at 2:58. He had failed to notice that the article began with: " Makhan Shah Lubana (also written as Lobana) was a devout Sikh and a rich trader from Tanda district Jhelum (now in Pakistan)…" – If this was a fictional story, would it refer to "(now in Pakistan)". Further, mid-way down the article is the line " He then recited this Shabad of <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Arjan_e86e.html" title="Guru Arjan">Guru Arjan</a> Dev:" followed by the sacred hymn by the fifth <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh_Guru_e1fb.html" title="Sikh Guru">Sikh Guru</a> – Now surely if you are not even aware of the <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">Gurus</a> of the <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikhs</a>, do you have the right to make any judgement on this article or any other article linked to <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>?<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If Joe has the "well-being" of Wikipedia at heart, surely it does not take more than a few seconds to search for "Makhan Shah" on Google to see if this is fiction or fact! – He would have found 654 hits and the first article is at: www.Sikh-History.com – Do I need to say more! – I don't think you would find fictional stories on a history website. Under the circumstances, the comment by <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyboycrashfan_c57e.html" title="User talk:Royboycrashfan">User talk:Royboycrashfan</a> that this is "original research" is laughable. 654 hits with Google and this is original research!!

<dd>Following my comments on the discussion page highlighting that this article was a <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakhi.html" title="Sakhi">Sakhi</a>, which are very popular in <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> at 3.09, Joe changed the article to AfD status at 3.13 saying that this was because "text is a Sikh story taken from <a href="http://www.srigurugranthsahib.org/guru-teg-bahadur/discovery.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.srigurugranthsahib.org/guru-teg-bahadur/discovery.htm" rel="nofollow">this website</a>". So in 4 minutes he has done a proper comparison of the two articles. I am sorry but I don't think this is how articles should be judged - Someone spending 4 minutes to evaluate an article that may have taken a few days to create from various resources. How can someone who appears to have no knowledge of the subject matter and has spent very little time be allowed to take such a step?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having read the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a>, I believe that the comments made by Joe – "only that the fashion in which it is currently presented is non-encyclopedic" does not appear to be reason for articles to be deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, he says that if the text was: "of great religious import, it would, I think, appear in some form on more than one website" – This is based on a Google search of the words: "Once while he was returning home". What he does not tell us is the Google finds the following:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"with his ship carrying valuable goods over the vast seas, his ship got caught up in a furious storm" in my article and</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"with his ships loaded with valuable cargo, there was a furious storm at sea and his vessels got caught in it" on the other site.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not quite the same sentence – let alone the whole article. So how he can say that "text is a Sikh story taken from" another site is completely unjustified.<br />
So I believe that these criticisms are totally ill-founded and without foundation. Further, this appears to a tactic to discourage minority religions to have a reasonable say on this website and this type of behaviour will stall contribution from the minority traditions. The majority sects will dictate what goes on this site - even when they are completely wrong!!--<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 05:03, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, please calm down. First of all, with quotes, Google only shows 138 results, but then again Google is not very reliable for articles on non-English related subjects.

<li><b>Comment</b> Initially if you folks had said that the style was not good and it should be improved – Well, I can understand that and we can discuss that. – But that is not what was said. Please read the initial posts. First it was a fictional story, then it has been taken from another website or may be it was original research or school project! Well what is it?<br />
<br />
You know that the world has over 6 billion people and there are just 1million articles on this site – that a tiny fraction – This site does not represent the views of the globe or even all the English speaking people – If you don't listen and allow other to tell you their story, how will you know how they feel and what they have to say!<br />
<br />
If you care to look, I have written over 400 articles for Sikhiwiki (<a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php?title=Main_Page</a>) and Wikipedia on <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>. When a <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakhi.html" title="Sakhi">Sakhi</a> is told, it is told as a story. That is how these were recorded in the "Janam Sakhi"s which have existed since <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Nanak_1360.html" title="Guru Nanak">Guru Nanak</a> in the 1500. What is suddenly wrong with this style? Was there a reason why this style was used? And because of Wikipedia, this style has to change?<br />
<br />
It would help me if constructive comments were made rather than irrelevant and incorrect comments! Many thanks to all of you who have been constructive and have taken your time to improve things rather than move backwards! I am much grateful for your help.--<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 07:15, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> it's definately notable and deserves a Wikipedia entry. However, it needs cleaning up (a lot) and it needs to be moved to Makhan Shah. We should refrain from adding titles unless necessary (in this case, Bhai means brother). Essentially any relatives of the Sikh gurus or close associates all deserve Wikipedia entries. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 18:08, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think that, consistent with the comments of Sukh and the discussions several of those who posted here have had with the article's creator on his and other talk pages, it would be fair to say that there is a consensus for keep. The article, as it is now, still needs a great deal of work, but the appropriate tag has been added, and it appears that Hari understands how best to write the article in order that it should conform to Wikipedia conventions (although I am a bit worried by his comment supra: "When a <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakhi.html" title="Sakhi">Sakhi</a> is told, it is told as a story. That is how these were recorded in the "Janam Sakhi"s which have existed since <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Nanak_1360.html" title="Guru Nanak">Guru Nanak</a> in the 1500. What is suddenly wrong with this style? Was there a reason why this style was used? And because of Wikipedia, this style has to change?"). This can't be closed as a <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">speedy keep</a>, but I do think it should now be closed as keep. In the future, I do think that a proper procedure for us to follow when presented with an article such as this was in its first version, consistent with the "On deleting pages" section of <a href="../../../d/g/f/WP%7EDGFA_21d3.html" title="WP:DGFA">WP:DGFA</a>, is to vote "delete" and then list the article on <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">WP:RA</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:42, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hari removed the AfD tag from the page. Because I fear that he may infer malign motive from my re-adding it (even as I've now supported the "keep" position), I'm not re-adding it (though it was removed out-of-process), especially because I expect that this will be closed as keep soon. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:15, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that at least there should be a mention of the website and characters in some sort of "Minor Flash Cartoons" article.

<li>Actually, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> has an article, and so do about ten animations off of it—some of which are up for Wikipedia awards!

<li><b>Keep</b> Game is not vaporware. Game can be downloaded and played on a PC as well as sample music files from the game. The downloadable portions of the game are playable and contain a scenario to play. In essence, it can be considered a demo, or a short game in itself. The playability of the game is however not complete of what the author wants, as the game will continue to grow and become bigger, and will be released upon the web accordingly. There is no crystal ball, no predicted event, game is playable and has already happened and has been online for 10 months. With each version release, new content and new gameplay will be added and changed. Viperg 20:40, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I probably should shut my mouth, but I'm too much a passionate, truthful and tactless person to do so.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. I am the other developer. 2. I would login but wiki refuses to deliver my new password.</dd>
<dd>Onto the matter at hand: I find it highly amusing how wikians and their admins love to talk about vanity while they're measuring everything upto their humangoose ego and penis sizes. I always thought it is entertaining how ERROGANT wikipedia is to discuss the likes of Jack Thompson when they're so not too different in their behavior themselves.</dd>
<dd>This game is a project, a highly ambitious one to admit (and since when reaching far is wrong? Would you like to go bash Will Wright now?) which strives to satisfy the lacking needs required of today's games for ourselves and whomever may share our gaming desires. If you think what David wrote constitute as crystal balling, then I have no problem editing it out to stick to the facts. It will take years to develop, it will contain what I have in mind for it to contain and as was detailed and more.</dd>
<dd>But I think the problem really is, as said, phallic in nature. Simply put, BlackSky doesn't have the huge hype of celebritation which wikipedia require, though unlisted and I doubt you'll acknowledge its existance, it's a MAJOR consideration for you. So, just like you removed Pet Professional for it, I expect this to go down. Of course, if Pet Professional become a successful webcomic enoguh for you to notice, you'll come running to create an article for it. Sad hypocracy, is all I can say. Then again, the wiki rules never mentioned wikians need to be holding any virtue, merely trollish behavior to jump on every new post and nitpick it for violations, like any common forum trolls who got nothing better than 24/7 crawling around looking for someone to post something they can beat up like little nerds.</dd>
<dd>Anyhow, I never liked wikipedia, it is a failure and a good lesson in socio-dynamics, its "citizens" are more like an elitist geek society than a community of researchers and historians. So do whatever, not like I expect you to keep this. Don't know what David expected by posting this, I guess he doesn't know wikipedia too well. I'm off to work.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Oh, certainly, let us adress the biased wiki as a source of knowledge, there be a laughter. Vaporware:</dd>
<dd>&lt;jargon&gt; /vay'pr-weir/ (UK "vapourware") Products announced far in advance of any release (which may or may not actually take place). The term came from Atari users and was later applied by Infoworld to Microsoft's continuous lying about Microsoft Windows.</dd>
<dd>Seeing as how there was a release taking place, quite a few at that although the content of these releases may well be argued of, prior to announcements of any nature I don't see how this applies. Quite frankly, I don't see what is the big problem.</dd>
<dd>History is written by the winners, and wikipedia is no different. The eggorant presumptionous of its admins/users to believe or psuedo-aspire to have anything writtin inside being nothing but an objective account of facts is completely bogus as well as ridiculous. Wikipedia is entirely made out of "common's concensus", simply put, the most favored/popular oppinion is that which takes place at the center of the stage with fragments of what-may-be factual information taking sidekick placements to decorate the former.</dd>
<dd>The best example I have for such and the earlier claim I made regarding popularity/celebrity/hype/phenomena being the most considered factor for placement on wikipedia is how something as silly and rather sideline as <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeroy_Jenkins_c207.html" title="Leeroy Jenkins">Leeroy_Jenkins</a> having an entire article dedicated to him. The simple first statement in the discussion area sums it all.</dd>
<dd>"This article has had a long journey to its current version. It has been the subject of mutliple deletion reviews and finally was unanimously voted for undeletion"; Indeed, wikipedia is motivated by nothing short of masses admiration. It is not, never was nor ever will be the online-dictionary-recordsholder it claims to be or claims to strive to be.</dd>
<dd>And before you jump on the "he's envy" cry-wagon, allow me to say this much: I could care less about BlackSky being listed on wiki in this context, I certainly see no good coming out of it. Personaly, I've been objecting to any sort of advertisment as I believe and forsee public reaction being nothing short of the leeching troll's "this isn't finished, this got bugs, where's my game" yawn-der and as you wikipedias reacted thus far (GG for the courtesy to say David is one full of vanity, he's nothing BUT, let me tell you, or this "article" at that, if anything it's a sincere obligation/mission statement. I would rather walk out with the project, or at least the game engine being half-done and then letting people I know of it and asking for feedback. But as said, this is not about BlackSky, this is about my grasp of wikipedia and how I see its denizen's.</dd>
<dd>This is what I'm angry about, what I "care" about. "You people" act immoraly and errogantly while forcibly applying rules of virtues and make self-proclamations regarding things you hold dear...if anything, YOU are the vaporware which has failed to deliver since then, now and ever. Hypocracy at its worst, and it is nothing short of utterly disgusting me.</dd>
<dd>One good thing did came out of this though, it grants me the notion of looking upon pushing further morality as part of the game's core design. Richard did good with ultima 4, sadly he forsoke soon the ideals of teaching good vs evil in his games since. He said once that games, especialy mmorpgs, should be made to educate people proper social behaviour, I believe that in a sense he is quite right.

</dd>
<dd>I'll continue to attack this on the merits of pedia's definition of vapourware, for the sake of argument since I'm such a righteous-aspiring person. Since I believe I've covered the "release" issue, skipping a bit forward..."The term implies deception, or at least unwarranted optimism; that is, it implies that the announcer knows that product development is in too early a stage to support responsible statements about its completion date, feature set, or even feasibility."</dd>
<dd>Deception this is not, never was, nor intended to be and I apologize if it has been grasped as anything of the sort.</dd>
<dd>Unwarranted optimsm, perhaps, unorginized amatuer indie developing always is and I'll be the first to admit and say that I've been part of many such and watched 90% falls through. Being a pessimistic in nature myself, this isn't easy for me to defend against, but...sigh, here's hoping. David, fail me and I'll crush your scronie(sp?) neck.&#160;;)</dd>
<dd>Too soon? I'll acknowledge, as the article statements succinctly (and I could expand without a problem) that we're in "too early a stage" to make responsible statements probably other than "this is what we're setting out for - and this is where we are currently".</dd>
<dd>Feature set, by most is definitely something I could make a responsible statement about, of course it isn't set in stone and is subject to change, yes yes yes, but for the most part this is what I'm looking to achive (hell, the "article" is so...generic&amp;minimized, it doesn't begin to describe what -I- will refer to as feature set), if anything I'm looking to expand and append features rather than to decrease (from the get go I'm looking at this as designing a strong highly capable engine rather than just "a game", so if anything even featuers which won't be used in the game will be available to the engine, why the fuck this is important? because "the game" will be 100% modifyable, er-go, you can use anything in the engine to change the game, IE, we're making it ships, you could make it tank wars or I dunno...does aerial monopoly sounds too far fetch? meh (lemme think about it for a few bits...well it own't be transport tycoon (aw, sweet game, thanks sawyer!) but I can definitely see key engine feature elements being redirected and geared towards such).</dd>
<dd>Completion date? Always moving, can't, didn't &amp; won't make a "responsible" statement about. Personaly, deadlines always flactuate, I forsaw mid 2006-2007 as a good deadline with the initial progress rate for finishing the engine, however, with the current delay and to factor in a beta (as in having actualy begun to create the actual game's content) I predict it to slide well within deep 2007, perhaps even 2008? We'll see...</dd>
<dd>Feasibility? As said, independent developments tend to turn vapor/canceled/dissipate/however you may wish to call it. If we (David, or if need be ever sadly (here's hoping not) his predecessor(sp?)) stick to it I'll say that its 100% most definitely feasible, the scope is large so it simply takes time - being independant and all, but feasible? The current programing technology and what limited resources such an almost non-budget development is by far, wide and large more than the required to lunch such a thing. Of course, go pitch it to a publisher (they're all looking for quick&amp;easy money cows that has AWEEEESOME 3D gfx and utilize the latest 3dfx card or something to the like) - it won't fly, which is why indie devs games are known for their type/genre which the pubs are scared to do and why this one is being made for free and is&amp;will be provided for free. Meh. ^_^</dd>
<dd>Someone should sue Interplay for misusing the "by gamers for gamers" motto.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: AKA, Hype. As said, popularity, nothing more, nothing else. Importance, weight of the matter - so to speak, ramifications of the event in question, etc. they are all negligible. Only one thing matters on wikipedia, the one thing "online geeks" can ever agree on (couldn't notice Everquest lacks an entry, I doubt its because none attempted to create one, but rather due to the, so-called, "contributors" being unable to agree on one single fact to be a fact and not a personal oppinion), the common's concensus of the masses. I found the leeroy movie funny, but nothing beyond that. To go onto the lengths that "article" assumes and try to go...sad. It was a short fad, nothing more. No more than the "juggernaut bitch" and that starwars3-trailer-parody and so on and so forth. Amusing, good for a laugh, but not something one is to give substance and weight for. Yet, there it is. Why? One reason: "everyone loves to ""hate"" leeroy", so to speak.

<li><b>Keep</b> What exactly do you mean by "notable?" Notable amoungst. . .? Since the game provides real demos (I know, I've actually played them, have you?) it is obvious that this isn't just some sort of elaborate gimmick or whatever. It is an independent, and currently freeware, game that seems far more developed than most all that I have seen in sourceforge.net or other games with non-profit development strategies. How many more releases are needed before this game becomes worthy of a wikipedia page? Or does it only become real when a commercial media organization takes a break from covering one of hundreds of US criminal cases (often no longer even relating in some way to a hollywood or sports celebrity,) and provides coverage of the project? --DS <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.179.59.136 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.179.59.136_69f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.179.59.136">contribs</a>) 01:21, 23 March 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>Wafflefest is very much a real thing and so are the ideas behind Waffle World. This is event is the creation of a group of people who share the same ideas, passions, and personalities. The idea behind the article was to produce the entire history of the event from its inception to today. People have been requesting the history of Wafflefest, so I have produced it. In my opinon, it is very notable.--MickelMouse87 05:16, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am very disappointed with all of the negativity towards Wafflefest on here. Wafflefest is far from being just something that was made in school one day. It has been in planning for month and has a good following. I'm sorry that you do not see the relevance. I felt that it was interesting thing to share with the world.

<dd>(I'm new to this process-- I hope it's appropriate for me to respond in this fashion!) Can you give a reference to your statement: 'accretion theory is the valid over-arching name?' My original objection is precisely that that term is -not- the 'valid over-arching name'. Furthermore, the nebular hypothesis and theory referred specifically to our own solar system historically because there was only one solar system known-- that does not mean planetary scientists think it is not applicable to other systems, it simply means they only recently began to test it and think about revising it. an article about the solar nebula theory can't be written with complete generality to other solar systems, because there is no consensus yet in the scientific community how to improve the model. we are still very early into this process! — <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrrhlin_ef5f.html" title="User:Myrrhlin">Myrrhlin</a> 15:16, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b>, non-negligible book by conspicuously notable author. Just being a lousy article isn't grounds for deleting the subject, and saying that an article should be deleted because parallel subjects don't have many articles is arguing that Wikipedia should not improve its coverage in areas where existing coverage is inadequate. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 16:22, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>Of course, I expect we'd quibble over where existing coverage is inadequate. Many new pages extend coverage to areas that were not previously covered, but many of those areas are not covered for a reason. When I noted that only one of Dave Barry's non-fic works has a page, I meant to suggest that a consensus already existed to the effect that the books were non-notable; one may perhaps disagree as to the propriety of my making this inference or to the validity or veracity of the inference. Notwithstanding that, I adduce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh_is_a_Big_Fat_Idiot_and_Other_Observations" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh_is_a_Big_Fat_Idiot_and_Other_Observations" rel="nofollow">the Wikipedia page</a> for Al Franken's wonderful <i>Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations</i>. The differences between that page and the current one are readily apparent. It is always my policy to vote "delete" where a page is wholly substandard, even if I believe the topic of the page to merit inclusion here. General policy would seem to suggest that my voting is inappropriate, but one also observes that, at <a href="../../../d/g/f/WP%7EDGFA_21d3.html" title="WP:DGFA">WP:DGFA</a>, it is suggested that, as one deletes an article, he/she may, believing that the article should exist in a different format, instead list the article at <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">WP:RA</a>. I am always concerned about votes to keep deficient articles, because those who say that the articles should be cleaned up rather than deleted don't often take part in the cleaning up (I don't fault anyone for this; it's very easy to take on other projects here and to forget what one intended to do). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:57, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do I know you? Anyway, that was for a little self-promotion, I meant it completely modestly, but I just thought that I would add it onto the list.

<dd>I assume that's intended for me. It's because you used your real name and my magical friend Google checked it out. Self-promotion, or, really, promotion, is not what Wikipedia is about; not is it a web directory for people to find new bands (or stuff). It's an encyclopedia. I applaud your impulse to share good stuff with people, but not here. Actually, your user page would be a fine place for this.

<p>The page is about a computer program used by a high school, so I'm guessing its not very notable (no hits for it on google). It also mentions a quake bot, no idea how notable that is.

<p>Continuing the clean-up of Soviet WWII articles, this is another <i>highly</i> suspect article which deals with a person never identified by name, but referenced once in a single non-authoritative book.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> as unverifiable. The book "Stalingrad" does mention Zikan — in exactly the one sentence mentioned in the article.

Since Zikan means "cheater" etc there is a good chance he was a war propaganda hoax. Unless sources surface either delete, or mention the probability of war propagaganda in the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This was never a legitimate speedy candidate, as mentioning somebody as having attempted to assassin the Prince of Wales is, at the very least, an "<i>assertion</i> of notability". I've found a few references. <i>The Times</i> (obviously) reported on the case, There is an article by a "Dr Speyer" (no first name is mentioned), "The Legal Aspects of the Sipido Case", in the <i>Journal of the Society of Comparative Legislation</i> 1900. There is also an entry for him in the <a href="../../../w/b/i/WBIS_Online_f839.html" title="WBIS Online">WBIS Online</a> with a reference to a Belgian biographical dictionary (I'll see if I can find that one in the library). As an alternative, we could consider deleting Sipido and adapt Wikipedia policy to report on things in exact proportion to the number of Google hits, in which case we really need to get up to speed with increasing our coverage of naked blonde women with big boobs. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 10:47, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I challenged the CSD, so here's why: Sipido took part in a real, if minor, historical event that played a part both in the history of anarchism and the history of the British Empire. An assasination attempt on the heir to the British throne during a time of imperial war is important and notable. I'd like to see a better article here (it should be tagged {{expand}} and probably {{cleanup}} too) but I don't believe this should be deleted. If Wikipedia is an encyclopedia it should cover this sort of material. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 13:30, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Back from the library. The Belgian <i>Biographie nationale</i>, vol. 42 (1981), has a fairly long article on Sipido on pp. 662-679. A <a href="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=sipido&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=sipido&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google Books search</a> also turns up a couple of useful hits. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 14:04, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> if expanded. At the very least, the article needs to decide whether it is about the event (in which case the title changes) or the person (in which case it needs to be rewritten as a biography). <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 15:31, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. We can disagree about whether there is sufficient evidence of bad faith, but to say there is no evidence at all is not, I think, a reasonable position. Nominator 1) stated an invalid ground for deletion and 2) ignored a clear assertion of notability satisfying <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:16, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It looks to me like nominator simply had a misunderstanding of the rules for vanity articles. If you prefer, replace "any evidence" with "at all strong evidence."

<li>I'm sorry, I guess we looked at different things. You looked and saw that the user had been around for 9 months, I looked at his contribution list, of which he has a total of 150 or so edits, only about 6 of which are to deletion related pages. So for all intensive purposes Sper is a newcomer IMO. (I think I may need a wikibreak when I'm arguing over the proper application of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> ah well...). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:24, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm also sorry, but I do still consider myself a newcomer. After reading the relevent links that both of you have posted, I agree with the sentiments of those who voted to keep. I assure everyone involved that I had no prior knowledge of who Alex Nackman was, and did not act with any bad faith or malice whatsoever. I do maintain my position that persons who are intimatly involved with a biographical subject should refrain from creating articles about the subject because of the possibility of bias. I also disagree with the definition of notablility that is used under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. That being said, it is an agreed upon policy that I'm now familiar with and will abide by. I was also unaware that the very act of putting an article up for a vote could be considered bad faith and I promise to use a lighter hand in the future. Upon reviewing the history of the article, I think that MusicMan5 has done a very good job in updating the article to be more in line of something approaching encyclopedic, but I still think the article reads like an advertisement for the musician. I have found reviews online that are both supportive of, and critical of the artist and the article falsely indicates that the press is only supportive of Nackman. In any case, I will not edit the article because of the accusation of bad faith on my part. -- <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESperril_8161.html" title="User:Sperril">Sperril</a> 04:58, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It certainly doesn't appear to me that his linear algebra book is all that well known. For all I know, it could be just another one of hundreds of textbooks that appear and vanish into oblivion every few years. If any of the folks who found reason to find the book notable care to explain to me why, I would be more than happy to change my mind. Otherwise, I don't really see how it benefits Wikipedia to accumulate articles on random textbook authors. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 03:23, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's a nice lecture and everything, but since you <i>wrote</i> the article, obviously you feel it's notable, but thanks for making a cheap shot about how anons shouldn't create afds, guess what, anons can't create afd pages or any pages for that matter, seems like someone else should pay more attention before pointing fingers, and it isn't me.

<li>The "Strong Island Sound" Google search is up to 11,800 items, almost all of which are clearly referring to the professional basketball team in question. The fact that a search appending "basketball" yields a smaller number of hits is not only irrelevant to justifying an AfD (after all, most people don't refer to a team with the name of the sport included), but the nunber of pages found, in and of itself, is evidence of notability. The fact that this IP Address user's entire experience on Wikipedia consists of two AfD's should also be cause for concern. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:48, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Since one game on the same list had an article(<a href="../../../l/o/t/Lottso%21.html" title="Lottso!">Lottso!</a>), I believed it acceptable to start one for another two(Squelchies and <a href="../../../p/o/p/PoppaZoppa_34f8.html" title="PoppaZoppa">PoppaZoppa</a>(which I notice is not up for deletion)). Unless you want all three of the game articles deleted, do not target any of them. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBioTube_ec6c.html" title="User:BioTube">BioTube</a> 01:20, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that game names mean little without a description, so perhaps it would be a good idea to shorten the list to just a couple of games, or just to add a short one sentence description after each game. I'm not sure. I think it would actually be a good idea to put the other non-notable games up for deletion, but that we should wait for this debate to finish first. <b><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><font color="blue">Wh</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="#0AB20D">e</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><font color="blue">re</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhere_05e5.html" title="User talk:Where"><font color="#0099FF">(talk)</font></a></sup></b> 20:49, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

My vote is <b>Keep</b>, because this term is not a neologism. I've found use of the term (in this sense) on USENET as early as 1999; earlier usage might be found with a more thorough search. Here are some early (1999/2000) uses I've found:</li>

<dd>For reference, better search terms than "daystar hacker" would be something like "evil Daystar" or "rumors of the Daystar". Those appear to be the primary early usage contexts, although we cannot discount "Daystar" by itself. Unfortunatly, the prevalence of other meanings makes it hard to distinguish. "Hacker" as as search term is pretty useless, though; there's no indication that "hacker" would be likely to be found in close proximity to "daystar". <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 02:26, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b></s> <b>Keep</b> (changed to Keep following Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.'s edit) there's so much to dislike about this article.

But, the company owns Graceland and the rights to Elvis Presley's image. That's pretty notable. I'd much rather see this properly wikified and expaanded than just deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Frankly, that one is close to gangcruft as well, as the vast majority of it is unverified and original research. It hasn't been AFD'd because 1. it's got a legitmate link, unlike the above article, and 2. I wasn't aware of its existence. Bear in mind that now that you've mentioned it, it will probably be looked at and some editor may decide to put it up for AFD as well.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 18:35, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Gang life is a real in Chicago. As for what I know about the Roman Saints, or the later the Saints, the author has taken great pain in putting together the history of a club where there wasn't a lot of references. Considering that Wikipedia allowed someone to refer to the Hells Angels as a motorcycle Gang verses a MC Club, I think the Saints entry has a lot of merit. Unless Wikipedia wants to eliminate the history of gangs altogether - which means Al Capone, John Gotti, and any organized crime must be deleted, I think gangs are a big part of American History. PS: There are people who are interested in gangs and study them, plain and simple, and are not gang members.151.198.117.251 06:53, 21 March 2006 (UTC)151.198.117.251 18:17, 17 March 2006 (UTC)<b><a href="../../../j/b/u/User%7EJbutera_a7dd.html" title="User:Jbutera">jbutera</a></b></li>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The problem with the two articles is not that they're fake - I'm well aware that these gangs likely do exist (I'm not from Chicago, so I don't know). The problem is that they are both original research, and not cited for the most part (in fact, when I nominated the <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almighty_Saints_9f2f.html" title="Almighty Saints">Almighty Saints</a> article, it had no sources, and it wasn't until the first one was AFD'd that both articles got some sort of slap-dash citations).</i> <i>The websites they lead to are written by gangmembers, not news organizations, law enforcement agencies or whatever, so they can't be taken as accurate, even if they likely are. As an extreme example, someone could write on one of those pages that "We have nuclear weapons", and there'd be no way to verify it, other than to take them at their word. That's original research, and that goes against <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, which is WP policy.</i> <i>If someone can actually give valid (news, law enforcement, etc.) references, that may sway the vote. But until then, my vote on it stands, and if <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Kings_b5a7.html" title="Latin Kings">Latin Kings</a> isn't fixed in another week, I'm going to recommend that article for AFD as well.</i></p>

<dd>It's been a few days since, and I have yet to see any real change on either article, despite others stating that it's all verifiable, even from the <i>Tribune</i>, as you say. If that is the case, then citations need to be made, not just slapping an article from the web as has been done with both articles. I have no problem with gang pages being on WP if they're notable. I <b>do</b> have a problem with the original research. If an editor is calling it a hoax, it's not because (s)he doesn't know, it's because there's nothing to back it up.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 04:35, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Look, I just discovered this AfD last night and it took me just five minutes to find the Trib feature. Why didn't you post the Trib feature? Why didn't you correct the two editors on this page who followed your lead and called this gang a hoax? Why didn't you leave a message on the article talk page asking for more references? Did you even try to find references for the article yourself? Its very easy to call something OR when you know nothing about the subject and then refuse any that are provided. Lastly, where is the proof for the bizarre, and borderline slanderous accusations that "gangmembers" are writing this article (not that it even matters)?-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 13:21, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> still problems with OR so still some further <b>cleanup</b> required despite the addition of some sources. Also I'm further concerned re notability - is this really a notable group of people?

I have a lot of sympathy for Mitsukai's position and it's only my lack of context to compare notability of minor gangs that makes me lean away from delete. On the subject of gangs, it is right to be cautious about fansite style references and if I had come across the article, I may well have AfD'd it myself as a google search for "almighty saints" doesn't throw up a promising start as Southampton football club dominate the early hits. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 10:30, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A list with greater scope than can be covered in a wikipedia article. The number of charities in the world is likely to be at least many thousands given that it is a legal status rather than anything to do with doing good. It is not possible to document the entire list and in any case this list is redundant with Category:Charities. The prospect of deletion has been raised on the talk page. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 15:20, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> A <i>complete</i> list of charities for all of the countries listed?

<li><b>Delete</b> This page is always going to be prone to POV, systemic bias, linkspam, and fraud.

<li><b>Comment</b> If the claims in the article can be verified then Mr Maxwell may well be encyclopædic.

<li><b>Keep</b> As someone who actually practices in the field of Plastic Surgery (and was one of Dr. Maxwell's former fellows) I can tell you that he is arguably THE premier breast surgeon in the world &amp; one of the world's authorities on cosmetic and breast surgery. He travels all over the world as the featured invited lecturer on symposiums on breast cancer and plastic surgery. In an era where Dr. 90210 is Plastic Surgery to TV viewers, Dr. Maxwell is kind of an "inside baseball" celebrity (ironically Dr. Rey from Dr. 90210 sent 2-3 patients a week when I was there that he was afraid to operate on to Nashville from California). If someone of his stature in the field doesn't meet standards for inclusion here, then I don't think anyone would. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroliver_c7f0.html" title="User:Droliver">Droliver</a> 02:05, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>W</b>eak delete.

<li>In other words, we need proof that he is more notable, e.g. description as "THE premier breast surgeon in the world" by an authoratitive source. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:12, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If dozens of peer reviewed papers, book chapters, visiting professorships, and the like aren't enough to convince our community her, I don't know what it would take? If you know a Plastic Surgeon, ask him who Pat Maxwell is &amp; I guarentee 100% of them will tell you exactly who he is and his level of respect in the field around the world.

<li>No offense, Jared, but a simple internet search would tell people what your company does...it doesn't take a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article to figure it out. From what I have found on the company, I find it difficult to believe that anyone "reading about it" would need any further background information that requires a Wiki article. The fact that you work for the company doesn't help, either, but rather makes it look more like an attempt at advertisement. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">grunt</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 23:12, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not opposed to a genuine article about effectivity (either here or on Wiktionary, depending on content) but I think it would be better to delete and start over than attempt to salvage this version. While some of the more flagrant bits have been deleted, it's still written more like a sales pitch than an encyclopaedia article.

<li><b>Delete</b> - This page was added by User:Anglokurisu who has simply added the same link to UKSPI to a range of pages related to the paranormal, UKSPI is obviously an organisation he/she has affiliation with.

<li><b>Keep -</b> UKSPI is concerned with research within the paranormal, and is recognised by a number of institutions include Universities in the UK. Other people who are affiliated with the paranormal have added their own articles such as Jason Karl and Phil Wyman, all of which are no long affilated with the paranormal. Also UKSPI was the only research group added to the links, the rest were from information relayed from the research conducted by organisations such as UKSPI. UKSPI is relevant to Wikipeida as it fields research into the paranormal, not only by existance of ghosts, but also the on going psychological study of paranormal experiences in the UK. This is not against the Wikipedia rules as the theories and ideas have not been added to Wikipedia. - Anglokurisu</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - UKSPI seems to have a lot of information on their website that could be vital to people studying or researching the paranormal. I do not believe this is self advertising, they are trying to help others by sharing their information and facts. They are one of the only paranormal links on this website that have such information avaliable to anyone who may need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>UKSPI is a non-profit research group from he United Kingdom, and aims to answer one of the most debated questions through self-funded research. Spiritseekers are also linked on the paranormal webpage, yet only have 15 memebers.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This page does have significance to the field of paranormal research. There are a large number of groups who have their links on several paranormal groups, and from looking at their website they seem to be the only group with any sort of scientific research into the paranormal. I have seen other groups who are just as official as them such as Torro, who have been allowed to keep their page on there. It maybe self promotion, but it appears as if their research is vital to the paranormal field.</li>

<p><b>I will delete the article, nothing is worth this hassle. I believe UKSPI to have significance to Wikipedia, but it appears that a large well known English Organisation cannot be added onto Wikipedia. I believe this to be a mass injudice, but I will no longer risk the professionalism of UKSPI but arguing with the members of Wikipedia. I am deleting the article now. So don't bother with the voting, enough people view our website on a much more dignified website such as Google, who have always been supportive of us.</b></p>
