<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, I wouldn't have a problem with taking the mineral data from mindat.org and pasting it into wikipedia - these are scientific facts and aren't subject to copyright (although you might find the data on other sites such as webmineral.com is better suited for that purpose). Photos are copyright of their original posters so you'd have to check with them before using.

<p>This is not encyclopaedic. It is the biography (likely autobiography) of a minor functionary in student politics, and says nothing of note. His primary distinctions are i) chairman of Conservative Future, an organisation with approximately 300 active members and ii) researcher for an MP. There are 659 UK MPs and literally thousands of researchers. I can safely state none of the latter category have articles besides this person, and most of the former category do not have articles.</p>
<p>I am sure that Mr. Bristow's achievements are considerable, given his youthful age of 25. But I do not think he is ready for an entry in Wikipedia quite yet. Perhaps when he becomes a front-bencher himself it might be more appropriate. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Platts_cbce.html" title="User:Matthew Platts">Matthew Platts</a> 15:09, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It is but one part of a deletion argument. If you are making an allegation that I just made it up your "assumption" is obviously incorrect. Since another editor has used idolcruft and other editors before this have used it, I am dismissing your claims as nothing more than a personal attack on your part (I dont ever see you criticisng anyone esle for using cruft).

<li>I've rewritten and expanded this, although it's still a crappy stub. <b>Strongest possible keep</b>--this is a very notable concept in political science, and a lot of research has been done on it.

<li>Well, for one thing, it's a fairly distinct topic; I wouldn't be sure quite where to merge it. Also, I can really do a much better job than this once I have some more time to hack this out.

<li>Your transparency is appreciated. The sentence in <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html#Nomination" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD#Nomination</a> is true in several senses, as I see it. Several of these incomplete nominations <i>have been</i> ignored, for weeks in some cases, so it's true as a purely descriptive warning that incomplete nominations <i>may be</i> ignored. It's also true in that there's leeway to choose to roll back incomplete nominations, to prevent vandals from overloading the system. I'd argue that anonymity isn't the deciding factor. But lack of an edit history comment when applying the VFD notice, and lack of any attempt whatever to create a discussion page, certainly weigh heavily against completing a nomination. On the other hand the other contributions of 128.235.249.80 (<a href="../../../1/2/8/User_talk%7E128.235.249.80.html" title="User talk:128.235.249.80">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.235.249.80_1876.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.235.249.80">contribs</a>) from the same period appear to be in good faith, and relate to a campaign to do <i>something</i> with a whole series of Pope articles.

<p>Prosoft Learning is noteworthy because it manages two industry standard certification programs: CIW and CTP</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If Prosoft manages CIW and CTP they're notable. The article is blatant self-promotion -- but that would be OK, if the article were more informative. (Note that some useful info was lost when Hodg "de-commericalized" the article.) So the thing to do is keep it, maybe roll it back to a more complete version, and add an <b>explain significance</b> template.

<li><b>Keep, rewrite</b> I wouldn't consider myself highly religious or anything, but I think it's pretty sad when so many people assume that a certain angel is just something from Evangelion! Evangelion borrowed the names of numerous biblical angels for its monsters. Sachiel is a "real" angel, at least in Christian lore, and also the pseudo-Christian new-age angel mysticism that seems to be going around these days. Try a Google search for "<i>sachiel +angel -evangelion</i>" and you'll see what I mean: hundreds of hits, very few are EVA-related. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:13, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Who gave you the idea that an average high school is notable? There should be a solid proof. Why teaching music makes in notable? What is "Yu cai" in Chinese? there may be plenty of reasons that the schools were named "yu cai". For all I know from Chinese, i.e., less than zero, it may mean "comprehensive school" or something. The article is useless as it is. Its existence in this form is bad precedence to pump millions of high, middle, secondary schools over the world without sufficient reason. With all due respect to the education system. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 15:25, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being founded as an experiment by a famous educator makes it notable, or at least important to the history of education in China, although I don't suppose wikipedia has any ambition to cover that. He only founded half-dozen or so schools. "Yu Cai" (育才) means something like "cultivate talent". Thanks you for clarifying that this important school is being deleted in order to prevent the addition of other schools. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 19:19, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please don't confuse the notions of <b>deleting an article</b> and <b>disallowing an article</b>. Many people believe that bad stubs actually do more harm that no stub at all. Please think what will person learn about thye school fom the text. If it is prominent, it must have a prominent article. Otherwise a person reads the article, just like me, and shrugs: "why is so much fuss about this school?" As for amition, no reason to be so pessymistic. If you care much about the subject, please drop a notice at the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Wikipedia%7EChina-related_topics_notice_board_c29f.html" title="Wikipedia:China-related topics notice board">Wikipedia:China-related topics notice board</a>.

<li>They will learn that it was built by a prominent educator during wartime in a partially occupied country, and they will get some idea of the theories he was testing, and how influential it was. How can wikipedia grow if everything has to be created as a full-size article? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:28, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I fully sympathize with your bitterness. I myself tried to defend a couple of miserable articles about things that looked important to me. But so far even the referenced link don't impress. From the link I see that it was one of numerous Tao's schools. From wikiarticle it is even unclear whether the school exists at all now. Google does give some hits, but it is not at all clear what are they. I suppose if I searched in chinese language, I'd got more. That's why I suggested you to talk to the Chinese board. Another issue is verifiability. You cannot base a wikipedia article on a short paragraph from another internet site. As for full-size, please don't overkill. No one requires a 1000 thousand text. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 20:53, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This stub does enough to establish notability and proves that the subject deserves to be allowed organic growth. If it wasn't a school, it would be left alone. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:09, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>When a notable band releases an album, that's generally considered notable enough for an article. When a notable author writes a book, that's generally considered notable enough for an article.

<ul>
<li>Not exactly so. We don't have articles for every book, do we? A book establishes the notability of a <b>person</b>. Why don't we start from an article for the undisputably prominent educationalist Tao Xingzhi?

<li>When an author's book is published, we generally agree that the author is notable - but we list the book in the author's main article unless there's something exceptional about the book. The same applies to schools - they are created by (the government of) a city or town. The city or town deserves an article. I hold that we should list the school in the city's main article unless there's something exceptional about the school. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:00, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)

<li>If someone writes an article about a book by a notable author, we don't delete it, even if it's a stub and the author doesn't have an article.

It needs some NPOV-tweaking. I think it's already fairly clear that the theory is not accepted by mainstream Western science or medicine, but this could be clearer. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:30, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sure that there is some other more "scientific" name for the thoery the underlies homeopathy.

<dd>Uh, read the article. It's pseudoscience, but it does not say anything about primordial vibrations. That's Klonimus making a worthwhile effort to try to put it into pseudoscientific context.</dd>
<dd>The question to my mind is whether "aligned water theory" is a term in real use. I don't think it is and accordingly I'm voting for deletion. By the way, I don't think the concept is automatically utter bosh, as water molecules are very high polar and I'm sure I learned in chemistry class decades ago that they do cluster in some way, perhaps like "magnetic domains" in magnetic material. Water is not normally considered to be a "liquid crystal" but it may exhibit some kind of crystalline-like behavior. It's a looooooonnnnnng way from there to any explanation for acupuncture, but it's much more convincing pseudoscience than "primordial vibrations" are.</dd>
<dd>By the way... there's a 1950s story by Jack Finney, called, IIRC, "Such Interesting Neighbors." The narrator talks about his neighbors who the reader quickly recognizes as time-travellers from the future. He makes a living out of amazing "inventions." One that still sends a chill down my spine is one that he demonstrates to the narrator. It looks like a flashlight, but it measures distance. He pushes a button on it and a beam of light, in Finney's words "a special <i>kind</i> of light" comes out, and it reads off the distance in feet and inches. When asked how it works, the neighbor replies "On flashlight batteries." What gives me the creeps is that at the time I read it, I said to myself "A special <i>kind</i> of light? What nonsense!" I ask you, if someone had tried to describe lasers and coherent illumination light to you in the 1950s, wouldn't you have thought it was nonsense or pseudoscience? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:42, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>, there is absolutly no reason to. First of all, The link is not broken. Second of all, it is unlikely that this is self promotion.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Hello, I am the creator of this comic. So what? It isnt as popular as Bob and George but it dosn't deserve to have its article deleted because of that. Just think about. I plan on building my website to the popularity of Bob and George one day. Just because it isnt very well known now dosn't mean it won't be someday.

<li>Well since it looks like it will wind up being deleted let me say this: This article WILL be back someday. Just you wait.

<li>Actually, we hope it <i>does</i> some back someday, once notability has been established. As for why we don't take articles based on potential future notability, just think: every kid in preschool right now could grow up and be the one to find a cure for cancer... but obviously we can't have articles on them all just because they might do something someday.

This may be a small film companies movie, but by wikipedia's standards is not vanity. It should also be noted that "A page should not be cast away as 'vanity' simply because the subject is not famous.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not a member so i dont know if my vote even counts, but i'll throw my two cents in here: its a small movie and small movie company. The whole point of wikipedia is you can find articles you normally can't find in other sources. Just like the articles on various California highways and their history: are they notable? If you live in the area, yes. Article worthy? Will some people find it interesting? Apparently yes. It's being snobish to say "It doesn't count because it's small, even though it meets the Wikipedia basic standards, it doesn't meet our standards." The Wikipedia-Masters out there might wanna just relax a little. Also, there's some sockpuppet stuff going on here though, which is stupid.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Oh? A Geocities URL is a superb bit of reverse snobbery and one of the few endearing features of the company.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Regardless of how noteworthy it currently is, I see no truly compelling reason why this article should be deleted. Cries of vanity seem like an excuse to silence these "Schwor" zealots. The film appears to be, and in all likelihood, a small student-based film by a new motion picture company supported by unusually devoted fans and their respective sockpuppets. We should notice that many great film makers have had similiar beginnings. For example: Trey Parkers film <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibal%21_The_Musical_53ab.html" title="Cannibal! The Musical">Cannibal! The Musical</a>, which has origins very similiar to this film. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz9000_f8e0.html" title="User:Fritz9000">Fritz9000</a> 07:27, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a> describes vanity as an article which describes a person, but says "Articles about start-up businesses or musicians are not vanity pages and are considered acceptable, but it's preferable that the initial author not be someone affiliated with the project." This may be a small film companies movie, but by wikipedia's standards is not vanity. It should also be noted that "A page should not be cast away as 'vanity' simply because the subject is not famous. There is presently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required for a page to be included in Wikipedia, and therefore, lack of fame should be completely ignored in deletion debates." Therefore, does not deserve deletion.-<a href="../../../z/e/c/User%7EZechenia_0035.html" title="User:Zechenia">Zechenia</a> 11:51, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>This article is not encyclopedic. It is too long and does not contain a logical build up of neutral factual information. I suggest deletion or a total rewrite of this article</p>
<p>This article is not encyclopedic at all. It does not contain neutral unbiased information presented in a logical and concise build up. (history of the political party, founders, members, party programme, participation in elections,...) The article is clearly being dominated by one or a few contributors, containing dubious research and discussions of non-events. Furthermore, the article in its present form is too long to be of an encyclopedic nature. I suggest deletion or a total rewrite of this article. --Ratatouille 07:49, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There's enough factual info in there to at least reduce it to a viable stub. I prefer you'd take it to the discussion page rather than VFD.

<p>I feel this article should be completely overhauled and rewritten from scratch. That is why I put it up for deletion as in its present form I think it is too long and certainly not encyclopedic like.

G'day fellas, this <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanblair23_6de0.html" title="User:Ianblair23">Ianblair23</a> here, what have I done!! All I was trying to do was get ready for the Commonwealth Games. I was so impressed with the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Summer_Olympics_330c.html" title="2004 Summer Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a> layout, I was simply trying to lay the ground work for ready for next year. With a huge event such as this coming up surely there is no harm with templates sitting there ready for the results to go straight in? 13:17, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Is it possible to move these placeholders and templates (they are nice by the way!) to a subpage of your userpage? Then you can restore them in 2006 without having to manually recreate them. Not quite sure if that is in accordance with policy, but apart from things like profanity and personal attacks, most people are fairly tolerant of what you put on such pages. I appreciate your efforts Ianblair23, and I hope these nominations were not too discouraging. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 15:06, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Nearly the entire text of the "article" is simply the text off the back cover, and the about-the-author blurb, verbatim, which means that if it <i>isn't</i> a copyvio, it's less an article about the book, and more about the book's jacket. <b>Delete</b> the current article and it's not necessary to create a new one until someone can demonstrate that this book is in some way different from the thousands that have and will come out chanting the same "OMG Internet pornography SO BAD even more dangerous than other kind OMG OMG" refrain. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 11:44, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This has been speedy deleted once, but someone has recreated it. I say <b>delete</b> because Norwegian first names do not make good encyclopedic topics.

<li>Feel free to delete it. I recreated it because i believed i just had made a mistake on the first one. Sorry for the inconvenience. --Forconin 12:03, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move to Wiktionary</b>. They're happy to take entries for given names. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 12:14, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Forconin if you want to make an article on a given name, its original language and meaning, and its etymology, please go directly to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Eivind" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Eivind">Wiktionary:Eivind</a> and do so, right now if you like. You'll save us the hassle of transwikification by submitting your content directly to Wiktionary. (A list of people with that given name is just padding, by the way. You don't need that padding to justify a dictionary article on a name.) You can even then list it on <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary_Appendix:First_names_male_e" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary_Appendix:First_names_male_e">Wiktionary:Wiktionary Appendix:First names male e</a>. Here on Wikipedia, articles on names are either navigational aids (<a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna.html" title="Madonna">Madonna</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cher.html" title="Cher">Cher</a>) or articles about people/things commonly known by only one name (<a href="../../../h/o/u/Houdini.html" title="Houdini">Houdini</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dannii.html" title="Dannii">Dannii</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney.html" title="Britney">Britney</a>). We tend to discuss the people/places/concepts/things <i>that the names represent</i> here in the encyclopaedia, and the <i>words themselves</i> in the dictionary. (Compare <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cher" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:cher">Wiktionary:cher</a> with the above, for example.) Hopefully presupposing that you <i>will</i> make a contribution to Wiktionary directly, I'm voting <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:29, 2005 Apr 13 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. I don't know if winning the top prize on this show is easier in other countries, but from watching the Norwegian version, winning the top prize is a very rare event (it has only happened once in Norway), and with so many watching, that's enough to make the winner a small celebrity. And if Carpenter is the first top prize winner, then that counts in the article's favor as well.

<li>haha probably because someone is trying to delete the whole article. wikipedia is by no means complete, and the length of articles is not an indication on the importance of subjects.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Carpenter is notable in the respect that he was the first notable big money winner in the so-called late 90s quiz show revival, so an article about him should exist, but this article really really needs a whole lot of work for it to be keepworthy. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvSYC_688e.html" title="User:KelvSYC">kelvSYC</a> 03:24, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_To_Be_A_Millionaire__277c.html" title="Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?">WWTBAM</a> - Sure, he was the first, but he certainly wasn't the only one. Not really notable outside the game show itself. <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a> may deserve a bit of mention in his own respect for setting a record on <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a>, a long-running game show deeply embedded in US culture (though I might debate whether he deserves an article, too), but John Carpenter really falls more under the "First of many" category for a game show with far less cultural impact (i.e. most people nowadays will beat you over the head with large blunt objects if you ask them "Is that your final answer", but humming the Jeopardy! theme when observing someone in deep thought is far more acceptable). But, at the VERY least, if this is kept, the article needs a drastic rewrite. Most notably, to include the infamous last question. Sock it to ME? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainSpam_a756.html" title="User:CaptainSpam">CaptainSpam</a> <small>actually remembered to sign it <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainSpam_84b8.html" title="User talk:CaptainSpam">this time</a></small> 22:40, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, or maybe merge, but just being the first winner on the show does not make him worthy of an article.

<li>I find it appalling that some editors are now putting so little thought into their discussion contributions that they feel able to use templates for them. The fact that this template provides no way to <i>address the article actually being discussed</i> is exceedingly ill-considered. But perhaps the most ill-considered thing is that the editors using this template have not only given no thought to the article being discussed, they haven't thought about the simple consequences of using a template. There's a strong argument to be put forward that any such transcluded votes should be discounted from discussions entirely, for the simple reason that they are <i>unsafe</i>. The person closing the discussion has <i>no</i> idea (without a significant amount of cross-checking work) whether the current content of the template reflects the actual opinion of the person employing it, since someone else could have come along and modified the template contents. (A mildly <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> change would be to modify this template to read "<b>Abstain</b>. The user of this template has unwisely allowed xyr professed opinions in many discussions to be changed en masse with a single edit.") And no, the name of the template is insufficient rationale by itself for some judgements, especially with respect to the decision between a keep-with-merger and a keep. In that way, this is a significant new burden on those who are closing discussions, and arguably crosses the same "too much complex work to determine what the voter's opinion <i>actually is</i>" threshold that the "peculiar votes" crossed. <s><b>Delete</b> to encourage the use of this template to cease, or, failing that, <b>Modify</b> to read as an abstention vote after substituting in existing uses up to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">04-12</a>.</s> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:08, 2005 Apr 13 (UTC)

<li>Transcluding multiple votes from multiple users onto the already-large, already heavily-used VfD page represents a substantial unnecessary draw on Wikipedia's servers.</li>
<li>Multiple votes may be changed after they are cast simply by editing the template, either by a well-meaning but misguided individual or a malicious vandal. (Both of the above can be avoided by 'subst:'ing, but it is apparent that many template voters are not doing this.)</li>
<li>Template encourages copy-paste voting. Knee-jerk votes from editors who don't read the articles in question and can't even be bothered to type a comment themselves are <i>not</i> helpful to building consensus.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I too am frustrated by the inclusionist tendency to vote keep seemingly without actually reading or weighing the quality of the article in question. However, disallowing templates will not magically make people change the way they approach voting on schools, nor will it prevent people from merely cutting and pasting in the same vote, nor will it prevent people from merely typing "Keep. School." over and over again. I don't think template security is much of an issue - templates can be abused just like anything else can be abused here. The issue here is schools, and one that should be thrown open to the whole of wikipedia for a final stab at consensus instead of arguing the same issue over and over again. The reason people are using templates is that the same arguments are coming up over and over again, because all of these schools and school articles are almost exactly identical. It is not avoiding evaluating an article, it is a response to the very nature of the issue. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 17:53, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and refer to Rfc--I agree with Gamaliel. The fact that something like this even exists is a sign that something has gone wrong over schools that cannot be fixed by vfd. This template won't stop people from cutting and pasting or other tactics, as Gamaliel says. What's really needed is a genuine <i>consensus</i> on school articles, which clearly doesn't exist. It might be impossible, in which case I suppose we get the status quo, but there should be a sustained push from the people who actually care about this on both sides of the issue (read: not me) to come to some sort of agreement and avoid this divisive argumentation. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 18:50, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>EXTREME KEEP</b>. None of the votes here are a surprise really. As I just posted over at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_St._Joseph%27s_Secondary_School_cc9c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/St. Joseph's Secondary School">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/St. Joseph's Secondary School</a>, the message remains the same whether it is communicated by way of template or not. The only difference is saving a few bytes of diskspace on Wikipedia's servers. If bandwidth is more expensive than diskspace, then I have no problem creating a macro in lieu of using Dr Zen's template. But the core of the issue here is that someone has nominated yet another perfectly fine template which exists in someone else's userspace — not cool. —<b>RaD Man</b> (<i>talk</i>) 01:08, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>You might be interested to know that I also tfd'd Template:Not notable, which read "<code>*'''Delete'''.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If you believe all schools are fit subjects for an encyclopaedia then your reason for voting keep is the same on each occasion. You could type exactly the same thing in for each vote. Why deprecate using a template to do it? I do not see the same commenters attacking those who vote: "Delete, not notable" for every school. (I don't see how that is a "discussion", frankly.) There is no difference. I don't believe it's an "abuse of the deletion process". That made me giggle. Naturally, only "the other side" ever abuses anything. It strikes me that VfD causes a great deal of strife and diminshes Wikilove to a great degree. I don't suppose the factionalism, which is, after all, powered by a desire on both sides to reach the same goal (although each side has a different idea of what the goal actually <i>means</i>), is much helped by having a page that encourages its expression. Perhaps you should have approached Dr Zen if you really didn't like his having a template and spoken to him about it, and to those who use it. Have we all forgotten that this is not a warzone and the way to resolve disputes is first and foremost to talk to one another? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:15, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Regarding the nominations, this is the sequence as I understand it:
<ol>
<li>Radiant! nominated the template at <i><b>T</b>fD</i></li>
<li>Netoholic closed the discussion there on the grounds that it is explicitly stated that TfD deals only with the Template namespace. This is in the user namespace.</li>
<li>Netoholic put a note on Radiant!'s talk page explaining his actions.</li>
<li>I have Radiant!'s talk page on my watchlist (becuase of our correspondence over the proposed restructuring of Categories for deletion), and saw I saw the message.</li>
<li><i><b>I</b></i> (<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a>) then made the VfD nomination, citing Radiant's reasoning from TfD. I did not make it explicitly clear that it was my nomination to VfD, not Radiants, although I felt I had implied this sufficiently, hindsight leads me to believe I was wrong.</li>
<li>At various points the page was blanked, restored, large parts struck out, unstruck, rewritten and reverted, etc. At some point in all this, the vote was closed (I think by Radiant!)</li>
<li>Snowspinner then reopened the debate, and renominated it in his name.</li>
<li>Radiant! removed all attributions to him and doesn't want anything to do with it.</li>
<li>Dr Zen, in whose userspace the template was, emailed SlimVirgin to ask that it be deleted.</li>
<li>RaD Man quieried this, but the upshot was that it was deleted.</li>
<li>Around the same time, an identical template was made by RaD Man in his userspace.</li>
<li>Carnildo nominated that template for deletion (VfD), directing the discussion here.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>So, the people responsible for the VfD are myself (<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a>), <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> but <i><b>not</b></i> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a>, who has stated several times he wants nothing to do with it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. First of all, it's in userspace. Secondly, until Wikipedia actually comes up with an official policy on whether schools are notable or not, every VFD vote is going to involve the exact same arguments. I can understand why school inclusionists might want to save time by using a template for each VFD on that subject. We need a real policy on school inclusionism/deletionism rather than argue the same thing ad infinitum on this page. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 01:33, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't like seeing things deleted from user pages, but is it really that necessary to even use this template? Assuming people just want to vote on VfD without looking at an article and arguing on its merits, why can't they just cut and paste some text?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although in general, I believe that what's in a User's space should be left alone, in this case, this is simply a bad faith VfD vote process. The User should be required to at least read the articles in question.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see this Vfd going anywhere; obviously there will be no concensus. The persons involved will vote yes or no regarding school articles, whether you delete the template or not (hopefully it saves them some time to make other additions to wikipedia).

<li><b>Comment</b> Why on Earth do people want to make templates for voting? There is not much typing saved by doing so. Besides, if people forget to use "subst:" they will be in a vulnerble position from people vandalzing their template (and thereby all their votes using it) to read "<b>Delete</b> A high school. No high schools are notable. Wikipedia is not a vanity site for high schools". Also, it appears to be the people who dislike school articles who keep voting to delete this template, but I really don't think it matters, why prevent your opponents from exposing themselves to template vandalism? <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 09:58, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article's not convincing, but if you check out some of the actual Google-hit pages, you discover: 1) "Vive la rose" is a 200-year old French folk song. 2) The primary artist mentioned (Emile Benoit) was a "genuine" folk artist (i.e. folk music wasn't his career, but he was the inheritor of an oral tradition of French-Canadian culture in Newfoundland <a href="http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/benoit.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/benoit.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>), and the subject of a study that sounds similar to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Lomax_aa12.html" title="Alan Lomax">Alan Lomax</a>'s field recordings for the Smithsonian Institution in the U.S. So I'd say <b>Keep</b> and let's go find some French or Canadian cultural historians to help turn these into 2 real articles. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 07:07, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a subpage that was moved from the article space, after having not been worked on since late January. I think it is now extremly unlikely that it will receive further attention. This is not a speedy candidate as I am not the only person to have contributed to it, and the user page policy also says that matierial moved from a different namespace is specificaly not eligable for speedying anyway.
