<p>This article is speculative, unsourced and unencyclopaedic in my opinion.

<li>Some are completely unreferenced, others have references, like this one, that do not back up the substance of the article. I can't see any from peer-reviewed journals for example.

<li><b>Keep</b> for this one. The others should be debated separately with their own AfD's, but I foreshadow that I'd be saying strong keep for some of them. Of course there are no colonies on Mercury for us to write about, but the article makes no such claim. Colonisation of Mercury is a theme in science fiction and a topic for speculation among space enthusiasts, and that is what an article with this heading should be focused on. The article could easily discuss all that, and I'm reasonably confident that sources could be found. Admittedly, the current article suffers the problem that it is mainly original research about the practicalities, but that is a reason for bold editing or some other action, not for deletion of the article. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 01:13, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> per Metamagician3000. Most of the content is facts with fairly minor OR, much of which could be sourced and kept. Needs some discussion and sources on NASA blue-sky projects, and some discussion and references on notable science fiction in this area. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:30, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Moon and Mars, delete the others. There are presently scheduled trips to both these planets. Also, it's patently silly to start by saying, "We should not try to predict" and then saying, "the events predicted will probably not happen." <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyscale_5a16.html" title="User:Greyscale">Greyscale</a> 03:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good point! What I mean is that events that are very likely to happen, like an upcoming election or something like that, can sensibly have articles, but ones like this which may or may not happen should not. I was trying to emphasise that these are not events that are going to happen in the near future. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 11:28, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep all</b> of course; the colonization of space is a significant subject among scientists, sci fi, television documentaries, etc.; the moon and Mars especially, but I'll vote a blanket keep since they simply shouldn't have been lumped together like this. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 03:59, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> - These articles aren't crystal-ballish; they discuss objectively the challenges involved in colonization. Notable as a topic of science-fiction literature and as general goals for space expanion. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 04:45, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep all</b> because they (ideally) discuss objective, factual information about the great deal of past and current commentary and technical research on these ideas, a great deal of which has been funded by <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> and other space organizations and which has been carried out in peer-reviewed <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_literature.html" title="Scientific literature">scientific literature</a>, the record of which is entirely a matter of fact, not speculation. The first peer-reviewed scientific paper on colonizing another planet (by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Sagan_68dc.html" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> in the prestigious journal <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_%28journal%29.html" title="Science (journal)">Science</a></i>, on the potential to terraform and colonize Venus) was published almost fifty years ago, and such literature has been growing exponentially since then. Such factual information on past and ongoing research and commentary is no more speculative in nature than is any subject of scientific or engineering research. The Colonization of Mercury page is so far sparse and lacking in sources, but those should be remedied by further work, not by trashing a valuable subject.

<li><b>Follow-up Comment</b> - We should veer toward adding cites and cited info rather than deleting content where possible.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now - this is a notable concept in science fiction and for speculation in "real" science. I suspect the titles need a tweak of some sort, and I'd like to see the notable fictional references such as from Asimov's Robots short stories, which demonstrate that the conccept has existed for some time. Also it would be good to see how the changing facew of what we know about the planets has informed the way the subject is treated in fiction and fact. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 10:52, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Peak oil will happen and may even have already happened, and the universe certainly will end, but our guidelines say that future events should only have an article if they are "almost certain to take place" - see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 11:28, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Peak oil may have happened already or the Moon may be colonized first; there is a range of opinion on both subjects. And I think you are quoting the WP:NOT crystal ball section out of context. The types of events it is talking about are specific things like elections or sports matches. It goes on to say "It is appropriate to report discussion and arguments about the prospects for success of future proposals and projects or whether some development will occur, provided that discussion is properly referenced."--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 21:39, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'll second this. The core arguments being discussed on this page are not based on Mercury, but broadbased and could be applied to all. Why not delete Space Colonization entirely if we're going to follow the logic being applied by those who want to delete. After all, it's speculative and talking about possible future events.

<dd>Ok, so what's the timeline we will accept? We will eventually have people on the Moon and Mars. That's probably within the next 20-40 years. Maybe Mercury will have to wait a few hundred years, but I personally doubt it, at least not if we can actually get something moving. The future is a long time. Will we prevent discussion on extra-solar colonies using the same logic? What about permanent science stations on the floor of the Oceans? We can't limit ourselves to 5-10 years on Wikipedia, not if we want to give our readers &amp; editors the idea that what they write and work on will be read by people beyond that timeframe. We will eventually reach Mercury. It's a matter of time and will.

<dd>Wikipedia is not paper. If and when those things happen, and if Wikipedia still exists at that point (which is highly unlikely), then the articles can be created. We don't need to make articles for every possible future event just in case it eventually happens. An article takes two minutes to create; there's no need to get a jump on things decades or centuries in advance. And, yes, I would advocate deleting any of the other examples you've given. Man hasn't even set foot on the moon in three decades; there's no reason to think we're about to start growing alfalfa there or something. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 17:44, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly my point. 25 conferences and how many planets/moons/asteroids have they colonized? Not a one. No reason to think anything will be different by conference #50 or 100. I'd like to think Wikipedia will be around in the future, but there's really no basis for that. There's no reason to even assume that the Internet itself will be around at that point.

<dd>However, if you ask anyone in the NewSpace community, they will tell you that with sufficent capital investment they could do all of these things immediately. The Space Elevator being developed by Liftport has an estimated development cost of $10 Billion. That's accessible from any number of governments, corporations and even individuals or coalitions. How many conferences occured among ship captains in the 1300's talking about the potential for an ocean route to the West Indies? We'll never know. 33 years ago, we were on the moon. We will go back, unless naysayers continue to prevent it. Yes, we have a lot of work to do here, but the only thing preventing us from looking up is the people who keep saying "it won't happen". And this is quickly devolving into a debate on the subject, not these specific articles. It looks like there is more support for keeping than deleting.

<li><b>Followup comment: These are not exclusively about speculative future events. They are about the strictly factual past and present of a wide body of research and commentary.</b> The arguments for deletion keep repeating the idea that these are only about speculative future events needing entries to act as crystal balls, which simply isn't true. As I said above, we need to add new sources and new sourced information in the articles to contribute to their coverage of past and present research and commentary, which includes a lot of sophisticated and fascinating research by many of the best known and loved scientist of the past fifty years. I started that with the Colonization of Mercury yesterday with just sources I happened to have within arm's reach of my computer; there is a great deal of well-sourced existing research yet to be added, including many papers in the most prestigious peer-reviewed scientific journals, which many of us will be adding in the future as time allows. And that includes far more material than needed to justify each of the individual entries listed. To get started on coordinating such activities, I've opened a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Space_Colonization_2b11.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Space Colonization">Wikipedia:WikiProject Space Colonization</a>.

<dd>So because I disagree with you, my argument is specious? Don't be ridiculous. I didn't ignore your arguments; I disagree with your entire premise that there is a "wide body" of work dealing with the colonization of Mercury. There's not even a wide body of work detailing plans to <i>get</i> there, much less to colonize it. A book and a couple of websites does not a viable theory make, and therefore I think it should be deleted.

<dd>There is, in fact, a wide body of research (serious, peer reviewed, engineering sand pace science) on how to get to the various planets, and why you would want (or not want) to go to specific ones. These articles don't generally go into huge depth in those sources, but they are definitely out there. The tradeoffs of trajectories, propulsion types and mission designs, landing site analysis, resource analysis, human factors of various missions, etc. The Moon and Mars are the best studied, followed by the Asteroid belt, but people have researched every possible place to go in the solar system (and outside it, for that matter) as an engineering problem for colonization.</dd>
<dd>You may not see that research if you don't hang out in those communities, but there are hundreds or low thousands of technical papers (peer reviewed, etc) published and probably ten conferences a year on the serious technical engineering and scientific issues associated with space development and colonization, looking across the world. It <b>is</b> a very serious deep technical field. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 04:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't make any personal attack, I made a frank and informed evaluation of the argument. As I said, the references I was able to put into the Colonization of Mercury entry last night, which draw from popular and peer-reviewed literature by expert scientists, was the result of ten minutes of pulling out books I could reach without getting up from my computer. It's the very beginning. You have also shifted your argument now from denying the existence of a factual subject to denying that enough sources exist to support the entries. A very large body of work on these subjects does exist; discoveries of the breadth of this literature have astonished me more than once. Your lack of knowledge of these references does not render them non-existent. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop">Reaverdrop</a> 18:25, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't shifted my argument. At no point in my original statement did I say that random speculation on the subject does not exist. I know it does. I said that the topic fails to meet the crystal ball criterion that it should be a near certainty. I stand by that. If you want to discuss the speculations presented about the possibility of colonization, then this should be moved to "Theories of interplanetary colonization" or some such thing. It has nothing to do with the references; I don't care if you have 100 of them. The actual colonization of Mercury has not happened (and, I'd say, will never happen) and therefore this is in the wrong place. Don't worry about it - there are enough supporters here to keep the article from being deleted without you trying to have my opinion disregarded. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:36, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let's not lower ourselves to make comparisons with religious articles.

The speculation about colonizing other planets is, and I did suggest moving this to some more appropriate title.</dd>
<dd>Religious theories never rise above speculation; that's what makes them religious theories. If they came true, they'd be science. On the other hand, "speculative science" is a nice way of saying "science fiction".

<dl>
<dd>The point is that the fact that this has not happened, and may never happen is irrelevant; whether you consider a valid analogy to a religious topic "lowering ourselves" is up to you. The article is not about making predictions; it's more comparable, for example, to an article about a proposed bridge that was planned, engineered, discussed, and possibly even partially financed, but never built. Such would be an equally encyclopedic topic, and similarly not making crystal ball predictions. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 19:31, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think a more appropriate analogy would be the idea for a bridge that was discussed among a few architects and filed away for being completely impractical, without ever having professional plans drawn up or receiving any significant financing. A real-world analogy might be the myriad plans for developing a memorial for the World Trade Center. The hundreds of absurd ideas that didn't get past the discussion phase do not have their own articles here. They were impractical, they were not acted upon, so they would only be notable as part of a larger subject, or with a qualified title. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 19:40, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strongly Keep All - and improve according to Wikipedia standards</b> I agree that there is a need for these articles. If they must be spun off from another article then that is not in itself an argument that they should not exist - that is just a question of organisation. Planets and the moon and Titan are factual matters. Space exploration is factual. Space exploration of the solar system inevitably raises issues of the habitability of the solar system. These issues exist as a function of the relationship of human biology and terrestial life, generally, to hostile but reachable environments. These issues are real, not fictional. If the subject is denied then it is censorship of information necessary to the ongoing human exploration and settlement of new environments that took us out of the Rift Valley of Africa many hundreds of thousands of years ago to the point where we are now on the verge of colonising neighbouring worlds. Anyone who suggests that this is "speculation about the future" should not bother to post on the internet, since they are speculating that someone will read what they have posted. Some assumptions about the future are well founded and reasonable while others are not. Science assumes that what holds true today will hold true tomorrow. It is speculation about the future, not scientifically verifiable, since we cannot time-travel into the future to verify our assumptions, but scientists do it all the time. In this case we are using facts about planetary objects, physics, biology etc., and the speculation is that human nature, curiosity and necessity will urge us as a species to do what we have done in the past, that is, to explore and colonise our environment. All life does it - why should it be unreasonable speculation about the future to suggest that humans will continue to do so? Rather, to suggest that we might not is <i>highly</i> speculative and unsupported by any evidence that I am aware of! - <b>Elizabeth Jane</b> <i>(registered with Wikipedia) 6:04 AM 9/05/2006 Adelaide (C.S.T.)</i></p>

<dd>Right. Because the scientists who design the spacecraft that will bring colonists to Titan are going to consult Wikipedia for the latest info on the subject, and reorganizing these Wikipedia articles would doom any hope of future space exploration.

<dd>No-one's trashing Wikipedia - it's an encyclopaedia, not a space travel manual. Given that <i>No solid plans or studies have been made regarding manned missions to Titan</i>, I fail to see how we can have an article about it.

<dd>That's not true. The information here could be merged if desired, but this page should still be deleted. There's no need to turn it into a redirect, because <i>there's no such thing</i> as the colonization of Mercury, so nobody is going to search for it. Reaverdrop has decided to turn this into a soapbox (and nearly dragged me in, which is why I struck my comments below), but Worldtraveller's use of AfD is entirely appropriate. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 15:35, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, and as a deletionist I wasn't expecting to vote that way till I read the article in question. There is nothing wrong here. The Mercury article is verifiable, is not original research, has citations for many of its claims, and covers an interesting topic. I see no unwarranted speculation. If the other articles are not of a similar standard, then they should not be in a grouped AfD, so I will assume that they are all good enough to keep. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 21:51, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
