<li>The nominator removed stuff about the notorious Two Towers petition which got considerable press attention. I'll put it back. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 01:04, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(edit conflict (I saw the petition stuff)) Might as well cover the other supposed claims to notability: he got banned from somewhere, he founded a joke petition, and he committed suicide, all of which I could probably do myself within 3-12 hours, depending on how quickly I can procure a bottle of vodka and some sleeping pills. The petition is supposedly notable for its external coverage, but I read the Times article via <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a>. It's 8 lines long and doesn't mention Klerck at all. There is also an <a href="../../../m/s/n/MSNBC_69dc.html" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> article which is only mentioned in a blog article, with no actual proper citation to be found to give us any hint of how we can find the actual article (and if verification isn't repeatable, it's not verification at all), and it sounds bloggish anyway from the article actually linked. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 01:05, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> a minute with Proquest found several news stories from all over the world about the petition incident (they don't mention Klerck by name); I added a few more cites to the article. I don't think this is the most important article in the world but I'm a bit bothered by the notion that Wikipedia articles can get removed if MSNBC takes down a story that the Wikipedia article cites. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> expresses a preference for citing online media instead of print media and maybe that's not such a great idea. I like to think Wikipedia will be around long after organizations like MSNBC are gone. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 07:51, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>-especially after reading the previous AfD. I see this article being a real POV fork, in either direction. For those who love them, they can slather unsourced Weasel Words and craft it as a Wiki-Memorial. For others, it can be a lightening rod for troll vandalism. But on the whole, I don't see how all the sums merits an article. 1.) He was a notable troll. Trolls are not inherently notable and in fact tend to have a short shelf life. Is anyone going to be looking up a particular internet troll 10 years from now? But he was "famous" in his own time and to that extent I would think he warrants his mention on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a> page. 2.) The Petition. I could possibly see an argument for <i>this</i> having an article but in truth, it's best served with the mention it already has for on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings%7E_The_Two_Towers_%28film%29_fd9b.html" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)">Two Towers</a> page. 3.) He posted a suicide note on the web. Sadly, this all too common and the nature of his suicide doesn't have the unique element that <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_Vedas_75dd.html" title="Brandon Vedas">Brandon Vedas</a> had in regards to internet culpability. Adding it all together, I just don't see a reason to keep it. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 02:47, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I actually like the article for sort-of-literary reasons that are hard to explain. It somehow got on my watchlist a fairly long time ago and it does get vandalized regularly, so I end up looking at it again every so often when fixing it. Its view into Klerck's personality adds some character to the encyclopedia, or something like that. I'm reminded also of <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">User:Grace Note</a>'s and <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">User:Vizjim</a>'s comments in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sam_Sloan_1068.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sam Sloan">Sam Sloan's AfD</a> about AfD's on semi-notable, unusual personalities and I'm somewhat persuaded by their arguments when self-promotion isn't involved (and I'm a long way from being an inclusionist). Sam Blanning's remark that it doesn't matter who nominated the article is of course true, but the speedy nominator was blocked as a GNAA troll a few hours after making the nom. It will be ironic if a troll takes out the article after the regular editors have left it in peace for so long. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 10:50, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: The circumstances in which this has been nominated concern me. I think the nom could be an attempt at disruption. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim1988_0c53.html" title="User:Tim1988">Tim1988</a> <strong><sup><a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETim1988_1a2d.html" title="User talk:Tim1988">talk</a></sup></strong> 10:56, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Trollish nomination or not, this subject really doesn't merit an article, and as usable content has been merged to appropriate locations, this is rendered unnecessary. It is sort of an interesting content, but it doesn't belong on this site. GassyGuy 11:08, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Speedy</b> someone whose biggest claim to fame was posting an online petition to get a movie title changed??? Even if successful (and it wasn't), it wouldn't be notable. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:55, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually there is some circumstantial evidence that the petition was partly successful. As reported in the LA Times, the LOTR filmmakers did a big benefit premiere of <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> in NYC for a 9/11 charity, but then, subsequent to Klerck's petition making the internet rounds, they got cold feet at doing a similar premiere for the second film. However, it's not directly established (at least right now) that the second premiere was cancelled <i>because</i> of the petition. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 09:27, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The petition got press coverage from around the world, and someone thought it was notable enough to document it in the "Two Towers" film article in its own section (I don't think I would have gone that far). It's attributed there to Klerck (originally without a wikilink) but that immediately raises the question "what kind of person would have done this?". And where else is anyone going to find the info? My original "keep" sentiments were lukewarm but I feel somewhat firmer about it now. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 22:36, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note that addition to the Two Towers article was just done today, and seems to be a response to this AfD. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 02:09, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - I completely agree with Agne. I was honestly strongly considering a Weak Keep, I guess partly in sympathy... but the points in keeping an article to Wiki standards outweigh that notion. The Two Towers Petition thing could be notable as an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a>, and yeah, could technically have its own article, actually. I see it's been merged into the film's article though, which I think is enough. His death, while tragic, is something that happens regularly in this world. Still, I think brief information about him in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">internet troll</a> article should stay intact as well though, as a sort of "famous example." Maybe a little more info could be added to the Two Towers article of his antic (maybe his death could fit in to the Trivia section, possibly, heh). -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 08:54, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as hard as it is for me to say - don't care much about the circumstances of nomination, this clearly fails WP:BIO and WP:V. All of this stuff sounds a bit fishy to me, especially the supposed trolling stuff (as in "disruptive behaviour even the most thick-headed hooligans can come up in two seconds flat"). And if all of this stuff were true, that <i>still</i> would barely climb above the notability threshold. The petition may or may not be notable in itself but that doesn't mean petitioner is. ("I believe every dog and wolf puppy should have an article." There. You can quote me on that. Now please make an article about me. Don't feel like? Well, neither do I.) And while suicides are always tragic, this is neither first of its kind nor notable in its own right, I'm <i>terribly</i> sorry. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:46, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I notice that the brand new user "Yunica" (who I suspect is yet another sock of the original nominator) recently went and spewed bogus {{fact}} tags all over the article, to make the verifiability issues look worse than they are (the tags were bogus because they were attached to items which were in fact already documented in the references section). I added footnotes to where most of the tags were, though to be fair there are still a few things needing to be checked out. Inserting those tags appears to have been a bad faith edit to manipulate the afd. If that was the version you saw, it would be nice if you could take another look. Most of the article is in fact pretty well sourced. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:57, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Even</i> with that stuff sourced, this person's notability is still rather marginal.

<li>Well sure, the newsmedia didn't report on the person because (like <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_the_Ripper_b953.html" title="Jack the Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>) he didn't attach his name to his activity; but unlike Jack the Ripper, there wasn't a trail of bodies and consequent huge manhunt, so there wasn't that much attempt to find the person behind the events. What documentation remains is of some historical interest, but it's fading away steadily and is mostly concentrated in places like this, and is simply going to be lost if the article is deleted. I see preserving that type of hard-to-collect documentation as part of why Wikipedia is here. Wikipedia shouldn't be entirely about video game characters. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 12:25, 26 July 2006 (UTC) (Also see: <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_true_Scotsman_3eed.html" title="No true Scotsman">No true Scotsman</a>) 12:04, 27 July 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>, he's notable enough, with some of his activities cited and his death also fairly notable in the online community, though the "some... while others..." chaff really has to go.

<li><b>Comment</b>-I am a bit concerned at the path this AfD is starting to take, in particular with the isolating of users who favor <i>delete</i> for an examination of their "good faith". An AfD is never meant to be a vote and frankly, the three word "keep/delete per nom" reply is rather useless unless there is persuasive reasoning behind the view. Hence, there is not a need to "swift boat" the other side to try and cancel out their "vote". I do believe it is in the best interest of all to simply <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and state your reason for keep or deletion and leave it at that. There is no need to comment on each and every user's possible vote motivation. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 16:23, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Agne, it is part of AFD policy that new accounts are supposed to weigh less in determining consensus; I made notes of all the ones I noticed, not just the "delete" supporters, to assist the closing admin and to alert those who might find themselves "piling on". I also believe there is sockpuppeting going on given the number of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">WP:SPA</a>'s participating here, a couple of whom have already been blocked. I even see possible issues of censorship on the part of the original apparently-GNAA-connected bad-faith speedy nominator and his/her possible associates or socks trying to suppress this article and now the similar one <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_Vedas_75dd.html" title="Brandon Vedas">Brandon Vedas</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brandon_Vedas_0e04.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brandon Vedas">AfD by another brand new user</a>). (That issue emphatically does <i>not</i> apply to the legitimate supporters of deletion on good-faith editorial grounds). Per Agne's request, I will stop adding such notes, but the closing admin and others should check the contributions of every participant. And, I only made such notes for the SPA's, not regular editors who favored deletion (though I responded to some of their arguments).
<p>Yunipo, on my first contact with the article, I also suspected the death (including the published obituary linked from the article) might be a hoax and I thought of AfD'ing it myself, but I checked it out off-web and confirmed it to my satisfaction, and that's how I started watching the article.</p>
<p>Re the WP:BIO complaints: I agree that Klerck's personal notability <i>per se</i> is marginal per the guidelines, but I think the biographical info is important as background and context for his widely-reported activities (the article currently cites newspapers of 3 or 4 different countries). As a web user who has to deal with trolls, I'm interested in their biographies, just as people concerned with terrorism might study the biography of <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Atta_1743.html" title="Mohammed Atta">Mohammed Atta</a>, to know what they're dealing with. Just about anyone (as Sam Blanning remarks) could do what Klerck did; and any airline pilot could do what Atta did--so <i>why didn't they?</i> One has to look for answers to "why do these guys do what they do?" and it's not enough to say "Atta attacked the WTC because he was a terrorist, end of story". So the biographies and their documentation are relevant in the search for understanding. That's why I find merging the petition stuff to the Two Towers movie and trashing the rest to be unsatisfactory. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 10:04, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP.</b> I don't care if he is notable or not but the article is helpful for people who study cybersociology.
