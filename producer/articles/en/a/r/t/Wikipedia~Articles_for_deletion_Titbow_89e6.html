<p>Made up game. <i>Titbow game</i> yields very few unique googles. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:32, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>All games are made up. It is played all over Sydney and in Melbourne too. It's an Australian thing. Would it make a difference if i fix it up a little?--Jzeltzer 15:57, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Verifibility is important to wikipedia articles. If no independent verification can be given other than "I know a bunch of people who play this" then, sorry, but it is not a suitable subject for wikipedia. If it really is played all over Sydney and Melbourne, then there shouldn't be too much trouble finding some independent, verifiable references to the game. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:23, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I live in Canberra between Sydney and Melbourne and I've never heard of it. Perhaps I lead a sheltered life or perhaps this game is not well-known or has been made up. The lack of sources currently leads me to the second conclusion. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 19:15, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can definitely say that I've heard of the game. I found two guys playing at a pub in Sydney and looked interesting. I went over to find out what was happening and they invited my to play - the three player version definitely exists as the article here states (though not using the 2 of diamonds as the dud). When I next spoke to my sister (who is studying in Melbourne), she said that she had also played with friends of hers. I can't explain why it does not come up on the internet, it must be something that passes by word of mouth. That said, I have definitely heard of it and do not think that it should be deleted. So <b>Keep</b>. W.Burroughs, 12:10, 17 October 2005</p>

<b>Keep</b>. Oh my goodness! I cant believe someone actually put up an entry for titbow! I've been playing it for several years and so can vouch for its authenticity. Please do not remove. -- Daniel Krochmalik Sydney, Australia 211.30.0.195 08:42, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> as hoax. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 13:07, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey guys n gals, i did some googling myself... admittedly i couldn't find much on Titbow, but found quite alot on Mr. Krochmalik above. Check it out. He's like some bridge champion. That's gotta count for something right?--Jzeltzer 22:42, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>To correct Jzeltzer, I am a semi-professional bridge player who is very familiar with card games. I recently competed in the 10th World Junior Bridge Championships held in Sydney. On the sidelines of this very important tournament, titbow was played as a social game to release the tension from the day's bridge. It is well known within bridge playing circles and amongst people who are experienced card players. This is no hoax. Daniel Krochmalik 211.30.0.195 01:45, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey i live in Sydney. I know alot of card games but have never heard of it. Dont really see the problem though. The game has clearly been played (by virtue of the rules themselves), it makes sense, and i cant really think of one like it. I think I'll even give it a go - looks classic. It is truly remarkable how many games can be played with a standard deck of 52 cards. It would be great if wikipedia could be a testament to this remarkability. Viva Titbow. <b>Keep it</b>. --Jonathan pang 11:46, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey, I played a drinking version of the game in Syd. Added it on for ya dudes. --Balint Seeber 11:15, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Am not sure why this is being considered a hoax - it would seem like a lot of effort has been made just to make a false addition to the Wikipedia. If there are clear rules, and people admitting to playing, then surely the game exists and should be included. Or am I missing the point? If so, could the detractors please explain why it should not be included, rather than just calling it a hoax. For the record, I have played Titbow with Uni friends in Sydney and it is an awesome game. <b>Keep</b> --Yun thai wang 11:25, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hey, I'm over at the uni of wollongong. We played it on 1st year camp, not familiar with the drinking version (though many drinks were involved..). anyway, its not a particularly good game but it exists nonetheless. good to see some aussie youth culture making its way into wiki. <b>Keep</b> -- Lance Draper, Gong</li>
