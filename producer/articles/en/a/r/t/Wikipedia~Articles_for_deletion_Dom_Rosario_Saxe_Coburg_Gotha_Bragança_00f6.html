<li>Strong <b>keep</b>. The duke of Braganza dom Rosario is a pretender of the Royal House of Portugal. His rights come from abdication of the last daughter of the king Charles of Portugal, Maria Pia, and he has also many jurisdictional international recognitions. These are the more important facts. Others are only talk. I don't understand because miss Muriel want hide this truth. I remember her that now are not in dictatorial (salazarist) period and this is a democratic encyclopedia where is important introduce to all people the historical truth and not the personal certainties. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.54.247.122.html" title="User:82.54.247.122">Manuel</a> 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The Duke of Braganza is worthy of entry in Wikipedia. But is Dom Rosario Saxe Coburg Gotha the Duke? Or even a 'real' pretender to the title? Google gives me 14 hits for him. Now it may be that I'm missing something here but I would have imagined that a bona fide claimant to the title would have a lot more than that on google. So until I find out otherwise, I go for delete. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 14:17, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you search in Google.com&#160;: " Rosario Saxe Coburg Gotha Braganza ", you can find 337 results.<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.54.247.122.html" title="User:82.54.247.122">Manuel</a> 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Following the link you post below, I obtain 337 hits. But that's well into the realms of not-notable. Also, a good number of those 337 do not seem to necessarily refer to the same person. (I would of course expect a lot of returns for Saxe Coburg Gotha as that was, I think, the family name of Prince Albert. (Husband of Queen Victoria). But there is not obviously a link between the two families). Sorry, I'm still not convinced. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 18:58, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>A further point. Just checking again and that link appears to be to google in Italian. Searching google.com (in English) I get 0 results for the same name. Whilst I don't purport to understand why this is - and freely admit I may be making a mistake - at the moment that tends to convince me that this chap is not-notable. At least, not-notable enough. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 19:10, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unfortunately Manuel de Sousa has chosen to use Wikipedia as a means of publicizing a fringe character's absurd pretensions, in a way that does not recognize the absurdity of the claims, and is thus misleading. An article with a neutral point of view would be under the man's real name "Rosario Poidimani", and would point out that [1] his "claim" is through a purported (and unlikely) bastard daughter (impossible) [2] who "abdicated in his favor" (impossible) to whom he is [3] unrelated. The claim is ludicrous, and unimportant, and most importantly, with Manuel continuing to propagandize in this and other articles (see the vote at <a href="../../../h/i/l/Talk%7EHilda_Toledano_a094.html" title="Talk:Hilda Toledano">Talk:Hilda Toledano</a>), it is apparent we cannot maintain a neutral article. This is just a fork of the Hilda Toledano article (it's the same "claim", dressed up for an unrelated man), created when it was made apparent that <i>that</i> article would not be residing at "Maria Pia of Saxony Coburgo Gotha and Bragança". If we could maintain an article like <a href="http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/fantasy/portugal-false.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/fantasy/portugal-false.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, which makes the absurdity of the claims clear, it would be worth doing. But with Manuel, who is associated with the websites of this fantasy royalty faction, showing no commitment to NPOV, and a relentless pursuit of falsely depicting these claims as reasonable and true, this seems impossible. The article as it stands could come from Poidimani's own website! - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 20:56, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nunh-huh is the typical example of user that with his groundless certainties thinks to know the truth (and the unique truth). He can seem a Stair Sainty disciple and he can spit out sentences only reading and founded on a web-site <a href="http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/fantasy/portugal-false.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/fantasy/portugal-false.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. For this web site dom Rosario has sued the owner of this web-page(Guy Stair Sainty) alleging libel against this person(also member of an association <a href="http://www.icocregister.org/patronsandmembers.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icocregister.org/patronsandmembers.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> where one of patron is also Duarte Pio of Braganza, and consequently is not a impartial scholar of dynastic matter in the our argument)and in november will start the case against Stair Sainty. So Nunh-huh please don't judge you because there is a impartial tribunal that will judge this. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.54.247.122.html" title="User:82.54.247.122">Manuel</a> 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please. Anyone so silly as to sue a website (or whose "candidacy" is so weak that he feels he <i>has</i> to sue a website) can hardly expect to be taken seriously as a candidate for heir to the "throne" of Portugal. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 07:31, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>But only a sentence of a impartial tribunal can confirm the autenticity of all the documents present in the web site <a href="http://www.theroyalhouseofportugal.org" class="external text" title="http://www.theroyalhouseofportugal.org" rel="nofollow">www.theroyalhouseofportugal.org</a> . The scholar of dynastic matter Stair Sainty( he is not a historian because a historian judge only after check the autenticity of all the documents and this is not the case of Sainty) found his certainties on the falsity and lie of these documents. Only a defenitive sentence can prove the superficiality of this scholar and can prove the close relation that this person has with Duarte Pio of Braganza. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.54.247.122.html" title="User:82.54.247.122">Manuel</a> 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Their authenticity can't be confirmed because the originals don't <i>exist</i>, as far as can be determined. Setting aside the issue of "Maria Pia's" natural birth, her supposed legitimation/elevation as an Infanta of Portugal is based upon a single typewritten document, dated 1959, purporting (on the authority of the lady herself) to be a transcription of the Royal document. The original has never been produced, nor evidence brought forth (e.g., from the Royal Archives) to corroborate it; indeed, while I'm not familiar with the various Portugese constitutions of the time, I find it difficult to believe that the King had the power to unilaterally confer succession privileges. There are reasons why this claim is not taken seriously, and the supposed ill-will of Miguelists has nothing to do with it. (Side note: I don't know precisely what litigation is in hand, but Mr. Sainty has won the initial round; here is <a href="http://www.icocregister.org/Poidimani_Sainty.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.icocregister.org/Poidimani_Sainty.htm" rel="nofollow">a transcript in Italian</a>.)<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 00:52, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This particularly impostor's claim to the throne is so patently ridiculous, and his notability so questionable, that I can't see any value to this page. BTW, in case anyone is confused, this guy is not the same person as the Dom Duarte, Duke of Braganza, the generally recognized pretender to the Portuguese throne. This is just some random Italian dude who claims that he should be King of Portugal because a crazy old lady who claimed to be, but was not, the illegitimate daughter of one of the later kings of Portugal, supposedly "abdicated" in his favor. We have an article on said old lady, <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilda_Toledano_0d6f.html" title="Hilda Toledano">Hilda Toledano</a>, who is, I suppose vaguely notable. Any information on this gentleman can be contained at her article, if it is absolutely necessary. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 03:29, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I’ve argued about this also in wiki.pt, and therefore I decided to vote it here. The article is clearly publicity, and the claims of that gentleman simply a non-sense. Just like Muriel says, <b>producing an internet page does not produce a truth</b>. Anyone of us could also claim to be an illegitimate son of an old Portuguese king, forge a genealogy and other evidences, and hence declares to be a claimant to the duchy of Braganza and the Portuguese crown… Quite easy, don’t you think? Another option (which I suggested in wiki.pt) is to <b>redirect</b> the page to claimants of the Duchy of Braganza and then <b>protect</b> it to avoid its recreation or further vandalism against it… --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Boru_e52f.html" title="User:Brian Boru">Brian Boru</a> 15:24, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dear Gryffindor, its not the same thing. Rosario only appears in his own net pages and wikipedia mirrors. He is using wikipedia as a platform of propaganda. He is non-verifiable.

<li>Muriel, only your attempt to hide and obstruct the knowledge of this pretender is a platform of antidemocratic propoganda in favour of Duarte Pio. And this is not impartial for a democratic encyclopedia as Wikipedia. We cant allow this. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.54.247.122.html" title="User:82.54.247.122">Manuel</a> 8 October 2005 (UTC

<li>Manuel, Duarte Pio <b>is</b> verifiable.

Rosario only appears in your sites and in wikipedia mirrors. I personally couldnt care less for Duarte Pio and monarchy in Portugal or wherever.

<li>Muriel, Rosario is a obscure pretender in <b>your</b> consideration. You are not a impartial judge that can pass judment about this. Rosario has many monarchic supporters and jurisdictional recognitions of many Sovereign States.This is the most important check about his pretender rights.<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.54.247.122.html" title="User:82.54.247.122">Manuel</a> 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
