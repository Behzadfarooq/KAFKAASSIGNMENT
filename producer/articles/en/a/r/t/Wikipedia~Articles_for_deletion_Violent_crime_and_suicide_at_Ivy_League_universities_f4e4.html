<p>This is, at its heart, an indiscriminate list of information. There are no connections between any of these crimes, no research has been done about crimes specifically on these campuses, and, lacking sources, even making a statement like "crimes periodically occur on Ivy-League campuses" is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. This is about as useful an article as, say, Pastries sold in Ivy-League dining halls, except that, because it's about crime, it's more sensational, which is why I imagine it's stayed around as long as it has. <b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a> that aspires to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original reseach</a>. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 17:34, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, as it stands, as original research. However, the topic of "Ivy League suicide" can probably be better substantiated by cited sources, as something that gets a peculiar brand of media attention at least from time to time. An actual article on this topic would, to me, justify retaining the list of crimes, as it would no longer seem like an arbitrary collection of facts. If better substantiation of the topic as encyclopedic is provided, I'd consider the article rescued from AfD-worthiness. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 17:45, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This does not look like original research in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> sense--every statement cites an external, verifiable reference to a news story or similar source. If that's "original research" then isn't everything else in Wikipedia too? OTOH, it nothing <i>more than</i> a list of said entries, but lists-of-things pages aren't by their nature prohibited on Wikipedia. The page seems to need some editing to fit the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">WP list-page standards</a> and/or some text to explain why this material is interesting or documented here or whatever (but it's already tagged as needing work in that direction). The only AfD issue is whether it's just an indiscriminant collection of facts, an issue only recently brought up on its Talk page and via the addition of {{importance}} and {{globalize}} tags. At worst, the proposal to merge into <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> should be an alternative to simple Delete. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 18:36, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> requires more than mere source citations, which this article provides. As I said on the article's Talk page, it appears to be an original (novel, idiosyncratic, unsupported) <i>synthesis</i> of existing facts. My concern is that nothing has been done to establish "violent crime and suicide in the Ivy League" as a <i>topic</i> as non-original research. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 18:46, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Crime and suicide are not original topics of research. Nor even crime and suicide at universities. Even so, I don't think there's a need to establish the <i>topic</i> of an article as non-original; just the <i>content</i> itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> DMacks makes a fine case (although I'd likely disagree with him as to whether the topic is sufficiently notable as to merit an article, and, concomitantly, to whether it is, by its nature, an indiscrimate collection of information or otherwise exorbitantly crufty), but it should be said that <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>, even as it commands the support of most editors, is a guideline and not policy, such that there are some (amongst which number I generally count myself) who comport their editing with the guideline but feel free, at AfD and the like, to support the <i>deletion</i> of lists that conform to <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> (for various reasons, typically that lists aren't the best way to disseminate information encyclopedically). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:07, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Also, delete as completely idiosyncratic non-topic. Besides, my alma mater, MIT, has lots of suicides! And much better suicides than Harvard has! Why shouldn't it be included? If the truth were known, MIT is <i>just as good if not better</i> than the Ivy League schools. Well, I mean just as bad if not worse then them. Well, not that violent crime and suicide are <i>necessarily</i> bad, they're just neutral facts, right? Oh, dear me, this is so confusing...

This page is no different than a list of famous alumni of a given university or members of an organization (except that every fact on the crime/suicide page actually has a cited source, whereas the alumni pages generally give no sources whatsoever, and would therefore be justifiably deleted).

<dd>I can't find anything on this page that constitutes original research. There is no synthesis of new information here. No conclusions are being drawn. It simply chronicles crimes and suicides of the Ivy League, all of which have been previously published in reputable sources. You need to be more specific about this page containing original research if you really think it's happening.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The article is also not a list of indiscriminate information. It is a list of violent crimes and suicides of the Ivy League schools. It is no more indiscriminate than a List of unrelated songs with identical titles or a List of people who became famous through being terminally ill or a list of <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_laureates_by_university_affiliation_9034.html" title="Nobel Prize laureates by university affiliation">Nobel Prize laureates by university affiliation</a>.</dd>

<dd>The reason this article has been nominated for deletion is that people don't like having facts perceived as negative published about their schools.

<dd>I really don't agree. I mean, I agree with you that <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">academic boosterism</a> is a perennial problem. (I have attempted occasionally to mention in the MIT article that MIT's library is quite notably poor in relation to MIT's reputation, and it has never lasted for more than a day). But the problem is that this article groups things that are utterly unrelated. To rephrase seriously what I stated above as a joke, what, exactly, do suicides at Harvard have to do with suicides at Columbia, and why don't suicides at MIT belong in the same article (MIT and Harvard sharing a locale, a high-pressure milieu, and a sanguinary school color?) What's the point of this article? Either it is implying that there's something about the Ivy League that encourages violent crime and suicide... in which case it is both original research and an attack... or it is a miscellaneous collection of unrelated information. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:54, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Come on. Really? The Ivies have a shared reputation, and the schools are often thought of collectively rather than individially. People often say, for example, "he has an Ivy League education" rather than "He graduated from Columbia". There's nothing unusual about considering them or people affiliated with them as a group. We in fact have an entire article about the Ivy League, where we list Harvard with Columbia, but don't mention MIT even once.</dd>

<li><b><s>Weak</s> <s>Keep,</s> Comment</b>. The existence of this article seems to suggest that the Ivy League has some sort of crime-fighting competition.

Better than a merge would be a move/expansion to List of violent crimes and suicides at colleges and universities in the United States or similar, which doesn't inherently make original research suggestions of a correlation between these schools and crime.

That being said, I also admit I am emotionally invested in this article because i've spent so much <b>freaking</b> time researching it, so I very well may not be seeing things as clearly as I should (especially given my lack of coffee this afternoon). I stand by the statements that this article is encyclopedic, that it is not original research, and that it is not "a random collection of news clippings" or "an indiscriminate collection of information".

<li><b>Merge</b> the individual school entries to their specific school article (e.g. events from Columbia University sent to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>). I have no problem with data that violence happened at a school I am looking up in the encyclopedia -- it's important reference information -- but a generalized list of crimes grouped together by a naming convention? "Violence at Big Ten Schools" would be a rediculous topic since those schools have nothing in common besides the football division they are in, so there's no objective linkage regarding criminal activity. Same goes for here, although I grant the items themselves may have historical or informational value <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 21:39, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, that will depend on the editors of those school articles, as they decide what's relevent and important information. If a well documented group of recent crimes at, say, Yale starts to grow lengthy, it could be split off from the <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> article as a sub-article...if that is, the editors of that page believe that information has encyclopedic value. The problem with the list as it exists, is that there's no meaning or purpose to it beyond making a list of crimes that are not particularly noteworthy except to the families of those involved (I don't mean that to sound cold or heartless)...but given an air of prestige because those crimes happened at the 'top schools'. As people have said, a similar list of 40 crimes from the last 3 decades at shopping malls would hardly excite this level of debate. It would just be deleted as listcruft. <b>Comment</b> All of that in mind, I *do* feel there is some encyclopedic value in knowing crime/suicide information about a school, as that is a determining factor in attendence for a student, hence the suggestion of merging to those school articles. Without the context of information about a school, this is a list of random events and should be deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 22:22, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> for three reasons:
<ul>
<li>Firstly, smells like listcruft;</li>
<li>Secondly, smells like OR;</li>
<li>Thirdly, many of the events detailed are not events which occurred at the supposedly connected institution, but merely involved alumni or current staff and students at other locations unrelated to their capacity as members of the institution. Do we have such a page for every group of universities which has produced people who went and offed themseles or their families and friends in incidents unrelated to their <i>alma mater</i>? No, and nor should we. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">SM247</a> 23:20, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is just a list, not an article. The intro says only what the conditions are to list something here. They are basically meaningless conditions, as employees killed at their off campus homes qualify. If we said to merge by school, the school editors would rightly say that everything has to go. The typical Ivy League school has a few thousand students, a few thousand staff and faculty. Among that many randomly chosen Americans over as many , statistics would say that there ought to be <i>more</i> murders and suicides than are recorded. This data could be a basis for OR saying that really, no, there isn't a problem, but until someone does that research and gets it published elsewhere, we can't use it. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 00:45, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think that the Ivy League universities promote themselves as places of learning rather than places where violent crime and suicide intrude. It is the unexpected or contrary to the promotion that makes them notable. Like airplane crashes are noteworthy, planes that take off and land safely, or merely cause loss of luggage aren't for the same reason. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:50, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Read the article again. A large number of these events didn't even happen at the universities. Dartmouth professors get murdered by a couple teenage thugs at their home. A Harvard dean's secretary gets robbed and killed at her apartment. A Harvard student gets robbed and stabbed in the Combat Zone. A Penn student is involved in a murder in Delaware.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If the major criticism is that the material is loosely-related primarily because it includes not just at the colleges themselves but also "anyone connected with the campus", then would removing those that are not on campus (for some definition of "campus") make the article more coherent (good for the article and readers) and resolve this AfD? <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 02:40, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment (for DMacks)</b> not really. I wouldn't even support having a list of crimes occurring at any one institution, let alone a collocation of universities, because the incidents are not systemic or related to the institution. The only (rather tenuous) common nexus is caused by the fact that the victims or perpetrators are all connected to a university. Using the same principle, there could also be one list of murders or suicides on metros in different French cities, from skyscrapers in cities on the US Eastern Seaboard, a list of people been thrown from the 18th floor of any building in Denmark etc. There really isn't much logical difference as there is no causal nexus between a) any of the incidents at a particular place, and thus neither is there one b) between a particular institution and deaths cited as being related thereto and thus c) nothing connecting a death only tenously connected to one uni to another uni by virtue of the association of the unis. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 04:54, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Split or move</b>? The article already is tagged to globalize and set in context, so maybe expand and refocus to Crime on college campuses is the way to go? There's often a false sense of security, a feeling of being in an idyllic bubble on campus, where local communities don't intrude ("ivory tower"). Hrm, not sure a comprehensive list is useful there. Okay, how about expand and refocus to College suicide? Is there enough material about suicide among students, its effects on the fairly tight-knit communities that are found on campus, etc. to make an article (Epidemiology and methodology of Suicide is already fairly long and not focused on effects)? There might be few enough cases that a list of them would be appropriate as part of that article. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 02:43, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I think there's a potential for a real article on College suicide, not based on anecdotes like this, but with real statistics. I know there is published research on the subject, and high-pressure schools (not just Ivy, but every top-grade school) have higher rates. As for crime, most of it (not all, but most) has little to do with the school and a lot to do with the neighborhood it's in. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:11, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'd caution, though, that we ought to be cognizant of <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>, lest we should soon end up with Meth abuse at Oxbridge, Pastries sold in Ivy League dining halls, and Violent crime and suicide at Podunk, AL. FWIW, Rbellin is, IMHO, right to say that an article apropos of general trends w/r/to college suicides, especially at highly competitive universities (where suicides, if not violent crimes, occur with a greater frequency, statistics bare out, than they do at other schools), would likely be alright, but surely there is nothing in this list that we could properly merge into a broader article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:02, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
