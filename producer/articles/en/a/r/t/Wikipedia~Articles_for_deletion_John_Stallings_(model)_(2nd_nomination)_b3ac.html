<p>No problem, I was thinking that you would revert it if you had a problem, something that is easier than undeleting an page. Something that should be pointed out though is that you are a <b>significant contributor</b> to the article in question, as well as the <b>pages that link to it</b>.

<dd>If you're not implying anything, then why bring it up <b>in big bold letters</b>? If no conclusions are to be drawn from my contributing to the various pages then mentioning it here has no relevance. Nor does my contributing to the articles in question have any bearing on my opinion (put <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathan_Fields_9080.html" title="Nathan Fields">Nathan Fields</a> up for deletion and I'll vote for it) or on the fact that the subject passes both <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
