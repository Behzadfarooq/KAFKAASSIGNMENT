<p>The article states that the word is "not found in a dictionary". Quite right. And if one excludes Wikipedia as a source, it's not to be found on Usenet or the World Wide Web, either (except in a handful of cases where people mis-spell <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frivolent" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:frivolent">frivolent</a>). Since this is not a word, there's no person/place/concept/thing to be treated in an encyclopaedia article by this title, not any reasonable place for a redirect. Going by the creation date, I'd say that at least one New Year's Eve drunkard thought it a hoot to get their made up word into the dictionary by putting it into the encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:44, 2005 Mar 29 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Leading Australian photographer Harold Cazneaux took 100 photographs of the school published in 1934; the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Library_of_Australia_5972.html" title="National Library of Australia">National Library of Australia</a> used these photos as part of an exhibition on his art;</li>

<li>Rosemary Foot, a former Deputy Leader of the NSW Liberal Party in the 1980's - Foot was the first woman to hold a leadership position in the lower house for a major party in Australia;</li>
<li>five notable award-winning authors attended the school; and</li>
<li>the Sturt craft centre has an Australian reputation as a centre for the crafts;</li>
</ul>

<p>This article (and <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Reirom" class="extiw" title="q:Reirom">its mate on Wikiquote</a>) comes across as either a vanity page or a joke, especially given that <i>it English style suggesting written from persons it about</i>.

<li>My own take, personally, is that Danforth and Degrassi are sufficiently notable, but Don Mills and Dufferin probably aren't (disclosure: <i>I</i> created the Degrassi article, because of its significance to what are arguably the most famous Canadian television series in history, but I don't normally do Toronto streets). I <i>don't</i> believe that all major streets should have articles; only ones with special historic significance. As a Torontonian, my own evaluation is that most of them really ought to be shitcanned, but keep Allen, Bay, Black Creek, Bloor, College, Danforth, Degrassi, Don Valley Parkway, Dundas, Eglinton, Front, Gardiner Expressway, Kingston, Lakeshore, Queen West, Spadina, St. Clair, University and Yonge as more notable than most. (Oh, and the provincial highway numbers, but those are a different matter entirely.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:17, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

It's a complete fairy tale made up some 150 years later, when Camp Chief Little Turtle at the Anthony Wayne Boy Scout Reservation was founded. However, unlike Little Turtle, Tacumwah doesn't seem to have inspired as much genuine scholarship, at least that I can uncover. I'm also busy with several other Wiki projects (like <a href="../../../c/o/s/Costas_Georgiou_5641.html" title="Costas Georgiou">Costas Georgiou</a>, and school assignments right now, and I haven't had the time to go digging in the library.</font></font></dd>

I don't claim to be able to evaluate the notability of <i>his</i> notoriety, now that P.T. Barnum's supposed dictum has been proved again: "No one ever went broke by underestimating the intelligence of the American public." (But some people, including me, make fools of themselves by overestimating the intelligence of the English-speaking peoples. And that only increases my contempt for this person.) I was mistaken in assuming i could tell that he was non-notable; others will decide whether he is notable enough for his article to deserve more respect than he does. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 22:54, 2005 Mar 31 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was delete. This article is a duplicate of the concordance at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Words_From_Foucault%27s_Pendulum" class="extiw" title="wikt:Appendix:Words_From_Foucault's_Pendulum">wikt:Appendix:Words From Foucault's Pendulum</a>. It appears to have been created in order to circumvent the deletion decision of the article "List of Words from Foucault's Pendulum". The only difference is the addtion of this sentence in the header of the list. "These are either topics that don't belong in a dictionary or protologisms." I do not find that sentence to be true. All of these are, in fact, topics which <i>do</i> belong in a dictionary. In addition, the concordance is already linked in the main article on Foucault's Pendulum. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:55, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know how to otherwise put it, but I feel that this article is not appropriate for Wikipedia. Not meaning to bad-mouth <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i>, but I fail to understand why we need to compile a list of subjects covered in this one book, as opposed to compiling a list of subject found in, say <i>The Bible</i>? The Elder Pliny's <i>Natural History</i>? <i>The Boy Scout Manual</i>? (I am trying very hard to put these points in neutral language, but the fact someone would consider this list appropriate for Wikipedia leaves me speechless.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Foucault's Pendulum is a work that's intended to be decoded. There are subjects here that the average reader would be frustrated by, and want to immediately look up in an encyclopedia. Wikipedia makes it much easier to read this book, and if you've paged through it, you know what I'm talking about. How else are you gonna know who Adolphe Menjou is or what Joss sticks are. The boy scout manual reader doesn't need an encyclopedia. I got the idea to make this page when I saw the index for <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitchhikers_Guide_99e2.html" title="Hitchhikers Guide">Hitchhikers Guide</a> and thought this worked along the same lines. Maybe not. Whatever. I vote <b>Delete</b> Someone should turn this into a website before all the work is lost because I know readers need this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's move this effort to its own webiste, &amp; encourage the author to create an external link to it. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 22:30, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete - this is the sort of thing the elastic deletion clause ("No potential to become encyclopedic") is for. "Wikipedia articles are not lists or repositories of loosely associated topics" would seem to apply as well. -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">‚úé</a> 22:47, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Foucault's pendulum is an important novel, so the esoteric topics covered within it are going be very interesting to many readers. I'm depressed that you don't want wikipedia to adequately cover topics like this book, or the Bible, or Pliny's natural history. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:13, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see how you read that into what xe said. The <i>book</i> is covered in <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foucault%27s_Pendulum_%28book%29_6a28.html" title="Foucault's Pendulum (book)">Foucault's Pendulum (book)</a>, not in this article, and the (encyclopaedia-worthy) subjects from the book are covered in individual encyclopaedia articles. How, therefore, does suggesting the deletion of the <i>list</i> somehow translate into non-coverage of either the book or the subjects? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:59, 2005 Mar 31 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because it means not covering the "non-encyclopedia-worthy" subjects which may neverless be important in the book, as well as not gathering these related subjects together in an accessible form. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 07:51, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No it doesn't mean that at all. Coverage of subjects "important to the book" but not outside of it can quite naturally go <i>in the article on the book</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:36, 2005 Apr 1 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Maybe I just don't understand the idea here. If you're reading along and find something you want to look up, why would you look at this list instead of just looking the term up directly in Wikipedia? (By the way, if it survives vfd, don't forget to move it to List of subjects in Foucault's Pendulum.) <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 23:17, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>"<i>These are either topics that don't belong in a dictionary or protologisms. For a list of obscure but defineable words, see the concordance</i>" <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:18, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC) {BWT "protologism" is a newly created word that hasn't gained wide acceptance, so you shouldn't use it in encyclopedia articles.) There really aren't any protologisms in this list. Its either archaic words that people havent thought to define in wiktionary, or obscure places and things that only a semiologist would know about.
<ul>
<li>That's pretty much the only textual difference between this article and List of Words from Foucault's Pendulum, and it is <i>not</i> borne out by the rest of the article at all. Hence my question, which is still unanswered, as to how the original author intended to edit the article to make it distinct from List of Words from Foucault's Pendulum. Was this intended to be simply a "main article" broken out of the "See also" section of <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foucault%27s_Pendulum_%28book%29_6a28.html" title="Foucault's Pendulum (book)">Foucault's Pendulum (book)</a> (which has just been turned into rather a mess, by the way)? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:36, 2005 Apr 1 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Spelling correctly helps find information quicker. Anselm was a person, Canterbury was the place he was from.

<dd>I want to add that the place for surname promotions should be genealogy project of wikipedia, (<a href="http://genealogy.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://genealogy.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://genealogy.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page</a>). There are hundreds of thousands of surnames in India and in Asia, and an encyclopedia is not the place to promote them, unless that represents a completely different clan/caste/tribe etc. So, I'd affirm my vote for <b>deleting</b> this and/or moving it to genealogy site. <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 21:48, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Notable surname with strong regional affiliation and social implications. Definitely not family vanity. Unlike Anglo-Saxon surnames, Indian surnames are different than Anglo-Saxon ones; often they indicate that a person originates from a particular region or subculture. There are lots of regions in India where almost everyone has the same last name! Second, as the article implies, surnames in India have meaningful social implications. Don't vote off the cuff. Say delete only if you know something about India and have valid reasons. Geneology is a purely Western phenomenon. Our judgements of "significance" and "notability" can easily carry a Western-centric bias. In conclusion, I would argue that some surnames are notable simply for being common and widespread, and this one obviously satisfies that criterion, albeit on a regional level. --<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithfarm_eede.html" title="User:Smithfarm">Smithfarm</a></li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> . Indian surnames have links to the history of a region . This article should not be deleted but can be merged under a broader topic. I TOTALLY support Smithfarms view on this vote. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELeningrad_41d7.html" title="User:Leningrad">Leningrad</a> 09:25, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> . Indian surnames are different from Anglo Saxon names and relate to regions or customs/traditions. The best way for keeping these articles would be grouping them under a broader group on Indian Surnames. I thank Smithfarm for his in-depth views on this article and in-fact to be honest, am surprised a bit on his knowledge of the Indian social system. The social system is so varied in India, that the same community when you move from one state to another, will change their food habits, customs, traditions and even marriage criteria etc. So if Brahmins by surname 'Awasthi' dont allow marriages in same family; brahmins by surname Aiyyar would actually consider cousins as the first candidates for marriage. And this is only ONE of the millions of anamolies related to just surnames or regions or other criteria of 'non-notable' significance. Unless the world is not interested in knowing that kind of variations existing in it; the article may be considered fit for deleting, but then half of the rest of pages would fall in that kind of category.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mel - on what grounds do you base your assumption that it's "clearly" a bit of "nonsense" - when the etymology described in the entry suggests otherwise? You appear to be employing the "clarity" that comes from a lack of knowledge of the term under discussion, or it's localised usage within its originating subculture. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Twain_a5be.html" title="User:Mr Twain">Mr Twain</a> 11:54, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmmm, you mean: ‚ÄúThe origin of the word is unknown‚Äù? In any case, etymologies prove nothing; it's very easy to create a word and give it an etymology, and false etymologies are common (the Romans produced hundreds of them).<br />
Incidentally, you're not signed in, so it's not ceratin that you're the person you're signing as. Also, it looks very much as though you've created three accounts in order to vote for this; it should be easy enough to establish by checking the IP addresses. Would you care to confess now, and get it off your chest? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">ŒúŒµŒª ŒïœÑŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ</font>)</a> 10:59, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>But the etymology of the word in this instance is entirely genuine - a product of a particular subculture and validated by its use within that subculture. I can frankly find no reason why anyone would wish to contribute a "fake" entry, but perhaps that's because I'm personally not predisposed to prankery. By all means - go ahead and check the IP addresses of the other users voting. You will find that they are separate people. For a second time - you appear to be jumping to a conclusion based on a value judgement rather than the evidence presented. This is disappointing given the statements in your profile about your personal policy towards the aggressive and random deletion of topics that exist outside the Wikipedia regular's immediate sphere of knowledge. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Twain_a5be.html" title="User:Mr Twain">Mr Twain</a> 12:13, 5 Apr 2005 (BST)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Your search criteria actually include "ezakly", a name from the publisher's website, not "exakly", in case someone questions your Google results based on that or thinks it's "exactly". <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:20, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I think. There was also a Parker Brothers game with the same name, which is not totally unremembered: for a game from 1974, there are enough comments on boardgamegeek.com to make it encyclopedic. I edited the article: added Parker Brothers game, and removed the advertising. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugene van der Pijll</a> 19:11, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak weak keep</b> for EvdP's revised article, mainly for the sake of disambiguation. WP is not a gamers' guide. The new game by that name has not yet established notability sufficient for WP's purposes, and its info link is advertising. I doubt that the new game (with dice controlling movement around a one-lane track like Monopoly) will ever be as good a game as Campaign Trail or some other election games. From a small publisher, it probably won't become more famous or influential than a thousand other boardgames. The 1971 game wasn't influential except by virtue of Parker Brothers distribution getting it into many stores. It isn't nearly as well-known as contemporary PB and Milton Bradley games such as Stratego or The Game Of Life, and it never spawned a play-by-mail or tournament hobby as did Diplomacy. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:17, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for the edited article. The PB game may not have been a mega-hit, but it certainly was not obscure in its day. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimmin_7c2f.html" title="User:Shimmin">Shimmin</a> 00:35, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
