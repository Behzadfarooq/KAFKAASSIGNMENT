<p>You chaps should look up the menaing of encyclopedia and related words:</p>
<p>A comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field, usually arranged alphabetically. adj&#160;: broad in scope or content; "encyclopedic knowledge"</p>
<p>Word History: The word encyclopedia, which to us usually means a large set of books, descends from a phrase that involved coming to grips with the contents of such books. The Greek phrase is enkuklios paideia, made up of enkuklios, “cyclical, periodic, ordinary,” and paideia, “education,” and meaning “general education.” Copyists of Latin manuscripts took this phrase to be a single Greek word, enkuklopaedia, with the same meaning, and this spurious Greek word became the New Latin word encyclopaedia, coming into English with the sense “general course of instruction,” first recorded in 1531. In New Latin the word was chosen as the title of a reference work covering all knowledge. The first such use in English is recorded in 1644. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Williamo1 (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamo1_d526.html" title="User talk:Williamo1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Williamo1_af15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Williamo1">contribs</a>).</small> <small>03:15, 24 March 2006</small></p>

The site has received mention in Newsweek, the Wall Street Journal, Associated Press stories, and most recently in the March 13th issue of Time Magazine. If one of the pseudo-intellectual "arbiters" of Wikipedia managed to accomplish anything in life worth mention in even one of these publications, I have to believe they'd be drafting a wikipedia entry within seconds. Yes, the article should be cleaned up - but its critics have no place impugning its merit based on the most perfunctory and prejudicial of arguments. The site's traffic and notoriety are EASILY verifiable. All you had to do was LOOK. Instead, many of you dismissed it offhand simply because it deals with tennis shoes and not pewter orc figurines. The article's inclusion only enhances the scope and utility of wikipedia. Don't confine this resource to your own narrow interests. RakimAllah 02:09, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

The mentions in major publications go to notability rather than verification in this is not a cite, but the alexa results hold up to looking up other shoe collecting sites. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE">TKE</a> 03:32, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmm, tough one... (bias disclosure, Aaron Brenneman asked me to pop in here... but I am <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/inclusionist" class="extiw" title="m:inclusionist">inclusionist</a>) I think it's verifiable this video exists, that within the conspiracy community it has wide notice, that there are a lot of other sites that link to the site promoting the movie (which has an Alexa of about <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.911inplanesite.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.911inplanesite.com/" rel="nofollow">140K</a>... not high enough for notability on its own).

The whole thing almost smackes of a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">Walled garden</a>. Not available on Amazon, and the IMDB entry is weak. Very marginal notability. Still, the article is well written, as these things go. If this had any cites from mainstream sources (small town theorist run papers in <a href="http://idaho-observer.com/" class="external text" title="http://idaho-observer.com/" rel="nofollow">Idaho</a> need not apply) you can be sure the <a href="http://www.911inplanesite.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.911inplanesite.com/" rel="nofollow">website</a> would be trumpeting them, so that's evidence of non notability right there. Is there somewhere this could be merged to? Maybe an article on fringe movies that also included 9-11: The Road to Tyranny and 9/11 Guilt: The Proof is in Your Hands&#160;???

This is the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_Wrong_Version_cb2e.html" title="Wikipedia:The Wrong Version">wrong article</a>. The real story here, I think, is about Dave vonKleist, not about this one video (the voice said it sold 50,000 copies, if true, that's probably marginally notable, but I'm thinking maybe this guy is more notable)... If my earlier suggestion about merging all the videos into one article about them all doesn't fly, perhaps someone should take this article and move it to Dave vonKleist, changing the focus from the video to the man.

<li>Yeah, whatever. Not that there is anything really to evaluate since you made the case for keeping the article with the facts in your nom. However, while <i>we</i> are properly evaluating things, perhaps we can start with the only truly unabashed voice for delete on this page, i.e. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">Bov</a> down below, who at least deserves a prize for honesty. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:31, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I will admit right off the bat that I'm voting delete because I think this film promotes blatant disinformation - pods, missiles, flashes, no planes. It is offensive to the families of the victims who died at the sites by suggesting that fake planes or missiles were used instead of the actual flights themselves. Is it notable? Sure, like a virus all over the internet. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">Bov</a> 19:11, 26 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With all due respect, that's not a good reason to delete. An encyclopedia article <i>about</i> the film need not inherit the bad characteristics of the film itself. Most would agree that <i><a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a></i> was offensive and promoted disinformation; it does not follow that the article <i>about</i> it should be deleted.

<li>What an apt comparison. Actually I never said it was a good reason to delete, only that that's why I'm voting that way. Others can do what they choose. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">Bov</a> 19:57, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, citing instances was not what I had in mind. I was thinking more along the lines of, why do we have a Germanic word for the affirmative and a Latin (I assume) word for the negative, when the two meanings seem so closely related? Why are "aye" and "yea" used in certain contexts? Why don't we use a different affirmative word for answering a negative question, like some languages do? --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 02:16, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Indeed this line of debate is interesting, and words such as "yes", "no", "milk" and a few others can be discussed in languages of the world rather than just English. But you seem to be advocating some kind of debate and research, rather than presenting information already known to be notable and already reported in reputable sources, which Wikipedia - as a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> - is more suited to. If widely reported and accepted info can be shaped into a WP article about the evolution of a hugely important word then it has a chance, but I would need to see it presented as such before changing my original vote. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">Dei</font><font color="#FF6600">z</font><font color="#990000">io</font></b></a> 02:47, 24 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know what you mean by advocating debate; I didn't mean to advocate debate. Nor do I mean to advocate any primary research. If the answers to the questions I suggested are not known to the field of linguistics, then my argument fails and the page should be deleted. I'm voting keep because I suspect that someone (though not me) knows the answers and will eventually put them in the article, with sources, given enough time. (My goal in these responses isn't really to save the article, but to explain my thinking. <del>Incidentally, my understanding is that Wikipedia is both a secondary and a tertiary source. Is this incorrect?</del> Sorry -- looking more closely at <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>, I see that a tertiary source includes both primary and secondary sources, which is exactly how I see Wikipedia.) --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 03:33, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>; I'd like to see how this develops.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Also, as a comment, there's a difference between censorship and <i>standards</i> - this is a case of the latter. No one's denying that the film exists, or trying to suppress the film itself. However, right now, this film has almost <b>zero</b> internet presence. It's a non-entity as far as films go, <b>for now</b>. If the film gets distributed or shown at festivals, even listed on the IMDB, then those are signs that there's some legitimate interest in the film, and then its inclusion in the Wikipedia can be revisited. But right now, it looks like the filmmakers are tring to game the system to generate false search hits and returns on their project, and that's NOT what I think the Wikipedia should be supporting. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRealFennShysa_6315.html" title="User:TheRealFennShysa">TheRealFennShysa</a> 22:58, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. Martin Luther King said she was notable, and used her as a figure in his preaching. "Since that dreary night in 1956, Mother Pollard has passed on to glory and I have known very few quiet days. I have been tortured without and tormented within by the raging fires of tribulation. I have been forced to muster what strength and courage I have to withstand howling winds of pain and jostling storms of adversity. But as the years have unfolded the eloquently simple words of Mother Pollard have come back again and again to give light and peace and guidance to my troubled soul." The quotation is well known, and has been the source for the title to more than one notable history of the US civil rights movement (the best known by <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howell_Raines_3df7.html" title="Howell Raines">Howell Raines</a>). I like the eloquently simple form the article now has, and would myself simplify it a shade further, but I expect someone would soon enough convert to a more mundane, traditionally encyclopedic form. That someone would seriously claim that Mother Pollard (sometimes referred to as Sister Pollard) does not merit a few bytes of space in a supposed encyclopedia which devotes absurd amounts of it to fictional characters from mediocre cartoons, "performers" in the erotica trade, all the subway stations in the world, and every one of those wretchedly inbred British peers who devoted their lives to sexually abusing their kitchen staff, fox hunting, and oppressing the Irish is unfortunately unsurprising, and I would hope this proposal is immediately and resoundingly rejected. But I am certain it will not be. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 04:53, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>- Perhaps you're right, why should an encyclopedia be responsible for maintaining information and recording events, when it can be a top 100 list of popular trivia? The one film that has been released by this company is the only dedicated documentary in Wikipedia databases regarding the subject of Racewalking. That alone should ensure its reason for non-deletion. Not to mention that the film is regarding the World Masters' Championship, which is an international event in equally high standing as the Olympics. Photoactivist 22:44, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> SWATJester has made it readily obvious he does not take this to be serious subject matter. FCYTravis has also made many uninformed allegations against this article; He confuses North and South Dakota and is apparently unaware of the fact that the University of North Dakota has no accredited journalism department and the campus newspaper is about as focused on Minot happenings as the Chicago Tribune is on Milwaukee. --<b><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington"><font style="background:#000088;" color="#FFFF88">AlexWCovington</font></a></b> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 22:40, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Swatjester made one comment which he noted was a joke, given that and you claim that bias was expressed by "editors" plural, I have trouble seeing that. Your other comments, i.e. not being aware of the nature of the local newspaper and confusing N and S hardly constitute evidence of bias. Now, there specific conditions for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<li>My claim that the article should remain based upon the fact that artists on the label have completed national tours in the United States has yet to be disputed.

<li><b>Commment Response</b>*Sorry? It hasn't stopped people on this site before. While series like Star Wars and Dr. Who are amidtablly more notable than Pure Pwnage, the fact is they have larger articles and sub articles than World War II on this site (which, is funny since the first has its own Wiki). This goes for a whole bunch of other series as well. Like for example, before I would get fansubs for Gundam Seed Destiny, I'd check here first for the spoiler's. And they were fairly extensive. So, unless you are going to attempt to be a great champion of the wiki and nominate every single one of those article for deletion, I think the PP article is fine and short in comparion.<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendantheJedi_f1e8.html" title="User:BrendantheJedi">BrendantheJedi</a> 04:31, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Someone with an abnormally low edit count is (purportedly) less likely to be knowledgeable about wikipedia policies and/or a sockpuppet used to vote multiple times.

I know wiki prefers to look at itself as encyclopedic, but this in an encyclopedia that be edited on the internet. Because of the demographic, the articles on this site may lean towards geekish followings. They can only go after smaller things like Pure Pwnage on occasion, since they still feel the futile need to look sophisticated. But we all know if they tried to cut down on articles on Star Wars, they attept would most certainly fail (unless of course it was a character article about obscure person in the fandom).-<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendantheJedi_f1e8.html" title="User:BrendantheJedi">BrendantheJedi</a> 17:00, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I seem to have forgotten to add the comparison details in my earlier vote, so here goes: Not only was there an already large fanbase during the previous AfD almost three months ago, but it's grown considerably since with another episode released. The &lt;200K for Google has jumped to around 300K (I just picked up 312K), Alexa ranking's jumped from 39K to 34K, his then-month-old MySpace has gone from 3K friends to almost 10K<a href="http://www.myspace.com/teh_real_jeremy" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.myspace.com/teh_real_jeremy" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, and the forum members of 11K to 15K.<a href="http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> And presently, a TeamSpeak chat with the crew will be held on Saturday; I expect 300+ participants like it's happened before. Also, as said above, a lock of the protagonist's hair is going for more than US$4,000, now with over 100 bids and 225K hits, even after a bunch of relatively high bids were taken down for more safety from fake ones.<a href="http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7601131682" class="external autonumber" title="http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7601131682" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHeteroZellous_ad35.html" title="User:HeteroZellous">HeteroZellous</a> 01:45, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response to comment.</b> It's not a matter of authenticity, but notability. Literally tens of thousands of aspiring artists, actors, musicians, directors, <i>et cetera</i> create Wikipedia pages for themselves. While all the information therein may be factual, the vast majority of self-created pages are simply not notable from an encyclopedic viewpoint. For an actor or stuntman, you're going to need several major movie credits (i.e. not student/web films, and not just as an extra) before being deemed worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 12:28, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Despite sucky stubs in both Polish and English, the tree is well known in Poland. I think it's reckoned to be the oldest tree in Europe.

<li>Is it? Can you find any other information on this tree? It looks like the author of this page created a dozen or so articles for other trees - each time just giving some random stats about it.

<li>Well, it's proving quite hard to research (including in Polish sources), and it looks like the article might be toast soon.

<li>All the Google results for "oldest tree in europe" seem to point to a yew in Perthshire, at least on the first few pages. Someone has edited the article to say this tree is 400 years old.

<li><b>Comment</b> Different issue, but there's now a picture of the game put up there by the original author of the article that's marked as user-created and released to public domain.

<p>Definitely not a fake album at this point, this album is past the rumour point and is upcoming release now. I don't see any point in killing this article just to have it recreated in a few months. I know the article is only a stub at the moment, but there's not that much verifiable information out there at this time. Hopefully the actual labels will release information shortly about the release which would shore up the information. I know this album has yet to be released but why not have a stub to link to the dead links in the Bad Religion article regarding this forthcoming release? --Estanton 06:45, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The text of this article mentions that "illegitimate" isn't a recognized category in the United States anymore and people born out-of-wedlock are now granted the same rights as those born in wedlock, and yet it proceeds to identify certain people, such as <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Clapton_2d16.html" title="Eric Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href="../../../e/a/r/Eartha_Kitt_f154.html" title="Eartha Kitt">Eartha Kitt</a>, as "illegitimates". That doesn't make much sense. How can they be "illegitimates" when they are from a country that doesn't recognize the concept? Also, the reference to them as "illegitimates" seems to be without any verification. Where have these individuals ever been referred to as "illegitimates"? Aren't Wikipedia articles supposed to be based on verifiable sources? I have never heard any of these individuals termed "illegitimates", and I have never heard of <a href="../../../e/v/a/Eva_Peron_86ab.html" title="Eva Peron">Eva Peron</a> being termed an "illegitimate". This article seems completely unnecessary and completely without verifiction. If one wants to mention that these respective individuals were born out-of-wedlock, wouldn't it be preferable to mention that on their respective pages?

<li><b><i>Retain</i> this article.</b> It has been commented that the purpose of this article is unclear. Granted; this list is so far barely a stub, and so its purpose may at this point <i>be</i> difficult to discern. But, then, there are many lists on the Wikipedia — what purpose do <i>they</i> serve? What, for instance, is the purpose of a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_poets.html" title="List of poets">List of poets</a> or of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_novelists.html" title="List of novelists">novelists</a>?</li>

<dl>
<dd>It has been objected that the criteria for inclusion in this article are imperfectly defined. True, the criteria <i>do</i> need to be more explicitly refined. But are they, even now, truly more ambiguous than those for inclusion on a list of <i><a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet.html" title="Poet">poets</a></i>? Who can provide a universally embraced <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition.html" title="Definition">definition</a> of "<a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a>"?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It has been suggested that a list of persons born illegitimate could end up including a major part of the world's population. Not really.

By the nature of things, one cannot anticipate with any certainty where research will lead. If it were possible to do so, any research at all would be superfluous. What, for example, could ever be the point to compiling a list of <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicides</a>? What would be the point of such a gruesome undertaking? And yet suicide was the subject of ground-breaking <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociological</a> research by <a href="../../../%C3%A9/m/i/%C3%89mile_Durkheim_ed0d.html" title="Émile Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a> (<i><a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_%28book%29.html" title="Suicide (book)">Suicide</a></i>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a>), and — yes — <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> <i>is</i> home to a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_suicides.html" title="List of suicides">List of suicides</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It has been observed that there may currently be individuals on the List of illegitimates who do not belong there. I suspect that that is indeed the case. I will posit that no name should appear in the list that cannot definitely be documented as belonging there. Only those individuals should be listed who, in the circumstances of their time and place, were deemed at birth by their <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">society</a> to be "<a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimacy.html" title="Illegitimacy">illegitimate</a>."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the purpose of this list is still to make itself manifest, there at least is one thing that it is <i>not</i>. This list is <i>not</i> intended as a public pillory to shame those whose names appear on it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, why set up such a list? First, it may be worth noting that, given current trends, this will be a <i>self-limiting</i> list: the concept of "<a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimacy.html" title="Illegitimacy">illegitimacy</a>" — I will venture to say this, at the risk of disclosing a personal <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bias.html" title="Bias">bias</a> — appears to be dying out, at least in the demonstrably more enlightened quarters of the world. But until recent times it <i>was</i> widespread, and it <i>did</i> cause incalculable anguish to those touched by it. Though I am by no means an expert on their life stories, I am convinced that it was a grim presence througout the lives of <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and of <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_of_Arabia_a6f3.html" title="Lawrence of Arabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a>, and of countless other less prominent individuals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that a useful purpose <i>can</i> be served by this list, and that it should have a chance to demonstrate that usefulness before its life is so early snuffed out. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogologist_53bd.html" title="User:Logologist">logologist</a>|<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELogologist_084c.html" title="User talk:Logologist">Talk</a> 06:33, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response.</b> I'll make <i>one</i> response to this, and then that will be it (otherwise, a debate would go and on). <i>At the very least</i> you should have verifiction of people having been referred to as "illegitimates". You have none. No such category of "illegitimates" exists anymore in this country. (Further, there is perhaps the risk that publishing such a list may constitute slander. I doubt that Oprah Winfrey, Eric Clapton, and Eartha Kitt would be too happy to know they are listed as "illegitimates".) And isn't there already <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimacy.html" title="Illegitimacy">an article that discusses the concept and the places where the concept is still viable</a>? It seems to me that should be sufficient. I fear I shouldn't say this, but I'm going to: this list seems about as appropriate as making a list called "A list of Negros", and then listing various people of African descent. And I wholeheartedly agree that there is little use of a list that would include a great deal of the world's population. And if you believe that being born out-of-wedlock was of importance for Lawrence of Arabia and da Vinci, then wouldn't it be more appropriate to simply include that observation/opinion in their respective articles? -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 08:21, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b> (for Esquizombi). Mind you, it is not a "list" of African Americans, but a category -- a category which is broken down into several different articles. Further, it uses a term ("African American") that virtually no one is offended by. The category is not "Category:Negros" is it? Lastly, the classification of "African American" is viable and is <i>not</i> prejorative. The classification of "negro" is not viable and <i>is</i> prejorative (or at least referring to an individual in such a way is likely to be perceived as such), and any such list would most likely be met with opposition as well. (I respond in order to clarify what I was attempting to say, as I realize the analogy I am attempting to draw is perhaps controversial. But I think most here understand what I'm saying.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 11:27, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>One answer</b> Well, with regard to the <a href="../../../e/a/m/Eamon_de_Valera_90a6.html" title="Eamon de Valera">Eamon de Valera</a> article: no. The <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> has retroactively abolished illegitimacy, and indeed has passed legislation explicitly outlawing discrimination based on the circumstances of a person's birth. However, de Valera lived before this happened and as can be seen from the article, his illegitimate status did impact on his life, and is therefore very relevant to the article. And the article is the proper place for it to be addressed, not in a meaningless list of people born out of wedlock. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 14:44, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b>. You seem unable to grasp that the term "illegitimate" is not legally viable anymore in this country (the USA), nor any other English speaking country of which I am aware (England, Australia, New Zealand, etc). Therefore, to describe someone as "illegitimate" simply means that they were born out-of-wedlock, not that they are denied any rights. No one as of yet who has voted on this page can see any use in maintaining a list of people born out-of-wedlock when the very concept hardly holds any meaning anymore in most developed nations and all English speaking nations. Wikipedia's rules hold that an issue or person must be "notable" in order to warrant a page, and most of us agree that this is not an issue of notable importance.</dd>

<dd>Has Eric Clapton's out-of-wedlock birth ever been made an issue of consequence for him? Has he ever been denied any rights because of his out-of-wedlock birth? Has there ever been an OFFICIAL declaration by the country of his birth that has established and labled him as "an illegitimate"? Most likely, no. The issue of his out-of-wedlock ("illegitimate") birth is of little to no importance and is treated in his biography in passing and is not a major factor in his life. If the issue of his out-of-wedlock birth is hardly an issue on his own article, then what use is served by referencing it on a page that defines him in terms of an issue that has little to no importance on his main biographical page? I mean, what purpose is there is making lists that group people together based on issues that hardly have any meaning to the respective people or to larger society? Like someone said earlier, we may as well have a list called "List of people with red hair" (a list that would include me, which I'm sure no one cares about anyway; hey, maybe we could make a list called "List of people with red hair who were born illegitimate", another list I could be included on -- another list that would serve no purpose). -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 02:57, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Addendum</b>. In regard to the Random House Dictionary definition of "illegitimate" as "a person recognized or looked upon as illegitimate" -- this definition does not specifically refer to a person of an out-of-wedlock birth. People can be viewed as "illegitimate" for any number of reasons. To reference the page that led me to this page: <a href="../../../e/v/a/Eva_Peron_86ab.html" title="Eva Peron">Eva Peron</a>'s power was viewed by some as "illegitimate". Mind you, Eva Peron's power wasn't viewed by some as being "illegitimate" because of her out-of-wedlock birth, but because she was not a formally elected official. In other words, the term "illegitimate" can refer to many, many things, and therefore is incredibly vague and a very weak premise upon which to base an article. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 03:27, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've convinced me as to Clapton; I've delisted him. Evita is gone, too.</dd>
<dd>As to the <i>Random House Dictionary</i>, I'm afraid its definition of the <a href="../../../n/o/u/Noun.html" title="Noun">noun</a> usage for "illegitimate" <i>does</i> refer to a person born out of wedlock, rather than to one who usurps or misuses political power. The full entry reads: "a person recognized or looked upon as illegitimate; a bastard." I omitted the last two words before, because we're already having problems enough with unfortunate colloquial connotations. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogologist_53bd.html" title="User:Logologist">logologist</a>|<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELogologist_084c.html" title="User talk:Logologist">Talk</a> 03:57, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for removing Evita from the list, and I think that it is best that you removed Eric Clapton as well. About the Random House definition, that may be that they clarify the term "illegitimate" in relation to someone born out-of-wedlock, but that doesn't change the fact that the term "illegitimate" can pertain to <i>many</i> different situations and circumstances. This page does not clarify the different meanings of the word, the different ways the word has been used, nor does it qualify that within this list the only people who are termed "illegitimates" are people born out-of-wedlock.</p>
<p>Further, an argument could feasibly be made that referring to a person as an "illegitimate" is within the realms of hate speech. Could you imagine if someone made a list called "A list of <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">niggers</a>"? I mean, you could probably compile a list of notable African Americans who have been referred to as "niggers" at some point in their lives, and thereby argue that because these people have been referred to by that word then the list is justified. But the word "nigger" is largely regarded as hate speech, and any list called "A list of niggers" would be perceived as a list endorsing the use of that word and endorsing the discrimination synonymous with that word -- and therefore such a list would be met with resistance.</p>
<p>I hesitate to use that n-word because it is so controversial, but to be frank, I find it as offensive to refer to a person as an "illegitimate" as I find it to refer to a person as a "nigger". As an earlier editor mentioned, this list is probably best to be removed because otherwise it will create a vandalism and POV nightmare. Thank you for removing Evita and Eric Clapton. Now if only I could get you to see that the entire page itself should be removed.... -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 04:56, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. As the term "illegitimate" is not a legal term anymore, my opinion is that even renaming the list something like "List of historic figures stigmatized by illegitimate birth" is not sufficient. What <i>is</i> an "illegitimate birth"? The term no longer has legal meaning and is now relegated to the realm of colloquial use. Under today's standards, those same individuals would not suffer any legal ramifications due to circumstances of their birth. If the article is kept and renamed, I think a better title would be something like, "Historical figures stigmatized by the categorization of 'illegitimate'".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I realize that's a very long and cumbersome title (which may be another reason the article is better to be deleted). But the important distinction such a title change would make is that it would put the focus on <i>society's bigotry</i>, rather than on the state of an infant. The problem was not that these people were born to unwed parents, but that <i>society stigmatized them</i> for being born to unwed parents. I know that sounds POV, but in reality is it not because today's absence of illegitimacy laws makes it evident that the concept was deemed inappropriate by the courts, was a "problem", and was therefore abolished. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 02:23, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b>. The use of parenthesis, in my opinion, makes the word less offensive because it is less likely to be interpreted as an advocacy of the term and designation.

<p>I'm nominating this page for deletion because it is written with a point of view , excessive use of unreliable sources.and the title "Khalistan" is wrong for the topic because "Khalistan" does not exist,lack of support from resident Punjabi's and Sikhs in India, but there was a "Movement for Khalistan" and that is the right title for the topic, and i think this whole article "a new name" should be rewritten with the help of people from sikh community "in" India and other Indians, because this topic is related to politics/people of India.We all should understand Khalistan is not a political entity and having a article is not justified, Microsoft Encarta and Britannic encyclopedia don't have an article known as "Khalistan" but they do have articles on the movement that took place decades back, and i think there are also copyright issues involved with this article because big parts of this article are written on other peoples research. Many reliable sources are used to show "one side" of their view on the topic, there are also indications that organisations banned by US and EU are involved in providing their research on the movement.I am a strong supporter to have a stub on this topic , but im afraid that such articles on wikipedia have become mouthpieces for organisation which are known for disrupting peace (assassination of one of india's prime minister, twin bomb blast in New Delhi on the eve of Diwali) in Indian sub continent.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: The article needs cleanup, not deletion. The movement, and their proposed homeland is well known, and the article seems to have a long list of citations. It is true that this article is perhaps biased, but AfD is not the place to remove bias. Discussion and consensus at the article page is the proper way to do so. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 18:39, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. While I am not averse to moving it to "Movement for Khalistan" I believe it is not an appropriate title. The article needs some clean-up and NPOVification, though. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 18:50, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a valid term, even if not an officially recognized entity (see <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>, for example). If the article is too POV, or there are copyright issues, that requires cleanup, not deletion. Whether or not one likes the politics of some supporters has no place in the discussion. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:00, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>: I've worked with <a href="../../../z/a/f/User%7EZafarnamah_215f.html" title="User:Zafarnamah">User:Zafarnamah</a> to get the article cleaned up significantly from its original form (check out the talk page, and history). There is an undeniable bias in the article (i.e. it is pro-Khalistan) and it does little to criticise the Khalistani militants. However, this is absolutely no reason to delete the article, and the name is perfectly acceptable too. Anmol.2k4 seems to think that bias problems in an article with such depth are easy to fix - they're not. I've on several occasions asked Indian Wikipedians to help in showing an anti-Khalistan view, but none have edited it. This issue is extremely complex, and plagued by misreporting on both sides (the stifling of media in Punjab did nothing to help this). <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 19:12, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: this was my entry originally. there are entries for the angry pirate in every major online sexual and slang dictionary as well as the encyclopedia of sex. the drink recipes are widely available. the possibility that the angry pirate is entirely a joke is included as a parenthetical qualifier within the text, but there is no evidence to suggest that it isn't a "real" scenario as it's included on sites alongside many socially accepted sexual practices. regardless of its status as a scenario which is acted out in actuality, it is a socially relevant narrative described in detail on hundreds, perhaps thousands, of independent sites around the web. <i><b>Perhaps recategorizing under "sexual urban legends" would suffice?</b></i> Davidelliot</li>

I have heard references to this from acquaintances living throughout the US who do not know each other (though I admit that this is not a sufficient basis for inclusion, it is what called my attention to the wrongfulness of this AFD). More centrally, though, this is a well-cited, well-researched and well-written article. We should not let it die just because certain editors have not personally heard of this term. Also above argument that "'Queer and feminist critiques of the angry pirate narrative' implies this can't be anything but patent nonsense" mis troubling as an argument. Maybe this one line is nonsense, added to an otherwise valid article (which this is) for gag vale -- the logical solution to this problem is seemingly to simply delete the disputed sentence, not vote to delete the entire article. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 16:55, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm going to have to disagree with pretty much everything you said here.
<ul>
<li>The article is not well-cited. It doesn't include inline citations. Also, as neither Urban Dictionary nor The Encyclopedia of Sex meet our standards for sources, the article violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. There are no citations from legitimate sources (newspapers, reference books, etc.).</li>
<li>The article is not well-researched. It's basically just a dictionary definition of the term, and does not provide any additional information, such as the phrase's origin and localization, or notable examples of its use.</li>
<li>The article is not well-written. As you noted, almost half of it is a bunch of joke lines about "queer and feminist critiques of the angry pirate narrative" or the acidity of female ejaculate, which don't add any encyclopedic value. It's not even well-written from a <i>technical</i> standpoint, as it doesn't conform to the manual of style: the article's title is not bolded, it starts with a number rather than with text, internal wikilinks are treated as external links, etc.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Sure they are not very original and not notable, but I don't agree that "non-notable" should make an article eligible for deletion. If it's left in Wikipedia it hurts nobody.

<li><b>Delete</b> Because all the admins of and frequent editors of encyclopedia dramatica come to wikipedia under tons of names each and alter the article to promote the website. If it's kept, the article should be reduced to a much shorter article, like "encyclopedia dramatica contains non-serious articles, which on very rare occasion are funny." April Furs Day should be left in though. I wonder if 4chan will do it this year like last. A more significant reason for is moving is that the domain is encyclopedia not encyclopaedia, and there is no "ae" key on keyboards, so it needs to be renamed at least. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 05:51, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

Well, <b>Wikipedia isn't your personal website</b>. We're striving to build a online encyclopedia will all sorts of content, not just content that we particularly like. (I thought censorship was considered harmful here?) Just because you dislike something, it doesn't make it non-notable. (See <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a>, for example.) This is a online encyclopedia, not an elementary school.

<li><b>Comment</b> Are you kidding? Uncyclopedia is not more notable than Encyclopedia Dramatica? Here, I'll use your own sources.

I think you'll notice that 499,000 is more than 18400, and that 8,201 is a higher rank than 32,000. So in terms of just pure stats, Uncyclopedia is literally about 4 times more notable than ED. Also you have to take into consideration all the extremely notable newspapers Uncyclopedia has been featured in. The source? You may have heard of it, it's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncyclopedia#Notability" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncyclopedia#Notability" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>.

Uncyclopedia has been featured in The New York Times, the Boston Herald, and the London Guardian among others. Believe me, I've had four of my own articles from Uncyclopedia cited in some of these newspapers. The best ED can come up with is a linkfilter quote from a year-and-a-half ago.

<li>I merely clicked the link on your webpage and noticed that you have a nice message directed to visitors from Encyclopedia Dramatica on your main page. It wasn't a personal attack, I was merely stating you have a grudge against Encyclopedia Dramatica -- it isn't a secret either, because you mention it on the main page of your site. I wasn't saying you were wrong or right; I don't know the backstory and I obviously wouldn't have any facts to back it up. Just stating that you do dislike them a lot, which I think that is true. Linking people to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> when they are only stating obvious facts is also a bit of an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a>, isn't it? (Also, I don't think they care about <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> or any of our other policies, considering their wiki isn't Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Notability is questionable (this is a recreate of a page twice deleted, kept the third time). This is a rather small website and rather limited in scope and activity. This article appears to be being used as a sandbox, a soapbox or an advertisement for a website; info the owners of that site don't want included has been repeatedly deleted via various means including sockpuppetry and DMCA misuse. Unless this can be dramatically cleaned up and merged somewhere else (such as a list of wikis on similar/related topics), this smacks more of "I want to advertise my website on the Wikipædia" than of actual useful encyclopædic content. I question whether we need an entire article about this one individual wiki. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlb_f511.html" title="User:Carlb">carlb</a> 17:28, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge or Keep</b>. It has enough notability to at least deserve a mention.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I admit that I do not care for this website, but that's not why I think this article should be deleted. <b>Wikipedia is not a web directory</b> and <b>Wikipedia articles are not advertisements</b>. The article does not read in an encyclopediac style and with the subject matter, it doesn't seem like it could. The website itself centers on non-notability, so any description thereof would be non-notable. The history of the website isn't notable, the content isn't, and thus an article wouldn't be (and isn't). The site <i>is</i> notable, IMO, but not more than dicdef. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 19:20, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not a merge, per se. Perhaps a <i>mention</i> in a relevant article (of which I can't think of any), but there isn't much notability to it besides its definition.

Basically <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> tricked people who posted furry art to post in this one area (instead of on their anonymous area) on April 1st and a few days later as an <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_fools.html" title="April fools">April fools</a> day joke, their admins banned everyone who posted there.

<li><b>I'd like to make a comment about this stuff in general</b>. I should say that there are millions, maybe even TEN millions, of sites out there, and just because a site has an Alexa rank of 50000, or even 200000, doesn't automatically make it non-notable. Many of the sites with &lt;10000 Alexa ranks are mostly sites for corporations such as ESPN.com, adultswim.com, and things that have notability outside the web. I know what the Wikipedia guidline is (and, for the record, it is NOT policy), and I must say it's pretty flawed. Something can be very popular and referenced and still have low Alexa ranks. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starmen.net.html" title="Starmen.net">Starmen.net</a> and SMBHQ, for example, have Alexa ranks of 200,000 approximately, and they're still some of the most popular sites on the web. Both sites have been referenced in MAJOR PUBLICATIONS, yet all people care about around here are numbers and statistics. And people say things like "delete: non-notable" without providing any evidence. Usually those who say it is notable provide evidence to back it up. A site does not have to fall under certain statistics to be notable.</li>

<dd>Well, Kurdistan by definition is a geographic region, and it spans several countries. This is different from <i>Kurds here and there</i>, since the term <i>Kurd</i> refers to a group of people not a region.

<dd>Diyako, Kurdish ethnicity and culture are everywhere in Turkey. Except for the Black Sea region, there is hardly any city in Turkey without a Kurdish population. There are more Kurds in Istanbul, Izmir, Ankara combined than in whole SE Turkey. You are promoting seperatist undertones in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is becoming pathologic, and POV pushers don't expect me to even answer. Turkish Kurdistan is an accepted term, it IS an encyclopedic term, it is a term which has been used for quite some time, just like terms 'Ottoman Armenia' or 'Russian Armenia.' And for those googlers that relies on google to establish the notability of a term, Lord Kinross, which Turkish nationalists like to quote in every given occasion that Ataturk is cricised DO call it such, a discussion published in The Geographical Journal Vol. 122, No. 2 (June., 1956) p. 166, Lake Van and Turkish Kurdistan: A Botanical Journey: Discussion by James Marshall-Cornwall; Lord Kinross attest to that. This Wikipedia-wide Turkish ultranationalism is really becoming a disease. Just recently Smyrnas material allegedly under the pretext of dumping it to be merged on Izmir, ended up as a pretext to DELETE the entire section regarding the fire. That they have sliced the criticism on Ataturk pages, that they have gotten parasitically involved in Greek, Armenian and Kurdish matters as far as screwing and scrapping the Armenian genocide article is not enought, they even had to recruit ultranationalists. BTW Coolcat, you were right on one thing, you indeed were not Karabekir, your alter ego Tommiks was, the Tommiks who rearranged, sliced and screwed the entire integrity of the Ottoman Empire related articles and who worked in tandem with you. As for my ranting, sorry, I can't help it, after what I have learned in those two days about the 'Call for Turks' in the 10s Febuary, 2006, to invade those articles made my two days(I have my sources). Also, if I were you, I would start accumulating the evidences, since right now, I have 14 pages of evidences that would discredit you, Tommiks, Ottomanreference, Karabekir and some I'd like to not name here right now, for good..., so it would be a good idea for you to stop requesting Kurdish related articles deletions and start accumulating evidences against me, sine in few days my research will be completed <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 01:56, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't seen you even debate when articles such as anti-Turkism, which are not quite notable were created, have you even requested a merging with the article about Turkish people? Besides what you say doesn't make much sense, this article exist, the term is notable, and doesn't apear to be to be expended article. There are articles of three lines which are accepted and no one even question if they should be merged. STOP IT! Don't you guys not realise that this is WIKIPEDIA and an apolotical encyclopedia? You would be the first, if Greek, Armenian or Kurd nationalists were to go on searching after any Turkish related articles to remove or add whatever they want, but yet, THIS IS EXACTLY what is happening there with ultranationalists like you. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:20, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know what's going on; I've seen plenty of these things go down. The purpose of AfD is the use a polling format to bring out the best arguments for keeping or deleting an article in order to write the best encyclopedia we can. Since the discussion format <i>resembles</i> a vote, many people take it to be one, and believe that they can "win" by attracting superior numbers of "voters". However, majority doesn't rule in these discussions - the best arguments rule. A swarm of "votes" which add no <i>reasons</i> for keeping an article are not given equal weight with a handful of thoughtful, well-reasoned arguments that demonsrate understanding of the situation and of the relevant Wiki-policies and guidelines. The strongest argument I'm seeing given for deletion is that the article is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/Wikipedia%7EPOV_fork_3de8.html" title="Wikipedia:POV fork">POV fork</a> - a second article on the same topic as an existing one, presenting it from a different perspective.

<dd>This only proves that the article needs to be rewritten. The point is, as ChrisO noted, that the arguments are not the same; many Kurds do not live in Turkish Kurdistan, and many Turks <i>do</i> live in Turkish Kurdistan. And also there's the region's economy to treat, thing that can hardly be done adequately in <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds_in_Turkey_c5e2.html" title="Kurds in Turkey">Kurds in Turkey</a>.

<dd>Are you sure you are comprehending what I am saying? The region already has a name, it is geopoliticaly Southeastern Anatolia, historically Upper Mesopotamia. Turkish Kurdistan should be under these titles. It means nothing alone that you got 1,450,000 hits with Turkish Kurdistan, I googled "Irish Empire" and got 1,630,000 hits, I guess we need to create an Irish Empire article based on this, eh?

<dd>The argument of redirecting to <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds_in_Turkey_c5e2.html" title="Kurds in Turkey">Kurds in Turkey</a> is not convincing at all, and should be abandoned. However, Adkagansu's proposal to redirect to Southeastern Anatolia is something else. It would be, however, like redirecting <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chameria.html" title="Chameria">Chameria</a> to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thesprotia.html" title="Thesprotia">Thesprotia</a>, which doesn't seem much better than two separate articles; it rather seems worse.

<dd>Yes it is a region and it is called Southeastern Anatolia, that's its geopolitical name. I think, instead of thinking clearly, some people here are just saying "This guy is a fascist, I am not like him, I am a humanist liberal righteous someone, I won't allow him to censor it". I wonder how much of those who voted <b>Keep</b> actually tried to understand my point in this without being dragged away by their bias towards certain things. Its geopolitical name is Southeastern Anatolia, at least, as previously suggested, this article should be moved to Southeastern Anatolia and be mentioned some regard it as Turkish Kurdistan, and Turkish Kurdistan will still redirect to this page and people will get their information.</dd>

<p><del>'<b>Delete and Redirect'</b>. Kurdistan is not an actual geographic location. Rather, "Kurdistan" refers to a regional ethnic identity existing across states.

Thus an article called "Turkish Kurdistan" would have to deal with ethnic Turks, if such a body exists anymore, living in a region titled "Kurdistan," assuming one existed. The article seems to suggest the content concerns Turkish administrated Kurdistan but since a state with that name has never and does not currently exist then it is impossible to determine the nature of the Turkish administration of it. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 18:04, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</del></p>

<li>My vote stands, and no amount of brow-beating is going to make me change it.

Joey 17:07, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't want you to change your vote. It is not the good faith that is questioned. It is the logic. Yor argument does not provide the <b>reason</b> of your vote. If you had given the reason, it could have been possible I'd changed <b>my</b> vote instead. Your explanation basically says "I like it all in one big article", and it is fine with me; I dont want to beat anyone's brows; tastes differ, I know. But this is the reason why I concluded that you probably didn't give it much thought: if you had, you'd explain your reasoning: <b>why</b> subheadings are better than subarticles. In particular you didn't bother to explain what is wrong with my <b>explanation</b>: wikipedia articles breed most often by spawning rather than by merging.

<p>I suggest we create a page called Geopolitical disputes regarding Kurdistan and put all sides of each argument there. Then, at the top of each disputed Kurd or Kurdistan related page, we can put a link which says "See also Geopolitical disputes regarding Kurdistan". What about this? <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerecat_31d8.html" title="User:Merecat">Merecat</a> 22:36, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ridiculous, it is really pathetic to see how people can give away simply because some ultranationalists are very vocal and by constant lobbying they can dictate what to do. We should simply stick to Wikipedia policies. Is there something called 'Turkish Kurdistan'&#160;? Yes, there is such a thing, Is this term notable? Yes! IT IS! I can cite here various articles, I have access to various servers of notable journals, and this term is very often used. The last question to ask is, are there materials in that article? Yes! THERE ARE. There are various sub of less notable terms which will never get deleted, merged. They have even merged Smyrna the ancient city with Izmir, and in the same token they have removed the entire section about Smyrna fire which is still considered one of the worst fires in history, there are even some comparing it with the burning of Rome. When will anyone attempt to merge the city of Ur with its current location? I say, this is ENOUGHT!!! ENOUGHT! I have attempted blind eyes for few days, but unless people stop sleeping on gas and no one answers this will continue again and again. Also it is amusing to see that some member still brag 'neutrality' request, when this one same member in his own userpage indicated clearly why he was on Wikipedia, which he said was to counter Armenian, Greek and Kurdish POV pushing. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 00:45, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am a Turk, I speak my heart, I don't hide behind devious words or schemes. I won't kiss you on the cheek, and dig your grave behind your back. I see you made a background search on me. I like attention, you may keep stalking me. Anyway, I have no beef with neutral Greek, Armenian and Kurdish users. With one neutral Greek user, <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a>, I believe we did a great job on making <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Cypriots_738d.html" title="Turkish Cypriots">Turkish Cypriots</a> page as NPOV as possible, which was repeatedly edited before. He proved his good faith to me many times and earned my trust.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is a fact there is a lot of POV pushing going on Turkey, Armenia, Greece and Kurdistan related articles. And I believe Turkish voice is definitely not heard as much as it should be. I've seen hardcore Wikipedian Armenian, Greek and Kurdish users here who spare many hours a day here and almost none Turkish. Most Turkish users here either spare little time for this or have little interest in what's going on or are busy with editing Turkish Viki or suffer from limited language skills. Now I have the feeling some people are uncomfortable with Turks rising their voice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway back to the subject here; what we have is a very legitimate case. I have examples in front of me such <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Turkestan_eb53.html" title="Chinese Turkestan">Chinese Turkistan</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian_Kurdistan_c5f3.html" title="Syrian Kurdistan">Syrian Kurdistan</a>. I'll demand my friends to create a Southeastern Anatolia page which is the geopolitic name for the region, internationally recognized, unlike Turkish Kurdistan which has been made popular only by certain media organizations. If you ask me there are 2 decent solutions to this subject:</dd>
</dl>
<p>1. Rewrite and shorten <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Kurdistan_fac6.html" title="Turkish Kurdistan">Turkish Kurdistan</a> page so it won't act as if TK is a breakaway de facto state in Southeastern Turkey. At the beginnig of the article it should say "For the geopolitic Turkish region see Southeastern Anatolia" or something like that, whatever the proper language is. But this will, in my opinion, be POV fork. 2. Delete the entire article and move the information to Southeastern Anatolia. Turkish Kurdistan will redirect to this page and in it the unofficial name will be mentioned like in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Turkestan_eb53.html" title="Chinese Turkestan">Chinese Turkistan</a>. <b>This I think is the most decent thing to do. I really don't understand people who fail to see the legitimate argument here.

<dd>Background search? What background search? I knew all this all along, since you are one of the Turks who registered in the 10s February 2006. And you are absolutly wrong and you know it when you claim that Greeks, Armenians and Kurds were much active while Turks were not. There are more active Turks and always has been than Armenians, Greeks and Kurds combined. There are at least one Turk in everything related to Armenians, Greeks and Kurds when the slightest political scheme is concerned. And now, with the call for Turks in the 10s February 2006, the amount of POV pushers has just jumped to another fold. No one is saying to stop contributing, in fact I will more than ever welcome a Turk that at least is honest enought to admit for what he is here and also assume his Turkishness, than some dishonest people hidding this all together and both of us know that in this sphere of activity(Kurdish, Armenian and Greek issues) this type of people aren't in shortage. And if you pay attention, there is a clear disproportion between nationalist Turks ivading Kurdish, Armenian and Greek articles than the other way around and if you were honest enought you would have no problem admitting that, but this is not what you do, you are claiming to the contrary. Just for your information, here we have another example of how ultranationalists dictate Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Khoikhoi" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Khoikhoi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Khoikhoi</a></dd>

<dd>This guy has been fair with everyone requesting concessions from every sides, but yet your fellows will in mass try to hijack a request for adminiship. Claiming that he push Greek POV which BTW is ridiculous when he himself as reverted Greek POVs.</dd>

<dd>Comming to this poll, most here don't even know for what they are voting, a member has even gone as far as placing statistics of the last Turkish election. By the same token I should also present the statistics of the last Canadian election to advance that French Quebecers are not French Quebecers because they have voted more for the Conservative right party which always was against French Quebecers identity and values, than the Liberals <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" rel="nofollow">[57]</a> . Or maybe we should merge articles about Upper or 'Downer' Canada, etc. The question here is, IS THERE SOMETHING CALLED TURKISH KURDISTAN??? The answer IS obvious, this term IS notable, the article IS expanded enought. This is what it is, and if you truly are against POV pushing, you will stop doing that. I myself disagree with the maps of Turkish Kurdistan, because it also claims what is called 'Ottoman Armenia,' but Wikipedia IS NOT about what I think, but what positions are, a coverage of positions. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 20:49, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Figures for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> Turkish Provincial Elections (electing members of the Provincial Assemblies) in the 'at least' 17 Turkish provinces covered by the article (former Category: Kurdistan in wikipedia covered 20 provinces, therefore their number is displaying an unmistakably decreasing trend!!!).</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, there are general, provincial and municipal elections. People usually think in terms of the country, the 81 provinces and their specific municipality. The last general election was in 2002. Therefore, these 2004 figures are not only more recent but also, I would say, coherent with the panorama presented by the previous general elections. Provincial elections and municipal elections were held simultaneously. Provincial figures reflect the political choices of the voters better than the municipal ones. My choice for using the provincial figures instead of the municipal ones does not work to the disadvantage of any party. The party that was <i>closest</i> to promoting a Turkish K. agenda (let's say, people thinking in terms of a region whose mint they have struck themselves, with a name of their own preference) in these elections was the <a href="../../../s/h/p/SHP_f744.html" title="SHP">SHP</a> (which is actually a tiny but nation-wide center-left party, and it that had struck a deal for the southeast with the HADEP-<a href="../../../d/e/h/DEHAP_53e5.html" title="DEHAP">DEHAP</a> pedigree for these elections). Any argument with an intention to relativize the definition of non-SHP voters can also be countered by arguments, possibly in stronger terms, for defining the SHP-voter profile as well. In Turkey, it is obligatory to vote in elections (you can vote blank if you want to, but you have to go to the polls), therefore, I would say, that the popular political viewpoint trends are rather well reflected in the numbers that come out of these polls (without having to draw comparisons with elsewhere). I start from the southeastern tip of the country and confine the figures to those parties that scored over 10 % in a given province, unless otherwise relevant or interesting. Very briefly, <a href="../../../a/k/p/AKP_c1ea.html" title="AKP">AKP</a> is the party in power in Turkey, <a href="../../../d/y/p/DYP_4e36.html" title="DYP">DYP</a> is national center-right, <a href="../../../c/h/p/CHP_e92c.html" title="CHP">CHP</a> is national center-left, <a href="../../../s/p/_/SP_6747.html" title="SP">SP</a> is religious-right, <a href="../../../m/h/p/MHP_c332.html" title="MHP">MHP</a> is Turkish nationalist-right.</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> per above. I can understand not having a million little stubs, but having one big article per neighborhood or area would be fine. No, Wikipedia is not a travel guide, but it's definitely more than a bound encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> seeing as how I see no real reason to delete it. I saw no evidence of it being merged with the <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorillaz.html" title="Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a> article. The proper channels were certainly not followed. It is my understanding that the tags labeling an article for merger consideration are there for a reason. Also, merging generally involves making changes to the article being merged into. Being virtual should have no bearing on whether or not it is notable. Also, this article is not about the website that represent Kong Studios, it is about Kong Studios itself.

<li>I would gladly merge the Kong article into the main article.

<p>This company is pretty noticeable (to say the least) in the industry, with works in the Met museum, the Tel Aviv Museum and others. You can see the long list of publications on the company's website, and I included here a short list of google retrieved links - I can assure you that no Google bombing was done by Designfenzider,. The entries are all related to either bloggers that are excited about the designs, publication that had articles about the company and the designer (worldwide, see this month ID magazine, Wallpaper magazine, last week's NYT business section), stores that are selling the company's products and directory entries that got picked up (I guess. for good or worse) from dmoz.</p>
<p>The main designer, Ron Gilad (another article-that-should-be-written), is well known and established. Objects are sold world-wide from galleries in Paris, stored in Tokyo to the MoMA and Cooper-Hewitt stores in NY.</p>
<p>Of course, the issue if this or any other company should be listed in here is up for debate, but to say this is not a known company or that it was trying to skew search results is just incorrect. If anything, this article should be expended by someone from the Design industry or academic world. My two cents – it’s up to the rest of you (the world) to take it from here…</p>

<p>First nomination was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Achievement_in_British_Education_d0c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Achievement in British Education">here</a>. Was in December 2005, and result was "no consensus". Nominating for three reasons. Firstly, the topic is almost necessarily <i>some form of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a></i>. It has to quote "recent studies", which to me is OR. Secondly, as mentioned in the last nomiination, the topic is "nebulous"; <i>what precisely does it mean</i>? Is it talking about different factors that affect educational performance? In that case, it should probably be part of the <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_United_Kingdom_7510.html" title="Education in the United Kingdom">Education in the United Kingdom</a> article (which itself needs a huge makeover). If it is about educational sociology, it should in the <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">Education</a> article. It seems to fill none of these roles, and for me can never; it is hopelessly unfocussed. Finally, what does it have to do with education <i>in the UK</i>? The current article has nothing to do with it, and I cannot see how it ever can be. What specifically is there about education in the UK that deserves an article of this kind (whatever "kind" of article it is)? <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 23:31, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What's said in this article amounts to the equivalent of saying there is a "Punk Voter" subculture of punk or something, which is absurd. It's a website, sure, that talks about a political category laid over a social one (people who are both conservative and punk), but the two have no special meaning in conjunction. I could say Libertarian punk, Republican punk, Constitutionalist punk, Democrat punk, but none of these have special meaning (unlike, say, anarcho-punk, which is a particular social subgroup and would merit discussion as such). The article reads like a debate (or at least one side of it), and isn't linked to any social movement except that tied to the website, which was just a reactionary jab at Punk Voter anyway. Not to mention (like I've said), I see the article as something full of broad (and generally incorrect or meaningless) generalizations, mixed with unencyclopedic and non-NPOV claims. I would say just change it to be an article about the website, but that (judging by the previous discussion) there's a consensus that it's worth having an article at all. <a href="../../../1/4/9/User%7E149.43.x.x.html" title="User:149.43.x.x">149.43.x.x</a> 00:22, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Google hits aren't the only measure of relevance or encyclopedic merit. I never contested the fact that this website exists or that it's newsworthy. I'm pointing out that it doesn't constitute in any way a subculture or social movement, as the article claims; it's just a website, a group of people who read it, and the ensuing media attention. Read the article - it's totally non-NPOV and makes sweeping generalizations, and seems to be mostly original research or stuff cut straight from the website. How would you address my statement that nothing here makes it encyclopedic unless we want an entry about this website? (I have no problem with that, but in the last AfD nomination, those in favor only argued that this was only encyclopedic because it was some sort of social movement/subculture, and would not be encyclopedic otherwise. If we do want an article about the actual website though, it needs to be redone almost entirely.) <a href="../../../1/4/9/User%7E149.43.x.x.html" title="User:149.43.x.x">149.43.x.x</a> 03:40, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So clean the article up so we can have the article about the notable website and the notable movement. The media mentions more than cover it, there's plenty of reliable sources to work off of. Cleanup isn't a reason for deletion. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 03:42, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't know what "deleting based on concepts" means, but the concept of a "conservative punk" seems dubious. A lot of things are mentioned in the media; that doesn't establish notability. If there's a conservative punk manifesto published in book form, or a political party or officially incorporated organization that advocates "conservative punk" views, those would be some of the things that might establish notability. As it is, it sounds like just one of the many labels adopted by people who wank about politics on the Internet that have little relationship to any real-life political movement. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 02:56, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Interesting. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifability</a> is typically the way to go on these, and this concept easily meets that standard. Different strokes, I suppose. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 03:06, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The news articles you cited above all center around Nick Rizzuto and his web site, and journalists aren't immune from the mistake of confusing a single web site with a significant political movement. I'm still skeptical as to whether "conservative punks" exist as a political movement beyond this one web site. Verifiability would mean verifying that they <i>do</i>, and that hasn't been demonstrated. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 03:24, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And they also discuss the concept. Your skepticism should be quelled by the Guardian article at least, but whatever works for you. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 03:27, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think anyone is debating the fact that someone could, in theory, be conservative and punk. No one is denying the fact that this has been mentioned in the news, no doubt much moreso since this website launched. But the fact remains that this doesn't necessarily lend legitimacy to this as a social movement, and certainly not as a subculture of punk. Like I said, I'd nominate for deletion "Liberal Punk" just as quickly, even though liberal punks are apparently omnipresent - because "Liberal Punk" isn't a term that means anything much more than the two words that make it up, and we've got articles for both of those words already.<a href="../../../1/4/9/User%7E149.43.x.x.html" title="User:149.43.x.x">149.43.x.x</a> 03:43, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reliable sources disagree with you. And if there were similar sources and coverage for "liberal punk," I'd oppose you the same way. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 03:45, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Show me where a reliable source explains, in socio-cultural terms, how Conservative Punk is anything more than a group of punks who are conservative. Look at <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_Voter_3496.html" title="Punk Voter">Punk Voter</a> - can we expand that to be a page long diatribe about how the Punk Voter subculture of punk is a rallying point for all liberal punks, and then enumerate some stereotypical set of liberal/punk beliefs? There's no such evidence my hypothetical case or in this situation, and thus "Conservative Punk" is in no way a subculture of punk. The only reason the phrase "Conservative Punk" gets so much press is because it's the name of the site! If Punk Voter were called Liberal Punk, you would be flat out wrong. In addition, show me where this "movement" actually connects conservative punks with the Conservative Punk website, and not the other way around. That is, if this is some social movement, you'll have to demonstrate that the website sprung from it, and not vice-versa. As I see it, there's no evidence for that, and so this amounts to nothing more than a website started by some punks to do their own thing. And that's fine, and it may merit an article as such, but there's absolutely no evidence to support the claims of nearly all of what's in this article right now. <a href="../../../1/4/9/User%7E149.43.x.x.html" title="User:149.43.x.x">149.43.x.x</a> 03:57, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Suggestion: If we're going to keep talking past each other, perhaps you'd like me to do a re-write of the article, taking out everything that's unsubstantiated, original research, or whatever. I'm sure that's a reasonable alternative to deletion (except that many suggested an article like that wasn't worth having - but that's not the issue at hand), if you insist that this website itself has encyclopedic merit.<a href="../../../1/4/9/User%7E149.43.x.x.html" title="User:149.43.x.x">149.43.x.x</a> 04:02, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Maybe the concept and the site are intertwined. My take, reading the Guardian and MSNBC pieces, is no. If you disagree, so what? If the article needs cleanup, then clean it up. A POV dispute that you seem to have about the concept isn't something you take to AfD. A rewrite is certainly worthwhile for a notable article and concept such as this. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 04:04, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I really appreciate your effort here. I certainly think we're at least stemming off the problems. It seems that the consensus now is to keep this, because it's a notable site - which is odd since last time it was up for deletion, people said it was decidedly not not worth keeping in that respect. Regardless, I'll try to clean up the language to be more accurate in a socio-cultural context, since there is no hard evidence in that direction. I'm surprised so many people want to keep it as an article about the website, but if that's what this article becomes, then that seems reasonable - I just assumed that the sentiment opposing a artcile like that from the last AfD discussion would have carried over. Thanks though, I appreciate the input.<a href="../../../1/4/9/User%7E149.43.x.x.html" title="User:149.43.x.x">149.43.x.x</a> 20:05, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
