Hence the list of unique results will always contain less than 1000 results regardless of how many webpages actually matched the search terms.

<li><b>Delete</b> Ignoring that the article is in a current state of disrepair, the question is: is this topic notable enough to be deserving of an article? Based on anything there is to be found (admitting that I failed to open most websites returned as very few seemed to be informative in the desired way), I would say that there is no distinguishing characteristic here to make Nikki worthy of an article, and a lack of reliable sources from which to construct an article. Combine this with a fuzziness as to whether or not appropriate WP guidelines (e.g., <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>) are met and I can't find any good reason to keep this.

It establishes whether or not the <b>subject</b> of the article is important enough. And it may address the reliability of the <b>source</b> which is being used to verify the content we allow in the article. Basically anything said in the article must also be stated by a reliable source and notability is <b>one</b> possible way of determining that reliability. It does not matter here if the actress is very notable by the number of times Google is requested to supply information. Regardless of whether or not that determines a number of actual people, if there isn't anything published by a reliable <b>source</b> about the actress, then the information about her is simply unreliable. In this specific case, I maintain that the web site that is being used to source the information about the actress is an unreliable source of information for two specific reasons. The web site itself hasn't any notability and it is self serving financially to be providing any data about whom it has hired. Therefore if the <b>subject</b> of the article is the actress then we haven't any reliable source. Also per verifiability that source is the only source available. The ambiguity of the matter itself serves to show that regardless of how many hits or ratings are performed, nobody can determine if it is the site or the actress that is being counted. Certainly one might say here, the <b>people</b> are supplying <b>hits</b> for both together. But if that is the case, then there is no source for the article at all. And in the final analysis, the actress is not quotable as a <b>source</b> for herself, or for the site. Logically and reasonably here, then, notability is key in understanding the basis for deletion. Hope you had a cup of coffee before you decided to read all of that. Thanks Eagle_101!</li>

When you can tell me what her name is and prove it by notable cited resources, then at least we will have a single fact. This is also not about a web site. This is about ambiguity as well as policy. Here is the exact reason that the article was nominated: Information on Wikipedia must be reliable. Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources. Articles may not contain any previously unpublished data. The web page itself must therefore be a reliable source. If you cannot argue against that, then you have missed the point. This is, after all, an encyclopedia. Thanks!</li>
<li>Here's my argument, why does Tiffany Teen have such a long article. Why is she notable? Its because she was immensely popular, just like Nikki.Letsgomets1212 11:49, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Whether or not some other non-related article is or is not notable is clearly a different matter. If you believe however, as you point out, that there is doubt to that other person's notability, then per the written policy at this time you <b>should</b> nominate that article for deletion on the same grounds. You mention the reason for the answer to notability as "immensely popular". The question then becomes simple. Is there a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reptutible source</a> that states this? Because if we here use Google and Alexa, then we are ourselves in this discussion committing acts of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<li>You people have no lives. Who cares?! She is obviously popular. Alexa and Google are not original research, they are places that show a site is popular based on ranking. What source could I find? So what your telling me is if i can find a source that states she popular, that would be credible? I don't think so. This website is an encyclopedia. It is meant to give people information on as many topics as possible. Are you going to lose sleep knowing that ONE article is on Wikipedia that you believe shouldn't be? Instead of deleting the article, someone with a knowledge of her should come in and write something decent. Let's face it, there is no credible source that can tell you if someone is popular or not. In my opinion, Alexa is a great resource for popularity. The #3,025 website in the world is not to shabby for a internet NN model, hmmm, maybe she is notable? Besides, there are few articles on here for teen models, a few notable ones should be kept.-Letsgomets1212 15:24, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I didn't think that nominating this article for cleanup would lead to this, but the article contains no credible or relevent information. As it stands, there are a lot of other small time porn sites like this I could create articles for, but won't as they are simply not notable enough. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperwad_c8b9.html" title="User:Superwad">Superwad</a> 05:42, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
