<p>Carlet is just one of a group of people within the organization that have garnered press and this is confined to the past few years. If you were to look at news articles you see other names representing the unions.<a href="../../../o/s/a/User%7EOsakadan_923c.html" title="User:Osakadan">Osakadan</a> 23:48, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>With creating the annual March in March in Tokyo in 2004, he has come to be known as a pioneer in the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> and migrant workers' rights movement in East Asia</i> This line is a total exageration and should be deleted if not the whole article. Pioneer? There are numerous other foreigners and Japanese who have been working in this field for decades longer than Carlet. And the March in March is considered a joke by many, including union members as it belittles the fact that many Japanese workers face the same labour problems that Carlet holds up as being discriminatory.<a href="../../../o/s/a/User%7EOsakadan_923c.html" title="User:Osakadan">Osakadan</a> 23:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't particularly care either way if the artcile is deleted or not, But I think having articles on people have appeared in the news a handful of times is ridiculous, especially when the article says nothing of importance. I also wouldn't delete an article on the basis of a few opinions and would hope it waits until more people have weighed in with an opinion.<a href="../../../o/s/a/User%7EOsakadan_923c.html" title="User:Osakadan">Osakadan</a> 04:46, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> The very arguments for deletion admit that he is well-known.

<p><b>comment</b> I have no views on the notability of this article - if it was reworked I would say <b>KEEP</b>. It is important to note that a check of the posting history of the nominator of this AfD, Sparkzilla, shows that this user and editors on the NUGW (in which Louis Carlet is intimately involved) page have been in conflict for some time. Sparkzilla introduced the criticism section on that page linking to Metropolis magazine. It should be noted that a conflict of interest arises, due to Sparkzilla's intimate involvement with Metropolis ( a crisscross publication). A RfC, or RfA or simpler remedy, by interested parties, will show Sparkzilla's past IP's to fall within that of the IP block assigned to crisscross.com by apnic. It would suggest that this AfD is not motivated by a genuine desire to improve Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>Considering the bias of the person who called for the deletion, it may not be warranted. The problem is though, much of the article is unverifiable, even if true. <b>Union official</b> - can be verfired through newspaper records and public records in Japan. <b>one of just a few paid migrant workers in Asia who is also a migrant worker activist</b> doubt this could be verified. <b>in 1995 organized a demonstration march in Manhattan</b> Again I wonder if this can be verified. If all the unverifiable material is left, I wonder if there is enough left to support an article.<a href="../../../o/s/a/User%7EOsakadan_923c.html" title="User:Osakadan">Osakadan</a> 08:36, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To suggest hat somehow <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_%28English_magazine_in_Japan%29_d0d5.html" title="Metropolis (English magazine in Japan)">Metropolis</a> is biased against the union because of one article written in a history of hundreds is nonsense. In fact, I am sure there are several pro-union articles in Metropolis if someone was bothered enough to find them. Please ignore the troll who psoted about COI. Check his posting history <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_221.253.85.230_792f.html" title="Special:Contributions/221.253.85.230">Special:Contributions/221.253.85.230</a> and you will see that he is a sad person who only posts negative information about Metropolis.</dd>

<dd>FYI <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> says: The existence of conflicts of interest does not mean that assume good faith is forgotten. Quite the opposite. Remember the basic rule: <b>discuss the article, not the editor.</b> Nothing against Mr Carlet, but he is not notable, the claims are not verifiable, therefore the article does not warrant an entry in Wikipedia.<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkzilla_f5f3.html" title="User:Sparkzilla">Sparkzilla</a> 09:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The demonstration in Manhattan is verifiable through the August 1995 edition of OCS News, a Japanese newspaper published in the US. An entire article was devoted to him on page 3 of a recent Mainichi Shimbun article. Also whether or not the annual March in March that he spearheaded is a "joke" or not is irrelevant to its relevance in the foreign labor movement today in Japan. It is the only march in Japan dedicated to multinational labor solidarity and march leaders, including Carlet, have repeatedly made clear that Japanese workers face many of the same job problems as foreigners. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 219.37.32.92 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.37.32.92_b3f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.37.32.92">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>Korean and South Americam immigrats outfar western immigrants greatly. And as many of these work in industries such as motor cars (Brazilians etc). The claim to be the largest union of immigrations may well be false. While the union has quite a lot of members it is relatively small in members in the foreigners division.<a href="../../../o/s/a/User%7EOsakadan_923c.html" title="User:Osakadan">Osakadan</a> 14:02, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
