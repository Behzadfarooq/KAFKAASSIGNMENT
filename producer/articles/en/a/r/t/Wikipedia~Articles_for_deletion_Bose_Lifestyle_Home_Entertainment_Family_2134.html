<p>This is basically an ad. I can see an article on "home theater" and one on Bose itself, but why cover a particular company's home theater products?

<p>A product or service is notable if it meets <i>any</i> of the following criteria:<br />
1) The product or service has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations <i>except</i> for the following:
<ul>
<li>Media re-prints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about its products or services, and advertising for the product or service. Newspaper stories that do not credit a reporter or a news service and simply present company news in an uncritical or positive way may be treated as press releases unless there is evidence to the contrary.</li>
<li>Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as simple price listings in product catalogues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are many references, here is a very list...

<li>Are you arguing that every product which is reviewed by places like CNET should get an article? They review thousands of products. I think it is arguable that a particular product should be covered only if it is particularly iconic and unique - the iPod, for instance - and certain Bose products might qualify. This, on the other hand, is just a line of home theater setups, of which there are many. Is this stuff so unique and different that it needs an article? And yes, you are right, there is lots of "Applecruft", and some of it should be removed - not all Apple products are notable. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well no, if that was the only place you might have a point, but if you were to check out <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=PVh&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=bose+lifestyle+review&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=PVh&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=bose+lifestyle+review&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">google "bose lifestyle review"</a> you will see that there are 740,000 pages on the net that meet this criteria.

Does that need an article? This is a commercial product, there are going to be reviews out there. Why makes this particularly unique that one can't simply cover it in a line or two in the Bose article?

<li><b>Delete</b> having a PR department to generate product reviews does not make a product notable. Where is the press stating that this product had a cultural impact such as Ipod?-<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsHyde_99ac.html" title="User:MsHyde">MsHyde</a> 17:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So only the iPod and the walkman should be listed, since it had a "cultural impact"? That is not the official stance from wikipedia where it states that, if it is "<i>the subject of multiple non-trivial, reliable published works whose source is independent of the organization itself, and fulfills the verifiability guidelines, then it is considered notable.</i>" -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 20:47, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The notability guidelines are <i>guidelines</i>, not rules, and the "multiple non-trivial, reliable published works" part in particular should, I feel, frequently be ignored. It works best as a minimal requirement. I'm sure I can find multiple independent and reliable reviews of quite literally <i>thousands</i> of products. We have to use our common sense here. I think the rough criteria should involve the number of people this product impacts, the uniqueness of the product, the cultural impact, and such. I would be far more impressed with a news article about how these Bose products have changed people's lives. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 21:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that you can even say that an iPod did that. Going with your criteria I believe that only medical or human assisting technology's could qualify. Its not like a iPod could cause someone to breath like an Iron lung, or an entertainment system allowed someone to walk again! Notability is why we have <a href="../../../h/p/_/HP_LaserJet_2400_6911.html" title="HP LaserJet 2400">HP LaserJet 2400</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_n_Series_47f0.html" title="Dell n Series">Dell n Series</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_Inspiron_fa02.html" title="Dell Inspiron">Dell Inspiron</a>, <a href="../../../h/p/_/HP_series_80_1a2e.html" title="HP series 80">HP series 80</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macromedia_JRun_8a1d.html" title="Macromedia JRun">Macromedia JRun</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_HDR-FX7_716d.html" title="Sony HDR-FX7">Sony HDR-FX7</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe_Creative_Suite_039b.html" title="Adobe Creative Suite">Adobe Creative Suite</a> etc, etc... and this was only after a quick search!

<ul>
<li>I completely agree with you that most of those should not have Wikipedia articles. The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_n_Series_47f0.html" title="Dell n Series">Dell n Series</a> might be notable due to not shipping with Windows. I feel quite certain that the iPod could pass the test I suggested; there have been any number of articles on its social, cultural, and business impact. I also think certain products could pass just due to the ubiquity of their advertising; the Bose "Wave" for instance - what human being in the US has NOT seen one of their magazine ads? OK, some haven't, but a minority, I'm sure... --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 09:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well my point was that they shouldn't be deleted, but thats besides the case. I also think that the Wave systems should have an article but how can they pass with your criteria of life changing products? Now the main reason for this article is to make sure that the official Bose company page is not too large. Because if this was removed they would have to be placed in the main page and just clutter it up. To alleviate this an article was made. This is not an uncommon practice and due to the several 100's of thousands of reviews available on the net I don't think this is too uncalled for. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 09:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't say that a product needed to be life-changing to have an article, I said I would be more impressed with that sort of thing than with reviews. I also disagree that this would add too much content to the Bose article, primarily because I don't see any actual useful content. What should be kept? The pricing? The information about what module does what? I can boil this down to one sentence: <i>Bose also sells home theatre systems which use their ADAPTiQ audio calibration system.</i> That's it, you're done. That's all the encyclopedaic content I see here. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:59, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
