<p>I am also nominating the following related pages because they are also junior league hockey players for the <a href="../../../s/a/g/Saginaw_Spirit_eb91.html" title="Saginaw Spirit">Saginaw Spirit</a> that do not meet the criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I looked at their roster and only tagged the ones that have not been drafted by the NHL, (although some of the others may not be notable as well, I will not tag them for this discussion):</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> For whatever this is worth, the creator and main editor of the articles keeps removing the afd tags for all of them, and I have had to restore all the tags twice now. I also would hope someone can look at the rest of the roster that I have not put up for deletion, as other nn players could be there. Also look for the team <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Whalers_bda1.html" title="Plymouth Whalers">Plymouth Whalers</a> for similar cases. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_fanta_fe6f.html" title="User:Tony fanta">Tony fanta</a> 02:35, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The user/creator of articles, <a href="../../../k/i/v/User%7EKivpit_58f3.html" title="User:Kivpit">Kivpit</a>, is not understanding about the afd process, he put an insult to me saying "I aughta delete your shit... see how you'd like it...". The user has tried to contact the Wikiproject for Ice Hockey, trying to stop the deletion of the articles for such reasons as "no one had a problem with them before" and "I worked really hard on these articles". That doesn't matter, it's either notable or it's not. And I have found numerous other nn junior/minor league players with some browsing, so more should go for deletion based on how this discussion goes. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_fanta_fe6f.html" title="User:Tony fanta">Tony fanta</a> 02:57, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s><b>Delete all</b>, sadly.</s><b>Comment</b> I do not know much about <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Hockey_League_f160.html" title="Ontario Hockey League">OHL</a> players, but one thing I would suggest if you look up other articles for future AfDs that you see if any of these players have participated in an event like the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Junior_Ice_Hockey_Championships_7a0e.html" title="World Junior Ice Hockey Championships">World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a>, or were first round picks in the <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_Entry_Draft_8e00.html" title="NHL Entry Draft">NHL Entry Draft</a>. Those would be two such cases where I think a junior player would automatically qualify as notable. In the case of his removing the AfD notices, I am going to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and believe that is simply the result of his not understanding how the AfD proccess works, or <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> criteria.</p>
<p>Also, since this user has put some work into these articles, and since players on major-junior rosters may have short term notability, especially in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, would there be an objection to having these articles <b>merged</b> into something like Saginaw Spirit roster? <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 06:00, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The more I think about it, the more I think I prefer a merge into a single article for a case like this. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 06:12, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Good idea, but I can't put myself behind it. The roster on the team's page should be sufficient for such a listing, considering the notability involved here. I could have added more to this afd, but I just wanted those that did not appear to have been drafted by an NHL team for this point. If the user spent a lot of time on these articles, I am sorry, but that's not an excuse to hang on to these. It's either notable or it's not. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_fanta_fe6f.html" title="User:Tony fanta">Tony fanta</a> 08:01, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all</b> per nom. I'm one of the Hockey Wikiproject regulars, and I don't care as it is for how loose WP:BIO is with respect to professional athletes. Nom's done a good job in excluding NHL draftees, who at least have a shot at notability. Those players who are left are scrubs who will never, ever play professionally and fail notability even at the major junior level. Furthermore, much as I empathize with the editor's work, we've AfDed far more intricate articles than these, because they fail consensus standards in one fashion or another. It's incumbent on new editors to learn what's acceptable and ask before editing. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 06:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
