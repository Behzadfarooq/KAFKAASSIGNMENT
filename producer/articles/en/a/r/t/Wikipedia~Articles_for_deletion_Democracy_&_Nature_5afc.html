<li><b>Comment</b> I can see how you would come to that conclusion, but I don't feel it's the case. I don't have a dog in this fight: I'm just trying to insure the integrity of Wikipedia. This article came to my attention while I was following RfPP after the Freemasonry edit war, and I was quickly convinced that if the editorial board (all of whom post from IPs, not named accounts) was going to insist on having the article exactly the way they wanted, then it qualified as Vanity. You can do the same external research I did: a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22democracy+%26+nature%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22democracy+%26+nature%22" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> on the title shows that most of the top references appear to be just references to the journal's existance, or reprints of articles. A <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Democracy+%26+Nature%22" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Democracy+%26+Nature%22" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar</a> search shows that very few of the articles are cited more than once or twice.--<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarekOfVulcan_fb73.html" title="User:SarekOfVulcan">SarekOfVulcan</a> 07:36, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> First, it is the Editorial Board itself which formally requested the deletion of the page when it became clear that Wikipedia could not protect our page from vandalism. But to characterise the page of the journal as a ‘vanity page, not obviously notable’ is only revealing –to say the least--of the philistinism of the author of this comment. D&amp;N was an antisystemic Left journal and citations from other journals are bound to be few and sparse, as it is clear that the mainstream journals (as well as those of the reformist Left) which dominate the field do not bother to deal with anticapitalist journals, particularly today. Had he checked citations made with respect to other serious antisystemic theoretical journals like Anarchist Studies, for example, he would have found even fewer of them! Second, serious research on the significance of a journal obviously cannot be carried out through a Google search, which refers exclusively to electronic citations. Had your ‘researcher’ checked with the authentic Alternative Press Index (only in print form!) he would have seen dozens of citations of abstract reprints from Democracy &amp; Nature. Third, it is an obvious lie that the members of the Editorial Board insisted “on having the article exactly the way they wanted”. In fact, even though it was apparent that we faced a systematic attack by a single disgruntled ex-member of the journal we took on board several of the suggested changes, but clearly we could not accept a blatant distortion of historical facts that he insisted on imposing upon us for his own personal reasons, as a reading of the exchanges in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Democracy_%26_Nature" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Democracy_%26_Nature" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Democracy_%26_Nature</a> makes abundantly clear.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Journals of this type are inherently notable. No one "owns" a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I dispute that journals of <i>any</i> type are <i>inherently</i> notable - many of them have pitifully small circulation, no academic credibility and they are often short-lived; many of them are vehicles for vanity, either of the editor or the contributors. Whether that is the case with this one I have yet to determine. It certainly looks as if this one may well be notable. Also, while the nomination might be in good faith there's plenty of evidence of bad faith in the edit history, so it might be hard to get to the objective truth. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 13:28, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A Google Scholar search shows 159 citations, of which 133 are within the journal itself. In the absence of any information on subscriber base, and given that the magazine is defunct, and given the long-running dispute re inclusion or non inclusion of text re the history of the journal, I'd say that the article is substantially unverifiable, and that evidence of notability is absent. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 14:09, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The fact that you cite University of Bath rather than, say, Oxford or Cambridge, is interesting (Library of Congress is famously promiscuous in its buying).

<p>I believe that the page should be kept as it is at the moment (with no separate sections for two members of the IAB) because information about a journal of such a scope is of an obvious encyclopaedic value. We should not permit a "disagreement" of a whole group of people with a single person (who hardly used arguments), to influence our judgement. D&amp;N was (and is, in its newest digital form and name) one of the last independent anti-systemic journals. We cannot base our opinion about it in google search, or even on the number of subscribers for that matter, but on the quantity and quality of the condributions and the significance of the contributors themselves!!! And since when an encyclopedia must select its entries on the basis of popularity? <s><a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimitri_f139.html" title="User:Dimitri">User:Dimitri</a> 18:57, 18 November 2005</s><small>This comment and vote were added by anonymous User:212.205.76.134</small></p>

<li><b>weak keep</b> I don't buy that this journal is NN. Other reasons to delete include that it's the easy way to end an edit war between one or more apparent kooks, whereas keeping will consume admin time and effort for the forseeable future. Deletion for this reason doesn't sit well with me, nor do the hints of editorial board expectations of maintaining control over the content of article.

<li><b>strong keep</b> It is more than obvious that this journal is trully important. It is really depressive to characterize the people behind it as "kooks", when the vast majority side explain again and again its significant reasons of arguing.

<li>More than obvious? That it is <i>truly important</i>? Excellent, then there should be absolutely no trouble whatsoever in citing references to support that claim: academic journals for the arts, for example, enthusiastically discussing the magazine and its importance to literary culture.

<li>Half a dozen or so? Are you interested in quantity over quality? It is obvious that the journal is important because of the quality its anti-systemic analysis. Whereas the reformist quantitative Left takes the existing SYSTEM of the internationalzed market economy for granted and would like to improve its functioning by putting a smiley or green face on it. The argument here is whether to keep the D&amp;N page as the EB has written. It is obvious that the comments to keep are emphatically and decisively in favor of the EB. So why keep this page up for now approaching a week? <s>user:john 20:45, 22 November 2005</s><small>This comment left by anonymous user:67.84.97.153</small></li>

<li>See, it's like this. The world is full of small literay (and other) journals. Some are significant, others are not. Thus far, the proof of this journal's notability has been, to my reading, confined to arm-waving and argument by assertion, so I asked for some externally verifiable evidence in the form of discussions in recognised authorities which themselves recognise the merit of this journal. So, to be absolutely clear, I am quite happy to believe that this might have been a noteworthy journal, but as yet no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable evidence</a> has been cited to prove it.

<li><b>Comment</b>*It is clear that Just zis Guy, you know? has never seen in his life an antisystemic Left theoretical journal, otherwise he would not have asked for some “externally verifiable evidence in the form of discussions in recognised authorities”! Can he describe for our benefit which are these “recognised authrorities”, as fas as journals of the antisystemic Left is concerned? We referred him to the authoritative Index of Aleternative Press but did not pay any attention to it. Similarly, the fact that some of the most significant university libraries in the world are subsuscribers to the journal is of non importance to him. Furthermore, had he gone through the dozens of references in Google (which of course give only a glimpse of the real significance of the journal as they mention only electronic references) he would have discovered that it is a distortion of the truth what was mentioned above by SarekOfVulcan that “most of the top references appear to be just references to the journal's existance”. In fact, many refer to specific articles used by other scholars et al. This is why the journal has received and published so many contributions by important theorists in the Left, who would never have submitted an article to an obscure journal. I am also sure that most other journals hosted by Wikipedia do not satisfy any of the above criteria, not to mention his own criteria. If this is not a biased attitude, I wonder what the definition of bias is…(Member of the Editorial Board)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> If the administrators have done their homework they would conclude that D&amp;N is notable. Sherlock Hemlock of Vulcan, your claim above that because one address has a very similar DNS address as some other address allows you to doubt the existence of Tommy and by inference the two addresses are one and the same, is illogical. Sherlock Hemlock of Vulcan your ruminations are irrational and since, according to your presupposition that Vulcans can only be rational, your identity is placed into question. Your claim that similarity is identical is senseless.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should know that “identical” twins are not truly identical, even though they are cloned from the same fertilized egg. Next, since there are no things as aliens (Vulcans) you must be something other. So to identify your self with something that does not exist is a real misunderstanding of your self. Your ego ideal (Sarek) is unreal—-one of wholeness and total rationality. Your image is based on a misunderstanding and therefore, you cannot fit into an ever changing (rational-irrational) world. Identity exists only in the ideal world of mathematics, everything else is difference. Your fallacy consists of, if A is identical with B, then every property that A has B has and vice versa, but you state that A and B are very similar, and similarities are not identical, so you make a false assertion: I doubt Tommy is Tommy, or the person who signed Tommy is not Tommy. The seeming identity of the two addresses has frozen your mind. Loosen up so that you can become more genuine. <s>user:john5:32 (thankstaking day in america) 24 November 2005</s><small>This comment and vote left by anonymous User:67.84.97.153</small></p>

<li>' ' ' keep ' ' 'In researching the D&amp;N journal one can find ways to change society. D&amp;N explores beyond all leftist ideologies which are in reality reformist and not revolutionary .In reading the responses and comments I have come to believe that an individual that hides in a fantasy vulcan world is parallel with the capitalist system that also provides society with myths and irrational concepts that distract societies from reality as the present situation in vulcan sarek's life proves.Thus Sarek is unable to differentiate reality from fantasy. This is why He doubts I am Me. In reality I know I am me. Sarek lives through a fantasy world to justify his exsistence.</li>

<dd>Comment. My claim that you may have never seen an antisystemic theoretical journal before was corroborated by the fact that you asked for “externally verifiable evidence in the form of discussions in recognised authorities”. THis was not therefore a personal attack but a very reasonable assumption and as such was read by any unbiased user. Everyone who has read a similar antisystemic journal in the past is aware of the fact that there are no independently recognised authorities for this type of journal and the only verification could come from the sources I mentioned, which once again, you ignored!(Member of the Editorial Board)

<li><b>Comment</b> This distortion of facts is really shameful. First, the reason that we objected the vandalism of a disgruntled ex member of the journal had nothing to do with the reference to Bookchin’s letter of resignation. As it was repeatedly stressed by members of the Editorial Board and the founder of D&amp;N himself (see D&amp;N discussion page), the reason we objected to this vandalism was that it added separate sections just for two members of the Advisory Board (Bookchin and Castoriadis) on the basis of the blatantly false assertion that “the main theoretical influences of the journal" were the work of these two writers. This, despite the fact that their articles and those of their supporters constituted only 12 percent of the total contributions published and that the programmatic aims of the journal, published in each issue, were clearly differentiated from their work! Second, Bookchin’s attitude was condemned by the entire Editorial Board <a href="http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol3/editorial_response.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol3/editorial_response.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, although it was not particularly surprising to us given that, in the past, he had repeatedly expressed his discontent to the Editorial Board for the fact that the Advisory Board included the names of other people (e.g. Chomsky) with whom he had political disagreements . It is clear that SarekOfVulcan uses here the well known old trick of relying on the fact that very few pople will bother to read the relevant exchanges before they draw their conclusions!(Member of the Editorial Board)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> According to Wikipedia guidlines there is a limit of five (5) days within which a decision has to be taken on an article for deletion. Despite the fact that the proposal for deletion was made on November 18, 2005 (today is the 26th of November) no decision has yet been made. I wonder whether this is due to the fact that two administrators, who are obviously determined (for reasons known only to them) to have the page deleted have not yet managed to get a simple majority in favor of deletion. In fact, the consensus as expressed by the vast majority of users and administrators who took part in the discussion, voted in favor of keeping the page and only one other administrator supported the above mentioned administrators. This, even when all the "anonymous users" voted to "keep" were arbitrarily deleted with the insulting description used by one of the administrators as "dodgy sigs"--just because of their concern that new users did not read the Wikipedia guidelines about registration and/or get a user name!

The deletion policy says that you can't delete it <i>faster</i> than 5 days, and after that, it's moved to a holding area until an admin has time to act on it.

<p>• As usual, [SarekOfVulcan] is economical with the truth. He forgot to mention for instance that I removed my “personal attack on him” just a couple of minutes after it was published by an obvious error of mine and that my comment followed his own personal attack on me when he accused me for bad faith—a comment that he never removed.

<li><b>Comment</b> When a proposal was made to delete the Parecon page on 20 July 2005, a decision was made by 28 July to keep it! In the Democracy and Nature case, the overwhelming majority of administrators, users, and anonymous have voted to keep it. Still, despite the fact that the proposal for the deletion of Democracy and Nature was made on 18 November, 10 days later the administrators have not yet decided anything on that, although the guidelines clearly state, "AfD is where Wikipedians decide whether problematic articles be deleted or kept. Items sent here usually wait five days or so while debates take place on whether the article should be deleted or not...the page is then kept, deleted etc." By the way, in the Parecon case the AfD was made by an anonymous user, whereas an administrator made the AfD in the Democracy and Nature case.
