<li><b>Delete</b> as unverifiable as per JJay. The article claims "The studio lot was built in the 1920's and was one of the first active film studios. It had a diffrent name them but the lot was the site of some of America's most treasured early films. After the great depression, the studio closed." If the studios had a different name when it was supposedly most notable, that is the name we should use if it is verifiable. Further, the article does not state any films, actors or directors associated with the studio at that time so it would very hard to confirm in any case. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:08, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, unverifiable. Ebay items should Google. Also, even 1920s studios have films in the IMDB. The fact it doesn't Google tells me it doesn't exist.

<li><b>Delete</b> extremely wierd hoax article. Since much of the article deals with supposed Cherry Cola Studio shirts, and even specifically states that the shirts are valuable, this article may exist to support a collectables scam of some sort. Note also that a movie studio being called "Cherry Cola" in the 20s simply doesn't ring true. Cherry Coke is from the mid-80s, and studios from that era simply weren't named things like that. Though I'd genuinely like to know what the deal behind this article is, it's zero-Google level shows it's a hoax as written, so it must go. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 18:15, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm a huge film buff and I've never heard of this place, plus I agree it is unverifiable, and lack of reference in the IMDb is the key here. I agree that the Google Test is not the be all and end all for either proving notability or existence, but odds are someone would have posted <i>something</i> about this place, considering the article claims it was active in the 1990s. Also, unless the Coca-Cola Company owns it, odds are such a place wouldn't be allowed to have the name "Cherry Cola" anyway since that's a registered trademark for Coke. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:17, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>,I can put an end to this discussion. This article is blatenly wrong. We were alerted that this type of thing may happen. Flyers have been showing up at local universities claiming to have "Origional Cherry Cola Studios Clothing" and they they will be avliable online. They aslo tell the same basic story as the article. A google brought us here. I sm co-owner of Cherry Cola Studios. (yes Virginia, there is a Cherry Cola Studios) Let me set this article straight. First - we dont make films and never have, Our business is to rent out high end video equipment mostly to local film students. We are a small A/V supply company, We do not create sets nor do we have uniforms and we do not provide crews of any kind. The building we are in was built in the late 1970's at the earliest and was a warehouse before we moved in. As far as we know, *no* films have ever been shot here. Also, we do not have a "gift shop" nor do we give tours They would be very short (Here is the office, here is the storage room, thanks for comming) We do not make clothes nor sell them and never have. Nor do we intend to. Also, Ebay has been notified that this most likely is some attempt to gather value for some worthless t-shirts by some college kid. We have not been in business since 1980 or whatever it said. We have been around just over three years. Please delete this article as it is not even *remoetly* acurate nor was it created or authorized by us. If you see an offer for cherry cola clothing on an auction site, please report it to the auction company. I hope this clears things up. BTW Skidoo... The Term "Cherry Cola" is not a trademark of Coke, but you were prob thinking of their trademark on "Cherry Coke" We apoligize for the inconvienence and we already have a lead on who the t-shirt pusher is. This article should be deleted without question. Thank you. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECman_1d2a.html" title="User:Cman">Cman</a> 24:22, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
