<p>Is this notable enough to be on Wikipedia? I think it can be interesting for people involved in this art scene themselves - so I wouldn't want to remove the article from the face of the internet - but I doubt it is interesting for Wikipedia users, so maybe there is a better place than Wikipedia for it?

<p>Ok, now there's already an edit conflict with the first vote, but there are more similar articles I was going to add (more detailed than the first, but same topic and level of interest, I believe..) --Ignavus 00:14, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> once again I must remind folks the standard for keeping is VERIFIABILTY, not NOTABILITY. Users who've been here a whopping 11 edits (That would be you Ignavus) should learn the policies to wikipedia before putting stuff up for deletion. This is yet another example of a new user with complete ignorance of policy listing something he's never heard of for deletion. "I've never heard of it, so it should be deleted" is not the way wikipedia works. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 15:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom and above. As <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> explains, non-notablity, while not a core policy like verifiability (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), it is the basis for a number of guidelines for article inclusion which represent consensus opinions on Wikipedia (such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>), and can be arguably associated with official policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> also explains that notablity is a controversial issue, but is frequently used as arguments for afd. Ignavus is perfectly justified to nominated these articles for deletion. While every Wikipedia user should take time to read up on policies and guidelines, its totally unnecessary and unjustified for ALIKIVAR to scold a new user like that - and on the basis of ALIKIVAR's own opinionated reading of Wikipedia guidelines as well. I would suggest that ALKIVAR read <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:11, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Alkivar. And since the "vote below applies to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trunk.html" title="Trunk">Trunk</a> only," why are we talking about <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trank.html" title="Trank">Trank</a>? If you want an article to be deleted, you might want to proofread your request (yes, I'm aware that typos happen). I'd also like to point out, as others are so fond of saying, AfD is not a vote. Also, if you'd like to nominate the other articles you've listed, you should do so. As of now, the AfD template for them links to this AfD; they're separate articles, they deserve separate discussions (which will likely mirror this and every other AfD discussion). There's probably a policy on mass nominations, but I'm pretty sure this isn't how it works (please, anyone, correct me if I'm wrong). --<a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyleslong_0d1d.html" title="User:Myleslong">Myles Long</a> 00:13, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>merge</b> per Dhartung. If I'm reading this correctly, this is a small spinoff group that eventually returned to the fold of it's parent group. There are no claims of notability. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 17:17, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - I believed it to be a bad joke by somebody. FYI, there was a time before the internet and before Windows 95 and up. People used <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modem.html" title="Modem">Modems</a> not to call an ISP to connect to a NET, but somebody elses Computer that was in most cases a private computer up for 24 hours on a designated telefon line just for the computer. That person had a software running called <a href="../../../b/b/s/BBS_Software_e30b.html" title="BBS Software">BBS Software</a> that accepted incoming phone calls and provided features like Messaging (just like <a href="../../../e/m/a/Email.html" title="Email">Email</a>) and <a href="../../../u/p/l/Upload.html" title="Upload">Upload</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/w/Download.html" title="Download">Download</a> of files. Those "things" were called <a href="../../../b/b/s/BBS_e769.html" title="BBS">BBS</a> which stands for Bulletin Board System and the PC Versions usually operated under <a href="../../../m/s/_/MS_DOS_4d7b.html" title="MS DOS">MS DOS</a> which was Text Based and fairly uggly. Thanks to <a href="../../../a/n/s/ANSI_d403.html" title="ANSI">ANSI</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/s/ANSI_art_b056.html" title="ANSI art">ANSI art</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_art_8901.html" title="ASCII art">ASCII art</a> got BBS's a much better look and touch of individuality. The Guys that did those weird type of Art (in the opinion of some folks of the after-MS DOS -&gt; Windoof Generation) usually formed Art Groups (like the Guys that did Demos (<a href="../../../d/e/m/Demo_scene.html" title="Demo scene">Demo scene</a>) and the ones that removed copy protections from games and applications (<a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez_scene.html" title="Warez scene">Warez scene</a>) later the guys that ripped MP3's and Movies, something everybody should be familar with, because they are still around. Btw. ASCII and ANSI Art is also still around. There are a lot of folks out there that have vivid memories about ANSI and ASCII art, but might not remember the groups and artists that made them, but there are also still a lot of guys out there that remember very well and appreciate the fact that Information can be found about it and that it is not all forgotten. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 05:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remorse.html" title="Remorse">Remorse</a> (for Trank only), at least unless someone writes a longer article about it. I'm a bit confused by this "multi-voting", as the deletion links in those articles you listed link here. I can't really say anything about Trank or Mistigris, but I think it's totally absurd that you're suggesting the removal of the articles about SAC, Remorse and ACiD. These groups are very notable considering the history of digital art. DiamonDie 07:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not again... <b>speedy keep</b>. Of course this part of computer history is noteworthy. --<a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvatar-en_77ca.html" title="User:Avatar-en">Avatar-en</a> 07:49, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, per Alkivar. <a href="../../../b/b/x/User%7EBbx_da7b.html" title="User:Bbx">bbx</a> 08:50, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These are notable computer graphics organizations which pre-date the modern internet, worthwhile for coverage on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 08:51, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Initially, when I created the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_artscene_groups.html" title="Minor artscene groups">minor artscene groups</a> article, I included Trank ASCII. That was until I discovered someone had already created a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trank.html" title="Trank">Trank</a> article. It is notable by being closely related to ascii scene legends <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remorse_ASCII_75f6.html" title="Remorse ASCII">Remorse ASCII</a>. I could live with the Trank article being merged into the Remorse article, but honestly, adding the Afd for ACiD, Mistigris, Remorse, SAC, is just ignorant, and this opinion doesn't stem from the fact that I regularly edit these articles. --<a href="../../../s/o/d/User%7ESodium_N4_c8b8.html" title="User:Sodium N4">Sodium N4</a> 15:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, ASCII Art and all of it's groups deserve a rightful place in history as any other. To remove it would violate the purpose of even having Wikipedia. Bad move by whomever nominated this. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConexion_6b05.html" title="User:Conexion">Conexion</a> 17:38, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
