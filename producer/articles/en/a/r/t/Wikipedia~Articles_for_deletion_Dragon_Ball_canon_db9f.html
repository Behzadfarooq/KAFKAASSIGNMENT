<p>This is entirely <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. As the lead of the article states, it is a term <i>used by fans to describe the various levels of "truth"</i>. Its essentially unverifiable speculation on which Dragon Ball series are more authoritative to the overall story line. There's no information here thats usable that isn't already in other Dragon Ball articles. Also, there are, of course, no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. <b>Delete</b> as unverifiable original research. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 19:27, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Keep if cleaned-up and made more neutral</s></b>. The problem is that Toei Animation(the studio that OWNS Dragon Ball) decides what is canon how much canon they are. Articles like <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28Star_Trek%29_c0ba.html" title="Canon (Star Trek)">Canon (Star Trek)</a> are verifiable because Paramount makes it clear what is canon and what isn't. This article is really just the opinion of certain fans, especially the part about GT being lower than the other shows just because it's not based on a manga by Akira Toriyam. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 21:18, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>JRP, the problem is that certain fanboys assert their opions into the page(like saying GT is not canon or less canon than anything else) with no evidence to back it up.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Huh? I'm not JRP. But, uh, moving beyond that *cough*, anyone who believes "GT is not canon to the TV series!" is going to great lengths to fool themselves in not wanting to dilute <i>their</i> vision of the show with what, in their view, is an inferior product. I'd agree as far as the manga goes, but GT is the same as all other produced anime-only filler done on the original <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Ball_86ec.html" title="Dragon Ball">Dragon Ball</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Ball_Z_eb3c.html" title="Dragon Ball Z">Dragon Ball Z</a></i> anime series.

<li><b>Delete per nom as non-verifiable and OR.</b> The very fact that editors of the article cannot agree on what constitutes canon does not help a bit. Needs some published authority to quote.

This is original research on the part of all the editors. They may be justified in their conclusions about the "canonness", but it i still original research.

<li><b>Comment</b>&#160;: why not rename the article as "Toriyama's implication in each product of the DB world" or something like that&#160;?

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm putting together a revision of this article using references, but it may take a couple of days due to the fact that all of my books are in boxes because I'm moving. I believe that while the word "canon" is not used, there is a clear separation in some of Toei's literature, specifically their Dragon Ball "daizenshuu" guides, that delineates the levels of manga vs anime vs movie canons. Unfortunately, most of those references are in Japanese so it's slow going. But, I think that I can put together an acceptable and cited version of this article. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> and give two demerits to any editor who inserts unsourced statements on "canon" into any article on fiction on wikipedia. "Canon" is inherently a violation of NPOV, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. It should never be used unless extraordinarily well sourced. In fact, this article admits to being a product of fan-activity in the first 10 words. It should also not be kept because we have a crappy article on the general usage of canon in works of fiction. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 01:33, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
