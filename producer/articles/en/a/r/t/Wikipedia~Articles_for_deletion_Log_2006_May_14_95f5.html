<p>I have been looking at this page and can't decide whether it should be kept or deleted. I was going to prod it, but changed to an AfD because I think it needs more eyes. Can we salvage this page? At present it is a mishmash of information, extremely hard to understand. If it can't be improved I think it should be deleted, and that would be my default action here, but I would like to hear other opinions before casting a vote. <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 00:11, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> -<a href="http://www.memorial-niten-ichy-ryu.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.memorial-niten-ichy-ryu.com/" rel="nofollow">The external link at the bottom of the article</a> connects to the memorial’s webpage. It may be that this is a very bad translation of something there. (I don’t speak French,-- or Japanese for that matter.) I put the title into the French Wikipedia and did not get an article hit. However, the memorial’s page contains the names “Kikou Yamata" “and “Miyamoto Musashi “ The French Wikipedia article for Kikou Yamata “ has a link titled Ecole Miyamoto Musashi that leads back to the memorial. I did not get a French Wikipeda article for Ecole Miyamoto Musashi or Miyamoto Musashi. In short, It might be very difficult to fix the article, and the relevant info probably exists on the French Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 04:44, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason why racist, neo-Nazi parties like BNP have been so prominent recently is precisely because of pages like this allowing them to air their fascist propaganda. All content on this page must be removed immediately - all publicity is good publicity in the eyes of these Nazis, in order to reduce exposure to their sickening activities. They are a tiny, non-notable party who do not have a single Member of Parliament, but it is important that they are squashed before they rise - the German Nazi party only had 2.6% of the vote in 1939, after all. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesmond22_684b.html" title="User:Desmond22">Desmond22</a> 00:39, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe we're considering a merge seriously only <b>because</b> of his relation to a famous person. Do this as a thought experiment -- imagine he's not related to Richard Feynman for a moment -- say his name is Carl Smith. So we have Carl Smith, the author of two books (one a popular work about physicist Richard Feynman) and an early contributor at one of the companies that arguably invented the concept of massively parallel computing. Wouldn't this person be notable? According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">WP:Notability (people)</a> the answer is yes: "Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 ..." --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippy_339a.html" title="User:Zippy">Zippy</a> 16:45, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. I am closing this early, as the same person who last nominated this article is relitigating the outcome, nothing has changed, there is clearly strong support to retain this article, and there is no prospect at all of a consensus to delete it. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the subject of the article is at least on the boderline of notability so there is no basis for me to go against community support for the article. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 14:07, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Proper and normal (but not required) practice is to always mention and link to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kathryn_Holloway_2c72.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kathryn Holloway">prior AFD</a> in the nom. You'll find that when you fail to do so, your nomination is appreciated much less. Generally, second nominations, always need extra reasoning behind them. You have to give a new reason, or point to a flaw in the last AFD (which there may be). By failing to mention the first AFD, it makes it look you're only problem with the first AFD, is didn't go the preferred way. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:42, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>This really does look like an "I didn't get the result I wanted last time, so I'll just try again" nomination. Although I concede that this isn't exactly an <i>obvious</i> keep, after reviewing the arguments on both sides I have to draw the conclusion that my distaste for second and third AFD noms that don't present any valid new reasons for reconsidering the first one exceeds any doubts about her notability. <b>Keep</b>, or alternately <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Canada_candidates%2C_2004_federal_election_513e.html" title="Green Party of Canada candidates, 2004 federal election">Green Party of Canada candidates, 2004 federal election</a> if necessary. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:29, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Of the four points raised for deletion, only one: "1. She's non-notable, nothing in the article establishes notability." is a stand-alone valid reason (non reliable sources, neutrality, reads like an ad should be addressed by editing). WP:BIO issues were dealt with at the last AfD. In my opinion, there's been nothing since the last AfD in the article to change her notability, and there were no objections to process or omissions at the last AfD. -- <font face="Arial"><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)">Samir</a></font> <a href="../../../c/a/n/Image%7ECanadian_maple_leaf_2.jpg_8df3.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/5/57/Canadian_maple_leaf_2.jpg/20px-Canadian_maple_leaf_2.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../c/a/n/Image%7ECanadian_maple_leaf_2.jpg_8df3.html" /></a> <font face="Arial Narrow"><small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">(the scope)</a> <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">धर्म</a></small></font> 06:03, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as I agree that the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines are unnecessarily restrictive. You all say that wikipedia is such a great source for information but are restricting it for no reason. It is not hurting anything to have this article up on the site. In fact, it is bringing a lot of irishtoothache fans to your site. Also, you are holding us to music guidelines, when we are involved with many other facets of entertainment and comedy. While I was working on the article, I felt like I was helping the wikipedia community out by adding a page about a new topic. Now I feel like you are ganging up on someone who is not "part of the group." There are pages upon pages of rules, and you can't expect everyone to read every single guideline when they sign up. I actually am surprised that you all know as much as you do. You'd make good lawyers. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlaze_b5ad.html" title="User:Glaze">Glaze</a> 23:18, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wow, I feel like a celebrity. No, I don't know anyone personally in irishtoothache. I heard about them from a friend at St. Mary’s College, became a fan, did some research, and made a wiki article for the group. When I made this page, I was completely unaware of the criteria that wikipedia uses to determine what constitutes a band. Now that I have read the criteria, I must say that I’m not as much of a fan of wikipedia anymore. If the community only recognizes bands that are already commercially successful, it might as well be getting a paycheck from Clearchannel. I can’t imagine why you would penalize bands for not already being famous and pretend like they don’t exist. Shame on all of you for trying to deny everyone else information on a band because they haven’t gone platinum or had a world tour. How ridiculous. They have plenty of fans that would love to read the article, myself included.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthonySchultz_da70.html" title="User:AnthonySchultz">AnthonySchultz</a> 03:58, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure you did read the criteria. Nowhere is there any mention of mainstream commercial success or that type of music. An old jazz trio that has never made much of a dime can still qualify under the guidelines. Self-released albums just don't cut it if you haven't been successful or influential, such as <a href="../../../a/n/i/Ani_DeFranco_242e.html" title="Ani DeFranco">Ani DeFranco</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jandek.html" title="Jandek">Jandek</a>.

<li>Well, it is <i>my</i> opinion...but allow me to elaborate. This AfD discussion centers on the band's notability. There have been no strong arguments (in my opinion) presented of Irish Toothache meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or any other <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> criteria. Then "the page is not hurting anyone" was trotted out as a feeble reason for keep. That statement is basically a concession that Irish Toothache doesn't meet notability criteria. Why <i>shouldn't</i> the big, bad Wikipedia editors delete this page? <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information; Wikipedia isn't an advertising service for small-time bands (or companies or websites, for that matter); Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and therefore it is a vehicle in which to elaborate on already notable subjects, not try to build notability <i>for</i> a subject. So, this page isn't "hurting anyone," but that doesn't mean unencyclopedic information belongs here.

<li>Well, saying the band has no notability would be rediculous. Irishtoothache has opened for national recording artists (Bubba Sparxxx, etc.), headlined concerts, has videos that have been featured on many notable websites (like 633tv.com, collegehumor.com, etc.), has <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/edubble/from/edubble/" class="external text" title="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/edubble/from/edubble/" rel="nofollow">an album available on cdbaby</a>, and is even being featured in an art show in Maine next week. Irishtoothache has also been offered various record contracts and are considering which steps to take next in regards to those contracts. So to say that they have no reach and no one knows about Irishtoothache is a little bit far fetched. It's true, they haven't been featured on the sucka free countdown yet, but why wait? It makes more sense to keep the page around so that when Irishtoothache does become famous, the page will be ready and waiting for them. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlaze_b5ad.html" title="User:Glaze">Glaze</a> 19:52, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Keep* Clearly you guys need to examine your rules more carefully. Now I would never be one to question people who seem as though they do nothing more than read page after page of articles on Wikipedia trying to find ones that don't meet ridiculous criteria so that people don't accidently get bombarded by "unencyclopedic" information (we all know how awful that would be)...but in this case I feel its my position to argue. My argument is this...OK...Irishtoothache is not notable as a band by the MUSIC standards for notability...and they may fall under the category of the dreaded "VANITY" page...these things I grant you... But on the other side of the coin...they do meet 100 percent of the neccesary qualifications of the "Normal Person's Guidelines for not Being a Silly Nitpicking Loser." Which is more than I can say for most of the people who voted to have the article removed. I don't know how much water this argument holds...but I'm sure I'll be provided with a fully documented report on that soon enough. My apologies to the cool cats at irishtoothache for this childish show of support. Irishtoothache is really cool stuff though...people would be very interested to learn more about the group...this is just a big lame mistake. And alot of you Wikipedia freakshow guys really are losers, completely apart from this discussion. I know many of you personally and your personalities are really...just...awful.

<li><b>Comment</b>.

However, I am currently working on making the article <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> better and I want to shorten the section <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html#Broadcasting" title="The Simpsons">The_Simpsons#Broadcasting</a> and move the information to a separate article according to <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>. The new article would be called <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting_of_The_Simpsons_e34f.html" title="Broadcasting of The Simpsons">Broadcasting of The Simpsons</a> and would merge information from that section, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_in_French_8e7a.html" title="The Simpsons in French">The Simpsons in French</a> and The Simpsons in Australia, although the last one is almost complete crap.

<p>KayinRichards: Keep Wii60, delete Viva La Wii60- Wii60 is a relevant and notable term, as of E3 2006. This term has caught on like a viral campaign, that doesn't seem to be related to either company in any formal manner. Regardless, it has taken on a life of it's own, and this term is on every game forum on the net. It will be around for the foreseeable future, and normal console game cycle. I would say 5-6 years. My brother is 13, and kids in his school in Florida have been talking nonstop about the three consoles. Wii60 (he has told me) is a frequent term used amongst his friends, and kids who're unhappy with the new PS3's showing/price/forced blu-ray. I don't see any reason for the Wii60 article to be deleted; however, I do think that the Revolution one, is absurd, and has no business on Wikipedia.</p>

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't personally think this can be saved; apart from anything else, the phenomenon is too recent to be encyclopedic, in my view. However, being constructive, I would suggest some citations (format: [http://www.XYZ.com.ru] in the text, or in an external links section [http://www.XYZ.com.ru/antiPS2 Origins of ABCD shown on www.XYZ.com.ru]. In addition and of equal importance, ensure that notability is met. See <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEME_0b58.html" title="WP:MEME">WP:MEME</a> for some ideas on this. Personally, I think that fixing up the spelling and formatting couldn't hurt, although doing this alone won't affect the notability of the article. Have a look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What wikipedia is NOT</a> to get an idea for some categories of articles that don't pass muster.

<p>I rewrote it to be neutral, put in some links, put in a time-frame, related stuff shows up on google, but its still not good?

<p>I just put in tons of links, showing that this is all across the internet. The Washington Post wrote an article about the agreement. I hope that convinces you guys that this is "notable".</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid these don't make your article notable. The link to the Washington Post article, for example, shows that that Nintendo have launched a console called the "Wii". No-one is disputing that, and indeed Wikipedia already has a good, sourced article about the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a>. These links do nothing to support your claim that "Viva La Wii60" is a popular and notable phrase, or that there is a group of "Revolutionists" calling for XBox/Ninetendo fanboys to unite against the PS3, which is the central claim of your article. The rest of your new material is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The primary link you provide that supports your claims is <a href="http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs/genmessage.php?board=930752&amp;topic=28093036" class="external text" title="http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs/genmessage.php?board=930752&amp;topic=28093036" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. Unfortunately that is a link to a forum (which isn't in itself proof of notability) and most of the postings there are other forum members telling you that your idea is, essentially, non-notable. Nothing I've seen here entices me to change my opinion above. This article is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">non-notable</a> <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> with no relevant <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and should be deleted. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gw</a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_Esperanza_97e1.html" title="User:Gwernol/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">rnol</a> 17:22, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whatever. If you guys wanna delete it so badly go ahead. I was just trying to contribute. I thought it was interesting, and yes, notable. I did all I could to try to make it meet your standards, but that is easier said than done. What if I were to write another article about the informal alliance between Microsoft and Nintendo in general, minus the revolutionist stuff? Seeing as I have so many links to back that up as notable, would you guys challenge it too? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Justicemanjj15 (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJusticemanjj15_d1c6.html" title="User talk:Justicemanjj15">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Justicemanjj15_5a5c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Justicemanjj15">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p><b>Separate the Wii60 and Viva la Wii60 AfD.</b> While Viva La Wii60 is more POV and terrible, Wii60 is a better article. Unglue the two AFDs. And besides, you didn't change the page. Just the header.</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. A tally of the "votes" in the instance yields a count of 6d/3k (counting the merge vote as a species of keep, and considering the "merge/delete" vote an abstention for this purpose), which is within the range for discretionary deletion. My own reading of the article finds it interlaced with plainly biased language from the outset, inappropriate for an encyclopedia. In my judgment, if NPOV treatment of this topic at this title is possible, it is better to have it begin ex nihilo than from this version. In consideration of those who feel this article contains valid information, I will provide the content for anyone who wishes to undertake an immediate NPOV incorporation of this information into <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Huraira_0ceb.html" title="Abu Huraira">Abu Huraira</a>. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:40, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I think there are two reasons for this:
<ul>
<li>First of all, whenever it is possible, the different views on a certain person are best presented together in one article. That way people who look up the subject will not get a one-sided perspective, but a general overview. Only if the article would get extremely long by presenting all interpretations - as in the case of Jesus - is a fork acceptable. I do not believe this is true for the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Huraira_0ceb.html" title="Abu Huraira">Abu Huraira</a> article.</li>
<li>Secondly, I'm certain you'll agree that Jesus is a far more important figure within Christianity than <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Huraira_0ceb.html" title="Abu Huraira">Abu Huraira</a> is within either the Sunni or the Shia branches of Islam.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Not counting boilerplate material, the Islam box, external links, categories and edit buttons, the body of the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Huraira_0ceb.html" title="Abu Huraira">Abu Huraira</a> article has at the moment a word count of 1197, and leaving out the Muslim view section 1120. After merging in the two view articles, the word count goes up to 3375. This means that in a merged version the Muslim view section will occupy two thirds of the article, which is disproportional. Some would say: prune it!, but who is going to prune this? The closing administrator? Editor David Sneek? It is not immediately obvious to me why the relative importance of the figure should have a bearing on the issue. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 00:02, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it would be a problem to shorten this article and turn it into a more useful section in the main <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Huraira_0ceb.html" title="Abu Huraira">Abu Huraira</a> article: the three comical ahadith need not to be quoted in full (one would suffice), and the sections <i>Umar beat, lashed, and called Abu Hurraira a liar</i>, <i>Muawiya rewarded Abu Hurairah for insulting Ali</i> and <i>It is not only the Shi'as who find Abu Huraira unreliable</i> can go because they are entirely copied from <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/5.3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/5.3.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> site. That would leave only 300 or 400 words. David Sneek 18:18, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you mean they are copyvio, you are not correct. If you mean the info is not important since they are in a prominent Shi'a source, then i dont agree. If you want to edit the text to be more diss-similar to that link, please do. But deleting it? No way. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 18:38, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I didn't mean to imply that it is a copyvio; I just do not believe it is wikipedia's job to copy other sources - not even prominent ones, and especially not when they represent a very specific POV. Instead, a short summary would be much better. For example, section 3 could be put like this: "According to <i>Peshawar Nights</i> by the early twentieth century Shia scholar Sultanu'l-Wa'izin Shirazi, <a href="../../../m/u/a/Muawiyah_I_c2c7.html" title="Muawiyah I">Muawiya</a> once rewarded Abu Hurairah for insulting <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abu_Talib_a9ac.html" title="Ali ibn Abu Talib">Ali</a> <sup><a href="http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/5.3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/5.3.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup>".

<p>Again, i do agree that the article is in need of attention, but we are not talking about that, we are talking about deleting it altogheter. And that is not right to do, it would be given undue weight in the main article, and the Shi'a deserve to have their views detailed. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 12:06, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, I don't know if this fits an official category for notability or not, but in 2002 they were nominated for "Best New Group" in the Canadian Rock Music Awards.

<li>The content not relevant to DBFG(L) is, from what I can see, the information regarding what fresh fruit is sometimes called, and the Hollyhock information. These look to me like Dicdefs.

<p>i am sorry. i haven't used wikipedia before, so i didn't know that it wasn't for invented words. i was going off of colbert's "truthiness," which has its own wiki page. i invented "celebritydom" about a week ago and my friends thought it was cool and told me i should write and article on wikipedia. the person who said they have heard it before probably heard it from a friend of a friend. once again, i am sorry. however, if colbert got "truthiness," why shouldn't i get "celebritydom?" please explain that to me. aokjunebug91</p>
<dl>
<dd>The difference is "Truthiness" was used on a national TV show, quoted in multiple articles in newspapers like the New York Times and selected by the American Dialect Society as the 2005 Word of the Year, making it <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. On a straight tally, the result is 5k/10d (one keep is weak), placing this within the realm of discretionary deletion. Even several keep voters acknowledge that this topic's claim to notability arises from an internet comic, and that the topic is already mentioned in the article for that comic. I believe that there is consensus that this article should not exist on its own, and that it is adequately covered elsewhere. After deleting, I will create a redirect to the parent comic in my capacity as an ordinary editor. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:36, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this new article (created 08:13, 14 May 2006 S ellinson) should be deleted with any information not already in the article <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Dissenters_5b0e.html" title="English Dissenters">English Dissenters</a> merged into that article. The reason for the deletion and not merge and redirect is the page name of the article: "17th century denominations" that does not reflect the title on the page "17th Century religious Denominations in England" in the page. Religious denominations in other countries apart from England in the 17th century. If the article "English Dissenters" did not exist then moving the article to "17th Century religious Denominations in England" would be an option but as the article "English Dissenters" exists such a move will duplicate information. Finally it contains information which is not correct -- the Levellers were a secular movement, and it is speculative to say "Many of these were influenced by the radical changes brought on by the execution of Charles I and the advent of the Commonwealth of England" because it is part of a chicken and egg argument. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:34, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>I would - naturally perhaps, - disagree</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would argue that the page fulfills a valuable function as the overview page for English dissenters spans a very large timeframe. 17th Century groups have a special character; their relationship to the commonwealth is complex and their influence on the contemporary political process is considerable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All the groups identified have at least some religious element. It is too simplistic to suggest groups at this period, such as the levellers, could be identified as being "secular" or "religious"; the discourse of the levellers was shot through with the religious imagary of its period and as such they may be acceptable as a religious group. However, i would draw your attention to the question of the extent to which "the levelers" may be considered as a coherent group per se. The work of Christopher Hill and Brian Manning underlines the complexities of these interactions.</dd>

<dd>It is not too simplistic to say that the levellers were secular. All discourse at that time has a strong religious element to it. If one is to say that the levellers were a denomination then one would be free to include the New Model Army, and given <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Astley%2C_1st_Baron_Astley_of_Reading_176f.html" title="Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading">Astley's</a> prayer at Edgehill, the Royalist army as well. In this context denomination has a specific meaning (which is not covered in this article at the moment) which is Christian religious denomination and as such should probably include the major denominations as well as the minor dissenters/independents. Further were the diggers a denomination? I am not sure; they based their arguments on Christianity, but were they a denomination? I would like to see a source which said that they were before including such a statment in Wikipedia. However this is a debate we can have on the talk page if it the article survives --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 07:26, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. These articles are a mess. This one and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_dissenters.html" title="English dissenters">English dissenters</a> are poorly written -- little more than lists (with errors, at that). This area has good potential to have great articles, if only the editors would work together. Following editors around to redo links doesn't engender trust. While the movements may be centered around England, her colonies were also important (the religious American colonies, such as Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, as well as John Wesley's unfortunate problems in Georgia had a strong impact on religion in England). Then there were movements through England from Germany to America (such as the Palatine Emigration) that also had an effect. There is a lot of good material here for some very decent articles. Or, we could have a turf war. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a> 19:10, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">User:TedE</a>. I'm by no means an expert here , but it seems to me that there is more than enough that could be said to make this article useful and distinct from <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Dissenters_5b0e.html" title="English Dissenters">English Dissenters</a>. Indeed, given the number of sectarian groups, you could probably write a book (ah, that's been done, several times). <i>The World Turned Upside Down</i> is frequently reprinted, which speaks to the popularity of the subject. But this is a time-limited conditional vote. If this is renommed in a couple of months, and it is still as is, I'll vote differently. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 23:08, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (as last two). Neither of the articles (nor <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonconformism.html" title="Nonconformism">Nonconformism</a> which covers similar ground) are particularly good. It may be useful to have separate articles on the denominations of the Commonwelath period (most of which did not survive the Restoration), on the Old Dissent (i.e. dissenting denominations) prior to the arrival of the Moravians and the Evangelical (or Methodist) Revival. However all these articles require work, as none really provide an overview of the subject. Nonconformism is perhaps the nearest to that. It all needs work, but I am not sufficiently expert to help much. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 23:44, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, but remove the rant</b> You must bear in mind that Professor Smadar Lavie has been under a constant attack for her lack of pro-Zionism. It might be a good idea to contact her, and ask her to provide proof of the challanged claims. Her CV appears to be quite objective. I followed the discussion about her in Hebrew as well (she published several interesting and well-written articles in the Israeli press too). As a Hague Convention child myself (Personal Status file 2637/1991, Tel Aviv District Court, before Justice Porat), I have a lot of interest in her experiences with the Israeli legal system in general, and with its family law branch in particular. I did read the publicly available court documents in Hebrew, which were posted on the website of the Isreali Bar Association and/or other Israel websites a few years ago. It is sad, but the truth is that each and every of Lavie's claims can be verified. Glukacs</li>

<p>The personal life of Hugo Chávez is not a subject worthy of an article in and of itself. Without context, discussion of someone's personal life is essentially meaningless as a standalone subject, and it doesn't make encyclopaedic sense to separate this information from the main article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Finding a "Personal life" section in the middle of a biography article is not unusual. When that section becomes too large, editors split the article and create a sub-article like this one. That's exactly what happened. That happens all the time in big articles, what's the problem?! What policies is this article violating? Actually, it just complies with <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Yes, the original Chavez article is outrageously too long and difficult to edit, and these daughter articles were created, apparently, to shorten the Chavez article for featured status, and to remove some controversial topics from the main article. But the information included in the Personal Life article isn't needed and doesn't warrant a separate article. Anything important enough about his personal life to be mentioned in an encyclopedia can be mentioned in the main article. There are numerous other ways the main article could, and should be, shortened without creating fluff. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 02:28, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Page reads like vanity and advertising. Also, he does not seem overly important in the tech world, though he does have a large presence on Linux message boards and the like.

<li>Well, WP:BIO is a guideline not a policy. That particular portion of the guideline could use some tweaking, after all a published author in a periodical of 5,000 or more is also considered notable, which <i>I've</i> accomplished. That would make a reporter for a small weekly in the middle of nowhere notable enough for an article. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 16:42, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> Indeed. It seems to me the question is also whether being the member of a band that is sufficiently notable is enough: hence the weak. But I'm happy to be in the minority here if others think otherwise. (I agree fully that the circulation number of 5000 is too low; and one-off publication shouldn't do it either: it should be regular contributions to a journal/paper several times that size, imo.) <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_Esperanza_9f0d.html" title="User:Bucketsofg/Esperanza"><b><font color="green">ets</font></b></a><font color="grey"><a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBucketsofg_e5d0.html" title="User talk:Bucketsofg"><b>ofg</b>✐</a> 16:55, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</font></li>

<p>As an amendment, note that it appears Impeccable H's article is marked for AfD, but the AfD notice directs here. This listing does not strictly include Impeccable H, although several commenters spoke of both. Procedure was not exactly followed in this case; but I will <b>delete Impeccable H</b> on the basis of this AfD, as if he were correctly listed alongside The Giant Khan. I acknowledge the process-defect, and will happily undelete Impeccable H under any good-faith request for a new AfD.

<p>Relisting. This article was recently on AfD, here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Native_Americans_at_Dartmouth_College" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Native_Americans_at_Dartmouth_College" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. The result of that discussion was No Consensus. Interestingly, however, there was not one "keep" vote on the previous AfD--the lack of consensus regarded whether this article should be deleted or merged into the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> article. Well, someone seems to have merged the bulk of this article into that one, hence I am relisting it on AfD. This is a non-notable student organization with less than fifty members and no website. I honestly think that it was unfair to every other student organization at Dartmouth that this one gets covered in the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> article, but I don't feel strongly enough about it to edit the article to include others. But this club does not appear to merit its own article. Google news search on the organization's name results in zero hits, indicating that it is not notable for some reason other than its size or age. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 16:37, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>-It was meant to be a new band. That was the project. At that time Björk was moving away from The Sugarcubes (after their second album got the worst reviews) but it all failed, as I said, because of Guðmundur illness. Also, it was "considered a new band, by the musicians themselves. How do I know this? Easy: I'm in touch with several Icelandic musicians. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Mar%C3%ADa_Ben%C3%ADtez_469f.html" title="User:Luis María Benítez">Luis María Benítez</a> 19:42, 14 May 2006 (UTC)<br />
--<b><u>Check this out:</u></b> On <a href="http://www.tonlist.com/ViewArtist.aspx?AuthorID=6577" class="external text" title="http://www.tonlist.com/ViewArtist.aspx?AuthorID=6577" rel="nofollow">this page of Tónlist.is</a> Björk Guðmundsdóttir &amp; Tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar is listed as one separate band, which proves I'm right, and I have an example: Bubbi Morthens joined MX-21 and under the name of Bubbi &amp; MX-21 they released a record in 1987. Some people think this release was a collaboration of Bubbi or MX-21, but “Bubbi &amp; MX-21” was actually the name of the band! If Tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar wanted Björk to collaborate with them for that album and just that, they would have put “featuring Björk” instead.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Bubbi Morthens, MX-21 &amp; Bubbi MX-21 do not have three separate entries, so neiher should Bjork, TGI and B&amp;TGI. Also: if someone had said to Björk at the time, "who do you play with?" would she have said "I am playing with Björk Guðmundsdóttir &amp; Tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar at the moment" or just "I am playing with Tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar at the moment"? Furthermore, having all information on one page would be logical <i>if nothing else than for the convenience of the reader</i>. Splitting them up over three pages - GG, TGI and B&amp;TGI - simply to appease the original intentions of the artists who at the time wanted B&amp;TGI to be a unique band, is complicating matters unecessarily. As archivists we are interested in a single 'event' here - the making of Gling Glo - 'intentions' of artists are irrelevant.<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamiancorrigan_d621.html" title="User:Damiancorrigan">Damiancorrigan</a> 17:51, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--- I think she would have said: “I’m playing <i>in</i> a band called Björk Guðmundsdóttir og Tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar”…<br />
As we all know this name appeared on the front cover of <i>Gling-Gló</i> and therefore many people think this was just an album released by the Trio “featuring” Björk as the vocalist. Some others (me included) say it was the name of a new group that couldn’t make it longer. On <a href="http://home4.inet.tele.dk/olrik/bjork/disco/1990.htm#glingglo" class="external text" title="http://home4.inet.tele.dk/olrik/bjork/disco/1990.htm#glingglo" rel="nofollow">this page</a> they appear as a separate band too. I’m very sorry to be so stubborn, but the fact is that they <i>were</i> a new band and those who have followed Björk’s music over the years would agree. I wonder what is the name of the band on the <a href="http://unit.bjork.com/77island/77island/sugarcubes/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://unit.bjork.com/77island/77island/sugarcubes/index.htm" rel="nofollow">discography page at Björk.com</a>… yes: BG&amp;TGI.

<li>Comment: The current content of the article is not good. However, on the principal of this type of article, I'm not clear it is inherently a POV fork. It seems <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_%28prophet_in_Islam%29_6c96.html" title="Jesus (prophet in Islam)">Jesus (prophet in Islam)</a> is similiar in concept, and a number of "God-per-religion" articles also exist. To me, if two religious groups have a sufficiently different view of a figure, perhaps separate articles are appropriate. This is particularly true when the views of that figure *define* those religious groups. I see <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_view_of_Ali_e6a0.html" title="Shi'a view of Ali">Shi'a view of Ali</a>, not as a fork of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_924a.html" title="Ali ibn Abi Talib">Ali ibn Abi Talib</a>, but rather, as sub-article of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_Islam_4b8a.html" title="Shi'a Islam">Shi'a Islam</a>.

<dd>I believe the Jesus case is special, since christians and muslims are essentially using different sources to build their views of Jesus, whereas for Ali (and the other ones in that cluster), Shi'i and Sunni have different comments but work from the same source material. Kinda the same. Erm. OK, the difference may just be one of degree. I see your point about having this as a sub-article of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_Islam_4b8a.html" title="Shi'a Islam">Shi'a Islam</a> - maybe something like Place of Ali in Shi'a Islam would be better? It would be less of a POV fork. I disagree with the rationale "could be helpful to readers of [[Shi'a Islam]", since it could be used to justify any POV fork. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">flammif</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">r</a><sup><a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlammifer_ede3.html" title="User talk:Flammifer">talk</a></sup> 19:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

There do need to be several articles as a matter of article length; however, I've deep misgivings about the way this was done. It seems that overtly labelling articles as POV forks (or worse yet, simply failing to translate the name, as was originally done, and is still done with <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musa.html" title="Musa">Musa</a>, etc.) had been seen as granting exemption from <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a> and as liscence to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Sahaba's (Muhammads companions) are a very prominent part of what Shi'a regard as relevant to their religion, and at the same time they have reached a totaly different conclusion than the Sunnis with regards to almost all Sahaba and events. This, in the same way that Jews and Christians have a very different view of Jesus, even though they use the same sources. So per the precedence of the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_view_of_Jesus_e834.html" title="Jewish view of Jesus">Jewish view of Jesus</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_of_Jesus_2f92.html" title="Christian views of Jesus">Christian views of Jesus</a>, this article series is legitimate and even needed and desired. In my view, those who do not agree have failed to understand the scope of dissagreance between Shi'a and Sunni in their views of the Sahaba, something that even have caused some Sunni denominations to cry out for the killing of Shi'a due to what they perseive as defaiming of the companions:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The Shi'a curse the Sahaba</li>
<li>Those that curse the Sahaba are kaafirs</li>
<li>The Shi'a are therefore kaafirs</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> However, I'm not so sure any longer that ALL the discussion re Ali should be moved into the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> article. That is, the Ali article is a biography. Shi'a make several claims about the life of Ali that are disputed by the Sunni and by Western academic scholars, and those contentious claims are covered in <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_of_first_male_Muslim_361e.html" title="Identity of first male Muslim">Identity of first male Muslim</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthplace_of_Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_6654.html" title="Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib">Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib</a>. I think both those breakout articles are what breakout articles should be: they take very contentious issues out of the main article, so that there's more space for all the contending views. However, much of the Shi'a view of Ali is, IMHO, theology rather than history. It doesn't belong in the biography, it belongs in the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> article. If it is too big to fit there, it can have its own article, <i>as Shi'a theology</i>. I think that's the difference between the study of the <i>historical Jesus</i> and arguments about the nature, divine or human, of Jesus (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christology.html" title="Christology">Christology</a>). I haven't gone into the Shi'a article in a long time -- it was taken over by Shi'a zealots. But a lot of the Ali material needs to go there, not be presented as history. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:02, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't think the latter should exist; I just looked at it and it does seem to be be a POV fork. As for the article up for deletion -- it's not theology, but history, badly written history, and it's written by someone with no background in Shi'a theology. If the article had a different title and substantially different content, and were presented as theology -- that is, if it were something it is not -- I would vote to keep it.

<dd>My understanding is that we're discussing <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni_view_of_Abu_Huraira_d733.html" title="Sunni view of Abu Huraira">Sunni view of Abu Huraira</a> here, not <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_view_of_Jesus_e834.html" title="Jewish view of Jesus">Jewish view of Jesus</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_of_Jesus_2f92.html" title="Christian views of Jesus">Christian views of Jesus</a>. When I read <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni_view_of_Abu_Huraira_d733.html" title="Sunni view of Abu Huraira">Sunni view of Abu Huraira</a>, I thought that:
<ul>
<li>The base article was too short to support splitting content off</li>
<li>Declarative "he is trustworthy" in Sunni vs. "view him in a very negative view" in Shi'a</li>
<li>"They dissregard reports of his unfailing memory as fabricated and falsified." in Shi'a summary, without comparable statements in the Sunni article. In fact, I see no criticism at all in the Sunni article.</li>
<li>Likewise, the Shi'a article has "Comical Ahadith by Abu Huraira show clear fabrications" and similar entries. It's deeply POV, and clear which side is supported in both articles.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Not counting boilerplate material, the Islam box, external links, categories and edit buttons, the body of the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Huraira_0ceb.html" title="Abu Huraira">Abu Huraira</a> article has at the moment a word count of 1197, and leaving out the Muslim view section 1120. After merging in the two view articles, the word count goes up to 3375. This means that in a merged version the Muslim view section will occupy two thirds of the article, which is disproportional. So it is entirely reasonable to have spinouts here. As to the POV thing, of course we won't put an AfD on the Jesus views just to prove a point. These should stay, for basically the same reason these articles should stay, which is the following: Assume a reader wants to know more about the Shi'a view of Abu Huraira. As a matter of <b>fact</b>, that view is not very positive. Actually, it is not positive at all. Stronger even, it is quite negative. This is a rather essential part of Shi'a belief, whether you like it or not. The <b>fact</b> that it is so, is at least as much a <b>fact</b> as that Christians mostly have a rather exalted opinion about Jesus. Many even believe that Jesus has a divine nature. Now both beliefs are <i>terribly POV</i> and not shared at all by (for example) most Shintoists. So should Wikipedia then not report on these <b>facts</b>? Please read <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> carefully:
<ul>
<li>"all articles must be written from a neutral point of view, <b>representing views fairly and without bias</b>" (my emphasis here and in what follows).</li>
<li>"The policy requires that, where there are or have been conflicting views, these should be presented fairly, but not asserted. <b>All significant points of view are presented, not just the most popular one</b>."</li>
<li>"As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, <b>not the absence or elimination of viewpoints</b>."</li>
<li>And: "assert facts, <b>including facts about opinions</b> — but don't assert opinions themselves."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>All the quotes here are from <i>official Wikipedia policy</i> and not just a guideline that you may ignore.

<dd>My apologies if I misunderstood you. But by using words like "It's deeply POV" and "Perhaps it is just as POV" you imply that this material should not remain. POV forks must not be "merged"; they must be deleted. Spinouts that by themselves conform to NPOV are legit; whether the matter is spun-out or kept/merged back in the main article is then a neutral editorial decision involving mainly considerations such as convenience for the reader. For the rest I wish we could spend our energy on <i>improving</i> these articles rather than keeping arguing over and over that they should be kept. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:33, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not a list of "random quotes" by "non-muslims". The people quoted are not just any non-muslims. They are <i>Islamic scholars who are not muslims</i>. Most non-muslims are not Islamic scholars, and most Islamic scholars are not non-muslims, so this combination is somewhat special. (Also, most if not all would easily pass the notability test.) The quotes are not random, They are <i>highly specific</i> about <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a>; how are they random quotes? Further, this is not a content fork but an "article spinout"; see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - "Summary style" articles</a> and also how this is actually <i>recommended</i> in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html#Avoidance_of_POV_splits" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style#Avoidance of POV splits</a>. As such, the article nicely complements <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni_view_of_Ali_a942.html" title="Sunni view of Ali">Sunni view of Ali</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_view_of_Ali_e6a0.html" title="Shi'a view of Ali">Shi'a view of Ali</a>. As to the alleged violation of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, that would be the case if some editor tried to keep others from editing his or her articles, for example by indiscriminately reverting others' edits, and refusing to engage in meaningful dialogue or attempts to reach consensus. None of this is evident in the article's history. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>redirect to <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a>.</b> This was a long discussion with lots of anons and newbies. However, it seems clear to me that the consensus <i>among experienced editors</i> was that this is not an article and should not stand alone. However, since some folks mentioned the possibility of a partial merge, I think closing this by redirecting is better than by deleting. This way we preserve the history for anyone who wants to try to merge. I discounted people who gave no reasons, or reasons like "we have even worse articles"- this is not an argument for keeping. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:04, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I suggest us list the largest fads (top 15 "hall of fame" fads) in the fads section of YTMND, then redirect the article. If we really would like a list of YTMND fads, might as well use www.ytmnd.com/wiki/index.php?title=YTMND_Fads&amp;action=history the list on YTMND's wiki (which was merged from the article on the 11th).

<li><b>Keep</b>, this page was made because the <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> page was getting too long. I see no difference between this and any other page that was split because of the main article being too long. Furthermore, if you go to the talk page you will see that the page has been listed as a source for articles twice. And lastly, as, kietotheworld said, it will discourage creation of each individual fad page which will definitely happen if this is deleted or redirected.<a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 22:54, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is composed entirely of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and so the content does not belong on Wikipedia at all, let alone in its own article. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 23:00, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Every fad listed is (or if it isn't already can be) linked to a YTMND or several YTMND's as a source, hence it not being OR. As far as YTMND pages being a reliable source, obviously they cannot be one for anything EXCEPT proving their own existence, which is exactly what it would be doing in this case. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 23:21, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Virtually none of them are so sourced, nor is there an indication that they ever will be. More importantly, the judgement that a fad <i>is a fad</i> is original research which cannot be backed up by a couple of links; it is a synthesis of the entire site, which we are incompetent to provide without secondary literature. The organization of the article is also OR; how are we to judge what is "most popular"? It's a joke. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 01:50, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll agree that the way it is currently presented is OR as to what constitutes a fad. Perhaps it should state a requirement to be considered a fad is a certain number of keywords or another such measure. Popularity can be determined by keyword count as well. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 05:58, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, as JDoorJam. These rather sad derivative works do not become fads by mere association with the original YTMND.

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> This is a very good reference for people who use YTMND. True, the article does need some clean up, but memes and fads are part of the Wikipedia, are they not? If not then there are many many articles that need to be promptly deleted. Also, I doubt that anybody would argue that YTMND is not a highly visited and influential website. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigeriz_34b4.html" title="User:Tigeriz">Tigeriz</a></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This site is an excellent reference and has helped me find the names of many songs from YTMND fads. I think it's important to keep it! Ohana 03:02, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> However, this could use something of a clean-up. Some time ago, it was very nicely organized - of course, it got deleted. If it is deleted, I'd suggest the notables be stuck under the YTMND main article.

<li>This doesn't explain why the fads should have their own article.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Cleanup</b> Not cruft, is necessary to understanding many of the sites on YTMND and the internet. If it is kept though, clean it up by purging non-notable "fads."

<p>The parent company as well as this studio are both being deemed not important enough, however in the market they exist they are revolutionary. Basing its importance solely on Google hits is irrelevant. It is an independent grassroots based Music Company. It reflects the changing market of music in the new millennium. Fidelity Entertainment Group and Pendlwood Studios both allow artists to do all the things it took a major label to accomplish along with digital distribution through such companies as itunes. The fact that this company has grown out of the Christian rock music industry, which is small by comparison to the mainstream market, should not change the fact that what this company is doing with Fidelity Entertainment Group is revolutionary. It is the beginning of what has already shown to be changing the entire music market place.</p>
<p>Also penalizing for having a myspace page is a very backwards way for an online encyclopedia to look at things. Myspace is the future of culture in this millennium and I believe we will only see more of life moving to an online existence.</p>
<p>The fact that you have a company that allows artist to record produce promote design distribute and sell their product entirely on the Internet without special selection by a major label IS the future.</p>
<p>If you still feel that deleting both pages is necessary, I have no option.

<li><b>Delete</b> It may have existed once (changing silt patterns) but not now. I asked a China list I'm on and the answer is no. One expert said:
<blockquote>
<p>The Zhu (Pearl) River deposits a lot of silt on this west bank in what is now the Macau-Zhuhai area. Islands have formed and disappeared relatively rapidly. It is likely that what is now the City of Macau was once an island but the earliest maps I have seen have always shown a narrow isthmus (16th century). To give an example of change, the Macau island of Taipa was two islands in the 19th Century and today it is now joined to the island of Coloane as one large island. Chinese colonization of this area of the delta often resulted land being reclaimed for agriculture and fish ponds. Thus the coast line was constantly changed both by fluvial and human action. While much of the area under discussion may once have been islands, the area of contemporary Zhuhai and Macau area probably have not been an island(s) for a long time. To view this area as an island today is incorrect.</p>

Most of the list is crap (ie, "African Americans characters' hair will invariably resemble a mop or a sea urchin" -- <i>huh? what?</i>) but there are some genuine cliches in there and God knows there's plenty of cliches in advertising.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I prefer to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. The nominator has provided a rational basis for his or her nomination. None of these lists provide any objective criteria as to what does and does not belong on the list. There is clearly a POV element and it is a reasonable to assert that the article smacks of original research. On the contrary, I see no reason why all clichés are notable. Saying it is so does not make it so. There may also be valid reasons to keep the entry; however, there is no need to disparage the nominator. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluit_5f4e.html" title="User:Fluit">Fluit</a> 20:52, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as inherently POV topic and title. See how the article <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">cliché</a> clearly states the decision to classify anything as "cliché" is POV. This also appears to be completely original research. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 20:42, 17 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Interesting...By extending that logic, it's impossible to provide any example of a cliché that's still NPOV, meaning the article <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">cliché</a> fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> because there are no sources that can be quoted to demonstrate clichés exist, therefore <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">cliché</a> should be AfD'd, therefore you cannot quote it to support your contention that calling something 'cliché' is inherently POV. [head explodes]<br />
I would suggest that since nobody seriously disputes that, say, 'head them off at the pass' is a cliché, it falls under WP:NPOV's <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#A_simple_formulation" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">a simple formulation</a> section and can be given as an example (you could even strengthen it further by directly quoting <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blazing_Saddles_d431.html" title="Blazing Saddles">Blazing Saddles</a> calling it one). As can, say, riding off into the sunset. The cliché article is <i>wrong</i> if it asserts that calling anything whatsoever cliché is a violation of WP:NPOV. Hrimfaxi 07:05, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't quite agree with your interpretation. That the word "cliché" exists and has (hopefully) been used in the sense that the <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">Cliché</a> article explains is surely <i>very</i> verifiable. But that something can be labelled "a cliché" NPOVly is a different matter! By your same reasoning, the article about <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> should not exist, because the existence of God is not verifiable (sorry, just the first example I could think about, not trying to stir up a religious debate now). But that the word God has been used many times to refer to such and such <i>is</i> verifiable, and that's why the article exists and should continue to exist. As far as <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#A_simple_formulation" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">a simple formulation</a> is concerned, well, I think that making a <i>list</i> that is <i>entirely composed</i> of opinions by "an identifiable and subjectively quantifiable population" (not even "a name", which is usually much more desirable) is stretching it more than a little. At the <i>very</i> least, if these article are two have any value, they should cite <i>extensively</i> the surveys and researches they're based upon; otherwise, they just strike my eyes as blatant POV original research. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 13:28, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But since <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>, we should then AfD the cliché article because it is not enough for a word to exist to warrant an article on it. As said, sources certainly <i>can</i> be cited to define things as clichés. By <i>your</i> reasoning above, since no NPOV source can be cited on the existence of God, there really <i>shouldn't</i> be a God article, and we clear the way to solipsism since there's no NPOV way to prove that, say, the United States of America isn't an incredibly elaborate hoax.<br />
The <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">Cliché</a> article actually states that "identification of a cliché depends largely on who uses it and who makes the judgement;" this does <i>not</i> mean, however, that there are not large numbers of things that most would agree are clichés, or that we cannot name anything as a cliché. For example, someone who has never played a videogame would not regard exploding barrels as a cliché; most gamers do because of the sheer number of games they appear in, and they have been mocked as such to the extent that at one point Valve was planning to put an Exploding Barrel Factory in Half-Life 2. Thusly, we can say 'Exploding barrels are generally regarded as a videogame cliché' and be NPOV; 'generally regarded' in the sense of a cliché means 'among those familiar with the medium in question.'<br />
A slight re-write is probably necessary for all of these lists to emphasise that these are <i>regarded as clichés among fans of the medium</i> and to cite sources on some of them [though simply listing a lot of examples goes some way to establishing that; for example, listing examples of the classic 'spherical black bomb' appearing in cartoons]. A slight issue about the definition of a term isn't really a reason to remove an entire article, particularly since there is no argument that all of these things <i>exist</i> or are <i>common</i>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">cliché</a> article defines:
<dl>
<dd>[The word "cliché"] <i>has since come to mean a phrase, expression, or idea that has been overused to the point of losing its intended force or novelty.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>How do you decide "overused to the point of losing its intended force"? How used is overused? Who knows what the "intended" force was?</dd>
<dd>The same article later goes on to say:

<dd>[...] <i>identification of a cliché depends largely on who uses it and who makes the judgement.</i></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I prefer to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. The nominator has provided a rational basis for his or her nomination. None of these lists provide any objective criteria as to what does and does not belong on the list. There is clearly a POV element and it is a reasonable to assert that the article smacks of original research. On the contrary, I see no reason why all clichés are notable. Saying it is so does not make it so. There may also be valid reasons to keep the entry; however, there is no need to disparage the nominator. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluit_5f4e.html" title="User:Fluit">Fluit</a> 20:30, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I would think that since there are so many other notable movie cliches on wikipedia, we should also keep the notable cliches for the genre of horror. This article definately needs to be cleaned up though, but this information is interesting and potentially useful. Let's not scrap it, lets fix it.198.213.57.8 21:10, 17 May 2006 (UTC)Makoeyes</li>

<p>It is very neccesary to have a list of episodes where Butters is significant. In recent years, Butters has tended to upstage Kenny. You should have a list of episodes with Butters because that way we know which episodes have Butters and which ones have Kenny. 1028 20:32, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I disagree, just because you think the the entry is silly doesn't change the fact that it does add information to the reader who follows the link from the original page. It clearly and concisely explains what the technique is and it explains it's background and usage in the movie. Therefore the statement "as there is non(e) to be added" is clearly wrong and demostrates only that you think the movie is silly and I don't consider that to be a valid reason to delete an entry.</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia does include articles for notable names.

<dd><font color="#FF0000">Did you check those references? Because I did, and some were referencing Mexico, while the sections discussing Neo-Taino nations is more fitting of a Cuban History section since all natives of Cuba were effectively wiped out by the spaniards and those few that have survived have not affected the overall culture, which draws strictly from Spain and Africa. Also, how can Castro's mandates be deemed a success? That is purely POV since there are a number of intangibles involved in calling something a success. First, well before Castro took power, the women of Cuba were some of the most educated in the world, having more college graduates per capita than any country in the western hemisphere, including the U.S. Also, although more women work today in Cuba, those women do not have a <i>choice</i>, as they are property of the state and are required to work to contribute to the communist government. Additionally, the pay is substantially less. This is more fitting of a subsection in a histroy of Cuba section. <b>Those of you saying we should keep this should READ IT COMPLETELY, UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL FACTS, AND CHECK THE REFERENCES.</b> Otherwise, anyone can write an article that sounds legitimate with false citations about incorrect facts.

<dd>Also User RasPutinAXp says he is a adviser in alpha Chi Rho chapel in university of Rowan. I think in life everybody has an outward expression of his/her inner beauty. I became very surprised he believe to universal brotherhood and his outward expression is against instruments of world unity. Creating a global integrated transportaion system is a noble concept and is becoming popular among urban planners.</dd>
<dd>The reason I write this wiki article to let every person a chance to fulfill his/her spiritual obligation under principle of ever advancing civilisation. We all must carry forward an ever advancing civilisation.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is indeed such a concept. His creater was truly a giantic spiritual being dreaming to create new basis of happiness by inviting all the pepole of the world a chance to contribute to a global integrated knowldge for the benifit of all.</dd>
<dd>Our technical paper will publish in physics and transport engineering journals. Those Journals are our academic standards. Our dream is for humanity to create a paradise in earth as a gift to our lord and show our true love to our creator. This is a journey of love and you can join us. The field is indeed so immense, the period is so critical and the case of world uniffication is so great. But the workers are so few and the time is so short. No true followers of the path of lord of love can efford a moment of hesitation. The time has come for the emergence of a new race of men. In the world we dream, the pain of one is the pain of all and the joy of one is the joy of all. This is the meaning of Paradise. the human race is becoming one and worship the lord as one. Good luck my friends. Catt Eastsscaft 11:07, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, of course, There have been a number of published papers in Physics and Transport Enginerring journal in the last two years, in particular arXiv:physics , European Journal of Physics, Physical review E, Journal of Eastern Asian Society for Transportaion Studies and nature. The list is rather long . Here some notable examples from NASA and Los Almos&#160;: N. Alexandrove (2004) " Transportaion Network Topologies" NASA technical report no Tm-2004-213259. Toroczkai work from Los Almos has been appered in nature (2004) under title " Traffic Jamming is limited in Scale free network". G. Chowell et al from Los Almos have published an important paper in physical reveiew E and arXivphysics (2005) under the title "Scaling laws for the movement of pepole between locations in a large cities". Queensland University and catt systems have also published papers (2005) showing traffic in city of Marion, Adelaide has scale free characteristics. Also in the list are University of bejing, Tsukuba university, .... . So there have been significant progress in this topic. I guess we can reach to consensus that the article has fulfiled the three required condition for inclusion in wikipedia. Please let me. Catt Eastsscaft 14:27, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Article need to be expanded as it is an important and genuine article.</b> We need to find out why this type of format was chosen?</li>
</ul>
<p>Gwernol has volunteer himself to rewrite it. Please do so, as this is what realy wikipedia is about.</p>
<p>The article content including traffic light optimisation has been already published with proper refrences so no worry about copy rights.</p>
<p>The issue of expansion and comprehansion need to explored further. There has been radical scientific shift in the last few years in physics and social communities. The shift is away from social construction sense making theories toward more adaptive principle based theories as evident in South africa and Easts urban plannaing professionals. Many of these principled based theories and in fact nearly all published physics papers use agent based complex adaptive systems in one way or another. There has been alternative principle based complex adaptive approach also which the article suggest. It seems the article suggests this is the way to the global integrated transportaion/urban system. It is basically religion based complex adaptive system reinvoking intelligent design theories based on certain superstatistical model.Catt Eastsscaft 12:14, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm sorry, I wasnt aware that 7 years was a short time. 3 albums on one of the most NOTABLE indie labels, 4 EPs, a couple compilations, and worldwide notoriety (not to mention having a big impact on the Washington, DC punk/indie scene alone)..I think that constitutes a keeper. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/m/5/User%7EBm5481_c4fd.html" title="User:Bm5481">Bm5481</a> (<a href="../../../b/m/5/User_talk%7EBm5481_9b5b.html" title="User talk:Bm5481">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bm5481_6c84.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bm5481">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>NOTE</b> Fair enough. The statements made by the original commenter are FALSE. Said band was in existence for 7 years hence "short-lived"=false statement. Said band and former members' other projects (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgie_James" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgie_James" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>) have also garnered praise and recognition from reputable sources, see<a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> hence "non-notable"=yet another false statement. Please remember, Wikipedia focuses on truth, not personal opinion. <a href="../../../b/m/5/User%7EBm5481_c4fd.html" title="User:Bm5481">Bm5481</a> 19:43, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Q and Not U's latest album was reviewed by All Music Guide, Pitchfork, PopMatters, The Onion A.V. Club, Alternative Press, and others. Ian MacKaye produced a few of their records, too. Their name's well-known to those in indie circles, if not on the level of Fugazi then at least as much recognition as their colleagues Les Savy Fav. I don't know how low the bar is set for "notable" but they were signed to a prominent independent label and achieved a good degree of success in their particular scene. <a href="../../../m/k/i/User%7EMkilly_79be.html" title="User:Mkilly">Mkilly</a> 20:09, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b> - No clear consensus for deletion, not that I count noses, but it's a tossup. I thought of closing no consensus, but the keeps and merges are a lot more persuasive to me than the deletes. The article has a lot of good information and comparision charts as well. At worst, merge it somewhere. That doesn't take another AfD, just do it...

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and expand. Might do it myself at some point. Let me explain: any article on the title 'sahib' will have to be completely different from an article on this phrase, which is a term with a very specific and rich sociological meaning. The word 'sahib' in the phrase, in this context, refers specifically to the British; a brown sahib is someone who imitates the British. Fairly important for the postcolonial theory crowd. There are discussions of this, by among others, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homi_Bhabha_70d4.html" title="Homi Bhabha">Homi Bhabha</a> in the Location of Culture.
