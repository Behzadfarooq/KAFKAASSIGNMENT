<p>"Production company" for some teenagers who made a film. There might be a claim of notability in the article since it says their film was well-received in many places, but it's hard to check since the film's name isn't mentioned in the article and looks to be a hoax. Googling "FOB productions"+desi gets 628 results, most of them from word lists and none seem to be relevant to this. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 01:49, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actualy, if you bothered to read, you'd realize that is gives the movie name as Sarhad Ke Par Dosti. Maybe not a big movie like King Kong.

<li>Sarhad Ke Par Dosti is not a hoax-i saw the movie on google video and was pleased by the quality of the film. These people have obviously put hard work into making this movie. I would recommend anyone doubting the validity of this article and the production "company" to email fobproductions@gmail.com (as seen on the bottom of the page) to assuage your doubts. Maybe they can help you. --Ananth <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ananthram90ib (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ananthram90ib_81bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ananthram90ib">contribs</a>) 2006-01-13 02:09:15 UTC.</small>

<li>Raj again, sorry for the somewhat uncivilized comment. Obviously the movie isn't a hoax. There are images, a poster and everything for the movie. I e-mailed FOB Productions and told them about this. They said that their movie was only reaseled through Desi people through hiearchal <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diffusion.html" title="Diffusion">diffusion</a>. They never had a website or a page for Sarhad Ke Par Dosti, as they did simple chartiable work and didn't bother with webpages. Just cause google does not index something does not mean its a fake. If people are going to base reality on what Google says, then i think that there might me a little bit of a problem with that. I am pretty sure if u type in "The Sky is always Hot Pink" im sure you'll get some hits...and as the wikipedia article said, there was a technical dificulty and the video was accidently removed from Google Video. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.1.25.54 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.1.25.54_b495.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.1.25.54">contribs</a>) 2006-01-13 02:26:05 UTC.</small>

<li><i>Obviously the movie isn't a hoax.</i> — That's not obvious at all. There have been far better presented things than this that have been hoaxes. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:02, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>FOB Productions is a valid production company with a release to its name. As seen in the article, Sarhad Ke Par Dosti is its debut release. FOB plans to release another movie May 2006 for similar purposes. - KM, Plano Resident <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.64.147.122 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.64.147.122_9b83.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.64.147.122">contribs</a>) 2006-01-13 02:46:05 UTC.</small>

<li>I am appalled at the fact that anyone would desire to remove this article. This movie's quality is superior and the content represents the Desi population of Dallas, and the removal of this symbol of the hope and achievements of the Desi pop. will definitely not please them. Personally, many of us down here at Texas Instruments would be disappointed ---FOB PRIDE <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.96.125.205 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.96.125.205_62fe.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.96.125.205">contribs</a>) 2006-01-13 02:47:05 UTC.</small></li>
<li>Ok guys, just for the record.. FOB productions is not a hoax at all. This article should not at all be deleted. I have seen the movie.. and more importantly, i loved it. It may have been a slightly low budget film, but for a group of teenagers, it was fantastic-- definitely represented us desis well: Especially the references to other hindi movies. I hope FOB productions continues to make more films because I, for one, would enjoy to see them. -- Rojaneer <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.1.178.189 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.1.178.189_be50.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.1.178.189">contribs</a>) 2006-01-13 02:52:05 UTC.</small>

<li>Raj again: There is always their e-mail source. If their own e-mails are not proof. Then there is no proof. Does culture chartity organizations that don't have google webpages have to not have articles on wikipedia?. The Desi population is dissapointed. I vote <b>Keep</b> article just like most of the other Desi (i think?) commenters here. the rest is up to wikipedia. The nuggets page thing is completly irrelevant. This page is obviously, as seen by it, not just random links to other pages. It has its own content. And to make up all that stuff seems very unlikely. If this article is deleted, what you would have done was destroy, as someone else said of FOB Productions "symbol of the hope and achievements of the Desi pop". Tell me, Does it harm you in any way is Desi's find pride by having this page up? With it up, many desi people are happy, but your tearing it down, disheartens them. i don't see what the problem is to leave it up if it helps a cultural community? <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_welfare.html" title="Social welfare">social welfare</a> is a very good thing...just to let you know... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.1.25.54 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.1.25.54_b495.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.1.25.54">contribs</a>) 2006-01-13 03:14 UTC.</small></li>

<li>well, if you want your sources, try emailing Fob productions --ananth</li>
<li>For trailers or anything e-mail them. As they are just a culture/charity company I'm pretty sure they won't care showing you how they try to promote their culture.and this is not a promotional site, its to show to others what a group of teens can do. Also, through this, they created an organization called Pragati which collected 600 lbs of clothes to give to poor people in India. As the article says, there is no personal gain here.

If you "true" wikipedians feel that it hurts you all to host this article then i guess itll have to be deleted. obviously true wikipedians just like to delete things.

<li><b>Delete</b>. As per the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> guidelines, <i><b>"Verifiability, not truth"</b></i>. We have a complete lack of third party sources, which means the only people who can tell us the 'truth' are the subjects of the article, and that is <i><b>a bad thing</b></i>. The movie's name doesn't respond in Google. The producers, FOB Productions, score a grand total of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22FOB+Productions%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22FOB+Productions%22" rel="nofollow">7 unique Google responses</a>, which include a model hiring service, advertising for the model service, the Yahoo Group for the model service, the releaser of a hip-hop album titled "FOB", a newsletter of some description, and someone that wants me to install a virused toolbar. If you could provide one relevant website (not created by this production company), or even one article in a newspaper about the film or the company that we can track down and confirm, I'm sure your case would be a lot stronger. Yelling at us and thrusting an email address at us is not going to help you, and will probably hurt. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> - The <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoids.html" title="Zoids"><font color="blue">Zoids</font></a> Expansion Project 04:28, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The purpose of any encyclopedia is to document the truth. lack of verification <i>on the internet</i> is not valid lack of verification, for there exists a world outside of the internet. there is no possible way to cite FOB productions (barring email, which is deemed invalid by many of you) on the internet; it exists in tangible form, it just doesnt happen to be on the internet, seeing as how its not a syndicated movie (how would it get on the internet?), and done on an extremely small scale. nevertheless, it exists. anonymous testimony (it is not as though personal information will increase verifiability) is all that exists on the internet, but there is no other kind of testimony of verification that can possibly be transferred to a web site. Furthermore, there is no reason, evidence, or suspicion to doubt its existence. this is not a "guilty until proven innocent" trial. -Korok
<ul>
<li>Which is why I suggested a newspaper article, if one has been written on the movie or the company, be brought to our attention. Newspapers aren't online, but it isn;t too difficult for someone to contact the paper publisher and ask "Did your newspaper print an article on FOB Productions on the *insert date here*?". They look through their records, they say yes we did or no we didn't... and bingo.

</ul>
</li>
<li>I must agree, that Korok person has a fair point. and those FOB productions sites on google are not the same and as far as anyone can tell, this is a different type of FOB productions. this is a chartiy thing, not a model site or something..and if more screenshots from the movie, or if posting the trailer up will help everyone believe the credibility of FOB Productions then i will get the trailers and put them up. Maybe ill do that right now. --Raj</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Failure to provide a third-party source of verification means it gets my delete vote as a vanity. It may be a charitable vanity, but it's vanity nonetheless. In addition I add a plea that the ones striving to get this article kept stop assuming that everyone who votes against it are anti-charity in some way, or out to get you, or whatever paranoia is involved. As for the arguments that deleting the article will somehow "destroy a dream" and "the removal of this symbol of the hope and achievements of the Desi pop will definately not please them", how much of a dream can it be if it's destroyed simply because Wikipedia guidelines don't allow the article? How much of a symbol of hope is it if you start screaming it's some sort of discrimination or conspiracy not to have it here? As harsh as it may be to sum up the 'keep' arguements this way, perhaps Shakespeare put it best with "It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 19:14, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Absolute, Obvious, Strong Delete</b>. A group of kids made a movie and posted it on Google Video. Then they decided their production company, an acronym for an ethnic slur, would be cute to put into Wikipedia. This is absolutely non-notable. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 23:17, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The movie is not even available on Google video as the article claims. It's just a home movie made by non-notable people. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 00:49, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It was a pretty good movie, but cheesy special effects</p>
