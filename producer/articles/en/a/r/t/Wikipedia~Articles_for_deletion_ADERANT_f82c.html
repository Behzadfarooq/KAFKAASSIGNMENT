<li><b>Move</b> to user space, then let editor see about developing the subject area of legal software. That is, if indeed there are only two choices practical for large legal firms, there must be some intriguing differences in this area from 'plain' accounting software. I don't know if an article specific to office needs relating to <a href="../../../p/r/a/Practice_of_law.html" title="Practice of law">Practice of law</a> is "too specific", but it would be one way to make this relevant.

<li>Thanks for running the search. I've reviewed either the text or the abstract of all 85. All except six were press releases. Three of the hits on page 7 were nonsense hits. (Here's an example quote: "the poor man who needs money to iret It at <b>aderant</b> rate".) The other three were general business articles that used this company as a passing example or that interviewed a VP of the company. None in that search pass the independence requirement for sources. (There were a couple of deadlinks in the list, too.)

<li><b>Delete</b> article is too advert-like and its not our job to clean this up. Not impressed with the Google News archive hits which appear to be press-release announcements (I didn't check them all either since again, for something like this, solid sourcing is the article author's job, not ours). Article was borderline speedyable (i.e. careful review of the cited sources might lead to a conclusion of speedy) but I do have concerns that such review didn't take place, therefore the self-reversal at DRV and bringing it here was correct. 64.160.39.153 01:57, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Spell it the normal way anyway, per <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-TM_00f8.html" title="WP:MOS-TM">WP:MOS-TM</a>. 64.160.39.153 07:18, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure of the intent of <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-TM_00f8.html" title="WP:MOS-TM">WP:MOS-TM</a> - most of the references are to trademarks, while this is the name of the company, and is probably closer to the "MCI" example given, or <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASF_1672.html" title="BASF">BASF</a>. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 07:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>MCI and BASF are acronyms. See the REALTOR example in MOS-TM. 64.160.39.153 08:29, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As the article points out, while <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASF_1672.html" title="BASF">BASF</a>'s name originated as an abbreviation, it is now simply a 4 letter name, consistently spelled in all-caps. The "REALTOR" example is not really applicable, as it refers to non-standard typography of arbitrary words used as product trademarks or for effect, promotional purposes, etc., not a company name. See also many other examples off all-cap names on Wikipedia, including <a href="../../../m/b/n/MBNA_586f.html" title="MBNA">MBNA</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/n/RAND_0a12.html" title="RAND">RAND</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/o/REO_Motor_Car_Company_b0be.html" title="REO Motor Car Company">REO Motor Car Company</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/SPAR_e711.html" title="SPAR">SPAR</a>, etc. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 03:12, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All of which are acronyms, and therefore <i>should</i> be capitalised. Aderant is a "stylized typography". We capitalise things because they're acronyms, not because some company's marketing department tells us to. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 00:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Again, read <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASF_1672.html" title="BASF">BASF</a>, while historically an acronym, is now simply the name of the company. If they had decided for some reason to go with, say, <b>MASF</b>, would their article suddenly be forced to <b>Masf</b>? REO happened to be the initials of Ransom E. Olds, but it was never the <b>R</b>ansom <b>E</b> <b>O</b>lds Company, simply REO as a "word". "RAND" is similar. Should THX Ltd. be forced to Thx Ltd? If the ADERANT people came up with some bogus story about how the name was actually an acronym, would that somehow require a change to all-caps? There is <a href="../../../n/o/v/NOVA_Chemicals_436d.html" title="NOVA Chemicals">NOVA Chemicals</a> (and I'm sure others), which seem to have no historical abbreviation roots at all, although it shouldn't matter in any case. I have no problem squashing arbitrary typography of common words or product names sprinkled in an article, but if a company name is commonly capitalized, then that should be reflected, abbreviation or not. I would also note that that things like "<a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>" is also a stylized typography, and Wikipedia goes to some trouble in apologizing for not reproducing it properly. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 05:05, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, without prejudice. I would second the suggestion that the creator take it to user space and work on finding additional information, establish notability, and remove some of the undue excess (the complete exec list, etc). As mentioned, it is mostly a (good-faith) rehash of information available from press releases and the company site. A quick Google doesn't seem to indicate any obvious sources of further information - as a private company there seems to be nothing on revenues, sales, etc. that could serve to indicate size, or anything compellingly indicating that lawfirm accounting software necessarily requires an entry. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 06:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Additional comment - my delete vote was mainly due to lack of indepedent information to create a useful article. In theory I have no real objection to an entry for the company - it will be up to the closing admin to compare with other private companies with similarly limited coverage. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 09:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think David Oberst raises a good point that the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> guideline creates a <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a> against private companies. Public companies generate lots of press coverage due to their public filings and access to media covering the securities industry. Private companies do not get the same type of media coverage, even if they are of equal size and economic importance. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 15:47, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That is a recognized condition that has been discussed several times at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, the Village Pump and a number of other places. Each time we discuss it, we again realize that can not become Wikipedia's job to solve that particular problem. Encyclopedias are, by definition, tertiary sources. We synopsize what others have already written about. When reputable, independent sources correct their bias and begin to cover private companies in the same depth that they cover public companies, we will be able to follow and synopsize those writings. Until then, we must not compromise our existing standards of independence and verifiability. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small></li>

<li>Companies generate lots of press releases, so they are rightly devalued. But reputable publishers do not reprint every press release they receive, so when a press release is re-published, it adds value. When they are consistently picked up, this is circumstantial evidence of notability. Not sufficient on its own, but better than used bathwater. The point is to use common sense here--the company is obviously not trivial. We need to apply guidelines judiciously. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 09:39, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

We can assume that reputable trade publications do not publish unjustified press releases; I consider them RSs in real life, and I do here. (Now, if there were any actual challenges to the veracity, that might require more of a demonstration.) For the commercial world, its enough <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:03, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Nobody said they were disreputable. What was said was that we apparently lack the independently verifiable sources on which to base a current article. Press releases, even if republished in many newspapers, remain an inherent conflict of interest. Press releases are routinely published without verification in the business sections of newspapers. Articles written by reporters employed by the newspaper, however, are fact-checked and reviewed by other staff before publication and are given greater weight because the newspaper has put their reputation behind the accuracy of the report when they authorize the byline. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> how is a multi-national company not notable? Also since <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomson_Corporation_c35c.html" title="Thomson Corporation">Thomson Corporation</a> is apparently unchallenged for notability, and ADERANT is it's major competitor, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> would suggest it should be included as well for balance. I think this is a case of anti-commercial bias creating an unrealistic standard for inclusion of company articles. I am by no means an inclusionist who would want to see articles about every sole-proprietorship, but obviously this company's products are well known in it's industry, so the subject is inherently notable, and better references probably exist. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 11:21, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>After doing additional research, adding references to the article, and trimming the content, I strongly believe that deletion is not appropriate at this time. Deletion is an extreme remedy for the objections raised here, as the references given are now sufficient to support the content. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 10:40, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I found <a href="http://www.almevents.com/hotdata/publishers/almevents/advertiser/7515535/566399/new_york_2005_review.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.almevents.com/hotdata/publishers/almevents/advertiser/7515535/566399/new_york_2005_review.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> independent secondary source reference which addresses the subject directly and places it in context. Because it supports a claim of notability, I added it to the article. Since this article is no longer an A7 candidate the nomination is no longer valid, particularly since it is only a procedural nomination. Therefore this discussion should be closed. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 00:11, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Contested A7 deletion simply means that the speedy deletion has been questioned, so Afd is the answer, no need to close <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">Ryanpostlethwaite</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">talk</a> 00:15, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The premise of the discussion is that the article is an A7 candidate, since it is not, much of the discussion is now moot. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 00:28, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, not. A7 is no <b>assertion</b> of notability. Since various editors (and/or socks) have asserted notability, the discussion now revolves around whether the notability criteria of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> are met or not. <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 00:35, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly, the discussion has forked--therefore no valid consensus can result from this process (e.g. see the first few comments below). <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 00:42, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The discussion has evolved. A valid consensus can still be reached. <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 00:45, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This discussion has not forked because it was never about speedy-deletion criterion A7 - that decision was answered when the speedy-deletion was overturned. This discussion has always been about whether there are sufficient sources to meet the criteria of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> - a significantly higher standard which requires research and discussion and is therefore inappropriate for the speedy-deletion process.<br />
Having read the almevents.com link you provided above, I remain unconvinced. That page contains a passing mention to ADERANT but is not primarily about the company. It confirms only that ADERANT has a blackberry interface. I also challenge the independence of that source since the almevents.com site files it under "advertisers" and every paragraph in that page includes a sales contact. Advertising materials, like press releases, do not constitute independent sources. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 04:50, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The nomination only mentions A7, so that is what the discussion should be about. If it was about <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and whether the references given were good enough, then the page should have been tagged {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}} first. If your assertion is correct, then taking a short cut by going from Speedy-A7 directly to AfD without giving editors notice and time to do additional research sets a bad precedent, and is only further evidence that this process is fatally flawed and should be stopped now. I have no procedural objection to closing this without prejudice, tagging it {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}} and after a reasonable period of time, if an editor still thinks it should be deleted, renominating it making a cogent argument for deletion. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 10:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Regarding the <i>In Brief</i> article by Karen Jones, I disagree with your analysis. Almvents.com was the sponsor of the trade show, and hosted a reprint of the magazine article because it was about the trade show. ADERANT was an exhibitor, and therefore an advertiser of the trade show. Karen Jones was publisher of <i>In Brief</i> magazine, which covered the legal industry and is independent of both. It only published between 2000-2005 and is now defunct, so any additional content they may have had on ADERANT is no longer available online. I also disagree with your devaluing of the article content because it was not exclusively about the subject. An article covering several related subjects is even more valuable than a feature article primarily about the company because it gives context. Feature articles can be bought and paid for, either by buying advertising, taking a reporter to dinner, or passing money under the table. Because this article discusses both this company, and its major competitor, along with related companies, we can judge relative importance, which is really the basis of notability. Because the author did not list all the exhibitors, and only focused on a hand-full of them, this is tangible secondary source evidence of notability. And it does not just talk about the Blackberry. The money quote is the one added to the article: “Aderant...have developed real time reporting and analysis that is becoming essential to profitability in law firms.” <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 10:35, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
