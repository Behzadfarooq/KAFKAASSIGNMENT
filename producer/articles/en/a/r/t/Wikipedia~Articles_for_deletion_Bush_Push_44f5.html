<li><b>Keep</b> Individual plays can be notable. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Play_c4c5.html" title="The Play">The Play</a>. SI.com has both of these on their list of greatest college football game plays. It does need to be written in a more NPOV and needs more sources (I added one before this AfD), but being poorly written isn't grounds for deletion. "Bush Push" + football gets 28,000 google hits as well. Furthermore, I have heard the term being used in NFL games by announcers when the ball carrier is pushed. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 23:31, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The results of the play are clearly notable, and the play itself was one of the key factors in those results.

<li><b>Merge</b> Although the article requires cleanup, the topic is certainly notable and encyclopedic under all applicable Wikipedia standards, as well as any imaginable common-sense standard. If the only available options were Keep and Delete, I would vote Strong Keep. However, the game in which this play occurred is itself notable and encyclopedic, and as such, I would argue that this article should be merged with a newly created article about the game. Unlike <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Play_c4c5.html" title="The Play">The Play</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Catch_%28American_football%29_4585.html" title="The Catch (American football)">The Catch</a>, the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaculate_Reception_5506.html" title="Immaculate Reception">Immaculate Reception</a>, the Doug Flutie <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hail_Mary_pass_e730.html#History" title="Hail Mary pass">Hail Mary</a> and other notable plays, the Bush Push was part of a game that will be remembered for much more than just that one play. The USC-Notre Dame game of October 15, 2005 is widely considered one of the best games in college football history (some would say <i>the</i> best, but it's probably too early to make that judgment), and it had two other plays/moments that were just as individually memorable/extraordinary as the Bush Push: the 4th-and-9 pass from Matt Leinart to Dwayne Jarrett, and the out-of-bounds fumble by Leinart which caused the Notre Dame student section to prematurely rush the field, thinking they'd won the game because the clock had prematurely run out. The Bush Push, of course, was the next play. But even beyond these three plays/moments, the whole game was extraordinary and notable. It was one of the most-hyped games in recent memory (for example, the Friday-night pep rally at Notre Dame Stadium was nationally televised), and yet amazingly, it managed to exceed the hype. The game also proved very significant to the overall 2005 college football season, as it allowed USC to remain undefeated and ultimately reach the national-title game; if the Irish had won, they might very well have reached the title game in the Trojans' stead, or else Penn State would have gone. Anyway, the game itself deserves an article, and the Bush Push should be a substantial segment of that article, and the Bush Push page should redirect to that article. 129.74.201.21 15:09, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> If the only available options are Keept and Delete, I would delete. The article, while covering a notable and encyclopedic topic, is not itself very encyclopedic. It is written with a sneer at Notre Dame. If an option is to rewrite it as objectively as possible, then by all means keep it. For example, "a well-known ploy" with respect to the green jerseys. That statement has little encyclopedic value. Also, the author is mistaken that "Irish partisans . . . roared with approval." Sure, they cheered for the team, but Irish fans in the stadium were generally apprehensive about the green jerseys. Anyway, what does all this talk about jerseys have to do with the play? It seems to serve the contributors purpose to simply mock and sneer at Notre Dame. I would keep the basic facts, but re-write it without any bias. I would also modify it so that all spelling errors are corrected ("rejoyced" anyone?).</li>
