<p>Bio of "prophetic geographer" credited with, among other things, being the first to note that India was an emerging world power (in, from what I can tell, 2005) and being a profound influence on someone the article refers to as "George Walter Bush, junior, the USA President". The sources that clearly bear on the subject are from MSN groups; the others appear mostly to underpin other aspects of the article's tortuous argument. The man most likely exists, but whether his world influence rises to the <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notable</a> certainly seems questionable. His name has recently been inserted into a range of other articles, from <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist_geography.html" title="Feminist geography">Feminist geography</a> to <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geopolitics.html" title="Geopolitics">Geopolitics</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 15:13, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Also, the Re-election of the War-Happy George Walter Bush, junior, the USA President further complicated the Global-Security Scenario. Simultaneously, the growing enmeshing and bonding of people all over the Globe in terms of the instant communication facilitated by the digital technology like the World Wide Web, popularly called the Internet, apparently started melting away the snow mountain of political boundaries to the ocean of insignificance."</i> --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanreitz_5938.html" title="User:Danreitz">Danreitz</a> 18:04, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Though there is a citation list, external link list, and sources list, the article is very difficult to navigate right now. I'm hoping someone who cares about the article being kept will take the time to clean this up, i.e. connect facts in the article with the source from which they come. Also, the MSN links add a particularly unprofessional flavor; please consider providing more scholarly sources if they are available.

<li><b>Delete</b> listed sources are vague. Verifiablity problem, notability not established, a bunch of emails on MSN pages do not constitute reliable sources.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The Hindi <i>dainik</i>s (dailies) have probably published few of his poems, but that doesn't make him a notable Hindi poet.

<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> . <i>Thakur Sher Singh Parmar</i> and <i>Sher Singh Parmar</i> are variants of the same name.If a person has contributed to so many branches of geography, then naturally it is reflected in terms of his inclusion unde many headings.Receipt of a national level award like Dr.Manibhai Desai Rashtraseva Puraskar for contribution to hindi literature itself shows this person is notable.NO NON-NOTABLE RECEIVES SUCH A PRESTIGIOUS AWARD.The sources of dainiks show clearly that all his poems have been published and as such these have found a mention on the page. If this seems to be a biography , well what other Wikipedians doing - why don't they improve upon it.Its very easy to destroy or delete anything but it needs some hard work to improve.So why we don't improve upon this article instead of being bent upon destroying it.To say that "I don't see any MSN web pages on India's page. It does have several .gov and .org links, which, like .edu links, tend to be a bit more scholarly than .com ... and especially groups.msn.com." is sheer nonsense because scholarly articles can appear on any web pages including the MSN pages and by the way one can doubt that the so-called scholarly artciles on ".gov and .org links" are there simply because the scholars writing these had good personal relations with their editors and so managed to get their articles published there. All the objections being raised have only one clear aim of deleting this page, seems people are bent upon deleting this page.Honest officers like Sher Singh Parmar have thousands enemy who would like to see that no one comes to know of these honest people."And I cannot find any of these variants in book sources such as <a href="http://www.worldcat.org" class="external text" title="http://www.worldcat.org" rel="nofollow">WorldCat</a>." saying this is just running away from truth.If his name is not found on some searches then it means that the people running those searches have poor technology unlike GoogleIf we apply the logics being given by all these counter-vandal patrollers and others, then we have to delete all the pages from Wikipedia.There shall be no Wikipedia at all.I request the ADMINISTARTORS OF WIKIPEDIA TO BE MORE VIGILANT AND RETAIN THE CURRENT PAGE.</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Thanks for the clarification; I can now comfortably move my input from weak to strong delete. I have requested more information, asked relevant questions, suggested room for improvement and have not received any answers other than POV. If my questions were answered (perhaps the most important being one I posted here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Amita_karpe" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Amita_karpe" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), I would gladly help you clean up the article in hopes of it surviving the AfD process. If there is no material published regarding this person in a book with an ISBN or a journal with an ISSN, then ... he is probably not noteworthy and doesn't deserve an article in WP. If you have the ISBN or ISSN, then please share it so I can verify it with my own resources. Another piece of information that would be helpful, since I've heard this is such a prestigious award, is a verifiable source listing of all the other winners of Dr. Manibhai Desai Rashtraseva Puraskar's award, before and after Thakur Sher Singh Parmar's receipt. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 13:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Y. Patil Institute of Management &amp; Research, Pimpri- info@dypim.ac.in Department of Management Sciences, University of Pune- pumba@dms.unipune.ernet.in Moder college- [<a href="http://intcent.unipune.ernet.in/site/students_admitted2005-06.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://intcent.unipune.ernet.in/site/students_admitted2005-06.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>] Someone should write to this college authorities and ask them- Does book "Geography,Economics and Economic Geography" by someone called Thakur Sher Singh Parmar exist in its library? If Yes, then how many copies does it have? IF THE CLAIM THAT THIS BOOK IS VERY POPULAR IN AND AROUND PUNE are true then this book should also be available in these management colleges of Pune. Same questions should be asked to all departments of geography in Pune. Patrolla 14:41, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment - I don't doubt that the book exists, and I don't doubt that there are many copies of it. However, if with my research and communication skills, I cannot find any reference to the book, and no-one can give me a citation that points to a published book, then, I am not convinced that we need an article on Parmar at this time. Even if the article is deleted, we can continue to work on this ... I have a colleague who has family in India ... maybe, just maybe, I'll involve him if he expresses interest.

<dd>Wikipedia readers (or AfD checkers) shouldn't have to be writing to colleges to find out if someone or their book exists, but should be quoted reliable sources by the article's writers, whose responsibility it is to do that. Whether the guy or his books exists or not isn't the point. The Wikipedia policy is "verifiability, not truth". (That doesn't mean verifiability of whether the person exists, by the way. The requirement is made explicit in the proposed policy <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reputable published source, not whether it is true".) <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 17:10, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. From looking at the article, it reflects a lot of energy and information-gathering, but unfortunately the information does not include what Wikipedia considers reliable sources. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">User:Keesiewonder</a> has done a Herculean job of trying to validate what was provided, but did not come up with anything. I previously did not find an OPAC (an online public access catalog) that was web accessible at any library based in India. The lack of such a catalog may perhaps slow down the process of checking that the books that are named really exist. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 17:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
