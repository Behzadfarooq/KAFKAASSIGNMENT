<dd>Trying to read too many posts too close together, my apologies. I saw the "I will delete the article myself." by Travb, above, followed by your comment. For some reason I registered you (Petral) as the one who said that. Let me try this again:</dd>

<dd>Have you ever been involved in something that you really enjoy, a book, a movie, a warm bath. etc. And some rude idiot comes along and ruins it. I was smack dab in the middle of creating this article, minding my own business when <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetral_adf6.html" title="User:Petral">Petral</a> came along and ruined my "warm bath". I was going along, enjoying myself in a certain train of thought, and then all the sudden I get interupted, I get pulled out of the bath, thrown outside, and beat by some stranger. That may be historonics, but that is how I feel. I got to the point, I just wanted to throw up my hands and delete the damn article. I started a new article, and <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetral_adf6.html" title="User:Petral">Petral</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetral_adf6.html" title="User:Petral">Petral</a>'s friends (maybe sockpuppers of Petral) all put that article up for deletion too.Travb 04:13, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"The possibility can be imagined" is not the same thing as "there are grounds for a public accusation." Would you like to specify exactly <i>which</i> of the many people agreeing with Petral, some of whom have more <i>years</i> on Wikipedia than he has <i>days</i>, are purported to be his sockpuppets? When actual <i>evidence</i> surfaces that any particular user is a sockpuppet, present that evidence. Presenting the suspicion as you are now, with <i>no</i> evidence beyond "I can't comprehend why people think my article should be deleted", is only evidence that you are violating <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:26, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
