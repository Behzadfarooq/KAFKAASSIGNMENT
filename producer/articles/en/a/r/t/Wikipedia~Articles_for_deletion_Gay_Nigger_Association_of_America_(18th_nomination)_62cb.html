<li><b>Delete</b>. No reliable sources, I don't think there are any, forums don't count, this is probably more of "Hey look, I can blame my trolling on something else" than a real organization.

The main reason for having kept this in the past is the claim that they're well-known on Slashdot. They aren't. I've been reading Slashdot for quite some time and have never seen even so much as a passing mention of the GNAA. Not one. Ever. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:31, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The GNAA is hardly limited to slashdot. It is a well-known internet community, such as <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albinoblacksheep.html" title="Albinoblacksheep">Albinoblacksheep</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/m/SomethingAwful_0538.html" title="SomethingAwful">SomethingAwful</a>. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmax-_a23e.html" title="User:Jmax-">Jmax-</a> 21:02, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> For what it's worth, I have looked this organization up on Wikipedia previously. With 18 nominations, it's clear that this will keep happening over and over, because many people find the mere existence of the group patently offensive. However, the page appears to be quite well sourced; note that sources such as paper newspapers and major online outlets may be loath to even acknowledge the group's existence or put its name in print. The group is nevertheless notable. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles</a> 16:52, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If nobody will put their name into print, they are not well sourced. Notability does not provide a free pass on verifiability. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 16:54, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>People <i>will</i> put their name into print, just not the most visible (and by extension, those considered most reliable) outlets. GNAA will not, ever, be found in Time or Newsweek, or any daily newspaper in any major or minor city. Some of the sources cited may be unacceptable if the subject were something well-covered in other sources, but in this context, many of the sources used in the article appear to follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>'s use of dubious sources criteria. I urge cleanup, not deletion. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles</a> 17:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does not say that if there are no good sources, it's acceptable to build an article from bad sources.

<li><b>Delete</b> It will almost certainly be kept anyway, but the sources are bilge and yes the credibility or significance of sources does matter. If it doesn't it should. In addition Wikipedia is moving beyond the "computer-dork navel-gazing" era. The nn elements in <a href="../../../s/l/a/Category%7ESlashdot_a58a.html" title="Category:Slashdot">Category:Slashdot</a> have been deleted or merged to <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am not a fan of GNAA but this is the eighteenth AFD, every one has ended at keep. Some people just need to accept that this article exists and get on with your lives.

<ul>
<li>They did not end at keep. The first few ended with no consensus due to terrible arguments, there were some bad faith ones, and then they started all getting speedy kept per the earlier ones. Articles do not get a free pass on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> just because they have a lot of bad AfD discussions. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 19:09, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Absolutely no non-trivial sources. The only source I see that comes close to "reliable" is the Mac Daily News article, which... doesn't mention GNAA.

<li>I encourage you to take a look at the last several nominations, and to consider the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> of the articles. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 20:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I've looked through <i>every</i> reference in the article, and they are all either blogs, forum posts, or from the GNAA website. The vast majority of the previous keeps were "speedy keep per prior afd." I should also point out there was a quasi-pool about the GNAA's 10<sup>th</sup> nomination, which may have encouraged bad faith noms. The last eight AfDs seem like bad faith noms of the form "NN delete" or "encourages trolls". Article has no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 20:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> They are real and they do real things.

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I am not a regular wikipedia contributor but I would like my argument to be heard. Most of the dismissals of GNAA on this page are directly antithetical to the very goals and nature of Wikipedia. To suggest that an organization is irrelevent merely because it could only exist within the recesses of the internet is negating everything this site is trying to establish regarding the validity of collectively established information that only exists in a constant flux. The majority of GNAA's activities are often deleted or censored as they are intended to be parasitic or disruptive to the sites they were placed on. As such they may seem to be less prevalent and pervasive than a polling of the internet zeigeist will clearly show that they are. However, GNAA's antics have been mentioned on G4TechTV (though not by name), as well as on major news sites. They are responsible for numerous changes in the 'slashcode' and are certainly as well-known as many of the memes given ample coverage on this site. The offensive nature of this article is not valid grounds for deletion. To assert offensiveness as a grounds for deletion would be admitting that Wikipedia values the taboos and political sensitivities of the minority over the freedom of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also like to address the dismissal of the previous VFDs. You are allowing Wikipedia to spite itself by argueing that a topic's history on this site is not noteworthy. The number of discussions and VFDs this article has generated SHOULD count for the group's significance. By suggesting that GNAA's contention and considerable debate does not provide notoreity, you are arguing anything documented on Wikipedia that involves the history of Wikipedia or happenings on the site should also be deleted. How many hundreds of references and articles would that negate? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.223.117.181 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.223.117.181_5777.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.223.117.181">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>I believe I just clicked through all the external links on that article that didn't point to gnaa.us or gnaauk.co.uk, which aren't independent sources. I didn't find any non-trivial coverage of GNAA in independent published sources other than personal blogs. There's certainly a lot more content in the article than can be gleaned from the available source material. I would say it's a lot of original research, which has been around for so long because its supporters have been so persistent, and we haven't been strict enough about insisting on verifiability. I suggest we pare the article down to information that can be sourced in reliable secondary sources, and if there's nothing left, delete it. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 01:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weakish Delete</b>: I note that somebody mentioned that freedom of speech should be one such reason to prevent this article being deleted, but I must disagree, freedom of speech doesn't extend to keeping articles which for all I now could be total gibberish made up at school some day. I do find the promotion of a group that uses the word 'nigger' quite unpleasant but that's neither here nor there. I don't see why I should bother adding references to articles if totally unreferenced articles will actually be allowed to remain. That said, if it only needs references, I'd leave the article for 7 days and if no sources are added, the page is deleted and protected to prevent recreation in order to prevent a AfD no 19. <font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b></font> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Heligoland</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Talk</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Contribs</b></font></a> 01:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
