<p>Is this a hoax? There is a musician named Tony Blackplait, and there is a group called The Flowers Of Romance that he is a member of, but how can they possibly be from Sealand? And isn't Sid Vicious a member of the group? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 08:52, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>They are officially a Sealand band. Yes, Sid Vicious was a member at the beginning. I. <i>comment added anonymously at 09:01, 2005 Mar 19 by <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.131.22.53.html" title="User:82.131.22.53">User:82.131.22.53</a></i>

<li><b>Delete</b> this and move the current article <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flowers_of_Romance_%28band%29_06f3.html" title="The Flowers of Romance (band)">The Flowers of Romance (band)</a> here. However, according to the external link, this may be less of a hoax than it appears (if the external link is not a hoax too, which it may be). I think we're looking at 2 bands with the same name, one of which is a allegedly a reformation of the other, but with entirely different members. The Sealand reference seems pretty bogus, but they might claim to be from that "country" as a sort of anarchist statement or something. Anyway, if there's any truth to any of that it can be added to the existing article after it is moved. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:14, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually this should be made into a redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flowers_of_Romance_f97a.html" title="The Flowers of Romance">The Flowers of Romance</a>, which is currently a disambig.

<li>No, you're not from Sealand. You may all have decided to get Sealand passports, but you've clearly not grown up on some disused WWII gun platform just off the English coast, so you're not from there. In the same vein, I wouldn't say Rupert Murdoch is from America, even though he has a US passport, Australia still has to take the blame for him. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:41, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> There is already an article about the original band, from which some of this article's content was copied (see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flowers_of_Romance_%28band%29_06f3.html" title="The Flowers of Romance (band)">The Flowers of Romance (band)</a>). And there is already an article on <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blackplait_f532.html" title="Tony Blackplait">Tony Blackplait</a>, who is a member of the "2nd era" Flowers of Romance. I'm not sure the new band is notable enough to have a separate article beyond <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blackplait_f532.html" title="Tony Blackplait">Tony Blackplait</a>. In any case it should not be in the same article with the original band. I've seen nothing (beyond Blackplait's own claims) that the two bands have anything in common besides the name. <b>Comment:</b> I've been following the edits (see relevant talk pages) at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flowers_of_Romance_%28band%29_06f3.html" title="The Flowers of Romance (band)">The Flowers of Romance (band)</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blackplait_f532.html" title="Tony Blackplait">Tony Blackplait</a>. The latter is a musician, who may or may not have made the personal acquaintance of <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sid_Vicious_3f07.html" title="Sid Vicious">Sid Vicious</a>, claiming to belong to both bands. Whenever I disputed this, the anonymous editor removed my templates, but at least removed or reworded the claims at the same time. Now that he has removed the "vfd" template from the article I'm no longer sure this guy's playing fairly. BTW I'm pretty sure all the anonymous edits (both to here and the articles themselves) are the same person, connecting via <del>Starman ES</del> <ins>Starman AS</ins> in <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>. -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 19:45, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Another <b>comment</b>: FWIW This probably could have been handled as a merge and redirect to the older article, rather than a VfD. If I had seen it myself I probably would have handled it that way, but since the user put it under a different title it slipped under the radar of my watchlist. (I wonder if this was deliberate? Similar variations on the name were already redirects.) As I mentioned, I'd been watching the other article, and the previous edits there are essentially the same content as this one. Back to the day job, -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 16:10, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Hello, I'm TL (I) of the F. I'm sorry about the vfd. The information in the article is allright. But you can remove or delete it if you think so. Best!</li>

<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
