<p>The article survived a VFD in 2004, as outlined on the article's discussion page. The template for <i>2nd nomination</i> does not appear to work, perhaps because that was before AFD replaced VFD. He is described as a popular singer in New York City in the 1980's but I can't find any articles about him in the New York Times from that or any any period. He is described as a friend of two notable musicians, but that does not satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. To have an article, he should have been the primary subject of articles multiple independent reliable sources. He should have issued popular records, or had other claims to fame than being described as a good and popular singer without good sources to show that was so. Seems to lack proof of enough having once had notability enough for an article <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:47, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - per nom. I note that both responses to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roberto_Tirado&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=70343965" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roberto_Tirado&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=70343965" rel="nofollow">citation needed tags</a> I applied on 2 November 2006 fail to satisfy. The first, intended to back up the claim that Tirado was known as "Phil Spector's pet" contains no such information. Furthermore, the writing contained in the link was penned by Tirado himself. The second reference, which should support the statement that Tirado opened for the Main Ingredient at Sweetwater's with a performance that critics considered "witty and fascinating" contains nothing about Sweetwater's, the Main Ingredient, or any specific Tirado performance - and includes no critical comment .<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 00:13, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am Roberto Tirado and although I am considered for deletion at Wikipedia, I am not in any way disappointed or upset at the consensus for deletion. Although it appears that there are criteria to be met for maintenance of an article in Wikipedia, there are actually much more contributions that have not been written about me here. In addition, I am a published authored and songwriter, among other talents. There have been numerous newspaper articles in the Spanish media written about me, of which I conserve copies, and a new biography about singer Lucecita Benitez will also contain a section about me. All things considered, I remain available for any questions or comments at erosben@hotmail.com. Thank you!</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Spanish language newspapers or magazines could be good sources to show in a verifiable way that someone is notable. And Wikipedia's policy is that notability does not go away; if Roberto Tirado was a notable musician 20 years ago, and if there were several articles in "reliable sources" <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> where Mr. Tirado was a primary subject, and they were substantial and not just, say, a mention that he was appearting somewhere, but a review, that could clearly support keeping the article. I did check the New York Times, but I have no idea what might have appeared in the Spanish language papers. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:25, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> While I agree that Spanish language media should be considered - and encourage those with the knowledge to pass on references - I do find it curious that Mr Tirado, "a popular singer/musician" and "hot item in the latin night club circuit" escaped the notice of <i>The New York Times</i>. I'm afraid I can't give too much weight to Mr Tirado as a published author since his book, <i>The Chosen Journey</i>, was published by <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trafford_Publishing_6214.html" title="Trafford Publishing">Trafford Publishing</a>, a vanity press in Victoria, British Columbia. I can find no listing for any biography of Lucecita Benitez (new or otherwise) at the Library of Congress, abebooks, or amazon.com. While I think the article could be strengthened by the inclusion of information on Mr Tirtado's album, I note that a goodle search for "Lando records" (the label mentioned in the article) + "Tirado" garners one ghit - that being this very article. The album in question is not held by the Library of Congress. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 00:35, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The New York Times is NOT the defintive source for Latino or Hispanic artists, actors, etc. Rarely does this NY newspaper write reviews on Latino or Hispanic artists unless it's a funeral such as Celia Cruz' or perhaps Jennifer Lopez' latest films. Once more, I have no problem with deletion of my post. Yes, Trafford Publishing IS a vanity press, but Amazon does sell my book and although Victoriagirl does make excellent search, my two recordings were published under Richport Music Company, of which is registered with the State of New York as a legitimate business. One English language newspaper that I have appeared in was the Daily News on Friday, March 5, 1993, when an ad appeared for my Sweetwater's cafe concert in the Entertainment section. Otherwise, the following newspapers and magazines have written articles and notes about me: NOTICIAS DEL MUNDO, FARANDULA, ESTRELLAS, EL EXPRESO HISPANO, EL VOCERO. Obviously, I keep copies of most of the articles written about me. In fact, I have been contacted by various people to make a comeback, most notably by Ray Rodriguez and his Latin Jazz Band, of whom is freely available on the net. Nonetheless, I appreciate Wikipedia's writers and volunteers' efforts to verify the veracity of its contents. Roberto Tirado</p>
