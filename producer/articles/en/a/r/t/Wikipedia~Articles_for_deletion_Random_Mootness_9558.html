<p>Random Mootness is a common expression in the North-eastern United States. This page should not be flagged for deletion, as it is an expression that is severely under-represented on the Internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22random+mootness%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22random+mootness%22" rel="nofollow">google search</a> found absolutely no references to "random mootness" on the WWW. That makes me doubtful it's a common expression.--<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanoeguy81_3202.html" title="User:Canoeguy81">Canoeguy81</a> 06:28, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>As previoiusly stated, this expression is under-represented on the Internet; hence the reason for the Wikipedia entry. It is purely colloqial - Western-half of NY, PA, Ohio &amp; Western Maryland especially. If you have access to a major university library, I can provide you with the names of scholarly linguistics journals which have documented this expression, as a colleague of mine has written extensively on such topics.</p>

<p>Thanks Kappa - I think I'll just throw in the towel though. Maybe when Merriam-Webster picks up the expression, someone else will add it to the Wikis.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> and comment: No one's biting anyone and no one wishes for you to throw in the towel. After looking at your edit history, I noticed that most of your edits simply didn't qualify as encyclopedia entries. The one you did about "shoe shopping" was a perfect example of what I mean. That isn't elitism at all. It's a combination of common sense and wise use of the site's resources. Opening an account won't necessarily mean your anonymous contributions would lack credibility. If anything, it'll strengthen your position. The door's open. Come on in. If that isn't anti-elitism, I don't know what is. - Lucky 6.9 07:22, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Ok, relax and read the updated version. Hopefully you'll agree it's up to "Wiki" standards. It was my belief that the point of the Wiki was to introduce the topic as a sort of "Place-holder" for update later. I didn't expect to have to spend as much time as I have, for a simple explanation. Futhermore, the Random nonesense, as you put it, is the key to Random Mootness. I wouldn't believe you one bit if you said you've never discussed "Who would win..." in hypothetical scenarios. Animal Planet seems to think it has enough merit to do an entire series of Random Mootness as it relates to the animal kindom - not by that name, of course.

<li>Lots of hits on Google, but most, perhaps all, are irrelevant. The article's of some interest, but it's essayistic and about an insignificant neologism. <b>Delete</b>. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:15, 2005 Apr 9 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've certainly never heard of "random mootness" and I don't feel as though I know much more about it having read the article. Why does the "Related Random Mootness" section have a link to "Wikiepedia"? Unless somebody can demonstrate the widespread existence of this phenomenon (involving an audience of at least 5,000) I will vote to <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliverkeenan_148a.html" title="User:Oliverkeenan">Oliver Keenan</a> 09:58, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC). In fact this is worse than I first thought, if you look at the links in the "Related Random Mootness" section, they are to an array of bizarre, random, totally unrelated pages, a significant percentage of which are also on the VfD page. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliverkeenan_148a.html" title="User:Oliverkeenan">Oliver Keenan</a> 10:00, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am new to Wikipedia, so I hope I am adding my note appropriately. A friend pointed out this page. Based on personal experience, I would expect the "audience" to well exceed 5,000. I do not believe the article should be removed, but the author of the article has made an error. Per the article, the genealogy of the term involves the sitcom Seinfeld. Seinfeld ran from 1989-1998. The term took hold in WNY (Buffalo and Rochester, NY and surrounding regions) prior to that time. Although I have no evidence to verify the relationship other than personal observation, the term seems to stem from an episode of Saturday Night Live that first aired on 10/20/84. Jesse Jackson was a guest on the show. At one point, he played a character in a game show. When asked a question, he responds “The question is moot. I’ll take the car!” I did not see the episode, but noticed that the word “moot” was being overused in everyday language in my high school – with the meaning becoming more general, akin to irrelevant. After inquiring, I was advised that quite a few people had seen the episode and that the word stuck a chord as being humorous. Therefore, it stuck. Keep in mind that SNL carried terrific ratings at this point. Shortly after that time, the expression seemed to naturally expand into “random mootness”. I later went to SUNY-Buffalo and usage of the term was widespread. Apparently, the phenomenon was not limited to my high school. Again, I have no idea how or why… 21 years later, both “moot” and “random mootness” continue to be commonplace terms in the area. I do not know if everyone uses it, but many do. One specific place where I have heard it repeatedly is at Buffalo Bills football or Buffalo Sabres hockey games over the years. When a play goes against the home team, I have often heard – and, admittedly, occasionally said – comments along the line of “Oh, that was just moot!” or “C’mon, ref! What is with this random mootness?” I do not mean to imply that the term is only used at sporting events, as I hear it in the workplace and many other settings. In summary, I am surprised that the term is geographically isolated and am equally surprised that it has no presence on the web. However, why would anyone bother? To me, it is like devoting a page to the term “oh, boy” or “I agree”. It is just a phrase… However, it is clear that many people are not familiar with it. If Wikipedia is a place to spread this type of information, then I think it should stay. By the way, one poster comments “…links in the "Related Random Mootness" section, they are to an array of bizarre, random, totally unrelated pages…”. Are you missing the point? The author is trying to better define the term by linking to “random mootness”. I don't have a user name.12.19.225.242 13:27, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
