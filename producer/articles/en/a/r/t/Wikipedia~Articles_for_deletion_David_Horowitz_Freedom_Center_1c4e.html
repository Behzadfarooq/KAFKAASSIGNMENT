<dd>According to Wikitionary: "Censorship: the use of state or group power to control freedom of expression, such as passing laws to prevent media from being published or propagated." Not the case here. I removed a comment based on <i>my</i> right in an open source forum to do so, and based on my experiences with wikipedia and the cautionary use of the above template. Nothing more. You replaced your comment, which again is <i>your</i> right to do so. As the comment below points out, the template wording may have changed. I was reacting to what I thought was an unnecessary addition/comment to the template which seeks to remind all users that this isn't a poll. You see it a different way. That's fine, and I won't remove your comment this time around. But let's keep things in perspective when it comes to <i>rights</i> on this forum. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 14:40, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your help, Andy but I doubt it is worth pursuing, and I don't want to keep any grudges or hard feelings. In fact I can see how this thread is distracting from the actual AFD, so if anyone else would want to move the whole thing to the discussion page, go ahead, that would be fine with me. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 16:06, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not trolling for another fight, but I thought you should get some support. Being right is better when you get some validation. Anyway, as an gesture promoting AGF, I've asked <b>chimneybrown</b> (Cbrown1023), the admin who deleted DTN over my objections, to look at this AfD with a view to closing it. It's turned into such a rout that the gesture has been somewhat devalued, but better late than never. I think that'll put everything on the Discussion page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyvphil_06f3.html" title="User:Andyvphil">Andyvphil</a> 23:54, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, what that template does is invite the closing admin to IGNORE the consensus majority and susbstitute his own whim, since clearly there are two different opinions here as to whether or not this is notable; it will come down to only one person's opinion. This makes everything below to establish consensus meaningless. I vehemently object to that template. If you are going to gag my speech here, remove the template also. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 14:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. Should be a keep unless an unreasonable admin does a drive-by delete. My first AfD was DTN, and an admin did just that: no explanation of why he thought there was a consensus, no cleanup of the dead links, no retention of history so that material could be merged... Left a bad taste, and me less willing to AGF in the face of evidence to the contrary. Hipocrite's nomination is typical of what he's been doing. No effort involved on his part, just involves everone else in a lot of wasted effort dealing with his messes. He's not the only one.

Since the David Horowitz Freedom Center topic has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and of each other such that there exists enough source material to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic, David Horowitz Freedom Center meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 17:22, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Since it seems we are now being encouraged to continue the argument here rather than simply demonstrate a consensus, let me address the RS question here. The people who claim that DHFC is not a reliable source (for itself, or anything else) have yet to provide even ONE instance where information on that site has proved to be unreliable or erroneous. They provide their sources and footnotes for all their information better than wikipedia does, and every statement they have made so far has indeed been corroborated as far as I know. Claiming it is "uncorroborated" etc. is a merely part of a non-neutral political ploy designed to tilt the balance of wikipedia in general over to one side. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 15:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
