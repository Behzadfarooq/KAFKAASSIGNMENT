<li><b>Comment <s>without vote</s></b> <s>(for now)</s>. The article does assert notability as it mentions the effects of the community on the sports entertainment industry.

<dd>Their comments were contingent on substantial changes to the article (which is still almost completely unreferenced). Have these changes been implemented?

<dd>I am still relying on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, actually. The four sources are not independent of the topic of the article; namely, they in fact originate within the very same group of people this article attempts to describe. For it to comply with the first two Wikipedia policies, there needs to be a source from outside the professional wrestling industry and the purported internet wrestling community... say, from a newspaper (site) or national news service. For the lack of such, I remain abstaining for the time being. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 07:34, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The term is generic and self-described. The notability would be that pro wrestlers and promoters acknowledge this group even if it's not always direct. The sources in the article are usually responses to wrestlters who are usually criticizing the IWC. It might be good to get the direct source from Matt Hardy or Eric Bischoff when commenting on internet wrestling fans. I noticed there's a couple of merge votes to <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smark.html" title="Smark">Smark</a> but that has no sources at all and that apparently is now being afd'd. The term IWC is being used much more than "Smark" now I can tell you that. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 21:32, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But still no independent sources - that's the problem here. You have basically admitted that it cannot meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (side question: have you tried seeing if it's been used in mainstream media sites? I know Alex Marvez has been following and writing about it for years for newspapers in Ohio and Florida). As for <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smark.html" title="Smark">Smark</a>: it too is up at AfD for essentially the same reason (and that it is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>). <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:03, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>What is the threshold for "reliable sources" for this subject matter? It would be people in the industry at the very least. This group may not get a segment on the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> or <a href="../../../6/0/_/60_Minutes_b078.html" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a> but it is notable among wrestling fans. To me, verifiability means something that can be confirmed even if it is not presently sourced. Just because some major outlet outside of the industry has not done something on it, I believe, does not in itself mean sources have to be outside the scope of the industry. That would be like saying a scientist(reputable of course) who does research on evolution is not a good enough citation because no outside media reported on it and therefore any article on evolution should be deleted. I'm sure many scientists would dispute that notion.<a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 03:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a weak analogy as scientific research usually - eventually - gets reported to, and by, media beyond the people doing the research. Secondarily, since <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> has still some controversy attached to it, it would be likely to be reported by media on both sides of it.<a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 02:21, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It probably wasn't worded in the best way. My point was that if something was notable in the scientific community does it need some sort of coverage by the media or referenced by some other group like, say, the freemasons? Or anyone else not related to science for that to be included? Do you see what I'm trying to say? <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 05:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC) For example, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terraforming_of_Venus_0e8e.html" title="Terraforming of Venus">Terraforming of Venus</a> does not cite any references outside the scientific community. Does that mean it should be deleted based on your criteria? <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 05:42, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per MrMurph101 vote and Arthur Fonzarelli. Just because a term is not well-known among the mainstream community does not automatically make it unencyclopedic; an encyclopedia is meant to be a place where the uneducated can learn about these things. Just as long as it's not filled with useless trivia, I'll stand by my vote. [[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriguy52748_613a.html" title="User:Briguy52748">Briguy52748</a> 17:31, 6 December 2006 (UTC)]]</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I do not find the external references to be sufficiently well-grounded. It is not enough to cite references outside Wikipedia; it is also necessary that these references would be generally regarded as substantial and targetted at what would count for a broad audience within the general subject area. Thus narrow fan websites don't count, and nor do websites which are run by fans posing as journalists. We need more solid references ( a reputable professionally published wrestling magazine or two would do the trick nicely ). The question I ask myself about articles like this is "could this come up as the answer to a million-dollar quiz-show question?" Clearly something like <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayfabe.html" title="Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/c/Face_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Face (professional wrestling)">face</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heel_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Heel (professional wrestling)">heel</a> could come up, but I can't imagine a fair quiz-show expecting the subject of this article as an answer. So on balance, I think this article should go. It also has the scent of OR, which I don't care for, but that's a separate issue. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:19, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
