"Gay" is not a neologism being propagated by an organization called "the Gays". If it was, "gay" and the organization based on it would certainly merit a single article together until "gay" became noteworthy enough for its own article.

<li>Fundamentally false analogies, much worse than the one provided by Graham above. The example of the term being used in a recent book establishes enough notability for there to be <b>one</b> article on the matter (as opposed to none whatsoever), not for there to be <b>two</b>. The concept/word "bright" is to the movement "Bright" as the concept/word "Christianity" is to the movement "Christianity". Arguing that "bright" is to "Bright" as "Christianity" is to "Jesus" is patently absurd, both in the figurative and literal sense. In the literal sense, Bright is not a person. In the figurative sense, Bright and bright are not clearly-distinct (they're only distinguished by a technicality) nor clearly-noteworthy (both are very borderline). Your examples are rhetoric, not reason. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 02:29, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was responding to JoshuaZ's suggestion that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> be redirected to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>. And, ummm, the correct analogy is: bright is to bright (movement) as Christianity is to organisations that promote Christianity (e.g. churches of various types, missionary organisations etc.). So if you insist on being positively Talmudic, I'll rephrase: "<b>Keep</b> Obviously. Well, that, or turn <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> into a disamb page linking to (among other things) <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> etc." The facts are these: there is an organisation that promotes the use of the term "bright". We should have an article on that. Then there is the CONCEPT of being a bright (which, despite your unsourced assertion) DOESN'T simply mean <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Naturalism (philosophy)">naturalism (philosophy)</a>. We should have an article about this as well. Whether we name the article <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Bright (philosophy)">bright (philosophy)</a> and turn <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> into a disambig or keep the status quo, I don't care. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkerpikker_c3cf.html" title="User:Mikkerpikker">Mi<font color="darkred">kk</font>er</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkerpikker_77de.html" title="User talk:Mikkerpikker"><sup>...</sup></a> 15:58, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps your latter suggestion is the best. Rather than keep <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> as it is, in it's confusing state as to what "bright" really describes, we should rename the current "Bright" article to become a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Bright (philosophy)">bright (philosophy)</a> and make <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> a disambiguation. At that instance, it would compromise by ensuring an article about both the movement and actual philosophy, but still be able to differentiate between it and other forms of bright. I think Silence makes a pretty good justification why the word "bright" needs to be the front disambiguation page below. Would there be any objections to this? <a href="../../../o/s/c/User%7EOscabat_962c.html" title="User:Oscabat">Oscabat</a> 03:58, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

In lieu of that, <b>strong delete and merge</b> into <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_movement.html" title="Bright movement">bright movement</a>. The <i>concept</i> of bright is not noteworthy because it's a neologism (no appearance in any established dictionaries, and barely any in reputable news organizations or publications) synonym of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Naturalism (philosophy)">philosophical naturalism</a>; at best, it merits a subsection or paragraph of the aforementioned more established term. The <i>movement</i> or <i>organization</i> of Brights, however, which is pretty much solely responsible for propagating the usage of "bright" as a self-identification, is noteworthy. The admin who closes this vote should keep in mind that most, if not all, of the users supporting the division between the movement "Bright" and the concept "bright" are self-identified brights themselves. A split like this would be a kin to atheists splitting the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> article into one for the "lack-of-theism" definition and another for the "rejection/denial-of-theism" definition, rather than doing what they should (and are) and treating the topic in a single article. And atheism is much more noteworthy (and complex, spanning dozens of pages) than bright (which is only a page or two long, even merged), so a split is even less justified for this concept/movement (and the distinction between the two isn't always obvious) than it would be for <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a>. (Note that the previous example was not meant to suggest that atheists are brights, or even vice versa; it was just an example.) Having two articles in this case is <b>beyond</b> unacceptable: it's an example of Wikipedia's corrosive systemic bias towards recent subcultures with a significant Internet base. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 02:15, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

You say <i>"there are so many potential pages someone could be looking for by searching for "Bright", and none of them are clearly noteworthy enough to merit being the "main page" for the word"</i>. Frankly, that's just wishful thinking on your part. No serious user of an encyclopaedia looks up things they already know about, (such as bright in the sense of "light" or "clever"). People use an encyclopaedia to look things up that they haven't come across before. Some very influential thinkers, such as Daniel Dennett, Stephen Pinker, Richard Dawkins have taken recently to using the word "bright" in this sense, and it is extremely likely that people, when they come accross this unfamiliar term, will come to wikipedia to look it up. I've asked on <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBrights_movement_a254.html" title="Talk:Brights movement">Talk:brights movement</a> for suggestions of realistic scenarios where a serious user of this encyclopaedia would type "bright" into the search box, when they were looking for an article about anything other than the philosophical outlook (or the band). Nobody's been able to come up with even one. I also asked for an example of an occasion when it would be useful or appropriate to wikify the word "bright" to link to anywhere other than the article about the philosophical outlook (or the band). Again, nobody's come up with even one.

<li><b>Comment</b> actually maybe better would be to redirect <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brightness.html" title="Brightness">brightness</a>, which is its primary meaning, and put a line at the top of the latter saying "<b>Bright</b> redirects here" and pointing to the dab page. That would be more in line with standard WP policies. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 06:01, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Modify my remarks</b> I hadn't appreciated how much of the debate was about keeping the current content at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> separate from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brights_movement.html" title="Brights movement">brights movement</a>. I have no strong objection to them being separate articles; it's OK with me if the current <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> is moved to, say, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Bright (philosophy)">bright (philosophy)</a> or whatever. But it shouldn't stay at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a>; that strikes me as a blatant attempt to use WP to push a linguistic change. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 16:23, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
