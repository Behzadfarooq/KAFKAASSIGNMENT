<p>Ejaculations- that's with an "s". I didn't want to get to deep with this. As a Child in catholic parochial school for Mothers day we filled out a card similar to a Christmas or birthday card for recognition of mothers day. Called a "Spiritual Bouquet for Mother". There were five categories we could fill in an amount that we would perform each item. "Masses, Holy Communions, Rosaries, Ejaculations, and Visits to the Blessed Sacrament". I chose to offer five repetitions of each except for the Rosaries which I had promised two. This word has so much negative baggage attached to it. Using it in an act of religious reverence seems quite contrary in the secular use of the word.</p>

He has had his portrait drawn by Ronnie Wood, of the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd has some art, Leo Sayer has a few paintings and Jimmy Page, of Led Zeppelin fame helped him paint a nude, literally. While in London he exhibited at The Royal Academy of Art Summer Exhibition and represented Canada at the Bath Contemporary Art Fair, in Bath, England. BIZZO'S artwork can also be found in the permanent collections of The New Brunswick Museum and Canada House, Trafalgar Square, London.

<p>About Us</p>
<p>CCD has been established as an independent department from the Ministry of Industry &amp; Trade since early 2002 pursuant to the amendment on companies law No. (22) of 1997 and pursuant to the amended temporary law No. (40) of 2002. The justifications of such independence emanated from the concept of reinforcing the ability to implement the law and creating broader visions and programs in a more flexible, independent way.</p>
<p>CCD plays two primary roles – Registration of various types of companies &amp; imposing censorship over these companies legally and financially.</p>
<p>CCD provides clear, simple, computerized and quick services based on the system of “One – Stop –Service”.</p>
<p>CCD’s Methodology: (way of work) The core of our strategic plan is in answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the government want from CCD?</li>
<li>How do we expect to achieve that?</li>
<li>How to measure success and effectiveness of our accomplishments?</li>
</ul>
<p>We should answer these questions within the following general frame: The government, through its cabinet and other bodies-CCD being one of these bodies, sets its priority targets (results) which should be interpreted for the public utility as products and services (outputs). These results should also be identified as of its expected effect upon society and national economy. The legislative authority then accords the allocation of necessary financial resources to enable the government to fulfill these results through its bodies.</p>
<p>CCD’s Vision: Our goal at CCD is to be distinguished and competent in the services we provide in order to create a safe investment climate.</p>
<p>CCD’s Mission: CCD’s mission is to act as a committeed governmental department that coordinates with the private sector to provide an attractive investment environment accompanied by simple, clear and high-quality services.</p>
<p>CCD’s values:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide a better service for the public.</li>
<li>Effective leadership on all levels that supports creativity and initiative.</li>
<li>High standards of integrity and professionalism.</li>
<li>Strengthening the concept of cooperation and coordination with other governmental bodies.</li>
<li>High levels of transparency to achieve equity and integrity.</li>
<li>Supporting training and constant development.</li>
<li>Creating a performance culture based on fulfillment of goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>CCD’s national goals: First:Contributing in attracting and settling investments: CCD is considered as an investment incubator in the kingdom. It endeavors to achieve the best results.</p>
<p>Second: Contributing in the administrative reform of the public sector: Through the quality of its services, the competency of its staff and the high-tech it adopts.</p>
<p>CCD’s Institutional goals: CCD strives to develop an ideal registration and censorship environment and to develop its performance through the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of procedures and mechanisms.</li>
<li>Simplification of work procedures.</li>
<li>Development of public awareness services.</li>

<p>William R Clark is an Information Security Analyst, Holds an MBA and an MS in Information and technology from Johns Hopkins University Recipient of two Project Censored Awards, First for his 2003 research paper: Revisited - The Real Reasons for the Upcoming War With Iraq: A Macroeconomic and Geostrategic Analysis of the Unspoken Truth and for His 2005 research on Iran's upcoming euro-denominated oil bourse. He is Author of the Book Petro Dollar Warfare, New Society Publishers, 2005.</p>
<p>Understanding why Iran is suddenly a target for US and Israeli military intervention gets easier to understand the more you know about about the economics of oil and the shaky status of the US dollar as a global reserve currency. Clark does a good job of shedding a lot of light right where the action is, in the places the Global media corporations never look.</p>

<p>The Rooswijk was built for the VOC "Chamber of Amsterdam" in 1737. On January 9 1740, during its second journey to the east, it sank on the sand bank of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodwin_Sands_3423.html" title="Goodwin Sands">Goodwin Sands</a>, about 8 km from the British mainland.

<p>In December 2005, it was made public that between May and September of that year a team led by Rex Cowan had recovered some of the ship and its contents. This was done in secrecy to avoid attracting looters. More work is planned for the 2006 diving season.</p>
<p>Lying at a depth of about 24 m, the Rooswijk had been discovered by an amateur diver in 2004. It is one of hundreds of wrecks on the treacherous Goodwin Sands.</p>
<p>Artifacts recovered included approximately one thousand bars of silver, gold coins and a mustard jar. When the VOC was disbanded in 1798, its possessions fell to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batavian_Republic_5fbe.html" title="Batavian Republic">Batavian Republic</a>, the legal successor of which is the current Dutch State, which therefore is entitled to the objects from the Rooswijk.

Stunna, or Cameron, said that he remembers and experiences his fellow classmates making fun of him when he wears his baggy clothes and say things like "Hey Cameron, your a white boy from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commack.html" title="Commack">Commack</a>, get over it." His follow-up was, "I don't understand why people do this just because we're white. Yeah we know we're not black, yeah we know we're not from the hood, so we're not gonna rap about that stuff. We can rap about other things like kris-kross or lil bow-bow did. I just wanna prove that we can do it. Just to show all of the people that doubted us." They are currently in the process of making a new demo-tape to send to about eight record lables.

<p>.berlin is an upcoming top level domain (TLD).</p>
<p>The new namespace of .berlin domain names will create local identity for Berlin's inhabitants and their city on the Internet. Through the localized .berlin URLs information from administration, business, science, culture, sports, welfare and from citizens will be intuitively available for providers, customers and visitors.</p>
<p>Our project will contribute to position Berlin as attractive location and dynamic metropolis nationally and internationally. The .berlin TLD is supported by a multiplicity of companies, associations and citizens and is acknowledged globally as precursor of TLDs for cities. With the concept we initiated a development which other metropolises like New York or London will follow.</p>
<p>The .berlin TLD will not only release a positive multifaceted pulse for Berlin and its hinterland, it will also bring Berlin's people, culture, business, innovational energy and internationality closer to other people worldwide.</p>

<dd>I've resurrected the text, as once you admit it is copyright (the original edit summary was plain wrong) and comply with the GFDL requirements on listing copyright owners and update history, it does appear to be copyright compatible with Wikipedia. However, my feeling is that it won't pass <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, and certainly doesn't pass <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. It is also about a future event, which I believe is not normally permitted. If ICANN really is seeking revenue by creating city TLDs, my feeling is that the only valid place for such TLDs would be in the existing entry for the city. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Woolley_c02a.html" title="User:David Woolley">David Woolley</a> 13:43, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Nicea-Constatninope Creed, is the final revised version of the Nicean Creed used today by both the Catholic Churches and the Orthodox Churches. It was approved of by the Church at the Council of Chalcedon where it became the official Profession of Faith. Revisions, such as the addition to of the "Filioque" at the local council of Toledo III, would lead to the East West Schism of 1054. For more information on this creed research the first seven Ecumenical Councils, Nicea I through Constantinople II, also see Nicene Creed.</p>

<p>Shane Evans was born on April 26, 1971. Like his other band members, he grew up in Stockbridge, Georgia. His interest in music arose when he was ten years old and received a bass guitar for Christmas. He is also a very talented drummer (I sure hope so since he plays drums for Collective Soul). He played concert percussion throughout middle school and high school.</p>

<dd>Rumours are not acceptable sources (although a source that reports the existence of rumours may be). Also, if you really meant References, when you wrote Weblinks, there are much more credible sources (NASA, NeoDys, MPC, etc.) for information about minor planets, than personal web sites. There is also a problem with your orbital elements, as it takes six parameters to define an orbit, and you only have five, and an epoch date! You are missing M of 132,417 degrees and an epoch of a modified Julian date of 53700<a href="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/cgi-bin/neodys/neoibo?objects:1991VG;main" class="external autonumber" title="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/cgi-bin/neodys/neoibo?objects:1991VG;main" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. The time of production is also important as the orbit of something that could be rocket debris could be easily perturbed. I've corrected the spelling of "Semimajor axis". --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Woolley_c02a.html" title="User:David Woolley">David Woolley</a> 07:07, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS I don't think it is a good idea to include detailed orbital elements in Wikipedia as anyone who actually needs to use them should be getting up to date values from JPL Horizons, NeoDys or MPC. They will change as more observations are made and also as the result of perturbations in the orbit. They are also two body approximations, so will, for near earth objects, change after encounters with the earth. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Woolley_c02a.html" title="User:David Woolley">David Woolley</a> 11:07, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rodney (Gipsy) Smith, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelist.html" title="Evangelist">evangelist</a>. He conducted evangelistic campaigns throughout the world but most notably in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> for over 70 years. He was a contemporary of other admired Christians of the time such as <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanny_Crosby_52e3.html" title="Fanny Crosby">Fanny Crosby</a> and G. Campbell Morgan.</p>
<p>Rodney was born in a <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsy.html" title="Gypsy">gypsy</a> tent at <a href="../../../e/p/p/Epping_Forest_d2f5.html" title="Epping Forest">Epping Forest</a> just outside of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. The family made a living selling baskets, tinware and clothespegs. This was common practise for traveling gypsy families of the time. His father, Cornelius, and his mother, Mary Welch, provided a happy home in the gypsy wagon. Rodney's mother died from smallpox when he was child. The Smith children numbered four girls and two boys of which Rodney was the fourth in line. Although as an adult he was quite literate and known as a brilliant communicator, as a child he received no formal education but was self taught as a teenager.</p>
<p>Rodney's father was in and out of jail for various offenses. During one of these incarcerations he heard the gospel from a prison chaplain. Later Mr. Smith, along with his brothers were converted at a mission meeting. From <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a> on, "The Converted Gypsies" were involved in numerous evangelistic efforts.</p>
<p>Rodney's conversion came as a sixteen-year-old as a result of a combination of things. The witness of his father, hearing <a href="../../../i/r/a/Ira_Sankey_033b.html" title="Ira Sankey">Ira Sankey</a> sing, and a visit to the home of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bunyan_63ef.html" title="John Bunyan">John Bunyan</a> in Bedford all contributed. He taught himself to read and write and began to practice preaching. He would sing hymns to the people he met and was known as the singing gypsy boy.</p>
<p>At a convention at the Christian Mission (later called the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation_Army_4c99.html" title="Salvation Army">Salvation Army</a>) headquarters in London, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Booth_32cf.html" title="William Booth">William Booth</a> noticed the gypsies but especially Rodney. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">June 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>, young Rodney accepted the invitation of Booth to be an evangelist with and for the Mission. For six years (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>-<a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a>), he served on street corners and mission halls.</p>
<p>Gipsy was married on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a> to Annie E. Pennock, one of his converts. They served in several assignments and saw memberships rise to hundreds, then a thousand. By June <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a>, great crowds were coming and the work was growing. A gold watch was given him and about £20.00 was presented to his wife by the warm-hearted members of a local congregation. Acceptance of these gifts was a breach of the rules and regulations of the Salvation Army, and for this, he was dismissed from the Army. His eight assignments with the Salvation Army had produced 23,000 decisions and his crowds were anywhere up to 1,500.</p>
<p>He began to traveled extensively around the world on evagelistic crusades, drawing crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands throughout his life. Busy as he was, he never grew tired of visiting gypsy encampments whenever he could on both sides of the Atlantic. Gipsy never wrote a sermon out for preaching purposes. Smith wrote several books and could sing as well as he preached. Sometimes he would interrupt his sermon and burst into song. Although he was a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a>, ministers of all denominations loved him. It is said that he never had a meeting without conversions.</p>
<p>Duing <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> he ministered under the auspices of the <a href="../../../y/2E/m/Y.M.C.A._1917.html" title="Y.M.C.A.">Y.M.C.A.</a> to the English troops in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, often visiting the front lines. As a result of this, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_VI_d01c.html" title="King George VI">King George VI</a> made him a member of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">Order of the British Empire</a>.</p>
<p>Gipsy's wife, Annie, died in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> at the age of 79 while he was in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">America</a>. Front page headlines in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> carried the news of the 78-year-old widower marrying Mary Alice Shaw on her 27th birthday. This, of course, brought some criticism. But it was a good marriage, for she helped him in his meetings, sang, did secretarial work, and later nursed him when his health failed.</p>
<p>Stricken by a heart attack, Gipsy died on the <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Queen_Mary_e54c.html" title="RMS Queen Mary">RMS <i>Queen Mary</i></a> in America, age 87. It was estimated that this was his 45th crossing of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic.html" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>. His funeral was held <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">August 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>.

<p>Portaboat is a boat that folds to 4 inches (100 mm) flat. It comes in four lengths of hull length 8 feet 6 inches (2.85 meters), 10 feet 8 inches (3.27 meters), 12 feet 6 inches (3.85 meters) 14 feet (4.28 meters), and hull weight 47 pounds (21 kilograms), 58 pounds (26 kilograms), 69 pounds (31 kilograms), and 96 pounds (43.6 kilograms).</p>
<p>The Portaboat was originally invented in 1969 and has undergone four different generations of models and sizes.</p>
<p>It became popular in the last 1980s and 1990s when many boating and fishing enthusiasts started downsizing to condominiums and apartments. There was no storage room for an ordinary boat.</p>
<p>It is also known as Foldaboat, Foldboat, Foldingboat, and Portabote.</p>
