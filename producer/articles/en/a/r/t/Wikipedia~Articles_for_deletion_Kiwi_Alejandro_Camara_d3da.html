<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. It's pretty clear to me that the article itself focused on nothing but the fact that he made racial slurs in class outlines he posted on a website. I'm not prejudiced against recreation of a more encyclopediac version of the articlem, or creation of an article regarding the "controversy," but it all seems pretty weak to me. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User_talk%7ERasputinAXP_2a9a.html" title="User talk:RasputinAXP"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;RasputinAXP&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RasputinAXP_8e7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/RasputinAXP"><small>c</small></a> 20:22, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The notability of the person in this article is suspect. As of the most current edit, this article does not fit Wikipedia notability criteria (see Wikipedia:Notability (people)).</p>
<p>There are only three unique points in the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>He graduated early from Harvard Law School with a fellowship.</li>
<li>He wrote an arguably offensive article.</li>
<li>He coaches high school debate at Mountain View High School.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people coach high school debate, some graduate early, and others let the word <i>nigger</i> slip out on accident. More than half of the article has to do with how Camara pissed people off. Not only is this article uncited, but one of its important external links are "humorous video at debate practice."</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a> suggested that Camara's status as a former <i>John M. Olin fellow in law and economics at Harvard</i> is grounds for notability as a fellow is basically a junior professor; however, this is a misunderstanding. As evidenced by Wikipedia's article on the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_M._Olin_Foundation_d6be.html" title="John M. Olin Foundation">John_M._Olin_Foundation</a>, the foundation gives a grant to fellows at universities, including Harvard. Now that the confusion regarding the "John M. Olin" moniker is out of the way, let us examine what a <i>fellow</i> really is.</p>
<p>According to the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=fellows" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=fellows" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, a fellow at a university would be <i>a graduate student appointed to a position granting financial aid and providing for further study</i>. This means that a fellow can hardly be equated to a college professor of any sort- they are just not the same thing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Jahiegel</a> has argued that the publicity surrounding the racial conflict at Harvard and Yale would be grounds for notability and would merit an evolution of the article into that incident. However, I contend that publicity is not enough to substantiate importance of subject based on two premises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can be subjected to publicity for any reason, good or bad. To set a precedent of writing articles based on the subject's publicity would be writing millions of articles about people who are potentially not notable. So, if there was any way for us to assume that publicity is a notability factor here, we would also have to assume that:</li>
<li>The reason why Camara's publicity would be notable is because he himself is already important. However, I have already disproven this assertion in the first half of this nomination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Camara himself is not notable enough, which logically means that the publicity surrounding him is not notable either. Consequently, this article should be deleted. <b><a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig.p_5a70.html" title="User:Big.p"><font color="#1E90FF">Big</font></a><font color="#1E90FF">.</font><a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig.P_Esperanza_1d6a.html" title="User:Big.P/Esperanza"><font color="#008000">P</font></a> <font color="black"><small>(<a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig.P_e35f.html" title="User talk:Big.P">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_big.P_5eb6.html" title="Special:Contributions/big.P">contribs</a>)</small></font></b> 04:43, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Graduating from law school at a very young age does not clear the notability bar. Coaching high school debate certainly does not clear the notability bar. This person's strongest claim to notability is having caused a little controversy because he used some offensive racial terms.

Nevertheless, the controversy surrounding his prospective YLR publication, and the media coverage such controversy received, likely seems to confer notability. Notwithstanding <a href="../../../n/b/d/WP%7ENBD_62b7.html" title="WP:NBD">WP:NBD</a>, I see nothing in this situation to distinguish Camara from <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristi_Yamaoka_48ae.html" title="Kristi Yamaoka">Kristi Yamaoka</a>, whom we've found to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Kristi_Yamaoka_%28second_nomination%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Kristi_Yamaoka_%28second_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">notable</a>. On the Yamaoka nomination, I supported "delete", believing that "where a personnage is notable only in view of his/her tie to a specific incident, our article ought to focus on the incident (as against on the person)"; I thought, then, that the Yamaoka article ought to be retitled and refocused on the incident writ large. Here, though, because the incident and person are wholly inextricable, because and where a singular person is the main participant in an incident, I am inclined to think that we ought to have an article apropos of the person; in either case, the event/person is notable. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 15:46, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Being a graduate at 14 is not notable, 'coaching' debate at a secondary school in the US is not notable, making a racist comment is certainly not notable. However; I agree with deleting errant nonsense from Wikipedia, I agree with deleting advertising from Wikipedia and I agree with deleting vanity articles.

<li><b>keep</b>. Here's what we know about the Olin Fellowship on Law and Economics at Harvard:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>'..during the first eleven years of the Program, thirty-two John M. Olin Student Research Fellowships have been awarded to advanced graduate students for the general support of their training in law and economics.In addition, 104 Student Research Fellowships have been awarded to students to support specific research projects during the summer.' Also, we dont have articles on everyone who published a comment in the Yale Law Review. (If we did, I would have had a lot of fun writing some of them.) Fails WP:Proftest completely. Also, Prodigy-Schomidigy.</dd>
<dd>However: the controversy was certainly notable. At the time, there was a long article in the New Yorker that discussed both this and the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a> affair, treating them as if they were of equal importance. It has also been brought up time and again in the past year when people were discussing <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Summers_b57f.html" title="Larry Summers">Larry Summers</a> and his comments on women in the sciences. Ideally, I would <i>support moving this to a page specifically dealing with the controversy.'</i> <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 08:21, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
