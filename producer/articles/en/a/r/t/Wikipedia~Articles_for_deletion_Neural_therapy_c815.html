<p>Despite the appearance of references, this is non-notable pseudoscience and spam.

<p>Im not sure your claim that is pseudo-science has any support. It is an alternative form of therapy that it is being practiced, tought and researched. So why dont we delete it in the german wikipedia? <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraltherapie" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraltherapie" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Knowing chemistry means little in understanding medicine or biology. Why not place the article for revision since you know as little as I? And since you are such a spiteful person you add that "the reliability of this article is not aided by the author's inability to spell <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganglia.html" title="Ganglia">ganglia</a>" when I knew perfectly that I meant <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganglion.html" title="Ganglion">ganglion</a>.: <a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbohorquez_f168.html" title="User:Jcbohorquez">Jcbohorquez</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/b/User_talk%7EJcbohorquez_7bb3.html" title="User talk:Jcbohorquez">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jcbohorquez_3712.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jcbohorquez">contribs</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I described, there's a distinct lack of published research on the subject, and a lack of sources indicating that it is a common alternative treatment despite this. One paper from 1956 does not make an article, regardless of what the German Wikipedia does or doesn't do. I was referring to the pluralization of "ganglion" as "ganglions", which suggested a lack of familiarity with the subject matter, but as this is a reasonable error for a non-native English speaker I have stricken it. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 06:10, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> <s>Actually since there are several ganglion it is adecuate to say ganglions.</s> Since you know the rules of wikipedia you can easily get this article deleted. I find this technic insulting and demeaning of what this site stands for. You should promote discussion not censorship. That is why I found your comments so viceral and was compelled to respond.</li>
</ul>
<p><s>Language is a fre e moving social construction of meaning. Its purpose is to explain what we understand to others and to ourselves.</s> I just found of encyclopedic value to know of alternative types of therapy. I did my best to improve the article. Theres a recent publication where patients prefer neural therapy over accupunture in accute pain. Since pain is a subjective experience the finding is of value to the medical community (patients and caretakers). I also found the article Ferdinand Heuneken published in 1961, listed in Science Direct.

<li><b>Keep</b> and improve. Referenced description by the American Cancer Society (linked from the article), plus a fairly large number of google hits<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22neural+therapy%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22neural+therapy%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> suggest that this is a notable alternative therapy. Almost certainly pseudoscientific nonsense, too, but that's not what's at stake here. If it is kept, the article needs to address the point that 'There is no scientific evidence that neural therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease.'<a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Neural_Therapy.asp?sitearea=ETO" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Neural_Therapy.asp?sitearea=ETO" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and to be copyedited.

<li><b>Delete</b> I would not trust anyone with injecting anything into my ganglions (sic), unless they had peer-reviewed journal articles documenting double-blind clinical trials to back them up. The fact that this AfD is being disputed on grounds like "language being a free moving social construct" is also worrying.

<dd>I'm not for a moment suggesting that this therapy is a good idea, but the evidence does seem to be that's it's fairly widely used, and therefore notable. That's why I argue 'keep'. Part of the improvement the article needs is certainly putting it into neutral, 'some people (referenced) believe that...' style.

<li><b>Keep</b> and improve. <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathic.html" title="Homeopathic">Homeopathic</a> medicine cannot stand doble-bind clinical trials due to the nature of the propused therapy. Yet it is a common practice of alternative medicine and has an article in wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> Published scientific studies have been quoted in the Homeopathy article, actually. In addition, there have been double-blind clinical trials on Homeopathy, see the article. They strongly suggest a placebo effect, but the trials have been done. Anyways, the current article is not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 20:15, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Niether of the following are good reasons to delete: 1. the article isn't NPOV or well-written; 2. the therapy it describes is pseudoscientific rubbish. 1 is a reason to improve the article. 2 is irrelevant: plenty of articles in WP are <i>about</i> rubbish without <i>promoting</i> rubbish. What's at stake is whether the subject of the article is notable - the evidence seems to be that it is - and whether an adequate article could be written about it - which doesn't seem impossible, given the improvement (e.g. in referencing) so far.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is not about the efficacy of neural therapy. It is about the notability of the practice. There are over a hundred pubmed articles about the practice as well as lots of google hits. It deserves a well-researched article of its own (I've made some small changes). <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 23:50, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It appears to me, from the discussion here, that it's notable, and I don't see merit in the other arguments. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielthursday_048f.html" title="User:Gabrielthursday">Gabrielthursday</a> 23:54, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If there is an organized group of people doing this thing, it deserves an article. The Scientific status is irrelevant, we also have an article about <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Science_5b54.html" title="Christian Science">Christian Science</a>.<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandroide_fda5.html" title="User:Randroide">Randroide</a> 12:20, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
