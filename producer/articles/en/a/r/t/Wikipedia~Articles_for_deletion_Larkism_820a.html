<dd>Excuse Me! i have Actually seen the "New Hall." It is in a place called Knightley Estate one Of Christopher Js Private Property</dd>
<dd>I was Invited there On a school re-union, And i saw a door marked New hall on my search For a toilet. Upon Looking inside i saw a huge banner saying "LEMC Meeting"</dd>
<dd>I did some research communticating with old school friends, i have even talked to a member inside the club and he has verified all the information asking me to write this article so the club gets a little more attention since the numbers of the clubs members has fallen, due to memberes migrating.</dd>
<dd>Obviously You would have to be linked to such an article as who would search for larkism? Therefore the club is still Remaining exclusive but attracting just that little more attention to keep it going.</dd>

<dd>In reply to Omicronpersei - there are no other organizations in Hertfordshire, or possibly in the UK for that matter, where wealthiness is compulsary to join the club and the club is purely based on wealth.

<dd>The LEMC does not currently have a website, but is looking to in the near future.

<dd>The fact that sources cannot be found is not an excuse to include information without sourcing it. This violates Wikipedia guidelines, and any such information should be removed.

<li><b>Response</b> Apology accepted, although it's interesting that the apology came from the same anonymous user who made the threat. In any case, we can't just take your word that the organization exists. You must give <b>verifiable</b> sources (ones we can check ourselves), and they must show that the organization is <b>notable</b> (widely known by people other than its members). Even if the club exists and was not something you and your friends just made up, and even if it is really full of rich people, it won't get a listing unless its notability can be verified. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 22:14, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am on the information team for The Lemc so it is not that intersting that it came from the same anonymous user. The club is not Known widely by other people outside Of the LEMC as it is an exclusive members club. However the LEMC would be recognised by potential members. The LEMC is in the process of being made. Will this be a verifiable source of information? Obviously \the club do not want to give away to much information about the club as it would no longer then be exclusive.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was the one who initially PRODed it. Hoax-ish and vanity. I would have deleted it myself but I think it is borderline A7 and letting the discussion here end would be best. However, I wouldn't be suprised if this closes early per <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 23:20, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Indeed. Closing now, deleting as per consensus + WP:SNOW, also speedy deletion as per CSD A7. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 23:24, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
