<li>Delete: The first one is a "see Team AHI" article, and the second one is pretty much spam, as it is an extremely brief blurb that heads to the external link.

<p>actually we just thought it'd be neet to be included on your site and added it more than once because your search engine didn't find it depending on whether CAPS was on or off ... as far as advertising well isn't any entry advertising ... i mean i've seen articles for emmis communications clear channel and millions more should i attempt to get those removed ... I propose maybe removable of the link but not the listing ... its breif because we thought it'd be cool if once we told people that we were on wikipedia they'd add more about teamAHI and as far as niche I think not ... we've had people contact us from germany to japan... well thanks for the thoughts <small>—<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> 24.115.244.206 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.115.244.206_0757.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.115.244.206">contribs</a>) 05:38, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</small> who is the author of the article</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> but allow re-creation if anyone wants to write an an actual article on what is a pretty legitimate American cultural universal... rather than one particular instance of it. Including the detail that the traditional Thanksgiving Day local football game is frequently referred to as "Turkey Day" rather than "Thanksgiving." Wait, is this adequately covered in <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>? No, it is not. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:42, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not a big deal. <i>This</i> article should be deleted. I'm just saying the current content is worthless but the <i>topic</i> is potentially worthy. <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey_Day_d883.html" title="Turkey Day">Turkey Day</a> already redirects to <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> as it should, being a common nickname for Thanksgiving. What the Thanksgiving article does not presently capture is that Thanksgiving is a traditional day for traditional rival high school football teams to play games of particular local importance. I have no idea how this custom arose, and the article on <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> doesn't tell me. The second nuance is that "Thanksgiving" has religious or quasireligious or patriotic overtones to it, and "Turkey Day" and variants is not just an alternate name for Thanksgiving, but tends to get attached to less serious events and athletics in particular (witness my home town's "Turkey Trot" 10K road race). Shoot-from-the-hip "common knowledge" should go into any article without more research. I'm just saying, there's <i>something</i> worth documenting that isn't presently in the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:26, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: I agree, and especially since the colleges do the same. ESPN has been calling it "rivalry week," and that's typically what the Thanksgiving games are, on the college or high school level. If there were a "cultural observances" or "leisure activities" section to <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>, we could also mention the Lions and Bears time immemorial NFL game. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:03, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Non-encyclopedic</b>. PITA supposedly is an acronym for "Pain In The Ass". It already has a Wiktionary entry. I don't see how anyone could develop an article on PITA. I guess it would be theoretically possible to develop an article on the derivation, use, and cultural repurcussions of the phrase "Pain In The Ass", in which case, any material on PITA could go there. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 01:49, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> An article should only be deleted if it is a completely unqualified waste of bandwidth. This article is hardly a waste. It provides an interesting look at reactions against the two-name system most cultures prefer. I find any discussion for deletion to be distasteful.</li>
<li><b>Weak keep and cleanup</b> per Andrew Lenahan, Wahoofive and Freakofnurture. Nobody who commonly uses both a first name and a surname should be on this list, nor should ancient people who predated surnames -- particularly those who are commonly known by an appellation of more than one word, like <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attila_the_Hun_c95d.html" title="Attila the Hun">Attila the Hun</a> or <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Iscariot_cdd5.html" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:22, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete or total rewrite</b> ultimately unverifiable - at the moment it is the creator and other's anecdotal impressions that form the list. And it is full of inconsistancies and errors.

<p>The webcomic is so totally not worth having. I've never read it and nobody really cares about it. Despite the fact that is has been around, for like, EVER, has like billions of readers (or so they SAY!!, but I doubt its true, sicne its crap!!!!), and gets more traffic then just about all other webcomics combined, it is by no means NOTEWORTHY. TOTALLY non-notable! Now, if you will excuse me, I'm going to go read a REAL webcomic like Garfield! 72.224.218.215 00:32, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
-Seconded. It's a webcomic, and hence, clearly not notable.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is more than just a webcomic, so far 3 issues containing 5 chapters out of the current 7 online have been published in print. It also has an extremely large fanbase, and is to a point a cultural icon regarding a relatively large and growing community. Also by the notion that it should be removed as a result implies that entries for <a href="../../../w/w/w/Www.yahoo.com.html" title="Www.yahoo.com">www.yahoo.com</a> and <a href="../../../w/w/w/Www.google.com.html" title="Www.google.com">www.google.com</a> should be removed since they are "just websites" and regardless of how many people use them they are "crap." <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28comic%29_7eef.html" title="Penny Arcade (comic)">Penny Arcade</a> also has an equally large article and fanbase associated with it. Are you implying that it should be removed as well because some may not like it? I would encourage you to take the article process a little more seriously from now on.</dd>

<dd>No offense, but when articles about webcomics as influential to the webcomic community as <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkerboard_Nightmare_aedb.html" title="Checkerboard Nightmare">Checkerboard Nightmare</a> are put up for deletion, it's extremely hard for the webcomics community to take the "article process" seriously. This post is a reflection of that. Perhaps come up with a general process and criteria that doesn't depend on a site's (habitually inaccurate) Alexa rating and "noteworthiness" as judged by someone who as often as not hasn't read said webcomic, and I might be more inclined to take the "process" seriously. (Note that I'm not the one who put this up for deletion, although I know who did. I think.)--Plaid Phantom 02:39, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This was put into the Articles for deletion queue because I incorrectly provided a link when I used "QiSoftware". I corrected that almost immediately.

<li>I developed the "Blogger Calendar" at the time blogging was gaining momentum --. The calendar is a Java servlet/applet combination and generates a lot of curiousity... It has received very good reviews. The primary difference between my tool and other blog calendars is that it does not refresh pages each time something is clicked. It allows the user to naviagate month to month and only retrieves posts when the user specifically requests a post or month.
<p>Bloggerforum.com where I first discussed the planned implementation and development... has about 4100 hits on the development topic alone. On my forum, it also receives a lot of attention. The tool is popular, especially in that it can also support Blogger.com blogs which is the largest blog platform to date.</p>
<p>Not only that I have come up with other innovative tools -- I am not a one hit wonder.... I have been dealing in the software arena for a number of years.... "My version of the "Blogger Calendar" is notable..... However, because of issues I have elsewhere my focus is not on promoting this tool, or any of my other software tools. I have other issues elsewhere that supersede my business issues. Truly... <a href="../../../q/i/s/User%7EQiSoftware_b4b5.html" title="User:QiSoftware">QiSoftware</a> 05:52, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete: There is a great deal of precedent here for deletion. Several Linux clubs, for example, have had articles for deletion in the past, and all were deleted. The reasoning is that any given iteration of a club is going to be inherently minor.

<li><b>keep</b>. I agree that I have been ineffective so far at justifying notability. The article is a "work in progress". If this article should be deleted, consider also Computer Club of Western Michigan University which is also listed under computer clubs. The claim for notability is based on its contribution to educational research. It is referenced in educational research papers at <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/education/research/networks/gern/gdc05.ppt" class="external free" title="http://www.bris.ac.uk/education/research/networks/gern/gdc05.ppt" rel="nofollow">http://www.bris.ac.uk/education/research/networks/gern/gdc05.ppt</a> and <a href="http://www.gamelearning.edu.au/conference_sep05.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.gamelearning.edu.au/conference_sep05.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamelearning.edu.au/conference_sep05.htm</a></li>

I'm one of the principal parents of this beast, and since I started working on it never considered it a Debian-specific system.

Also the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_kFreeBSD_ad81.html" title="GNU/kFreeBSD">GNU/kFreeBSD</a> page itself links to an experimental port of the same system (with GNU userland, Glibc, etc) based on Gentoo (not to be confused with <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentoo_FreeBSD_52b7.html" title="Gentoo/FreeBSD">Gentoo/FreeBSD</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>: I do think the information in articles about <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_b7e8.html" title="GNU">GNU</a> using *BSD kernels could be organised better, but I don't think deleting <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_kFreeBSD_ad81.html" title="GNU/kFreeBSD">GNU/kFreeBSD</a> is a solution. Indeed, if there is so much overlap with <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debian_GNU_kFreeBSD_4f9a.html" title="Debian GNU/kFreeBSD">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</a>, (for as long as the two articles are both small anyway, if that's the case) it should be the latter that gets merged into the former. Debian may be by far the largest distro of FreeBSD-kernel-based GNU systems but there will be more to say about the system itself than there will be to say about Debian's experience in packaging it (and some or all of <i>that</i> info could go on Debian pages). One possible way to get the GNU/*BSD information into shape - and this is just an idea which can be discussed on Talk pages afterwards - would be to collect the info onto one page (maybe GNU/*BSD) and on that page present the flavours of *BSD kernels that GNU can run on, contrast those systems with <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_b7e8.html" title="GNU">GNU</a> and <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Linux_4a58.html" title="GNU/Linux">GNU/Linux</a>, and discuss the Distros that package and distribute various *BSD-kernel-based GNU systems. The similarities in these systems, I think, will be more than then differences. If this unified page is too big, or becomes too big, the largest section could always be split of at a later date. I'd be willing to help with the merge. I've never run a GNU/*kBSD system, but I have lurked on related mailing lists, and I have a good knowledge of GNU history and workings. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 13:57, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>My main reason for not discussing a merge now is that I don't have the time this week, and probably not next. But I have already done some thinking on this, so here's what's in my head:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The logical way to avoid duplication would be for each operating system to have an article about the operating system, and for each distribution to have an article about the distribution. So there should be an article for GNU, and GNU/Linux, and GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/kNetBSD (see later). And <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debian_GNU_kFreeBSD_4f9a.html" title="Debian GNU/kFreeBSD">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</a> should be merged into <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debian.html" title="Debian">Debian</a> and <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_kFreeBSD_ad81.html" title="GNU/kFreeBSD">GNU/kFreeBSD</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentoo_FreeBSD_52b7.html" title="Gentoo/FreeBSD">Gentoo/FreeBSD</a> should be merged into <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentoo.html" title="Gentoo">Gentoo</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/FreeBSD_a3dc.html" title="FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a>. The GNU, GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/kNetBSD pages should have links to distributions of them, and the Distribution pages should say (and link to) what operating systems they publish versions of.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>About "(see later)": GNU/kFreeBSD and GNU/kNetBSD are a special case for two reasons. First, they share a <i>lot</i> of characteristics - and if I recall correctly, it was even the same person that did the bulk of both ports of GNU (was it Robert Millan?). Second, despite being made of very mature and widely used software, neither operating system itself is widely used (as a side note, this will greatly reduce the pool of Wikipedians' experience that the articles on them can draw from). These two factors suggest to me that the two things should be discussed in a joint article GNU on *BSD kernels, or GNU/*BSD, or something. If this seems unpalatable, keep in mind that nothing's permenant. If that unified article gets so big that it should be split, then Net/Free would be one way to consider splitting the info.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To clarify: the unified article should be written like an article on any other operating system (so it should include the {{Infobox_OS_2}} and should be in the <i>Free software operating systems</i> Category. <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_kFreeBSD_ad81.html" title="GNU/kFreeBSD">GNU/kFreeBSD</a> and <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_kNetBSD_d7d0.html" title="GNU/kNetBSD">GNU/kNetBSD</a> would then redirect there. Also, the name should not be given too much importance "GNU/kFreeBSD" is just a name invented quickly by the Debian porter after the FreeBSD guys didn't like his original name "GNU/FreeBSD" (since it could be interpretted as implying that the user would get a complete FreeBSD system). The most important thing for the name is accuracy, and since neither "GNU/FreeBSD" or "GNU/kFreeBSD" conveys a clear meaing (without additional explanation), I recommend using a descriptive name (such as GNU on BSD kernels, or the same with an asterisk before BSD). <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 20:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment -</b> I see your concerns, and I agree that Nsync, etc. are not part of learning per se... but we have to draw the line somewhere. There's a large difference between a PC game clan, which can be established merely by typing a few lines into the game, and artists and TV shows that have established themselves by selling thousands of records, and attracting thousands of viewers. Say you were to enter a game show. Which would be more likely to be a question: something about Nsync or South Park, or something about The counter-strike clan, "Internation Anarchy?" Yes, they are to a much lesser degree part of my (the US's) culture, but it would be far more encompassing to make an article about video game clans in general, instead of every individual one.--<a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKrovisser_25ea.html" title="User:Krovisser">Krovisser</a> 14:51, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't know if it they are violating copyright laws. It was being suggested that the music label was violating copyright on material they created themselves, but if anybody involved in this nomination was, it "would" be the Internet Archive, which is why I said "they'd" as in "they would". I was not claiming that they were violating copyright. Since they remove material upon request, perhaps no one has bothered to take them to court to find out one way or another. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 13:12, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's exactly what I would have done had I thought it needed to be <i>merged</i>. However, since I proposed removing all of this article's contents and turning it into a redirect, I wanted to garner the opinions of others who are hopefully more familiar than I am with the subject matter.

<li>Let's plase not get into reprimanding nominators. After all, a nomination is not a vote, and it's possible to think that an article should be redirected but recognize that some other folks (like me) will think it should be deleted. In my case, I think a <b>redirect without merge</b> is better, as I didn't see that much content to merge. However, I am thoroughly content with a <b>judicious merge and redirect.</b> There is a high degree of original research mixed in with the referenced material. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:05, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, Geogre. I didn't see Plutor's comments as a reprimand; we often see nominators not voting at all, and there may be a case for using a {{merge}} tag in a situations like this. However, when there is substantial text at risk of being scrapped (either by deletion or redirect), I prefer bringing the issue to a wider audience. BTW, congratulations!

<li><b>Keep</b>, with changes. Agreed that the material, appropriately rewritten, could be merged into Maya civilization article, to this latter's benefit as it does not presently cover this topic. However, I think that the general subject area is notable enough, and one which is seriously studied, so as to warrant (in addition) standing on its own. It would need to be retitled, I'd suggest something like Gender roles in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, to broaden the field of study but still focus on a region and time period with certain unifying characteristics. A restructure to remove OR-type statements, fix references, and a general wiki-styling is also required. I don't have the particular references cited in the text to hand, but I know of a few similar ones; if you allow a day or two I will see if a start can be made on its revision.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 22:42, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Operation Dwarka" is an insignificant incident that did not even result in the loss of life. Anon's attempt to rewrite history is flawed as in the previous article where everything is termed as "Operation" or "Battle". Next thing we could even see a firefight or shootout being glorified as war! <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 06:04, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965_4959.html" title="Indo-Pakistani War of 1965">Indo-Pakistani War of 1965</a>. The stub links to an official Pakistani government website that calls this the most significant naval engagement of the war. The operation's mission was to take out radar installations, to reduce enemy air effectiveness for the ground conflict, and to lower enemy morale. These are noteworthy strategic goals. I think it's rather a good thing when a military operation can achieve its aims without killing. Naval tradition usually targets <i>objects</i>, not <i>people</i>. (I've mentioned before that I'm a war veteran. Care to guess which branch?) <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 07:16, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The 1965 war article already explains this incident with proper references and in a neutral tone. It might seem on initial superficial reading like an american military operation which intends to cripple a target area with as little casualties as possible. It couldn't be further from the facts and it's regrettable that official Pakistani version uses the words "most significant". However as <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tariq_Ali_9b97.html" title="Tariq Ali">Tariq Ali</a>, a Pakistani historian and many pro-Pakistani sources would explain, it barely reduced any air effectiveness in the area or dented morale. In effect it was merely sent to shell a small coastal town called <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarka.html" title="Dwarka">Dwarka</a> and has remained only a footnote in the entire war achieving little significance. <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 07:45, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Things sometimes get interesting when one does a bit of sleuthing. The only Google hits for pages that mention both Tariq Ali and Operation Dwarka are Wikipedia and its mirror sites, specifically <a href="../../../p/a/k/Talk%7EPakistan_Navy_8ef8.html" title="Talk:Pakistan Navy">talk:Pakistan Navy</a> and nominator Idleguy's posts. While I couldn't locate Mr. Ali's actual words on the subject it does turn out that he was a Trotskyite with no naval experience. Things look bitter on that talk page. It's been through a POV dispute and mediation. Idleguy deleted two paragraphs about the 1965 war, leaving only one sentence, for much the same reasons he advances this nomination.</dd>
<dd>Here are three independent sources I located. From an Indian account of the war, "The Dwarka shelling infuriated many Naval Officers and in ways their pride was affected for some days to come." <a href="http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1965War/Chapter8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1965War/Chapter8.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Vice Adm (Retd) Iqbal F. Quadir attributes two myths to the outcome of Operation Dwarka, both of which reflect favorably on Pakistan's naval reputation. <a href="http://defencejournal.com/march98/pak3wars1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://defencejournal.com/march98/pak3wars1.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Another Indian source attests to the raid's psychological effectiveness. <a href="http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_432.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_432.shtml" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. A cruiser, five destroyers, and a frigate is a significant force.</dd>
<dd>I'll revise some of what I said about the operation. Faulty intelligence and communications interfered with the primary mission. Yet the Indian navy failed to launch any opposition ships at all. I've lost faith in Idleguy's claims to NPOV on this matter. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 09:35, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please read Tariq Ali's books and articles before coming to conclusions. Lack of naval experience is not a valid reason given that in the subcontinent officers of both nations tend to fudge facts and hype things up. A more neutral and civialian source would tell you it's otherwise. Unfortunately googling is not the only way to find out facts. The denting of "pride" for naval officers in the area that you refer to did not affect the battle plans of either nation. Infact the line is under the heading "SIDE SHOW IN THE SOUTH-WESTERN SECTOR" in the website quoted by you. Hardly worth mentioning, but if such psychological operations are to be given separate articles then we'd be filling Wikipedia with many articles of secondary importance given the magnitude of the war.</dd>
<dd>I also seldom edited articles with POV, it was just that outright claims of Operation Dwarka were being glorified as a great success when tactically / strategically it had achieved nothing of note in the course of the war that claimed thousands of lives. Hope you can read up on the war and prove me wrong. <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 12:07, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep, Maybe</b>. This IS a real company. They DO seem to have a somewhat unique product, they WERE in the NYC Chocolate Show and they DID get a rating of best in show from Phil Lempert, food editor for Today (ref:<a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9966060/page/3/" class="external free" title="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9966060/page/3/" rel="nofollow">http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9966060/page/3/</a>). According to Lempert, they are high-end gourmet product that uses "single origin", I guess that's like beans from one crop or something -- kind of like a single-malt whiskey I guess. Article also says they will never sell high volume because of this. <b>Question: would a very-high-end but therefore low-volume whiskey, wine, cigar, microbrew beer, etc. make WikiPedia? If not, then this should not; if so, then perhaps this should.</b> Yes the ARTICLE BODY is very poor and is PR, but if the SUBJECT is Wikipedic then the proper solution is to tag the article for improvement rather than delete, at least that is my understanding. If User Chocolove had written a better article with history, picture, more about unique aspects of product etc, then we might not be having this discussion.

<li>It would become too large and more importantly it can't be categorised under both Wales and South Africa, which would mean we would need to produce each list twice, nearly doubling the amount of server space devoted to the subject. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 13:31, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. In response to Zunaid's comment that one article per sport per combination of countries is too much... I think this is a perfect example of where the much-abused '<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> paper' guideline comes in handy. That said, we don't need an article on every single combination of countries and sports, just the ones which are... well... interesting. An article saying 'Senegal and Brazil do not have much sporting history in the field of <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curling.html" title="Curling">curling</a>' should plainly be deleted, and an article merely listing sports results sans commentary would be borderline at least. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The Dawn and Drew Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world (source: ranking at Podcast Alley, currently at no. 7 out of 10276), and was recently featured on Fox 6 News <a href="http://dawnanddrew.podshow.com/dnd-fox6-ipod/" class="external autonumber" title="http://dawnanddrew.podshow.com/dnd-fox6-ipod/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.

<li>Perhaps not but it did make history in one of our most populated, industrious states that has made major contributions to the auto industry and American music. The victory received nationwide coverage (UPI, AP) in addition to being mentioned some state history books used in the classroom. Not notable?

<p>My apologies but I have trouble navigating Wikipedia. Unfortunately I cannot cite sources as several members of the Michigan LP told me this about 15 year's ago and I have lost contact with them. I have lived in Illinois and Indiana since winning the election. Since I cannot prove this at this time, I hereby withdraw this statement. I left the LP for the GOP and have now returned after nearly 15 years.</p>
<p>Again, however, if literally thousands of names of male porn stars, female porn stars, gay porn stars, big-bust models and performers, porn stars who appeared in mainstream films, and Japanese female porn stars can have individual entries, I don't understand why a history-making event cannot.</p>
<p>However, it's your decision, I will respect it, and this will be my last comment on the subject. Thanks for the engagement.-- JamesClifton 10:08, 22 November 2005</p>

<li>Comment:sorry for calling the article 'stupid hoax' before, that was out of line. However, being that it's written by the subject and the external link is from the Libertarian Party of Michigan's page (which would be predisposed to publishing an article like that), it's hard to verify the notability of this. Googling "James Clifton" +libertarian gives 50 results and none of them were related to this event. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 18:25, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, This article's name caught my curiousity. It badly needs a rewrite and some pictures to show what it means. I thought it would mean homosexual excercise or more likely a non-sexual-related exercise where you just do the same type of workout like your only excercise is you ride an exercise bike and do no other excercises? Maybe this is what the name actually means, or should mean. The article says "gay figurative gestures used towards" and giving an example of physical sexual harrassment by gay men to straight men, but this should be called another name than aerobic because they don't achieve an aerobic workout. Umm... get a source, too. Funny name, but badly written article. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 22:28, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> says, this is a protologism. There's no such word attested, let alone a concept attached to it that an encyclopaedia article could discuss. The article tells us that this coinage was made less than a month ago. This is thus yet another attempt by students to get a word into the dictionary by creating an article in the encyclopaedia. The article is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:47, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but rename</b>, When I wrote this article the spelling of this word was unclear after I talked to people I truly thing the word should be changed to Homorobic. This was the word used in the actual conception of the word and was meant to be compared to the word "Homophobic" meaning..."I'm not homophoic, but homorobic, meaning I'm ok with my sexuality and can act how I please towards my friends, not scared of expressing myself due to homophbia." This is my first Wikipedia article and I do think it should be rewritten and I would appreciate help on it. I also firmly believe this is not a Protoligism, but a word that has meaning and can be used to discribe something. I'm not trying to get this word to "catch on" or become a fad, but really do think this word can be the benifit of many people. Now I know the actual break down of Homoaerobic is not meaning the word, and I plan to revise my article and post it under Homorobic. If you want to contact me about my ideas on this word feel free to message me or email me. I just think that it should be given and chance and time for other Wikipedia enthusiasts to see this word and expand on it. Also I wanted to add pictures, but I am in the middle of writing a term paper on "Airport Noise and it's Effect on local Residential Property," which requires a great deal of time.

<li>Hey Angr, <b>It's</b> obvious that you have a problem with me and/or my article. Man relax go smoke something calm your nerves or something. Now after i read the Kappa's comment, ok I realize that this might be ordinal research, so I will try to either find some sources to cite or just have to write some articles on some other part of the universe. But Angr man, If you are just gonna over analyze my comments enough to start breakin down my english, ya gotta relax bud. If this shouldn't be on wiki because of the policies thats cool with me, but don't just hate on me or my article. Hope you're havin a beautiful time in Moabit homie, and I see you're first book was published in Somerville, Mass...My friend lived there last summer and they make some good cheap vodka there....anyway I woulda messaged you but I couldn't find out how to message you directly. And if this really has anything at all to do with you being a homosexual thats unfortuanate because I have nothign against gay and lesbians. I have several homosexual guy friends who are gay and relatives that are gay. That would just be immature on your part, but thats cool...Céad míle fáilte romhat...--Farrelly 02:33, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Just now I saw that another guy keeps adding sections on a sexual harrasment on Lou Kearn. (Who just happens to be my grandpa) Now let's cut the crap. Just delete this and we won't have anymore junk on sexual harasment or falsaifed information. If people just keep screwing this up there is no point in having it. It's not an important article anyway. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 06:30, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>- I'm not entirely convinced of the notability of this company, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Reyk. I nominated this company for deletion last time, but was convinced otherwise by the discussion. The sexual harassment suit is documented. the only "falsified information" I'm aware of is the mistaken change of the company's headquarters to Arizona, which is easily rectified. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 10:12, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Here is the sequence of events, which I think might prove instructive to other editors who come here to promote a company.</li>

<dd>
<ol>
<li>I found an egregious advertising link to <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coit_Cleaners_f628.html" title="Coit Cleaners">Coit Cleaners</a> in the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parquetry.html" title="Parquetry">Parquetry</a> article, which had been inserted by the creator of the Coit Cleaners article.</li>
<li>That led me to Coit Cleaners, which seemed non-notable (and also spammish), so I researched the company.</li>
<li>The led me to the lawsuit information, which I inserted in the article. (My source, listed in the article, is the <a href="../../../e/e/o/EEOC_ae6c.html" title="EEOC">EEOC</a> report on the settlement.)</li>
<li>Now the original author of the article no longer wants the article to exist. A cautionary tale, I'm sure. I'd never have found the lawsuit info if the person hadn't spammed Parquetry.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>BTW, the original author reverted my edits, so you all have not been discussing the article as it actualy is. If anyone goes to the article and doesn't see the info on the lawauit, if you'd be kind enough to revert it back in, that'd be great. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 12:42, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I went through steps 1 and 2, myself, leading to the original nomination. During the discussion, I was convinvced by others that the company did indeed have some claim to notability. I was still bothered by the spam-like links in other articles, but decided to not remove them because my objectivity might be questioned. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 13:13, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per previous vote. I'm sorry that the creator is upset that a vanity piece turned into an informative article on the company and some of it's affiliates practices. Within the next 24 hours I will add citations for all of the info I have added to this article and specifically tag all non-sourced claims. This should address any claims as to misinformation, which I will note is not a valid cause for wholesale deletion. --<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> <a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">(email)</a></small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 19:39, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've rewritten the discription section and provided sources for all of that. All of the harassment section is verifiable from the provided links. The only unverifiable claim was that of "world's largest." The company's website claims to be "one of the world's largest," so that's what the article now says. Everything is verifiable. The company is also notable per community consensus in the previous AFD. (As it is a privately held company there is very little information available on employment figures for Coit, but according to <a href="http://www.insightdirect.com/press/3_31_04.html" class="external text" title="http://www.insightdirect.com/press/3_31_04.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> the main headquarters employs 100 people.) There remains no reason for deletion other than the founder's family being upset that the harassment settlement is a matter of public record. --<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> <a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">(email)</a></small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 02:08, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>. In more detail: it is <i>false</i> that statistical mechanics can only be applied to deterministic systems: it is routinely applied to stochastic systems, for example Brownian motion, Markov processes, Wiener processes, money-market fluctuations, etc. In the form of quantum statistical mechanics, it is also routinely applied to quantum mechanical probabilities. The article also claims that statistical mechanics takes no interest in the probability of individual microstates. This is also false: pretty much every statistical mechancal calculation is an expectation value, calculated by considering the probabilities <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> of each microstate.</p>

<p>I propose that this article should be deleted. Reasons include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The building it refers to is now called <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Pudenziana_6de5.html" title="Santa Pudenziana">Santa Pudenziana</a> and a page exists under that name - all verifiable information about the history of this church belongs there.</li>
<li>After considerable discussion no-one has been able to present a verifiable source which suggests that the Santa Pudenziana <i>ever</i> bore the name "Palatium Britannicum".</li>
<li><i>Palatium</i> is Latin for the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palatine_Hill_a37d.html" title="Palatine Hill">Palatine Hill</a>, it doesn't mean "palace", so the name "Palatium Britannicum" is impossible linguistically.</li>
<li>The "Palatium Britannicum" story appears to be derived from a discredited and dishonest source - Jowett's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Drama_of_the_Lost_Disciples_353d.html" title="The Drama of the Lost Disciples">The Drama of the Lost Disciples</a></i>.</li>

<li><b>Replace</b>. A possible alternative is a rewrite that says that it is a fiction that has achieved the status of a myth among a certain fringe group, then giving Nicknack009's four essential reasons why it has no basis in fact.

<p>I've nominated this article for deletion because much of it is background information that, with some editing, would probably be more at home in the main <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a> article, and the part that isn't (from the discussion of the Fetid/Feted Inner Core on) is likely to be meaningless or of little interest to those not steeped in the culture or society of Second Life. <a href="../../../z/z/t/User%7EZztzed_2ece.html" title="User:Zztzed">zztzed</a> 23:14, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I concur - Much of the article is useful information, but has nothing at all to do with controversy in Second Life. The parts that do discuss controversy (as described by Zztzed above) are a possible candidate for <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> dispute. Though they generally adhere to language that is almost neutral (witness the use of "alleged" and a fair amount of passive voice), they are biased against both "successful" content creators in Second Life and against Linden Lab itself.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some factual errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preen, though located centrally in Midnight City, was not the target of one of the beginning player links. Midnight City in its entirety was the target.</li>
<li>Abbotts Aerodrome contains a number of vehicle stores, but it encompasses a wide variety of other activities and services surounding aviation, including but not limited to skydiving, automated aerial tours of Second Life, and various vehicle building classes.

<li>The original article was included in the Second Life page, and was split from it by another author. Originally it was intended to <i>meet</i> NPOV as without it the Second Life page reflected only a positive point of view about Second Life.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, although I'd almost say "Merge with <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a> per the nominator." This isn't speedy cleanup or forced merge so this discussion really should never have started. Next time just <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a>: Cook this down to the two paragraphs it should be and make the redirect yourself. But since we are here and this would not make a meaningful re-direct, deletion is a good option. Any useful material will have to be re-sourced and cited by whomever does the not-quite-a-merge-so-we-don't-violate-GFDL. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 22:49, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
