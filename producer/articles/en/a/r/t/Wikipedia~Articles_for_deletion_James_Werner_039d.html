<p>There are many articles on people who are not as known as James Warner. James Warner's status as not being very popular is not a legitimate reason for deletion of this article. If that was a legitimate reason, that than deleting every reference of him on every article in Wikipedia would be reasonable along with deleting every reference of every person not as popular as he is. The information regarding why he was not invited to participate should be added to the article if you believe the article is biased in that respect. Also, I do not know what is meant by,"Most are of the also running is variety." Use correct grammar if you wish for me to understand what was attempted to be conveyed.

<li>I never said I was going to do anything bad. Obviously I would just forget about it if they blocked e from recreating the article. I just want to have an aricle for James Werner but if you want me to stop on the article so bad I will but what you have to relize is i'm no trying to vandalize anything and i'm writing about a real politician who's name is going to be on the 2006 Teas Governor Race ballot just like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Perry_3a83.html" title="Rick Perry">Rick Perry</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Bell_8f11.html" title="Chris Bell">Chris Bell</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinky_Freidman_7f50.html" title="Kinky Freidman">Kinky Freidman</a>, and Karole Keeton Strayhorn.

<li>Just to clarify the standards: if an AFD nomination concludes with a consensus to delete, recreating the article in defiance of that decision is considered to be vandalism.

<p>If for any reason it would be an act of vandalism I would not recreate the article but if their was no notice indicating that it would be vandlism their would be no harm in recreating the article.

</ul>
<p>Some of my elaborating can be found by simply looking for what I typed on this page. Also, to further elaborate, the article(James Werner) should be kept and revised. Revising, if done correctly, is obviously something that can be done that will make the article easier to understand and verifiable. In addition to that, Jesse Ventura polled about 10% before the debates and he went on to win the election, despite the fact that no major polls indicated that he was leading. While, it is true that James Werner is/was not as popular as Jesse Ventura and he is not polling 10% in any major polls, he is still polling in single digits, not a fraction of a percent, and although he did not participate in the debates, he is a candidate that should have an article. Michael Badnarik can be considered a person and a candidate(former and present) that shouldn't have an article, but does. How is he extremely more significant that James Werner? Is it because Michael ran for president and James is only a candidate for a less significant office? Think about it, what harm is done by keeping the article on James Werner, considering the article will be revised in the ways necessary? Liberty6 04:56, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Harm is not a criterion for keeping the article in question. Notability IS. You merely claim that he is notable. PROVIDE SOME SOURCES. Dozens of people run for dozens of local elections. What makes him more notable than the average political candidate. Be careful with the "If Y than X" arguement. Every article needs to be judged of its own merits. Still, if we must use Badnarik for analogy purposese, here goes. Badnarik received CONSIDERABLE national press coverage during his run for president. Though Nader ultimately received more vote, the Libertarian Party is the third largest party in the U.S. via total registered memebers, and the Presidential Election is considerably more notable than a congressional race. Its the nature of the race he was involved in. Badnarik's political positions were put under the scrutiny of the national press. He merits significant NON TRIVIAL mention in several fact-checked sources. We have no evidence that Werner has been covered by any source more notable than a voter guide. THAT is the standard that we are going by when we make the case for delete. If you want to change our minds, provide evidence to the contrary by putting forward NON TRIVIAL, FACT CHECKED references to this candidate. If you can provide them, you will swing the discussion to your favor. In the absence of such sources, however, your pleas, however heartfelt, will not sway the consensus. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 05:07, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There is no necessary way to revise this article because no matter how it is done, the subject will still not be notable.

<li>1) <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Ventura_0ea7.html" title="Jesse Ventura">Jesse Ventura</a> is notable independant of his political career. His notability comes from his career as an actor and wrestler, which would have made him worthy of a Wikipedia article had he never even run for Governor. ALso 2) Had Jesse Ventura <i>not</i> been notable before he ran for governor, he would <i>not</i> have been notable polling only 10% of the electorate. He would have become notable the day he won the election. If THAT had been the case, he could only get an article after he had won. This guy is in the same situation. If he wins, we'll write an article about him. He hasn't won yet.

<dd>It's BEEN thought about and thought about plenty, long before you showed up. The harm, as I stated in my nomination, is in allowing Wikipedia to be mistaken for a free promotional vehicle. It's not; nor is a free webhosting service, a blog, a mode for free expression, a repository of unreferenced and speculative factoids, a way to attract attention to someone's cause, an unmediated and one-sided depository of candidate press releases and soundbites, a disguised campaign position paper, a dessert topping or a floor wax. Wikipedia aspires to be a vital and valuable online ENCYCLOPEDIA; devaluing it just so someone can get a few more votes for his pet candidate or pet cause DOES do it harm. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:24, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep.</b> I realize that we can't list every candidate for every office up for grabs in the United States (or anywhere in the world), but I think WP:BIO as it relates to politicians needs to be revised. I think we need to include information about candidates as well as victors in important races. A consensus should be reached as to what those races are, but I would definitely assume that governor, secretary of state, AG, etc. would be among them. I am in COMPLETE agreement that articles need to be NPOV - we don't want them to be big, free promotional vehicles (and it sounds like this has been an issue here), but then that's a different issue, and we need to address that accordingly. I can't think of one thing more confusing and in need of clarification than politics to most people - having a deletionist policy and only listing winners/officeholders seems to be well beside the point of what Wikipedia is for. My humble opinion. (Full disclosure: I was the author of an article of a candidate for secretary of state in my state that was deleted, despite media attention and notability.) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickBurns_f65d.html" title="User:NickBurns">NickBurns</a> 19:39, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
