<li><b>Comment</b> To say that this article doesn't merit an entry does not achknowledge the fact that Scott Keith was an integral part of the development of TSM, and that TSM was an integral part in the development of Scott Keith. Scott Keith has an entry on him on Wikipedia which has never been contested over afD...there is a reason for this...the reason is this...he was important to the development of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a>. As was TSM.

<li><b>Delete</b>, the website is non-notable. And for those arguing over DVDVR being here, the article has only survived afd twice through No Consensus.

<p><b>Keep</b> - see main article. There is enough criterion to differentiate it from other <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a> web sites. It played a major role in the development of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a> and to this day is one of the most frequented web sites in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a>. If web sites such as DVDR are listed, then this should definitely be listed. There are NO other wrestling forums that have gained as much of a cult following as TSM and crossed over to mainstream as much as it has. They became so well known that they had to close signups for a long time because there were so many people signing up who were not living up to the expected standard---whatever that be (and actually signups still may be closed for all I know). Anyway, the subject of this entry is totally notable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.171.203.233 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.171.203.233_6630.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.171.203.233">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, this is not something that wiki needs. It is a boring entry for a rather boring website. Seeing this kind of stuff at wiki almost gives people the message that anything they find remotely interesting is worth putting up at wiki. That should not be the case. Especially for something like a website that barely exists and whose claim to fame, if it ever had one to begin with, was years ago. Matthew Jones, unregistered contributor 11:08, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: This website isn't notable by the usual <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> standards, but within the community it serves might be notable. The question then becomes whether individual sites within a notable online community are notable based on their association with the community. I would say not per Rory's comment above about association not transferring notability. This has interesting parallels to the discussion about the MetaWiki article below.—<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 07:33, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That's a good question. I'd have to say that since Wikipedia is a general interest encyclopedia, than notability within a community does not mean it's notable enough for Wikipedia. That's a whole other debate though. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a> 13:11, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - as it stands, virtually every "keep" vote is either insisting that the website is one of the most popular wrestling websites (no proof has been offered for this claim, though) or by arguing that the website deserves an article if the "Death Valley Driver Video Review" website deserves an article. This is not a reasonable argument, as the Death Valley Driver Video Review article has been nominated for deletion three times to date due to a lack of notability. Wikipedia should not be a staging ground for a series of juvenile "forum wars". <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 12:06, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Its Alexa ranking is 85,000 which is way more than RajahWWF.com. If that's not a reasonable argument then neither is that "its a boring entry for a rather boring web site." Tons of proof has been offered about its notability, including that it was one of the leaders of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a> boom; the only problem is that many people such as you are unwilling to achknowledge the arguments that have been fully established for it to stay.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 12:34, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But 85,000 is far, far higher than 411mania (25,777), wrestlingobserver.com (26,543) and pwtorch.com (21,819). The website in question is clearly not one of the more popular wrestling websites on the Internet, as there are similar websites with 60,000 more visitors. Moreover, the (dubious) argument that the website was central to the development of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_wrestling_community.html" title="Internet wrestling community">Internet wrestling community</a> is of little merit, as that article has also been proposed for deletion in the past. The same is true of your above claim that Scott Keith has an article, so the article should remain - the Scott Keith article has also been proposed for deletion in the past. This website is in no sense notable, and the fact that it influenced or was frequented by similar pseudo-notable article subjects should not save it from being deleted. <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 20:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your argument is entirely invalid. There is a very good reason why there is a deletion <b>process</b> here on Wikipedia. If there were'nt, anybody could just delete an entry they didn't like, but because there is a process, the deletion must be approved in advance. Your argument relies on the assumption that just because an article was proposed for deletion in the past, it isn't notable, which is ridiculous.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 19:50, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
