<li>If you follow your own rationale and apply the proposed notability guidelines given in the nomination, you will find that this school is notable.

<li>When it comes to schools discussions, many editors appear to be stuck in a groove, repeating the same arguments again and again. A lot of these arguments are wrong. "All X schools are notable."/"All X schools are not notable." are both wrong. Notability is not a blanket. "This school seems notable/non-notable to me." is wrong. Notability is not a subjective judgement made by Wikipedia editors. "This school is unimportant."/"This school is important to its pupils." are wrong. Notability is neither fame nor importance.
<p>The new <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> proposal embodies the <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a>, namely that the subject be the subject of multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the subject or its owners/creators. This is the notability criterion that first appeared in limited form in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> at least two years ago and that has been generalized to published works in all forms. In its general form it appeared in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, and the effect has been to shift the focus of discussion of company articles. Two years ago editors would be giving their <i>personal opinions</i> of how "famous" or "well-known" or "important" a company is, or centring the discussion around the author of the article. Now, as a direct consequence of WP:CORP, editors far more often go looking for books, news articles, magazine feature articles, reports, and the like (i.e. sources), and are basing their rationales upon the extents and natures of those sources. <i>Finding, reading, and evaluating sources is the proper study of encyclopaedists.</i> It seems like a good idea for the schools debate to shift away from the "stuck record" arguments towards looking at sources, too. If WP:CORP did it for companies, WP:SCHOOL should do it for schools.</p>
<p>Therefore I am applying the proposed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria, in particular the primary criterion, to this school. Looking for non-trivial published works, I find, in amongst all of the mere directory entries like <a href="http://www.axcis.co.uk/18533.html" class="external text" title="http://www.axcis.co.uk/18533.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.schoolreviews.co.uk/school.php?s=578" class="external text" title="http://www.schoolreviews.co.uk/school.php?s=578" rel="nofollow">this one</a> (which is content-free!), and a few works whose source is the school itself, a lengthy published report by an inspectorate independent of the school, and a followup report, both cited above. The first is <i>definitely</i> not a mere directory entry, and it appears likely from its length that the second is not, either. The primary criterion is thus satisfied. <b>Keep</b>.</p>
<p>Notice that the above rationale does not rely upon fame, importance, significance, personal opinion of a Wikipedia editor, or blanket statements in either direction; but relies solely upon the primary notability criterion and looking at sources and what they contain. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Just so you are aware, the reports you cited are from government inspections which take place from time to time for <i>all</i> Scottish schools. If they are deemed satisfactory evidence of the school's notability, then that means that all Scottish schools are <i>de facto</i> notable.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 03:20, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The first paragraph of the inspection says that it was part of a "sample" of primary schools, not that it was part of a global inspection of every primary school. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:20, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If this was a <b>random</b> sample, then it confers no special status on the school i.e. these schools are no more or less notable than any other Scottish schools. If it was not random, then the selection criteria are presumably published and become an input to the notability evaluation. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 12:18, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sampling in these inspections is not random, but is rather systematic so that over a time period each and every school is inspected, but in any given year a reasonable spread (primarily geographical) is chosen. See <a href="http://www.hmie.gov.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.hmie.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education</a>. If you look around that site you will find reports for pretty much every school. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 20:32, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete —</b> I'm not sure that an inspection report from the government makes a school any more notable, unless the criteria for ordering such reports are the same as WP's notability criteria (and I doubt this). <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 02:35, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as a directory entry.

Besides, you can probably find an inspection report on any school in Great Britain, as the inspection is probably required to make then. Hence, the would mean all schools should stay, which is not in the spirt of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. Moreover, I don't see this particular school meet any of the other criteria. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 02:59, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the school concerned exist for all schools in the U.K., then having articles on all schools in the U.K. is <i>very much</i> in the spirit of WP:SCHOOL. The spirit of WP:SCHOOL is having enough source information to construct more than a entry that would be a directory entry in a directory of schools. i.e. the spirit of WP:SCHOOL is <i>not to construct a directory of schools</i>. Read the introductory paragraphs of WP:SCHOOL and <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a>.

Government inspection reports (or, at least, <i>these</i> government inspection reports — please <i>read</i> them) are non-trivial published works, the same as any other. Discounting sources simply because they are produced by government agencies is wrongheaded. Sources should be discounted either because they are unreliable (i.e. they come from the school itself) or because they are trivial (i.e. they constitute no more than simple directory entries). These sources are neither. (I gave examples of trivial sources that <i>are</i> discounted, for contrast.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:20, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Also a question to Uncle G: have you actually read the Inspection reports? You simply can't base an encyclopedic article on them that goes beyond stub level: they simply state that the parents and inspection were satisified with the school performance a few years back.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I like the fact that we are striving to get more than "notable" involved, but applying criticisms of the subject of the article is limited. They will tell us only what could conceivably be written. Almost every day we have speedy deletions of sentence fragment "articles" under G1, even if they managed to pretend to be about something significant. Nor is this "clean up is no rationale for deletion" because this is not a question of cleaning up but rather a complete rewrite. Consider the speedy deletion criterion of A7: "makes no claim for notability." Again, it isn't "isn't notable" but "makes no claim": an article on a band that says "Talking Heads is a band that broke up in the '80's and they were really cool" would be an A7 candidate despite the fact that, of course, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talking_Heads_1ab7.html" title="Talking Heads">Talking Heads</a> was a seminal group. This particular article doesn't give us as reviewers much to work with. Now, we, as reviewers, can go off and do research on our own, but that has already put the onus on us to write the article. Once we're doing the research and organizing the information, we are, essentially, writing a new article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:47, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> So let me get this straight- it is being argued that all schools that are inspected (that is, every school in the UK), is notable because you can cite the inspection documents? I am not a crusader against schools entrys- if historical details/ unique method/ a particularly notable place in the community show that the school is more of note than just any school, then fine, let it be in wikipedia.

<li>There are <b>no</b> guidelines or policies about notability for schools, nor are there any general guidelines or policies on notability as a criterion for deletion.

There is not now, nor has there ever been any <i>need</i> for deletion on grounds of notability, and in many fields (math, science, engineering) it would be quickly recognised as inappropriate.

<dd><b>comment</b> Is verifiability the only criteria that determines whether something gets it own article? I can easily verify that I am alive. Does that make me eligible to have an article written on myself? No, it doesn't. I was under the impression that notability is a fairly important criteria when evaluating the existance of an article. Sure, a couple of sources do show that this school exists. It is verifiable. Does that make it important enough to warrant its own article? No. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> guidelines, although still a proposal, should be used to determine whether it should have its own article, and the sources that Uncle G cites I would consider to be <b>trivial</b> sources of Scottish schools. If every school must undergo an inspection and is listed on these reports, then following Uncle G's interpretation of the guidelines, all Scottish school's should have an article. What if the Scottish government did not have these documents posted online? Also, I am not familiar with the organization of Scottish schools, but are they run independently or does the Scottish government control them? It seems to me that a government agency that is responsible for regulation of Scottish Schools means that this agency is not completely independent of the article's subject. Are there any other non-trivial sources regarding this school? This thinking is not logical. It is obvious that this debate is still being discussed and consensus has not been met. Many still fail to see how this article meets the criteria.

<dd>That kind of thinking can lead you down a slippery slope. I know it is a stretch, but some people could begin to think: "hey, every person on the face of the earth influences other people and their society in some important way." Sure, education is very important in a modern society. That doesn't make every school important enough for an individual article. A library is important to a community, providing a means for indviduals to go out and gain access to otherwise unavailable information. But that hardly means that every library branch in my city deserves its own article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 03:06, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> As much as the school-cruft gives me a royal headache, the long running consensus has been that schools are notable. Uncle G's argument on the application of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is valid. I will say that I personally <i>disagree</i> with the spirit of WP:School because I think it is too leninent in it's criteria for the notability of school. But alas, that is the status quo consenus until we work to change it. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 08:49, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. What has struck me as odd is that there's obviously a double standard here (in AFD). People have to be notable, but schools have to be verifiable. I personally agree that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is <i>the</i> policy to adhere to, but that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ulf_Bauscher_df35.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ulf Bauscher">doesn't seem to count for people</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderhead_3955.html" title="User:Thunderhead">Thunderhead</a> 11:26, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is certainly true, but keep in mind that, while most schools are sufficiently verifiable most people aren't. It would certainly be nice to see less deletion of people that actually are verifiable though. Personally, I don't have the time to work on something along these lines, but if someone had suggestions as to how to ensure that verifiable people are kept I'd certainly support that. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:23, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, the first return of the search 'Three Kingdoms Comic' comes up with the site www.shiji.cc/san/ which happens to be the former place of the comic. Secondly, do you expect there to be a multitude of members in the first few days of a forum being up? Obviously it will take some time to get more members than 3-4 days.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's actually very popular amongst its target audience and is far from a "non notable" webcomic. I suggest looking for some web traffic stats before doing something like "deleting" when Wiki has many more less notable and less factual entries listed. If you choose to delete, then at least keep it on a list of webcomics. They don't need help advertising, but I see no good reason to delete given the comic's high readership for being "unnotable." <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlechtentag_c5e1.html" title="User:Schlechtentag">Schlechtentag</a> 08:14, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - My apologies for misplacing the Alexa link (now corrected). Also note that the Alexa rank for the old domain www.shiji.cc is <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.shiji.cc%2Fsan%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.shiji.cc%2Fsan%2F" rel="nofollow">unranked</a>. The reason there are less notable and less factual entries for webcomics at Wikipedia, is because the webcomic community think anything is notable if they're a fan of it. I would nominate and delete more, but right now I'm busy with work and my internet connection has regressed to 56k. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 02:03, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> It has 10,200 hits on google, and it might be, according to some reliable source we haven't yet found, truly notable. All the same, however, I don't see any sources that have much proof of notability on Google, and the article itself doesn't assert notability in any meaningful way.

While I respect you, your arguement is weak in the face of the matter that Wikipedia does not keep articles based on if they are interesting or not. <i>Wikipedia's three content policies are Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. Because the three policies are complementary, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. <b>These three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus</b></i> So if you believe it should be kept, please provide a reason that these pillars of the wiki community should be put asside for this one article. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 16:44, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Ridiculously incomplete, and if anyone tried to make a serious list, it would be completely unwieldy - Amazon lists over 1000 hits on his name.

<li>"<b>Weak Keep</b> If I go to the library and get a book about a composer, it may well have a section of "essential repertoire" recordings of the composer's works. I assume that at the time the book was written, these were the best performances on record: that they represent an acknowledged interpreter of the works, well recorded. I would appreciate the same thing in a Wiki article about a composer. The problem is, if Wikipedian Joe Blow writes the list, and says "These are the best recordings of Franck's work" that is obviously OR. The article would have to come from a verifiable source, such as a music book or music magazine, or at least a reputable website (and how is that detremined?). Then there would be the problem of copyright infringement: The list is the property of the magazine or book. One out is to include in the main article on the musician a link to a website listing essential recordings. Then some deletionist is likely to complain the website is spam, if they also offer products for sale. Checking a few musicians randomly: I don't see such a discography for Beethoven or Carl Czerny, just a listing of compositions. For Wagner, many compositions have their own articles. Lohengrin lists 6 recordings chosen by someone. Is their inclusion OR? Why not 6 other recordings? For Gershwin, the article on Rhapsody in Blue identifies 6 recordings as "Notable" without citing a source for that opinion. Clearly the precedent is set for an inclusion of "Notable" recordings in the Franck article itself or in a split off article such as this, or go to the other articles and remove the discography as OR. For Wagner's Die Meistersinger, the article has an external link to a Geocities blog where someone in 2000 listed the best recordings (in his opinion)of the work. That site does not offer products for sale, so does not appear to be spam. If such a site had reviews or selections made by someone with credentials such as a distinguished conductor or professor of music, it would seem to meet general Wiki requirements of verifiability, and to be a usable approach, preferable to the editor just listing the recordings he owns. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:12, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But this list doesn't even claim to be a list of "notable recordings". As I pointed out above, it doesn't attempt to cover such well-known works as Franck's <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_in_D_minor_%28Franck%29_9ca4.html" title="Symphony in D minor (Franck)">Symphony</a> or Violin Sonata. It is restricted to organ music. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 00:24, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point was that in any article, for the editor to say These 6 recordings are Notable or The Bes is OR unless they cite some verifiable external review or list to say so. Such lists should be deleted as OR unless tyhey have an outside source for the selection. It would not matter if the Franck articlelisted a couple of recordings of every composition by Franck. Still OR. But for consistency, why disallow a list of recordings ONLY in this article? Surely there are collections of reviews such as John von Rhein's: <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-0608110217aug11,1,1683241.story" class="external free" title="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-0608110217aug11,1,1683241.story" rel="nofollow">http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-0608110217aug11,1,1683241.story</a> which identify the most notable recordings, old as well as new, of a given work<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:48, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, but writing a discography generally takes a significant amount of work. If anyone was really serious about making this article more complete, they could, for a start, add entries for the 581 recordings of Franck available at <a href="http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Namedrill?&amp;name_id=3961&amp;name_role=1" class="external text" title="http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Namedrill?&amp;name_id=3961&amp;name_role=1" rel="nofollow">ArkivMusic</a>, and then investigate out-of-print recordings.

<dl>
<dd>See above. Other articles list perhaps 6 "Notable" recordings of a given work by a given composer, but I challeneg th editors' selection of those 6 as OR, the equivalent of the editor saying "Here are my favorite recordings" unless they cite, say an article by a music critic listing those as the critic's favorite recordings.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:57, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We seem to be drifting off-topic here. If you want to challenge lists of "Notable recordings" in other articles that are not backed by references as OR or "Citation needed" then go ahead. I'm not sure what relevance that has to this particular article, which does not claim to be a list of Notable recordings, but rather a "List of recordings of compositions by Cesar Franck". Imagine as a thought experiment that I created an article entitled List of all recordings of anything ever made and populated it with two CDs from my collection. That list would also have clear and verifiable criteria for inclusion and a finite limit. In fact, all the arguments that are being used to defend this Franck list would also apply to my imaginary article. It would need a bit of expansion, to be sure, but so then does the Franck list! Yet surely no-one would deny that <i>that</i> article should be deleted because it is hopelessly overambitious and pathetically incomplete. The same points apply to this Franck article. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 16:08, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Checked at my public library and found 2 guides to classical recordings. They do not list hundreds of recommended recordings for Franck. In fact, Rough Guide only selected 5 of his works other than organ works, and had a few recordings of each. "A Basic Music Library" by the American Library Association only chose 3 of his works other than organ works, and listed 1 to 4 recordings of each. Obviously there is zero merit to listing a duplication of Schwan's catalog with every recording in print, then supplementing it with all out of print recordings. But there is a place for "Notable" or "Recommended" recordings. So rename the article to avoid the accusation that it does not include every recording ever done, and either include representative selections from such guides as are found in a library, or from a reputable online website. Please take a look at my additions, which include 1 or more recordings of each of the works recommended in either of the 2 guides found. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:05, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Good speaker</b>, Carlo Rendell talks on life after sport for young cricketers and footballers who fail to make the grade. His small but relateive success after failing in his sport is a fine example for others as is reflected by his page. For those of you who have not heard of Middlesex CCC I am quite frankly appalled that you choose to make a comment to delete this man's page. Middlesex is one of the sporting institutions of this country, playing at Lords cricket ground as the above writer mentions. To bring this man's existance into question is a slight not only on him, but on the cricketing and youth coaching community as a whole. Please only comment on an individual when you have the slightest idea what you are going on about.Richardss 14:20, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Comment" It is fairly evident that many of the people passing judgement on Carlo Rendell’s notability have no understanding of cricket and the community that surrounds it. It is therefore impossible for them to comment on his notability within cricket circles with any authority. Perhaps they should keep there ill informed opinions to themselves or do some more research on cricket in England. I am a Middlesex member and am genuinely sickened that Middlesex County Cricket Club was called into question. I do hope these people look it up to see what a mistake they made. Carlo Rendell played for the club for the best part of three years and was a contracted professional, which I believe in its own write makes him notable! How the opinions of those in question would be swayed if it was a sport they actually had the patience or intellect to understand.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 164.143.240.33 (<a href="../../../1/6/4/User_talk%7E164.143.240.33.html" title="User talk:164.143.240.33">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_164.143.240.33_91bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/164.143.240.33">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>What a relief it is to have someone comment on this article that actually has an understanding of the game and can give acurate critisism. I refer back to previous comments and stongly urge "wikipedians" to only comment on things that they understand as some of the statments made previously are illinformed at best and could be percieved as down right ignorant by others. It seems utterly absurd for individuals from parts of the world that dont play cricket to make judgements on the game and its players. What do others feel? refering not so much in relation to this article but more generally in specific feilds of knowledge?</p>

<p>Your comments have left me somewhat chagrin. I understand your piont of veiw though, but still find the system a little frustrating. There are individuals associated with wikipedia who know alot about said subject(cricket)and they are very well placed to comment it may not be my place to ask but was offering a suggestion. Im sorry if i was not civil Brian and it was not a personal attack. I am worried that certain parts of wikipedia will be left in a detritus as a results.

<li><b>Keep</b>, looking at the article history, it was originally a press release copied over to Wikipedia. In an effort to clean it up and make it sound less like an advert it was stripped to its bare bones. Then someone stripped it down further making it just a definition. However, it seems that there is some claim that this product works in a <i>different way</i> than other products of its kind, that it's a <i>new technology</i>. That information should be restored to the article (and supplemented with non-press release references) and the article should be kept. <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 14:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Surprised to find this page listed for deletion, as I have encountered a few web sites who are already using EditGrid to store and present data (such as <a href="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/3100/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/3100/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>).

The orientation of <a href="../../../s/o/n/WP%7ESONG_9898.html" title="WP:SONG">WP:SONG</a> is semi-useless for artists like the Grateful Dead who were not singles-oriented.

<p>Look, Moeron also redirected out several other Grateful Dead song articles at the same time, most of which actions were justified (they were the sort of pointless "X is a song on album Y" articles that didn't say much else). But Box of Rain's article has compelling material. The story of its creation illustrates that even at the height of the so-called hippie/counterculture era, family and generational considerations were still paramount. And how Lesh composed it with vocal nuances but not words is also interesting. And its concert performance history also illustrates how sometimes great material can be forgotten and then refound. I'm asking for some common sense here. Which article do you think people will get more out of reading, <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_of_Rain_e9a1.html" title="Box of Rain">Box of Rain</a> or <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick%27s_Picks_Volume_15_440b.html" title="Dick's Picks Volume 15">Dick's Picks Volume 15</a>? <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 04:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC) <s>*<b>Keep</b>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yes, and this entry fails to mention that the <i>reason</i> they were kicked off not only LiveJournal but Blurty as well is because F_W members were actively encouraging members to harass people that they were "wanking", going as far as to post personal real life information of people (including pictures, full names, addresses and even telephone numbers). That's the problem with a fan page - the bias. F_W has its own Wiki, so why does their "history" need to be documnented here? Before you know it, places like OhNoTheyDidnt and Premade LJs - both communities with over 30,000 members - will have entries here. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoomisSimmons_5ef4.html" title="User:LoomisSimmons">LoomisSimmons</a> 13:20, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't know much about the days before Journalfen, but as of right now, F_W and its affiliated communities are <i>adamant</i> about not giving out the personal info of anyone featured there, and the mods will immediately delete the comments of and ban anyone caught doing this. You're not even supposed to alert the people being wanked that they are on f_w or participate in the wank on your own. These things are all right in the comm's rules. So if that's the problem you have with the community itself, and your issue is that Wikipedia condones such behavior by keeping the article up, then it's really a non-issue at this point. If you have an instance where someone's privacy was violated by the comm recently, then cite examples.AGNGoo 18:55, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> very interesting article about a website that has thousands of members. The website covers a whole range of fandoms and it is very much the case that major players within fandoms have heard of it. Amazing though it may seem to the person who brought up this AfD, a lot of people have heard of Fandom Wank (and we're not talking people just within the Wikipedia), and there are several articles on Wikipedia of less notable figures, for example: Daniel Brandt. I'm calling that the person who posted this AfD has some sort of grudge against FW.

<li><small><b>Delete</b>. The first deletion debate probably should have been thrown out, as notability was asserted without being proved. The lack of actual references outside of the community imply a walled garden. Absent extenuating circumstances, three thousand members is not particularly impressive nor does it argue for inclusion. Furthermore, articles are not kept on the basis that articles still worthy of deletion remain. An article <i>must</i> stand or fall on its own merits.

Wiki is a good place to go specifically for information about things you might hear about randomly that you have no clue about, and fandom_wank is one of the places you might accidentally run across in general net discussions. As to the size fo the comm? It's about as big as some of the small towns we have pages for (eg, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perry_%28village%29%2C_New_York_9c97.html" title="Perry (village), New York">Perry, NY</a>), and probably has more constant activity.

<li><small><b>Comment</b> I'd like to point out that the majority of these keep votes are simply "if so-and-so is here, why can't this be here?" which, as <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> has pointed out, is no reason to keep anything. If there are other vanity pages that need to be deleted, then let's get rid of them. As for "proving" anything about F_W through external documenation, I challenge anyone to do so. The first AfD should've failed solely because notability was not proven (still hasn't been, other than "lots of people RILLY RILLY LIEK IT!!11"), and now we have the problem of original research. No matter what articles are here that shouldn't be - yes, even the cursed GNAA (which I disagree with as well), the bottom line is that F_W has no place on Wikipedia because it does NOT NOT FOLLOW WIKIPEDIA'S OUTLINED RULES. Notability? FAIL. Verification? FAIL. Neutral point of view? FAIL.

I've been working on another community page <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_NY_50e4.html" title="Buffalo, NY">Buffalo, NY</a>, and the tone there is far less in tune with NPoV.

<dd><small><b>Comment</b> F_W does a lot of covering up itself, such as the reason for their being banned from LiveJournal (and Blurty) and the banning of people from their own Wiki who step up to challenge a lot of the lies they tell. Even if there is proof, (screencaps, links, etc), they'll ban that person anyway. So I don't see how F_W is any different than any other community who "covers up" things. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoomisSimmons_5ef4.html" title="User:LoomisSimmons">LoomisSimmons</a> 19:23, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small><b>Comment</b> So basically, your whole reason for bringing this up for deletion is that you don't like FW and think they lie a lot, without any corroboration whatsoever of that idea. Cite evidence of said lies. Bring up the screen caps--they'd be housed elsewhere, probably by the person who originally posted them. As far as I know, the only screen caps that have gotten people banned have been screencaps of f-locked posts, which are prohibited in the comm because they aren't allowed to wank f-locked posts. That's visible in the comm's regulations. Exactly what instances are you referring to?

<li><small>In keeping with the note at the head of the page, the reason I think it should be kept is quite simple: Wiki is the only place to get non-biased information on sites such as this. Yes, it could lead to the consequence of bad_penny having a page, or OhNoYouDidn't, but honestly? I don't think that's a bad thing. Cyber-communities unattached to major entries (eg, hatrack.com would be attached, presumably, to <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Scott_Card_9716.html" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>--I haven't checked, though) are orphan information, and they are topics which someone could quite conceivably come looking for if encountered elsewhere on the web. One of the wonderful things about the Internet is the spontaneous generation of distinct sub-communities, and it behooves an online encyclopedia to treat them as legitimate. If we want to avoid having a page for every single comm, maybe we could come up with an over-arching article which includes several under general categories, but at present, that doesn't exist, and an article specifically dealing with one particular comm, as long as it is written in NPoV, is as justifiable as one on a small town or any other minor hobby. (Another possible "general" page would be net-watching as a hobby, rather like <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philately.html" title="Philately">philately</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird-watching.html" title="Bird-watching">bird-watching</a>, with F_W, bp, and others addressed as separate aspects of it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_w_86a2.html" title="User:Miss w">Miss w</a> 20:25, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><small>I am afraid this will degenerate into wank if we continue this discussion. Well, you should look up the meaning of wank as I am using it here as fast as you, because if your mission succeeds you won't be able to look it up on Wikipedia anymore. Anyway, I am not sure if I can give you a justification for keeping the article, since you're quite intense about deleting it. But personally, I find the fact that the Official <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joss_Whedon_368c.html" title="Joss Whedon">Joss Whedon</a> blog has used the word <b>wank</b> in the Fandom Wank definition of the word without actually linking to Fandom Wank in any form a sign that the definition word <i>wank</i> has been irreversibly altered by Fandom Wank among a significant part of the online community. That is one thing that makes Fandom Wank notable. As for media mentions <a href="http://www.metroactive.com/metro/07.19.06/work-0629.html" class="external text" title="http://www.metroactive.com/metro/07.19.06/work-0629.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> describes a series of events that partially took place on Fandom Wank. Fandom Wank is not explicitly mentioned, but only because the author mistook Fandom Wank for <i>the LiveJournal fanfic community</i>. Wikipedia could have put her right, if she had actually done research. --<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules2_62d4.html" title="User:Jules2">Jules2</a> 00:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small>Furthermore, Truthiness has been the subject of multiple articles in the mainstream press.

<li><small><b>Comment</b>: The mainstream press is not the only source of documendation. I could fairly easily provide first-hand documentation (which should trump documentation provided third-hand, which is what you get most of the time with the mainstream press) of most of the claims in this article. Those for which I cannot do so could be provided by others. The only reason I haven't done so is a matter of time constraints. Furthermore, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">truthiness</a> was a concept championed by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, who is much closer to the mainstream press than Fandom Wank by virtue of being a cable television personality. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoman_1da2.html" title="User:Thephotoman">Thephotoman</a> 00:48, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><small><b>Comment</b>: Your argument against referencing primary sources is not valid, as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> allows for such. The only thing prohibited through <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is posting work in Wikipedia that would result in Wikipedia being referenced as a primary source.

<p><small>Sollog is not worthy of an encyclopedia article. He is of no significance or importance.

Also this article has major problems with WP:Verifiability. It uses Usenet posts by third parties as primary sources of information. It also uses personal web pages and blogs as sources for claims.

<p>I do not think this article, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a>, belongs on Wikipedia. The person is not at all important, he made some kind of "psychic prediction" back in 2001 and has not done anything very notable since. Most of his "fame", as much as there is, seems to come from Internet postings from him or people who claim to be him or his "followers", there is no way to sort them out. There is also lots of discrediting personal information in the article which seems to be put there out of spite and has nothing to do with his alleged "notablity". I had never heard of him until someone mentioned his article as an example of the kind of unimportant person who can get a Wikipedia article.

This has a list of ten alternative criteria. Of these, it's very obvious that the first six, the eighth and the tenth are utterly irrelevant to "Sollog". As for the seventh -- "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work" -- we might allow "published" to include "self-published", but there are not multiple independent reviews, let alone awards. The ninth is "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events"; there's no renown whatever and there's very minor notoriety for his trolling and misdemeanors in events (or non-events) that are barely newsworthy, and of course for his risible attempts to claim <i>after</i> very newsworthy events that he predicted them. WP:BIO does add that failure to meet any of these criteria is not reason for deletion; I do not claim that WP:BIO is a license to delete the article, but I don't see that it gives any support for retaining it. (Incidentally, for me "Sollog" fails the "I heard of it before coming to Wikipedia" test; moreover, he fails any "I heard of it outside Wikipedia even after I read of it at Wikipedia" test.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:36, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Why not? Wikipedia standards of inclusion are decided by consensus, and one way consensus is determined is by which articles are kept and which are deleted by consensus. The GNAA was deemed worthy of inclusion by six or ten or thirty VFD discussions and thus is a reliable indicator of consensus. If something is more notable than the GNAA, then it obviously meets the Wikipedia bar of inclusion. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 14:53, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think the GNAA article is a good metric as I think it's a special case. Not a special case by design, mind: It's systematically-connected to Wikipedia closely enough that I believe the Wikipedia system operates strangely in relation to it. (As an example, the huge number of deletion nominations is an obvious abberation indicating strange currents are at work.) Because I don't think the Wikipedia system operates as expected in regards to GNAA, I throw it out from the pool of data, as a statistician would, when trying to find a best-fit line that would indicate the cutoff point for notability. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 20:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.This is looking like a cause by a disgruntled anti-capitalist. This industry may not be well-known, but it generates over $80 billion in sales in the US alone. This is ivory tower condescension, especially since the one proposing the deletion has felt the need to return and justify his stance. If it's not self-evident the item should be deleted, then it seems he has not made his case. Additionally, changes have been made to bring the article more into Wikipedia standards. And as to "ghits," I thought Wikipedia was about sharing information, not popularity? W. S. Cross 19:14, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>ALEXA IS TRASH. It is the worst way possible to rank websites. When I installed their crap toolbar ages ago, i watched my site go to the top 10,000 within days. Go by our statistics - 5,000,000 message board posts, 130,000 members, and 350,000 sessions a day. Perhaps you should take some time to do some research before you make an ass out of yourself again. ALSO - the site uses two domain names - so search for both on alexa and you will see that it's a completely different story.

Second of all, pahardcore.com has an Alexa rank of 297,961; thus, on average, these two sites would have a ranking of around 290,000, and even if you put them together, their rank would probably be around 270,000. That certainly helps to confirm a lack of importance. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 13:51, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The fact that you're basing your opinions on alexa's ranking system is completely retarded. Seriously. If everyone that used my message boards downloaded their toolbar, we would see both domains rise to the top 10,000, which is where it once was. And alexa doesn't even support Firefox... which about 20% of my users use. <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrickhouse_b540.html" title="User:Cbrickhouse">Cbrickhouse</a> 13:53, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

This was because I had all my users download a personalised toolbar. A lot of the people stopped using the toolbar because they use BETTER toolbars, like googles. If google ranked websites I guarantee that we would have great rankings.
<p>And as for our "unique google hits" - you're basing that on the domain name stereokiller.com, which has only been active for a few years. Search in google for pahardcore.com and you will have much different results.</p>
<p>Your math/reasoning skills are not very good. It would *not* be an actual average of the two divided by the total of both. It would be much lower if the site used one domain name. Probably around 100,000. Because it's tracking both as seperate websites, it lowers the rankings of both instead of as one site.</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, I mentioned above that if you combined the rankings, they still wouldn't be much higher; as I stated, "if you put them together, their rank would probably be around 270,000." Second, and <i>once again</i>, please try to conform to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Finally, I actually got a laugh out of your claim that my math skills are subpar, seeing as I had perfect scores on the math SAT I and SAT IIc. But that's irrelevant; as someone mentions below, I'd be all for sprotecting this discussion, or simply speedying the article right now (as all 8 registered users who have made their opinions known have moved for deletion anyway, while only <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accounts</a> have argued for keeping the article). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:13, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Before I go into my reasoning for deletion, let me say this: saying incivil and rude things ("your math/reasoning skills are not very good", "completely retarded", etc) will <i>not</i> help your case in the least and may in fact result in a block or ban. I believe this article should be deleted because it does not satisfy the guideline of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and because it's apparently not very well known - I can find no news article or non-trivial publications on this website. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 14:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course I'm going to be un-civil - you people have not listened to a word I've said. Our google pagerank for pahardcore.com is 5/10 and stereokiller.com 4/10 - which is just as good as some other sites I've seen listed here. If you're going to ban me then just do it already. I've done nothing other than to try and get a simple page for my site here, not an advertisement, but because it is an important resource for music and IS widely used, despite what you have illogically deducted. But I ask that if you delete my then delete the like sites as well. Then at least you would have done something right today. <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrickhouse_b540.html" title="User:Cbrickhouse">Cbrickhouse</a> 14:22, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I realize that this website has certain guidelines/ways to decide whether or not a website is allowed to be listed on Wikipedia and that Stereokiller doesn't currently meet the Alexa rating standard. I also realize that Brickhouse may have offended/upset more than a few people on here, making everyone even more biased against the site. However, that was merely because he doesn't understand why a website that has so many users and so many bands isn't eligible for this website. Have all of you checked the site out yourself? It isn't just a message board. There are thousands of CD reviews on there, mp3s, and listings for shows all around the country, as well as, over a million users. Maybe when it was started in 97, it was just a bunch of our friends messing around on a website, but it has grown and has become ridiculously widespread over the past 10 years. Brickhouse could no longer even keep the old name (PaHardcore), because it was more than obvious that it wasn't just us southeastern PA kids anymore. The users on Stereokiller are from all over the world. The website helps up and coming bands get wide exposure, much like MySpace does. I hope you can at least take that into consideration. Thanks. -Jessclancy 19:01, 17 August 2006 (UTC)Jess.

<li>'Jess, while I can respect that completely, the fact of the matter is that this AfD is not about censorship or picking favorites. It isn't about if a site has a huge following or not. It is about if the Article can pass all of Wikipedia's rules. Let me help out a bit so you understand. The Alexia rating isn't really used as a guideline (and is often cited for it's inaccuracy. I personally believe it should be done away with), and the Google searchs are really only used to back up a statement, not as a basis for a vote though this is abused sometimes. No, the real problem with this article is that it doesn't follow the three pillars of wikipedia. An article must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> through multiple, reliable, reputable, independent, third-party sources. It must not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which means there are no sources to back up the claims. It must also have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point-of-view</a> and not show bias. As a guideline for the above rules, an article must <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite it's notability</a> with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and be must be <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopaedic</a>. This article falls into <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">being an advertisment</a> per a statement made by a forum member. It also fails to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">wikipedia's website policy</a>. I hope this helps you to understand.

<li>First of all, I would like to say that I understand and respect why you have these guidelines and this screening process. I neglected to mention that in my previous post. Although I just created my account today, I frequent this website quite often when researching my college term papers (and of course, I cite the information and give credit where it is due). Therefore, I completely understand that it is important to your credibility as a website and information provider to make sure that your hosted websites are legitimate. I also appreciate the time you took to be very specific when replying to my first post even though you already did it multiple times on this page and are probably tired of doing it. With that being said (I know, there is always a but), I think that with the variety of different services/information that different sites have to offer, maybe some of the guidelines should be different for certain types of websites. Stereokiller is much different than a site where, for example, someone has dedicated to American History. Obviously, if you are hosting that man's website, you must be sure that it is legit and the information is accurate, and that it is not just some wierdo posting from his basement who decides he wants to rewrite American History and see what internet sucker believes it. Stereokiller, on the other hand, really helps give new and up and coming bands exposure. The mp3s that are hosted are provided to the user for free, so Brickhouse is not doing this in order to have more people paying him for downloads of songs. Also, I understand why you are looking for notable sources/articles to verify that Stereokiller is a credible website for reasons that I mentioned earlier. However, I think that is a little less important than it is for the american history type website I described above, because the bands choose to host themselves. Brickhouse can't be falsely representing the bands, because they put the information about them up themselves. Also, I doubt there are many articles, if any at all, written about Stereokiller, not because it is a non-credible website, but because it represents the underground hardcore scene, which is much less popular than a website that is centered around huge pop-stars like Justin Timberlake or Kelly Clarkson. As far as not wanting to host a website with biased information, I understand that as well. The only information that I could see to be considered biased on the website would be the reviews, but that's to be expected, right? A review is simply one person giving their opinion about what they are reviewing. If they don't like the music, it gets a bad review, much like if Roger Ebert doesn't like a movie, it gets a bad review. That does not mean that Ebert is not a credible source for movie reviews, nor that the movie is techinically awful, it is just his opinion. As far as the article Brickhouse posted about it sounding like an advertisement, I read Pure Volume's post and found them to be quite similar. I realize that PureVolume probably meets the credible article requirement because it is a much bigger website, but it had to start somewhere, right? I realize this was quite a long-winded post, and I'm not sure if you are even going to bother reading it. I also realize that you probably could care less about bending the rules for me because, like I said before, I understand why you have the rules to begin with, and also because I'm sure you just think that I am some random girl on the internet defending her friend and his website. Haha, but I've never been one to not voice my opinion, so you got it whether you care to read it or not. Once again, thanks for taking the time to at least read my response, and also thank you for the countless amount of term papers this website has helped me with. -Jess.

<li>Thank you for that. You are on the way to understanding our purpose here. It isn't to write an article about every web site in existence. Projects such as <a href="http://www.wikidweb.com./" class="external text" title="http://www.wikidweb.com./" rel="nofollow">Wikidweb</a> have that goal. Our goal is to write an encyclopaedia, that readers can trust because they can independently verify everything in it should they choose to, that does not contain original research (i.e. completely idiosyncratic viewpoints or new ideas, syntheses, and analyses that haven't been through a process of publication, fact checking, and peer review outside of Wikipedia), and that espouses no point of view in any debates. Our inclusion criteria such as <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> exist, in large part, so that Wikipedia remains an encyclopaedia and doesn't turn into a World Wide Web directory. This is why arguments such as "Web site X has an article. We should, too!" will always fail. We also don't include and exclude subjects based upon their personal importance to individual Wikipedia editors. If we used subjective criteria like that, Wikipedia would be a complete mess. We don't include or exclude web sites from having articles based upon thier credibility (although we most definitely <i>do</i> exclude external links to web sites based upon their credibility, see <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>). We include or exclude web sites according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The way to argue that a subject should have an encyclopaedia article is to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> showing that it has been the subject of serious, independent, fact-checked, and peer-reviewed discussion outside of Wikipedia.
<p>Remember when writing your term papers that it is poor work to cite an encyclopaedia. An encyclopaedia is merely a tool that condenses and summarizes the knowledge, and shows readers where the <i>actual</i> reading material is. If there is no actual reading material about a web site, then there shouldn't be an encyclopaedia article on it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:01, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A fancruftish list and an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a>.

Are we going to do this for every single website in cyberspace? Wikipedia may not be paper, but we should take care to keep the signal-to-noise ratio somewhere beyond microscopic. What's next? List of common slang terms among sophomores at Peoira Southern H.S.? I can't see why anyone would want this article. If they wanted to know more about Uncyclopedia, they'd visit the website.

While we do cover those once they become established, a use of the word in a hyperbolic context to describe Iran doesn't qualify as an encyclopedic topic. This certainly shouldn't be in the main politics side bar if it <i>is</i> covered. Jondeere 07:55, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page was created with the sole attempt to try to attack Japan by comparing it unfavourably to Germany's post war attitude. Although it has been later changed, the article remains highly POV with no hope of later improvement. This is because it compares only Germany and Japan. It would be like creating an article comparing US and Swedish foreign policy. You could try to make it neutral, but because the choices were originally made to look the US look bad, the US will always be portrayed especially unfairly.</p>
<p>If the article had a general scope to look at how the Axis powers reacted to the war, or all the major powers on both sides, maybe it could work. But I don't think such an arbitrary comparison should be allowed to stay on wikipedia. No one is willing to put the effort in to change the slant, only minor edits. So hope of change would be vain. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 11:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Moving it wouldn't be sufficient, because the entire slant of it is to compare Germany and Japan. Although some parts could be used, it would need to be completely re-written from scratch. And no one is going to do that - they won't even try to improve the current format. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 13:00, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Okay, I realise the article has huge <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> problems, but they're not irredeemable. Which means this isn't an article for deletion, really, but an article for improvement. Unfortunately there's no WP:AfI. Hmmm.... <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:09, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the article were deleted, but the content saved/archived somewhere, it would actually provide motivation to write a better, more balanced article about all the Axis powers. Or indeed one about all the WWII powers - I think the latter would be better. Keeping it as it is with the tags won't make anyone sort it out. Sometimes you have to force people to do what is necessary.
<p>And if no one actually does write another article, it will show that they were never going to improve the current one, nor that it actually matters to them. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 13:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Why would that make a difference? The article has been tagged for ages. Besides if I move it, someone will just revert it.

<li>Well, roughly speaking "Needs improvement" is not really accepted as a criterion for deletion, unless "but can't be improved" follows. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:32, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I already pointed out, the entire premise of the article is POV and thus against wikipedia policy. Why not have an article comparing George Bush to Ghandi? Or the US' consumption of oil to Sri Lanka's? If those articles were created, they'd be deleted very fast, even if valid points were made. So why should this one get special treatment? If someone said, "well the points are valid and it could be expanded" that would not cut any ice. The call to expand/improve the article has been made many times. It has been ignored at every turn.</li>
<li>If someone wants to start a new article, they can go right ahead. But this will never be improved. It is completely POV and designed to attack Japan's "failure" to account for its past actions. Thus it should be deleted. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 13:42, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Both of those analogies fail because you're trying to relate unconnected things, rather than related things - see, for example <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_and_American_politics_compared_32b9.html" title="Canadian and American politics compared">Canadian and American politics compared</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_and_American_health_care_systems_compared_eb0c.html" title="Canadian and American health care systems compared">Canadian and American health care systems compared</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_and_American_economies_compared_e255.html" title="Canadian and American economies compared">Canadian and American economies compared</a>, or generally <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7EComparisons_a516.html" title="Category:Comparisons">Category:Comparisons</a> for some examples. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:51, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The comparisons you mention are not like the one we're talking about here. They're on domestic issues which are fairly uncontroversial. Certainly looking at the start pages, there was no malice intended when they were created. I know the comparisons I made were arbitrary, but I'm having difficulty in finding an unacceptable comparison where you can understand how it's unfair. I don't know, what about comparing Catholicism to Buddhism in terms of sexual child abuse claims? They're both global religions, so why not make a comparison? If you can't see what I'm getting at, I'm not sure what to say. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Firstly (and mostly as an aside) I'll say: <i>If you think comparing the Canadian and American Health Care systems is fairly uncontraversial, then you have been toking too much, and passing too little</i>. But while your point is okay, there is a very strong grounds for a comparison in the germany/japan response to World War II dealies - specifically, that they're allies in WWII (and really, the only important ones), and we're comparing their actions during a time in which they (marginally in practice, but very much in theory) acted together. An article like Comparison of Canadian Internment and American Internment of Japanese during WWII would be pretty reasonable, I think - if the Buddhists and Cathlics teamed up to molest children, then such a comparison might be appropriate. I'm not sure exactly how to explain it, but there needs to be a "connectedness" for comparisons, not just a "relatedness" <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that the US-Canada comparisons are more fair, because there are good and bad things to say about both sides. HOWEVER, if someone picked an area where Canada or the US appeared completely and utterly disgraceful compared to the other, and it was virtually impossible to argue against it because people had got it into their heads that was the case, would that be fair? No, it wouldn't. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:25, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see no reason to believe its unfair based on the <i>outcome</i> of the comparison. If the comparison is appropriate, then it'll be appropriate whether the two parties come out looking equivilent or one comes up roses and one comes up pig shit, it doesn't matter. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:35, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Eh? With that logic, you're saying it's ok to use wikipedia to attack things/people if they're hidden in a comparison. That's ridiculous! <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, that's not true at all, and it really applies apart from comparisons. Our article on <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Douglas_1bb5.html" title="Tommy Douglas">Tommy Douglas</a> is far more flattering than our article on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pol_Pot_2322.html" title="Pol Pot">Pol Pot</a>, but this isn't a problem. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Pol Pot was an individual, so that isn't relevant. His page also discusses his entire life. This is a comparison between entire nations on a <b>specific issue</b>. Now you're making improper comparisons. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:44, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was responding to your very specific point that because an article makes one person/group look bad and another look good, it's untenable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:46, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>You did not respond properly then. Those two people are not compared. I am talking about where someone makes an article to compare things purely to attack one party. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>You said <i>if someone picked an area where Canada or the US appeared completely and utterly disgraceful compared to the other, and it was virtually impossible to argue against it because people had got it into their heads that was the case, would that be fair?

<li>The article is too biased in its remit. The comparison was crafted to purely attack Japan by making an unfavourable comparison with Germany. It is not possible to make the article NPOV, because it focuses on this specific comparison which is automatically squeued against Japan. Also the points are mostly discussed elsewhere already - there is no need to repeat what has already been said. No one knows how to actually address and improve this article because however they do it, the squeued nature of it keeps making it NPOV. So it has to be deleted, with the content merged/moved elsewhere if necessary. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 16:07, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is hard to see exactly what this article provides that separate articles could not, and the numerous controversies relating to Japan's attitude to the atrocities it has committed are already discussed to death in dozens of other POV-magnet, revert-war-ridden articles. There's no need to waste time cleaning this up when doing so would merely be duplicating effort that is already going on elsewhere. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:13, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I have already merged the part on Germany. Assuming that the content on Japan is already present in the Japanese war crimes page, or any extra content is merged, what happens then?

<li><b>Delete</b> I could vote for merge, but this article is best deleted. Evidence gather is interesting but it really (now) reads like a social article.

</ul>

<dd>To that, it also follows along the line of <b>original paper</b>. Wikipedia as an encycolpedia should chronical what we see as conclusions reported, not what "we" think. In that, the article quotes <b>NO sources</b> that outline or discuss the theme directly. Hence, delete.

<li><b>Delete</b> No need to have an independent article for comparison. It suffices to write on the two issues on the articles of Japanese history and German history respectively. Comparison with Germany may be mentioned on Japan's WW2 article as it's a common criticism of post-war Japan, but presenting it as if it's a legitimate and objective topic is not npov since the way it presents the issues itself is highly politicized. --<a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaintjust_103b.html" title="User:Saintjust">Saintjust</a> 08:05, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete/Merge</b> per Endroit. World War II and postwar crimes and responses and Category:World War II and postwar crimes which also include the Allies, such as US, UK, China, Dutch, France, and especially USSR in addition to the Axes will be a nice summarization, and comparison within the context is pretty fine but picking up just two countries out of them from a view point that the Allies always have the justice is enough POV. --Jjok 14:05, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The only link between German and Japanese war crimes is that they happened to take place at roughly the same time. Japan and Germany did not fight side-by-side; the war crimes took place completely independently of each other, in different parts of the world, against different victims, while other countries were also committing war crimes (Soviets?) Furthermore, the type of crimes committed is completely different. So a comparison is as relevant as comparing Russia in Chechnya to Israel in Gaza today. Also, counting Japan's crimes against Korea under "WWII War Crimes" is simply incorrect as A) Japan and Korea were not at war, it was colonial rule, which B) started in 1910, long before WWII. Responses of Japan to colonial rule and war crimes is a notable topic worthy of an article but is lost here in an attempt at meaningless comparison. <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhonemonkey_dc65.html" title="User:Phonemonkey">Phonemonkey</a> 14:11, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Those are both fairly notable happenings. However, if those are the only things that those scav hunts are notable for, maybe they should just be included in articles about Canberra &amp; Monash Unis.

<dd>I don't think there should be articles about Uni of Canberra or Monash uni scavenger hunts, I don't think it is notable to even be mentioned in the articles on those universities. Similarly I don't think there should be an article on the Melbourne uni scavenger hunt as per above. All equally unnotable and boring. Anyone who thinks these are notable happenings leads a sheltered life. There are many things that newspapers mention that do not get wikipedia articles. <i>The Age</i> reference does not make the scavenger hunt notable.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">Arktos</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 02:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'd like to work with you on thiis. To me, this article is completely fact based. Are you able to point to anything which is not? Currently, the only sources of ramp metering information are from parties with a vested interest in saying they work. There is a need for an independent source. I don't believe the article contains conclusion(s), only facts. Where do you see a conclusion? Please help me to construct a correct article rather than punitively depriving people the opportunity to see a valid presentation of facts. Or maybe as you suggest it could all be presented under ramp meters. I would appreciate any guidance you could give. Thank you.--Ristrockett 17:43, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I'm going to put in <b>delete</b>, but I'd like to comment on the above. I highly doubt the league itself is notable as far as Wikipedia is concerned; the 40 total (and 20 unique) Google hits do not confirm much significance. With that said, the league's web page is well done, the league looks like a lot of fun, McCarren Park is a beautiful place (I saw <a href="../../../y/e/a/Yeah_Yeah_Yeahs_fb4c.html" title="Yeah Yeah Yeahs">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Youth_0a85.html" title="Sonic Youth">Sonic Youth</a> at the pool there last week), and one of the teams is named KYBSY, which I can only assume stands for <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clap_Your_Hands_Say_Yeah_5e36.html" title="Clap Your Hands Say Yeah">Kick Your Balls Say Yeah</a>. So, while the article on this team (and any subsequent league-related articles) will almost certainly be deleted, I wish the best to the league and its players. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 13:58, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The non-notability of "Brooklyn Kickball League" is <b>not sufficient enough reason</b> to propose deletion as laid out in point #1 under Articles on the <font color="hotpink"><b>Criteria for Speedy Deletion</b></font> page. Though the entry for "Killa Killa" may be "limited in content" its position within the "Brooklyn Kickball League" should provide it with the necessary context to "allow expansion." The Brooklyn Kickball League, therefore, could very well be notable and users should be allowed to demonstrate its notability with the ability to expand Killa Killa's heretofore prescribed definition.

<li>That's criteria for speedy deletion, which we can all agree are inappropriate here.

Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. Because the three policies are complementary, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. <b>These three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus</b></i> So if you believe it should be kept, please provide a reason that these pillars of the wiki community should be put asside for this one article. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 18:03, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> I generally <i>despise</i> lists like this, but I feel that this one could, theoretically, be a good article. For such a well-known and controversial figure, the "Hess in pop culture" section in his article is somewhat slim. This list could perhaps be made more encyclopedic if it was split into sections, such as "songs that support Hess" and "songs that object to Hess's practices". It's also interesting to note how many significant bands have referenced Hess. I can't, in good conscience, vote keep, as the article <i>is</i> in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. However, I think there's enough potential in the article to try to expand and improve upon it. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 15:18, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not the place for indiscriminate collections of information</a>, however prepossessing they may be. Another concern is vagueness. What passes as a reference, here? One item on the list, <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joy_Division_0c14.html" title="Joy Division">Joy Division</a>'s "Warsaw", doesn't actually mention Hess by name, but only his prison identification number. Where do we draw the line? Maybe a handful of the most "notable" references to Hess could go in the pop culture section of his article. (And I see the Joy Division song is already in there.) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font></a><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStarryEyes_a831.html" title="User talk:StarryEyes"><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 22:00, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. What useful purpose is served by deleting this article? Its a tad eccentric, but its likely to appeal to many who would otherwise access a Rudholf Hess entry in the first place; merge it with the main Hess article. Compare the numer of songs which reference Hess to other prominent German Nazis, such as Joseph Goebbels, Martin Boorman, Adolf Eichmann, or Albert Speer, and its clear that Hess generates an interest within pop culture far in excess of other leading NSDAP figures, thus justifying the continued existence of this list (albeit ideally within the context of being merged back into the main Hess article).

<li><b>Comment</b> The first criterion you present is not a criterion for deletion. The second one isn't true (as it's presented, it's <i>fringe</i> or <i>post-fringe</i>, but the article isn't pseudoscientific. The third one is surprisingly hard to work on - I poked around ADS and couldn't find anything. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>a::Perhaps valid counterpoints, WilyD - but in deference to the plethora of delete-votes below, allow me to respond. The new votes seem to articulate my original line of thinking, in accordance with Wikipedia AfD style. But, here's my own counter-counterpoints: 1) Myself and other editors have worked on rewriting to make it less poorly-written, but it's not made significant progress. 2) The term "fringe theory" may be better said as "not a theory, just a random rumination by a scientist that was later misinterpreted by someone as science." There is no formality in the theory, and thus no way to formalize the article. 3) Citations are hard to find because of point 2.

<p>Basically, this appears to be yet another rechargeable battery type.

<li><b>Keep</b>, despite her well publicized recent implosion at the primary debate with John Spencer, she still has a reasonable chace of winning the New York primary.

<li><b>Comment</b> The code lists are copyrighted, and the contents of those lists are made <i>freely available</i> from an authoritative source. Putting copies of these lists on the Wikipedia is a Bad Idea. The list here is already out of date, as I pointed out. The ISO 15924 Registration Authority does not need a Wikipedia list to compete with it. That is why we make the authoritative lists freely available. Of course you may <i>use</i> the script codes in articles about scripts. Just don't try to duplicate the offiical list, since any list here could be vandalized (for instance) or contain other error or simply be out of date. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a> 17:57, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Everything can be vandalized. Every list can be vandalized. That the RA does not need a Wikipedia list to compete with is questionable. It depends what the RA wants. Anyway, it's not the point what RA wants but what wiki-readers would like and what is allowed and what not. <b>Can WP generate a list of wikipedia script articles by ISO 15924 codes?</b> The official list does not have the feature of being available in WP with all the advantages that come with this - you can download WP and read it offline, you can click on a script name to learn more. That way I found <a href="../../../d/e/s/Deseret.html" title="Deseret">Deseret</a>. Everyone who needs the stuff in business will for security allways have to look up the stuff in the official list. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 20:12, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If WP uses the codes for <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_Writing_systems_16d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes/Writing systems">Wikipedia:Userboxes/Writing systems</a> as you supported at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category_talk%7EUser_cyr_c4b6.html" title="Category talk:User cyr">Category_talk:User cyr</a>, could WP then generate a list of Boxnames with script name written out in full? If not, WP should probably not use the codes. Maybe nobody should use them if he wants to give overviews of own content sorted by script. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 20:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>It is the opinion of the ISO 15924 Registration Authority that a Wikipedia article on ISO 15924 should <i>not</i> contain a list of the codes, because it will be always out of date. The article should point to the authoritative source, the registrar.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am the one who added the list to Wikipedia, although to <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_15924_c686.html" title="ISO 15924">ISO 15924</a>, not a separate article. I did so, because I expected to see it there, when I first read that article. I thought about the copyright issue for a moment before doing this. (Personally I think fixed-length abbreviations are hardly copyright-worthy, although logical numerical keys and the particular layout might, but let my layman point of view aside.) Finally I decided the links to the articles on the scripts that I added (and three trimmed columns) made it something different than a mere copy. The list on Wikipedia can of course never be more than informative, everyone’s expected to know that. I too wonder, however, whether the RA would still consider Tobias’ scenario a copyright infringement, although that would require some work first, because, for instance, some included scripts are still not or only described on corresponding language articles. PS: What part exactly is out of date? And who thought “Kana” meaning <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">Katakana</a> instead of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kana.html" title="Kana">Kana</a> was a good idea? <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrissov_713f.html" title="User:Crissov">Christoph Päper</a> 21:31, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is <i>not</i> the job of the RA to track an unofficial list to make sure that it is accurate. This page is out of date. Don't know why? Check the real list. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a> 08:12, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> for now. Let a lawyer review all ISO/IATA/ICAO related lists that we have in WP. Wikipedia is not there alone to please any RA or company. Of course WP has to fully respect copyright. Nevertheless User:Evertype (who is the RA) still did not answer some related questions. Is WP allowed to create a list of articles sorted by 15924 codes? Is WP allowed to create a list of userboxes sorted by 15924? Evertype supported the use of ISO 15924 codes for userboxes and now argues that WP should not publish a related list. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 15:34, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's not non-neutral. It ascribes the opinion to the people who espouse it, rather than presenting it as Wikipedia's own. Neutrality is about not having Wikipedia adopt a side as its own in any given discussion.

<p>Appears to be vanity/neologism; may also fail <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. To be specific:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vanity: the author and main contributor to this page is User:Ken.thompson. The inventor and primary expositor of the theory described in the article, and the maintainer of the <a href="http://www.bioteams.com" class="external text" title="http://www.bioteams.com" rel="nofollow">Bioteams blog</a>, is called Ken Thompson.</li>
<li>Neologism: searching for people <i>other</i> than Ken Thompson who use this term yields remarkably few results. While there are about 15,000 Google hits for the word "Bioteams", my brief sampling of these suggests that most of them are related to an apparently unrelated German company of the same name (<a href="http://www.bioteams.de" class="external text" title="http://www.bioteams.de" rel="nofollow">website</a>), while the rest fall into two broad categories: articles by Ken Thompson, and references to the Ken Thompson's blog (often in the context of people observing that they've never heard of "bioteams" before). Indeed, the article itself describes this as "a new area of research".</li>
</ol>
<p>For these reasons, I am inclined to the view that this article should be deleted.</p>
<p>If the consensus ends up being that this should be kept, note that it is in <i>serious</i> need of cleanup; particular problems are the unencyclopedic writing style, the poor wikification, and the long, rambling "bibliography" section which contains texts that are mostly only tenuously connected to the claims of the article, and certainly do not appear to be about "bioteams" as such. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 16:44, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The page does read like blog-promotion. But the fact that major old-media outlets (NYT etc) turned to a personal blog as a source in a time of major national crisis is kind of significant to the history of media -- just because it was probably one of the first times that had happened. However, merging the info into a section on "Media coverage" (which I'm surprised to see doesn't exist yet) on the <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> page would be fine--or maybe put it in the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a> article. Minus the puff-quotes of course. <a href="../../../d/y/b/User%7EDybryd_6f7d.html" title="User:Dybryd">Dybryd</a> 20:14, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It seems Mr. Loy is also featured in Spike Lee's new movie about Hurricane Katrina.<a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2006/08/im-a-movie-star.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brendanloy.com/2006/08/im-a-movie-star.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> -- 137.53.94.17 00:34, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No opinion</b> As the subject of the article, I'm not qualified to express an opinion on whether it should be deleted or not. However, I just want to say that it is NOT a "vanity page," if I understand the definition of that term correctly. I did not create the article, and I have no idea who did. Nor have I participated in the revert wars that have happened in recent months; I've watched them with some amusement, but have remained on the sidelines. Anyway, if the Wikipedia community thinks it's not sufficiently notable to be included, that's fine, but I would appreciate it if people wouldn't imply that I created an article about myself when in fact I did nothing of the sort. -- Brendan Loy, Aug. 18, 2006, 11:14 PM EDT</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems from the coverage that this blog was never used as a source for any news; just in the scores of articles about Katrina a couple noted his coverage of it. And nothing of any note has happened since then, nor does his blog have enough readers to meet the standards of notability. Not to mention that he has now made an entry on his blog about how his entry is up for deletion--insisting that it is not "meatpuppetry," naturally, but simply informing his readers (who are, as far as I can tell, his parents and a few college friends) of the "interesting" fact that it's up for a vote.

<li>This would be the most I would agree with. The only arguable notability of the blog was a few puff pieces related to Katrina a year ago. The only attention this blog seems to have ever gotten is directly related to the Katrina coverage, and it was not enough attention that an account of Katrina would mention Brendan Loy other than perhaps as a minor footnote. Wikipedia should reflect that. I still think he's not worth a mention at all, but if he merits any Wikipedia mention it should be as a minor footnote to Hurricane Katrina, not an entry of his own.

<ul>
<li><small>Okay, look. I again reiterate that I am expressing <b>no opinion</b> about whether the article is notable. That's a decision for y'all, not me, to make. But I'm not going to let blatant untruths and character assassination go unchallenged. First of all, the implication that I'm engaging in meatpuppetry, despite my <a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2006/08/wiki-wars.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brendanloy.com/2006/08/wiki-wars.html" rel="nofollow">repeated, straightforward, honest statements to the contrary</a>, is a flagrant violation of "assume good faith." Secondly, the assertion that my readers are my "parents and a few college friends" is laughably false. Really, I'm flattered by the assertion that I have thousands of "college friends," but it's just not true; I wasn't <i>that</i> popular in college!&#160;:) Before Katrina, my blog averaged around 1,250 unique hits per day; during and in the immedate aftermath of Katrina, that shot up to 7,500+ per day, and as many as 20,000-33,000 on some days; and since November of last year, after Katrina, it's hovered around 2,000 per day (see for yourself <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&amp;s=sm9brendanloy&amp;r=36" class="external text" title="http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&amp;s=sm9brendanloy&amp;r=36" rel="nofollow">here</a>), with occasional higher bursts (last week, for example, I received a <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&amp;s=sm9brendanloy&amp;r=35" class="external text" title="http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&amp;s=sm9brendanloy&amp;r=35" rel="nofollow">ton of traffic</a> because of widespread blogospheric discusison of my commentary on the Lieberman-Lamont election (and, to a lesser extent, the London terror plot). That leads to my final point: "the only attention this blog seems to have ever gotten is directly related to the Katrina coverage" is simply, flatly, verifiably untrue. See, for example, <a href="http://instapundit.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&amp;search=brendanloy.com+OR+66.237.232.84&amp;ResultDisplay=ascend" class="external text" title="http://instapundit.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&amp;search=brendanloy.com+OR+66.237.232.84&amp;ResultDisplay=ascend" rel="nofollow">this list of 69 links from InstaPundit</a> since February 2003 -- only about 20 of them related to Katrina. Other topics covered on my blog that have received significant attention from multiple prominent bloggers: my coverage of the Bush-Lieberman "kiss" (try googling "bush lieberman kiss," without quotes, and see what comes up); my commentary on John Kerry's deficiencies during the 2004 election; my coverage of the <i>South Park</i> controversy back in March (check the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon_Wars_Part_II_7677.html" title="Cartoon Wars Part II">Wikipedia entry</a> and the link to "Internet clip" in paragraph 4 of "Real-life censorship controversy"); the Lieberman-Lamont election and the London plot, as I mentioned (see for example <a href="http://technorati.com/search/www.brendanloy.com" class="external text" title="http://technorati.com/search/www.brendanloy.com" rel="nofollow">Technorati</a>); and there's plenty more. Technorati notes I have recevied 737 links from 310 blogs, by the way. Also getting plenty of attention: my coverage of USC and Notre Dame football generally, and specifically my videos of the USC-Notre Dame game last fall, taken from the ND student section, which have gotten repeatedly linked by fan sites for both teams. Oh, and if you want non-blogospheric sources of "attention" ... I was on the <a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2003/10/008818.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brendanloy.com/2003/10/008818.html" rel="nofollow">front page of the <i>Albuquerque Journal</i></a> and <a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2003/10/008821.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brendanloy.com/2003/10/008821.html" rel="nofollow">mentioned on Fox News</a> nearly two years before Katrina because of a <i>Lord of the Rings</i>-related story. And, two months before Katrina, I was in the <a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2005/07/018363.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brendanloy.com/2005/07/018363.html" rel="nofollow"><i>South Bend Tribune</i></a> just for my blog generally, not for any specific topic. Now, AGAIN: I am <b>not</b> asserting that this level of "attention" makes me "notable" -- that's for you all to decide, not me. I'm simply refuting the false statement that "the only attention this blog seems to have ever gotten is directly related to the Katrina coverage." My intention here is to correct the factual record, and nothing more. Whatever you decide, I simply hope you'll base your decision on verifiable facts, not unverified and untrue assertions. I also hope you'll assume good faith and not attack me for leaving this comment here. The mere fact that I don't appreciate being the subject of factual untruths and character assassination doesn't make the article a "vanity entry." (And, if I were into sockpuppetry, wouldn't I leave this comment under someone else's name?) -- Brendan Loy, Aug. 19, 2006, 3:48 PM EDT</small>

<li>Ok, wow. Please make sure you understand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_assassination" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_assassination" rel="nofollow">the terms you are using</a> before reacting so vehemently to a discussion. I reiterate that I just don't think this person or blog meets any of the guidelines of notability, either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" rel="nofollow">people</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28web%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28web%29" rel="nofollow">websites</a>. Instapundit is a good comparison: that's a website that has attained enough of a readership and notoriety on its own to merit an entry. Having been linked from it does not make a blog of the same stature. Nautikale 20:52, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My "character assassination" reference was to your unsupported, false, assuming-bad-faith allegation (at 05:17 today) that I was engaging in meatpuppetry. If you'll withdraw the allegation, I'll withdraw my use of the term "character assassination." As for your reiterating that you "just don't think" the subject of the article is notable, that's fine, and for the umpteenth time I am <i>not expressing an opinion</i> about that conclusion -- I'm just saying that you need to stick to <b>facts</b> and not state things which are <b>blatantly and demonstrably false</b>, like that my blog's readership is limited to friends and family, or that "the only attention this blog seems to have ever gotten is directly related to the Katrina coverage." Those are both <b>factually incorrect assertions</b>, as I've demonstrated above, and if you're not going to either acknowledge their falsity and retract them, or else attempt to refute or somehow explain away the factual citations above which discredit your unsupported statements to the contrary, I don't see why anyone should take your contribution to this discussion seriously. My response is "vehement" only because you are assuming bad faith and making false assertions of fact about me, neither of which have any place in Wikipedia. --Brendan Loy, Aug. 19, 2006, 6:00 PM EDT</li>

<li>My presence in this discussion is indicative of no such thing, as I've repeatedly made explicitly clear. My only "investment" is in correcting the factual record and preventing untruths from being passed off as truths. Do what you want with the damn article, but if you say things that are demonstrably false, I am going to correct them. If that's wrong, then I don't want to be right. Your assumption of bad faith on my part is indicative that you don't seem to have any respect for Wikipedia's most basic principles. The same goes for everyone who insists on ignoring the verifiable facts I've presented and focusing only on the ulterior motives that you ascribe to me, notwithstanding that my actions are perfectly reasonable and justifiable without any ulterior motive (and thus assuming good faith is dictated).

<li><b>Merge</b> While Loy may deny his personal investment in keeping this page up through words, his incessant replies to almost every entry seem to indicate otherwise. His rebuttal to "blatant untruths and character assassination" reads as a veiled attempt at advertising and making the case to keep. This page has been nothing but a pissing match between Loy's supporters and his detractors. To merge as part of a wider look at blogs or Hurricane Katrina would be acceptable. It is not worthy on its own.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.224.65.55 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.224.65.55_7a45.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.224.65.55">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Delete:</b> A review of the subject page, coupled with comments by both Loy and his college friends ( I believe user Scientizzle is a close personal friend) reveals that the blog is, in fact not designed to inform per Wikipedia's standards, and, in fact, is being used by Loy and his friends to publicize his blog. In addition, it is worth noting that the entry has been subject to frequent edit wars, which indicate that it is being used as a forum for his friends and detractors to air personal grievances.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am friends with Brendan. That does not change the fact that almost none of the anonymous IPs (and new accounts) that have commented here have presented a valid, detailed argument against keeping (by addressing the relevant policies and guidelines). <i>You</i> may not think the subject is notable, but Wikipedia has two established notability guidelines (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> &amp; <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>); I have detailed above 4 criteria from these two guidelines that the article appears to meet. I believe I've objectively come to my "keep" vote and properly supported my conclusion. Additionally, while Brendan Loy has been (in my opinion) overly zealous in defending his honor here, there have been several specious and demonstrably false claims made in support of deletion. I honestly wonder where all these anon IPs and new accounts with no Wikipedia edit history are coming from. Please stick to the facts, make sounds arguments, and avoid <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 18:56, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I appreciate your contributions to the discussion and your evident hard work on the entry, although I still disagree with your conclusions. But I disagree with any characterization of the previous discussions, including my own, as "demonstrably false claims" or personal attacks. You will notice that I qualified the statements I made with things like "as far as I can tell" and "seems like." This is because I am not friends with Brendan Loy and know only what I read online. For example, I said it seems like the only attention his blog got from outside sources was connected to Katrina--and I stand by that, qualified by the "seems." It's great that Mr. Loy can give an exhaustive account of every time his blog has been linked by another blog, and I wish him the best in expanding his readership, but the average user on Wikipedia who does not read his blog regularly would not know or care about a two-day spike in traffic to his website last month. Nor would they particularly care that a fake South Park video clip linked to by another Wikipedia entry happens to be hosted on his blog in one of the two places it is linked to on the page. The only larger significance that the blog seems to have achieved was in relation to Katrina. This is not a claim that nobody has ever linked to the blog in relation to another topic, or that I'm committing character assassination on Mr. Loy by failing to recognize his achievements in other areas. I just don't think, as a casual reader and relatively new acquaintance of the blog, that it has significance of the type generally required by Wikipedia. I have referred to Wikipedia's guidelines previously, but to repeat: Brendan Loy does not meet the guidelines of Notability (people)(<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>). He has not made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his field. He is not a published author with multiple independent reviews of or awards for his work. He has not achieved renown or notoriety for his involvement in in newsworthy events. At best, he has achieved minor note for assembling information on Hurricane Katrina, so at most I think it it would be accurate, if generous, to mention his blog as related to media coverage of the hurricane. He has not been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. Brendan Loy does not meet the guidelines of Notability (web)(<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). I do not consider the handful of what I would call puff pieces on Brendan Loy multiple non-trivial published works. No disrespect meant, but I do not believe articles headlined "Weather nerd" are non-trivial pieces. His website has not won a well-known and independent award, nor is it published by any site independent of Mr. Loy himself. Nautikale 20:53, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As someone completely unfamiliar with the genre, after reading the (revised) article I still have no idea what the mothership is supposed to be. Is it just a stage prop?

<li><b>Reply</b> Hey, I've changed it a bit more. I thought it would need a rewrite from a blank slate too, but I think what is there can be worked into something good.

<p>Not notable wiki engine. The Google search for PerspectiveWiki (one word) turns up 5 unique hits. "Perspective wiki" does a bit better: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Perspective+Wiki%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=230&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Perspective+Wiki%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=230&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">645 ghits with 196 unique</a>. That still isn't much as most top pages are listings of wiki engines. Only mention I could find is a year old mention in an article of InternetWeek and refining the search by adding "engine" cuts it down to 65 unique hits, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Perspective+Wiki%22+engine&amp;hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Perspective+Wiki%22+engine&amp;hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> none of which qualify as solid third-party coverage.

<li><b>Comment</b> - this was incorrectly closed by a non-admin. It should have been deleted first and the non-admin didn't have that power.

<ul>
<li>Yep - I closed this discussion as a non-admin because it is an incomplete merge. When you merge two articles, like you've done here, BlueValour, the page you've merged from should be made into a redirect, because people will still be looking for the page at its old name. A redirect doesn't require a delete or admin powers, so I carried it out, as authorised in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html#Non-administrators_closing_discussions" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion_process#Non-administrators_closing_discussions</a>. So its best to just do a speedy redirect, where no admin is needed.

<li>I merged the content /not/ the article. Please don't give lectures when you do not follow the guidelines yourself. It was /not/ an unambiguous Keep. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 00:10, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You merged the complete content of the article, which amounts to the article as a whole. It's normal procedure to make a redirect, as suggested here, to the new page from the old - not delete it. If the page is deleted, the problem is that the contributors' details are lost, which conflicts with the GFDL, which wikipedia tries to follow at all times. When an admin does come along, he/she will close this discussion exactly as I have - the difference being that admins don't have much time and I have more, so I may as well carry out what I can in terms of closing AfD's <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23"><font color="blue">rtinp23</font></a></strong> 00:17, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wrong. A merge/redirect is an editorial decision that the creator can reverse. A delete/redirect he cannot. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 00:23, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The creator could reverse a delete/redirect by just copy=pasting the inforamtion as held elsewhere into the article. If the creator were to revert a merge/redirect, he could just be put right and pointed to the appropriate AfD. It looks like I'm not going to be able to bring you round to my reasoning, so I'll ask the closing admin to decide on what the proper course of action was (should I have closed when I tried to?) (I'm going to sleep sonn - so may not reply for a while) thanks <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23"><font color="blue">rtinp23</font></a></strong> 00:26, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If a delete/redirect is bypassed then the Speedy delete procedure comes into play and, if need be, the namespace can be protected. A merge/redirect is simply an editorial move with no binding effect - a merge/redirect is a variation on a Keep. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 00:47, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Here's the bio of the CEO of the above-mentioned company. Has about 1,000 Google hits. The article appears to be factual, even the bits about dating Hollywood actresses, but the article boasts no sources, original research, a lack of notability, and possibly vanity.

<li><b><s>Week</s> Keep</b> (full disclosure - Kate Bush would join Glenn Gould in having a couple of entries on my desert island discs). I haven't looked closely at various songwriter/band articles, but I assume a section within an article of songs covered by others wouldn't be challenged as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, so I'm not sure a fuller list is inherently a problem - certainly requiring sourcing footnotes on each song would seem onerous, and I assume not common practice? If there is a consensus that lists of covered songs in general are unencyclopedic then this one can be tossed, but if the issue is the notability of the songwriter I'd have to demur. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 07:16, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, don't call me junior. Second, sign your replies. Third, This little fan series obviously isn't notable since it can't pass any of the WP:WEB standards since every other internet subject has to pass them to have a page here. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 03:46, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Kid, you're only 19, until you grow up a little, you'll be junior. I choose not to sign my replies, and WP:WEB standards could apply to anything. You could delete half of Wiki with those rules. Until someone gives my SUBSTANTIAL ruling against it. I'm gonna fight to keep it up.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia has standards and guidelines dictating what is eligible for inclusion. Otherwise, it would be a collection of whatever random information anyone wanted to post (i.e., the internet). And while I do disagree with some of the guidelines for inclusion, they are here for a purpose. If you want to change the guidelines, then please, contribute your opinion and back it up with facts and logic. Persuade other editors to support you and hopefully if you do it well, your opinion can become the Wikipedia consensus. If you want to advertise, do it elsewhere. Also, please be respectful of other editors. Thanks. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 04:01, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I take offense to the "notable" comment made by Spyke. So I choose not to be respectful in that regard. Second, this isn't an advertisement. We aren't making money off of this, nor are we attempting to persude others to come visit or read the site.</p>
<p>If "advertisement" is a problem, then you're a hypocrit. Look at half the comic book references placed in here. All comic book related characters owned and operated by another company. Doesn't that constitute advertisement? If you want a wiki that is strictly facts, then enforce the rules 100%, don't pick and choose because "it doesn't suit you".<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.70.html" title="User:64.12.116.70">64.12.116.70</a> (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.12.116.70.html" title="User talk:64.12.116.70">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.12.116.70_0643.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.12.116.70">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Noteable in what way slick? Just because they're making money? Or have been on the news? And who are they noteable to? The fans or those who never pick up a comic book. You're using standards that are way to broad junior.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I respect the work and dedication that Mr.Unsigned Whippersnapper and his associates are doing on this fan site, I think he is putting the cart before the horse in terms of notability. A fansite <i>can be notable</i> but it takes time, effort, and increasing familarity. Now I would agree that the nomination could have had a more civil tone but don't view this AfD as an indictment on the worth of your site. When the fruits of hard work and labor bring you success and notability, the Wikipedia community will welcome an article about your site. However, it is not Wikipedia's place to be an engine towards bringing you that success and notability. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 02:18, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
