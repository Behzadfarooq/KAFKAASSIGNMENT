<li><b>STRONG KEEP.</b> I've reconsidered my position. I've tried to post this several times, but have been unable to do so. (Another instance of a collateral damage block; it happens to me <i>constantly</i>.) [I can edit now. Thanks to <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">User:Guettarda</a> for posting this for me when I could not.] The two subjects are substantially different and both need space to be developed. <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">Cool (aesthetic)</a>, renamed, should continue to deal with the pop culture manifestations of "cool" with a nod to its African/African-American roots. As I mentioned on the talk page of <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29_fabf.html" title="Cool (African philosophy)">Cool (African philosophy)</a>, there are all sorts of possibilities for further development of <s>this</s> that piece -- an examination of the evolution of "cool" and the anti-hero (the "bad nigger," Stagga Lee, Iceberg Slim, Clint Eastwood's nameless drifter, etc.). <b>I suggest it be renamed "Cool (pop culture aesthetic)." I suggest the other article be renamed "Cool (African aesthetic)."</b> <b>In the readings I've done, primarily Thompson and the academicians who quote him refer to it as a "philosophy." All others seem to refer to the same (or very similar)concepts elucidated by Thompson as an "aesthetic," which, frankly, seems more appropriate. (I utilized Thompson's terminology in setting up the "philosophy" article as a means of differentiating it from cool in the pop culture context.) I reiterate that Wikipedia has far too few articles dealing with Africa and African culture. Cool in the African cultural context is sufficiently complex that it merits an article of its own.</b> Google "African cool aesthetic" and see what you come up with. There's ample information on the subject in an African context and in the African diaspora to fill an article without mention of Fonzie and social stratification and many of the, IMO, rather shallow, pop-culture manifestations of the phenomenon. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 21:35, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"'Cool', though an amorphous quality--more mystique than material--is a pervasive element in urban black male culture. As sociologists Richard Majors and Janet Mancini Billson evince in Cool Pose: The Dilemmas of Black Manhood in America (1992), African-American men employ "cool" as "a tool for hammering masculinity out of the bronze of their daily lives" (2). It is a 'strategic style' that 'allows the black male to tip society's imbalanced scales in his favor' (2). Importantly, too, "coolness means poise under pressure and the ability to maintain detachment, even during tense encounters" (2). To further define the indefinable, Majors and Billson produce a pantheon of cool: '<b>Black athletes, with their stylish dunking of the basketball, spontaneous dancing in the end zone, and high-fives handshakes, are cool....</b> (Though X is absent here, Imani Perry believes that his style suited 'the <b>cool aesthetic in [African-American] folklore [which] respects composure and asserts the importance of personal control over a situation</b> [179].) Crucially, in Majors and Billson, coolness involves a willingness to engage in violence (33), to risk death (34), to suppress emotion (in interactions with friends, family members, lovers, spouses, and children), to value spontaneity, expressiveness, and stylishness (71), and to prize verbal dexterity (99). These qualities of cool render it an essential survival mechanism in a society in which 'except for people over age eighty-five, black males are dying at a higher rate than any other group at any age' (19). Given this vicious context, any moral code that signals meaning, community, and purposefulness, that is to say, that combats anomie, is potentially irresistible. Coolness is one such code."<a href="http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/Jouvert/v2i1/Clarke.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/Jouvert/v2i1/Clarke.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>

<li>From "Now This is Cool: Even Westerners can appreciate The African Art Experience.": "This might be news to James Dean and Miles Davis, but the Yoruba people of Nigeria invented cool.

<li>From "Cool Jazz--History of Jazz": "First of all, 'cool' itself is a term with broad aesthetic implications. As a highly performative art that emphasizes spontaneous excitement and a kind of cumulative, trance-like energy, jazz is often characterized as 'hot.' And yet 'coolness' is a quality that scholars such as Robert Farris Thompson have found at the heart of a generalized African aesthetic: behavior characterized by poise, relaxation, and self-possession even in moments of great tension and effort."<a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~skd9r/MUSI212_new/assignments/cool_jazz.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~skd9r/MUSI212_new/assignments/cool_jazz.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>
<li>From "The Death of the Cool" (primarily an interesting examination of cool in the pop culture context, but somewhat useful here): "'Cool' is perhaps the only appellation to survive for as many generations as it has. Fifty-year-olds and five-year-olds seem to have a common understanding of "cool" and that whatever is cool is good.... Cool is that aloof, independent, self-contained, rebellious, strong, proficient, iconoclastic, vanguard attitude that Miles embodied. He was powerful, controlled, self-directed, and incredibly talented. Cool is still generated among the poor. The regions that 'cool-hunters' prowl are the ghettos and inner-city neighborhoods where young people have no stake in the status quo. Cool has re-manifested itself repeatedly and has become in many ways the core cultural expression of America. Cool is our greatest export. It is assiduously sought by marketers and manufacturers. To find it is to connect with the most powerful commercial force on the planet. For whatever is perceived to be cool will sell at premium prices."<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~paulrack/id16.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.earthlink.net/~paulrack/id16.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></li>
<li>From the PBS website "Great Performances: Free To Dance - Behind The Dance - The Revolution Will Be Danced": "As historian Halifu Osumare wrote in the ADF booklet <i>African American Genius in Modern Dance</i>, Fagan's fusion reflected 'a distilling of emotion to its physical, muscular components, rather than the dramatic display of character or the overt display of emotion itself. This abstraction of emotion through the tool of juxtaposition of the cool and the hot is simultaneously an age-old use of an African aesthetic principle, Fagan followed in the footsteps of some of his predecessors, choreographing the Broadway show "The Lion King"; he became the second black choreographer, after George Faison, to win a Tony Award." <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/freetodance/behind/behind_danced_c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/freetodance/behind/behind_danced_c.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></li>

<li>From a book review on soulstepping, the step shows of black "Greeks" -- sorority sisters and frat-bwois at HBCUs: "This is particularly noted during the 1960's and 1970's among sorority women whose counter clock [sic - "counterclockwise"] pattern of stepping is associated with the African dance patterns [preserved through the centuries in African-American religious observance (my note)] of the ring shout and the patting jumba.... In contrast to the aforementioned aesthetic characteristics that are considered 'hot' practices, steppers also demonstrate 'cool' aesthetics in their movements by striving for uniform visibility and clarity in their motions. Invoking the names of the founders and organization's history by the steppers as well as the practice of looking smart [also part of the African cool aesthetic (my note)] by entering and exiting the show properly rounds out the expressions of other 'cool' aesthetics presented by Greek members during step shows."<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3752/is_200409/ai_n9455909#continue" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3752/is_200409/ai_n9455909#continue" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></li>

<p>According to Frank Willet's introduction to African art, tutu, serenity, coolness, or composure is a desirable quality in both art and life: "In sculpture it is shown by the absence of violence in the facial expression or gesture; in the dance by the withdrawn expressionless face of the dancer; the chief should always behave calmly and unemotionally" [213]. Susan Mullin Vogel similarly notes this particular meeting of social, political, and aesthetic values:</p>

<p>I have read other references to African cool in the rest of the African diaspora, as well -- not just in African-American culture. I am virtually certain that if one were to read, say, the accounts of dancer-choreographer Katherine Dunham in her travels (her autobiography <i>African Rhythms</i>, or of Zora Neale Hurston in Haiti (<i>Tell My Horse</i>), one would find similar descriptions of expressions of African cool in spirituality, comportment and movement/dance.

<p>In conducting an online search, I found a telling quote at Global Black News, which I believe speaks directly to the endless campaigning (what is it now -- 3 VfDs/AfDs, 4?) for the obliteration of this piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As mainstream audiences and even the world continues to emulate and participate in the hip-hop environment there are some in the mainstream who are completely drawn to it but who do not identify with or resent the Black/African cultural aesthetic. This resentment or social isolation they feel, but strong attraction, often ends up as attempt to gloss over or ignore the culture in an effort to make it acceptable to themselves and their counterparts. -- from "The Cultural Jacking of Hip-Hop, by Bakari Akil II <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 07:20, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excellent research Deeceevoice. Unfortunately, this doesn't establish anything about it being a philosophy. Personally, I agree with the blockquote at the end very much: there are a lot of MCs out there who are trying to take the blackness out of hip hop-- they imitate all the gestures but their music isn't down to earth and has no soul.</dd>

<dd>I would suggest calling the new page Cool in African cultures, as <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28African_aesthetic%29_f096.html" title="Cool (African aesthetic)">Cool (African aesthetic)</a> would imply the biased view that the opinions of thompson et al are fact, rather than opinion. While many people would agree with these opinions, its irrational to present them as fact, as your suggested title would do.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 11:48, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree. My suggestion for the title is succinct. It speaks directly to Cool as an African aesthetic, the way it is characterized in virtually all sources I've listed (as opposed to Thompson -- and those who quote him -- who <i>does</i>, in fact, call it a "philosophy"). And it definitely and precisely fits within the rubric of an aesthetic: "Aesthetics is also the domain of philosophy that ponders art and such qualities as beauty, sublimity, and even ugliness and dissonance. An aesthetic (also spelled esthetic or æsthetic) is the concept of a particular school of philosophy that appraises art, beauty, and associated concepts by certain standards (e.g. the aesthetic of minimalism)." (from Wikipedia) The article seeks to examine the concept as a <i>primary</i> focus -- not emphasize how the aesthetic manifests itself in various permutations across African cultures, which is what your title would suggest.</p>
<p>Further, what on earth causes you to characterize the findings of art historians, cultural anthropologists, etc., across the spectrum as "biased"? You have absolutely no basis for such a judgment. These are, many of them, respected specialists in their fields who have devoted considerable time and effort -- and in Thompson's case, 40 years or more -- in the pursuit of their various disciplines. Because people may be ignorant of the information they present and, as a result, have made prejudgments regarding it, doesn't give them standing to criticize/denigrate it. Now, <i>that</i> is POV. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 12:57, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thompson and the other sources have indeed spent years researching this. But no amount of years turns expert opinion on a subjective concept into an objective fact. For this reason, it is wrong to take the conclusions of those sources as the fact of the matter.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 15:02, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Excuse me, but their expertion opinion and years of research and familiarity with the subject matter are <i>every reason</i> to accept their findings and conclusions as accurate and valid. Again, Urthogie, social science is what it is. This subject is no different from any other topic dealing with such matters. I'm done discussing this aspect of the piece with you; it goes nowhere. It doesn't matter what those unfamiliar with the subject matter think. It is our responsibility to dispassionately present state-of-the-art, up-to-date scholarship on a subject. Uninformed, often inchoate, opinion or irrational opposition is of no import. In fact, it matters <i>less</i> than little; it's utterly worthless. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 15:58, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Expert research on subjective things doesn't allow for objective truths to come out. However, it does allow for us to say "Expert researcher Mr. Thompson sees cool as..." And no, an encyclopedia isn't meant to display the avante garde, expert research as fact-- its meant to present a)objective truths as fact and b)subjective views as opinion.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 16:43, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Wrong</b>. Encyclopedias contain groundbreaking research all the time. I first read about DNA back in the 1960s, when its double-helix structure first was under serious scientific investigation. Further, Thompson's findings may have been "avant garde" in 1975 when I first read them, but no longer. They continue to stand the test of time. The fact that others may be just discovering the information doesn't make it somehow tentative. Further, the subjective or non-concrete nature of a matter under objective observation and research does not automatically render the results of such study subjective. Your position doesn't hold water. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 07:48, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm confused. The point that Thompson and maybe others are making is that the current concept of "cool" can trace roots back to African culture, right? This doesn't make "African cool" a seperate topic, this means we might want to include some of this in the history of cool. I still see no indication that there should be seperate articles here, since they're not seperate concepts. If the history and origins of "cool" become an overly large part of <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">Cool (aesthetic)</a> I could see breaking them back out in the future, but only for length reasons, not because they are seperate topics.

<dd>That information is actually already included in Cool (aesthetic. But if you follow the links I've provided, you'll see just how involved an article treating African cool potentially could become. I developed separate articles not because I wanted to create a "POV fork," as has been charged, but because the African aesthetic is a complex one that needs space for proper elucidation without the confusion and hostility that clearly have been exhibited by those familiar with the concept of cool in only a pop-culture context. "Cool (pop culture aesthetic)" also could be profitably expanded, if handled properly. It doesn't make sense to merge the two only to separate them out later. It could get messy. IMO, it makes sense to keep "cool" as a traditional, African cultural ethos with spiritual and metaphysical implications separate from its fairly simplistic/shallow pop culture permutations. Again, given the project's general paucity of articles treating Africa and African cultural expression, I think it important that the African article be one that is discrete and contained and comprehensive in its approach to the subject matter. Further, people accessing Wikipedia for information, and many seeking to contribute, likely will be looking for <i>cool</i> in the pop-culture context. They can read what they want and move on -- or delve deeper. The <i>cool</i> article, renamed "cool (pop culture aesthetic)" will continue to contain a reference to the more complex article for those who wish to read more. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 15:51, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That all sounds reasonable, but to me it still looks like undue weight. It's far better to have a "history of cool" article that presents all relevant and credible theories, than to have an "African cool" article that's about the ideas of one particular academic. If I invent a new theory about whether Jesus was real, and write a book about it, I wouldn't get an article on my specific theory (unless it <i>really</i> took off). I <i>might</i> get a mention of my theory in <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a> if I'm considered a reputable source. We don't want to emphasize one particular theory over all the others by having a specific article on it, unless that theory is way more accepted by scholars than the others. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:02, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Read my response again -- along with the lengthy list of sources. There is certainly more than one academic represented there, and certainly more than one academic discipline/fiend of endeavor. Length and managability are not the only considerations. The division is a natural and sensible one. While pop culture cool has African/African American origins, they are separate phenomena entirely -- particularly as pop-culture cool has changed over time and as it has been appropriated/assimilated by other cultures with different sensibilities. Further, Africal cultural cool is not "theory." A people's cultural ethos is subjective by its very nature; is what it is. There <i>is</i> no countervailing interpretation out there. Just as there is no credible, countervailing finding regarding the African/African-American origins of cool in popular culture.<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 16:06, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The division is natural to <i>you</i>, yes. But, your point of view seems pretty easy to read- you sound like you believe that "real" cool is African, and other forms of cool are inferior, shallow bullshit, so of course the division seems natural to you. I don't believe everyone sees it the same way. There are many ideas about the origins of cool. We should not be trying to pick which one is "correct" so we can emphasize it over the others. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:12, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there are "many ideas about the origins of cool," then <i><b>where are they?</b></i> None has been presented outside of the African/African-American one. Further, if there <i>are</i> other notions of the origins of pop-culture cool, then that's all the <i>more</i> reason why the two articles should remain separate. That's <i>precisely my point.</i> The article treating cool squarely and solely in the African/African-American/African diasporic context can be left free to develop outside the constant squabbling and bickering of people who want to assert there are other origins to the pop culture notion (but who so far haven't come up with anything credible to support their complaints). And, no. I don't think pop culture notions of cool are, to use your rather indelicate term, "bullsh*t." But pop culture incarations of traditional cultural concepts are commercialized, packaged, mass-produced manifestations and, by their very nature, shallow in comparison to the original idea. That's the nature of pop culture; it's pretty much kitsch -- a notion embodied/aptly illustrated in the Campbell soup cans of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_b973.html" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> in the 1960s. Is it a valid phenomenon? Of <i>course</i>. But let's not confuse pop culture with something rooted in the objective, historical experience of the people of the originating culture. By its very nature it is something <i>qualitatively</i> different. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 16:34, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think all of this is sidestepping, rather than addressing, the issue of undue weight. I might think that Cool is a Swedish meatball. I might even write a book about it. But we still don't want an article called Cool (Swedish meatball) about this belief. If sources show that the idea of cool as a meatball has widespread currency, that's another story. I think it's far more useful to have an article on cool (or, if needed, the history and origins of cool) that addresses the origins of cool as described by reputable sources. Disputes about the origins of cool should be discussed in the article, and all relevant points of view should be documented. Fragmenting into different articles for the individual beliefs given in different sources is unneccessary and undesirable balkanization. NPOV requires that we don't write different articles on the same topic to express different points of view. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:37, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's perfectly valid to debate the pop-culture origins of cool, treated in an article "Cool (pop culture aesthetic)." It is, however, <i>not</i> valid to debate the origins of cool in an article titled "Cool (African philosophy)," or -- preferred -- "Cool (African aesthetic)." It is clear by the very name of the article that the purpose of the document is to treat "cool" in its African context/meaning/understanding. AGAIN, I purposely fragmented the two articles to avoid the controversy about pop-culture cool and to deal with the African phenomenon as an underlying, complex, cultural and spiritual aesthetic that underpins much of indigenous African cultural expression. Further, it would be helpful if examples, e.g., "Cool (Swedish meatball)," utilized in your arguments were at least marginally applicable to the dicussion at hand and not beyond absurd. Further with regard to "writ[ing] different articles on the same topic to express different points of view," there <i>is</i> no debate about the existence of cool as an indigenous, African cultural aesthetic. It is a separate topic. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 17:58, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, the seperate topic that would be OK as an article would be the history and origins of cool, not one particular writer's opinions about the history and origins of cool. Those are two seperate things. Whatever debate exists or doesn't exist on that topic would be covered in the article. Presenting the topic as seen through a certain worldview doesn't actually make it a seperate topic, it makes it a POV fork. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:21, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. That's assuming that an article on cool as a legitimate, indigenous cultural ethos that is an underlying value in African society with regard to personal comportment, interpersonal relations, functional art, music, dance, etc., has no inherent value. And that most certainly is not the case. Cool in the African context would merit an article had there <i>been</i> no trans-Atlantic slave trade and no consequent infusion into American popular culture. It is complex, with pervasive implications in indigenous African cultural expression. There is ample information about cool in African culture that is clearly not POV; it is the result of scholarly inquiry and rigorous research. Some of those sources have been provided on this page. The contentious subject is, in fact, pop-culture cool -- which, if it didn't exist -- would not render an examination of cool in traditional African societies or in the African diaspora POV or superfluous. By the same token, an examination of pop-culture cool in its various permutations and disparate meanings is not critical to an examination of African cool.

<blockquote>
<p>Cool philosophy is a strong intellectual attitude, affecting incredibly diverse provinces of artistic happening, yet leavened with humor and a sense of play. It is an all important mediating process, accounting for similarities in art and vision in many tropical African societies. It is a matrix from which stem ideas about being generous, clear, percussively patterned, harmonized with others, balanced, finished, socially perfected, worthy of destiny. In other words, the criterion of coolness seems to unite and animate all the other canons (Thompson 1974:43).</p>

<p>Coolness is a metaphor for proper living; it symbolizes moral aesthetic accomplishment. It requires an attention to balance and harmony. It shades into behavior as well as art: "Coolness is the proper way you represent yourself to a human being" (Thomps on 1983:13).</p>

<p>Throughout the ongoing and antagonism/opposition <i>ad seriatim</i> attempts to obliterate this article (this is now attempt three or four, I believe), I have been charged with writing a "book report" -- quoting only some hack by the name of Ferris Thompson, utilizing one source. It was, in fact, the basis upon which the information referred to above was excised from the article by <a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">User:Urthogie</a>. I repeatedly have said that this information is widely accepted as the foundations of a <i>bona fide</i> African cultural ethos/aesthetic. The fact that several sources list the same attributes, sometimes with one or another of the items given different names, or not mentioned as discrete elements, but including them among the list of values (e.g., Thompson's list is not the same as some others'), speaks to just how widely this information is accepted across disciplines. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 20:00, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thompson <i>explicitly</i> calls cool "feminine" energy. And Thompson is, of course, writing of cool in the traditional African context. And as I commented in response to this old, old, <i>old</i> charge (which surfaced in the article discussion page months ago) -- and as one admin who bothered to do even a <i>little</i> research commented -- this correlates with values across societies: female is passive, quiet; male is aggresive, vigorous. Further, the article here treats "cool" as part of African-American machismo -- which is cool as it evolved in completely different historical and cultural millieu, of slavery, oppression, racism and survival -- <i>another</i> reason it is useful to treat African cool comprehensively, in its proper context. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 19:48, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I clearly stated in introducing the link what it encompasses. It establishes cool as an <i>aesthetic</i> in African-American culture worthy of academic investigation. Insofar as that <i>aesthetic</i> is descendant and derivative of African cool (as <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29_fabf.html" title="Cool (African philosophy)">Cool (African philosophy)</a> contends, it is supportive of the information presented in this embattled article. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 20:04, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states at the outset: "This might be news to James Dean and Miles Davis, but the Yoruba people of Nigeria invented cool. They call it <i>itutu</i>, and someone who possesses this mystic quality is generous and calm, possessing a sense of certainty." The article goes on to cite the use of blues and indigos to express <i>itutu</i> and the use of red in Yoruba art to express <i>ashe</i>, or "the power to make things happen." Aside from the obvious, my rationale for presenting the info: Kente cloth (Ghanaian, rather than Nigerian), for example, gives equal value to such colors<a href="http://www.marshall.edu/akanart/images/KENTESTORE.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.marshall.edu/akanart/images/KENTESTORE.JPG" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> -- what would be considered "loud" by European sensibilities. But as such, it is a visual representation of what in Oriental philosophy would be considered Yin/Yang; it is the cohabitation and balance of elemental forces: feminine and masculine, cool and hot. This aesthetic sensibility/approach is also evident in the African-American music, the highly Africanized band music played by the earliest Dixieland bands in New Orleans.<a href="http://www.smallsjazz.com/dixieland/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.smallsjazz.com/dixieland/index.html" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> And it is evidenced by the equal weight given positive and negative space and aggressive and passive elements in much of traditional African art. It is visible in weaving techniques, as well as wood carving. Thompson calls this manifestation a visual representation of jazz and uses two African masks side by side to contrast the aesthetic approaches of each. Once one understands the concept, it's easy for the reader to see which is which. The "jazz" mask is bold; it has vibrancy, movement, even rhythm; the other is dead/flat. But, hey, these are elements that I don't touch upon much, if at all, not having had the time to do so. And others seem more preoccupied with obliterating the piece than with actually improving/contributing to it. And, gee. I guess I won't get to if the deletionists have their way -- not in <i>this</i> article, at least.&#160;:p <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 20:20, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just received an e-mail from the professor cited above (the one doing research into cool in African American literature), Jacqueline Goldsby, Univ. of Chicago. Here is what she wrote, in part:</p>

<p>I skimmed the debate at the Wikipedia website, following the link you provided. Since I'm just embarking on my own research into the concept, I can't offer the kind of definitive sourcing you need. Though I would say this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm struck that the contributors to the debate are so hostile toward Robert Farris Thompson's discussion of "coolness" in Flash of the Spirit. That book is recognized by scholars as *the* definitive treatment of African-derived art forms and practices across the diaspora. Thompson's credentials are impeccable, as is his scholarship. It's specious for your opponents to dismiss the idea of "cool"'s Africanist origins simply because only one (English-language) text addresses it. That's often the case in scholarship. After all, seminal ideas have to start somewhere.</p>

<p>Actually, I think you mean source 9, "Death of the Cool." The writer states, "Cool is that aloof, independent, self-contained, rebellious, strong, proficient, iconoclastic, vanguard attitude that Miles embodied." This piece is actually a excoriation of shallow, pop-culture cool and cool as co-opted by corporate America. A decent source for approaching cool from a pop-culture perspective. Just my way of saying that there not only is a certain lack of three-dimensionality, if you will, in African-American cool, as opposed to its African progenitor, but that the difference between elemental A-A cool and shallow pop-culture cool is also huge. There is ample material available -- and certainly ample justification in terms of true-grit substance -- to justify keeping African cool and pop-culture cool separate. While one is derivative of the other, filtered through the African-American experience, they are vastly different -- one grounded in the spirituality, mores and fundamental <i>weltanschaaung</i> of a people, the other, relatively speaking, a permutation that has taken on a life of it own -- one, as this writer contends, that is a life <i>in</i> the life, whored out to the highest bidder. That's <i>his</i> take. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 20:38, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Wrong.</b> And "<i>folklore</i>"?!! An excerpt from the article of <i>one</i> mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example the percussive dominance where the stepper throws down a sharply percussive rhythm with the feet while the hands beat out a counter rhythm and the head enunciates another beat is one obvious characteristic present during step shows. This is particularly noticeable when steppers use canes to increase the complexity and audibility of the sound. Such a routine has its origins in northern Zaire, Sudan, Zambia and Mozambique while the familiar "get down" position commonly observed when steppers often begin and [end] a step by bending deeply from the waist can be traced to many Central and West African cultures. In contrast to the aforementioned aesthetic characteristics that are considered "hot" practices, steppers also demonstrate "cool" aesthetics in their movements by striving for uniform visibility and clarity in their motions. Invoking the names of the founders and organization's history by the steppers as well as the practice of looking smart [another characteristic of African cool, "luminosity of motion"/"looking smart" (my note)] by entering and exiting the show properly rounds out the expressions of other "cool" aesthetics presented by Greek members during step shows. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 19:31, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Answer:</b> as long as it takes. If there is unverifiable information in the article -- as with any other, then delete that information. Let the article remain in that state -- with a stub or other tag appropriate to its condition -- until someone has the time and interest to improve it. I mean isn't that the way Wikipedia is <i>supposed</i> to work? (Duh.) And that's what's happened to the piece so far; whole chunks have been obliterated.</p>
<p>But it hasn't stopped there. This article has been under constant attack. This is the third or fourth attempt to obliterate it, the last effort concluding as late as the end of December. Here, the article has been attacked for lacking information I previously had inserted in the article, but which was hacked out of it!&#160;:p And there were subheads delineating the widely accepted components of the aesthetic that were left blank (as is done in <i>lots</i> of articles on this website), inviting input and further development as a means of helping to form a general framework for the piece. They, too, were deleted.</p>
<p>The so-called "weaselwords" of the opening paragraph are a rewrite -- one I did not do. One of the people complaining about the condition of the piece did that. I left it as a concession. And, yeah. I, too, think the wording sux.&#160;:p</p>
<p>Returning to the question, the fact is <i>no</i> article on Wikipedia should depend upon the time and attention of a single editor for its development. Nor should it be obliterated simply because no single editor has worked tirelessly on it. People grouse about the page. If they spent a <i>fraction</i> of the time, energy and attention <i>constructively</i> editing the piece (not just hacking away at it) and <i>contributing</i> information that they've so far spent complaining about it or, <i>ad seriatim</i>, trying to get it deleted, hell, it'd be a freaking featured article.</p>
<p>Has anyone thought to put it up for article improvement, as is, I believe, fairly common practice around here when the desire is to improve an article? Has it been suggested for the project concentrating on articles treating Africa? Gosh. What a concept. The answer to both questions is no. Because beyond the criticism (some of it justified; I have <i>not</i> had the time or the inclination to concentrate on it) of the article itself, the hostility of detractors (as is evidenced by those who continue to focus on attack Thompson's unassailed scholarship completely without foundation, while completely ignoring the writings of others) has been directed toward the editor and/or the very subject itself. One of the primary detractors below has had the unmitigated gall to assert, "But many people don't recognize the [A]frican aesthetic as existing." Yet he so far has failed to produce a <i>single</i>, <i>learned</i> individual (biased opinions born of ignorance or animus don't count) who would make such an absurd and possibly racist statement.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that indigenous African peoples, as with all other members of humanity, have aesthetic standards and belief systems. Further, there is ample evidence, and considerable scholarhip that supports, that there is, <i>indeed</i> a collective cool aesthetic commonly held across traditional, indigenous African societies that has far-reaching implications with regard to how individuals comport themselves, how they interact, that governs/mediates both everyday/pedestrian and artistic expression. That aesthetic merits an article -- just as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_aesthetics.html" title="Japanese aesthetics">Japanese aesthetics</a> merits one.</p>
<p>This article has <i>not</i> been treated the way other articles on the website generally are treated. The far more interesting and legitimate question that begs a proper answer here is, "<i>Why?</i>"&#160;:p <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 22:49, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No. If you check their arguments, they haven't produced <i>a single source</i> to support their arguments -- not one. Their comments have been in the form of "I don't think," and vague generalizations -- but not supported by a single source. Their personal opinions and vague, inchoate objections -- seemingly largely grounded in ignorance and suppositions born of experience of cool only in its extremely limited, pop-culture context -- have no weight, no bearing whatsoever here. If anything, the "no true Scotsman" fallacy would seem to apply to their failed and incredibly lame attempts to discount/debunk Yale professor and respected scholar Robert Farris Thompson. I've challenged them to produce a single, solitary source source and then <i>half</i> as many sources to refute the existence of an African cool aesthetic (or even a collective African aesthetic shared across tribal and national boundaries) -- and they haven't produced a single, solitary one.

<p>Yom, don't mistake my directness for ire. I'm confident that they will be unable to meet the challenge I have posed and produce a source to validate their unsubstantiated and completely unfounded criticisms of either the topic or of Yale scholar Robert Farris Thompson. There is absolutely no knowledgeable person who would deny the existence of an African cool aesthetic or a collective African aesthetic that crosses tribal, ethnic and national boundaries. The naysayers'/detractors' statements so far have consisted of vague generalizations and "I don't think" commentary. And ignorance, supposition and inchoate supsicions -- likely born of exposure to only the limited, attenuated, pop-culture expressions of African cool -- are hardly firm foundations upon which to base intellectual arguments.</p>

<p><i><b>That aesthetic merits an article -- just as Japanese aesthetics merits one</b></i> (<i>Deeceevoice)</i></p>
<p>Japan is a country, Africa is a continent with thousands of different cultures. If one would manufacture an article about Asian (aesthetics) asserting that, lets say, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkmenistan.html" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Territories_df30.html" title="Palestinian Territories">Palestinian Territories</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> share one and the same "aesthetics" and live by the same cultural and spiritual values, the article would be listed for deletion as well.</p>
<p>Same would happen if someone would change the title of <b><a href="../../../y/i/n/Yin_and_yang.html" title="Yin and yang">Yin and yang</a></b> into Cool (Asian aesthetics), and would start to fill it with all kind of unrelated informations, claims and assertions. For instance adding the claim that, because Chinese judges were the first who started to wear sunglasses indoors, back in the 1400s <a href="http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/MichaelShanks/3079" class="external autonumber" title="http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/MichaelShanks/3079" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, trying to hide their emotions during court proceedings, anybody wearing sunglasses today to "mask his emotions" is appropriating Cool (Asian aesthetics). Or adding the assertion to the article, that, because of some Indian artists who preferably paint in blue colors, blue colors are an element of Cool (Asian aesthetics) and therefore valid for all Asian countries, and any non-Asian artists painting in blue colors as well are influenced by this concept of Cool (Asian aesthetics), or adding the claim that, because there are some Islamic countries in Asia, Islam is the spiritual element of Cool (Asian aesthetics) and is therefore the spiritual framework not only for the whole continent but for the Asian diaspora as well, etc. ect. The bottom line is that nobody would tolerate such an article, and rightfully so. <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoYep_5bfa.html" title="User:CoYep">CoYep</a> 14:35, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A lot of scholarly literature when it comes to black studies seems to be devoted to this pan-African stuff. The reason is, simply put: because African-Americans just know that they're African in ancestry. They don't know (with some exceptions for historical research) which tribe, or kingdom their ancestors belonged to. Its a shame that the diverse culture of various African tribes and kingdoms is lost in the massive brushstrokes of the academy.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 14:41, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You don't know what you're talking about. This is not "pan-African stuff" -- any more than scholarly work treating a generalized "European cultural aesthetic" is "pan-European stuff." The fact is certain African cultures/peoples <i>do</i> share aesthetics in common. There is <i>clearly</i> an African aesthetic: e.g., the way African dancers get low to the ground when they approach ecstasy, or the Divine or simply become caught up in the dance, in the polyrhythmic cadences, which can be mesmerizing. They "get down" -- low, near the earth. It's a common, recurrent theme throughout West African dance, and in other portions of the continent, as well. And in African-American dance. (And throughout the African diaspora -- in Haiti, in Brazil, in Cuba.) "Get down, get down, down. Get down, get down, down. Jungle boogie, jungle boogie." Sound familiar? That's Kool and the Gang. Another: "Let's dance. Let's shout. Shake your body down to the ground." That's Michael Jackson (the creator of the moonwalk: classic motion and stasis; hot and cool combined simultaneous motion/non-motion.) It's a hallmark characteristic of African movement that has survived the Middle Passage, slavery and the decades since.</p>
<p>Again, from a source quoted above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...<i>it is obvious that certain aesthetics observed during stepping are deeply entrenched within the music and dance of African culture.</i> For example the percussive dominance where the stepper throws down a sharply percussive rhythm with the feet while the hands beat out a counter rhythm and the head enunciates another beat is one obvious characteristic present during step shows. This is particularly noticeable when steppers use canes to increase the complexity and audibility of the sound. Such a routine has its <i>origins in northern Zaire, Sudan, Zambia and Mozambique</i> while <i>the familiar "get down" position commonly observed when steppers often begin and [end] a step by bending deeply from the waist can be traced to many Central and West African cultures.</i> [emphases added]<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3752/is_200409/ai_n9455909#continue" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3752/is_200409/ai_n9455909#continue" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></p>

<p>In contrast, white folks want to soar when expressing the same emotions -- as in ballet. They get up on their toes. They think in terms of being soft, ethereal, taking flight. Black folks get fierce and "take it down to the ground." And that's just one well known, well referenced example. You don't know the subject matter, and you have no idea what you're talking about. You're merely making facile assumptions, based on ignorance, that there's some sort of political agenda at work here -- when there's absolutely nothing of the sort. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 22:14, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, DCV makes good points. It's a known fact that "white folks" in general dance on their toes only. "Dancing in the rain. I'm happy again. I'm singin' and dancin' in the rain. Dancin' and singin' in the rain." Sound familiar? That's Frank Sinatra! Dancing in the rain is a hallmark characteristic of white folks movement that has survived since decades! And the Masai, who are jumping several feet high while they are dancing, are, in reality, "white folks".&#160;:-P <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoYep_5bfa.html" title="User:CoYep">CoYep</a> 22:53, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No. As a dance form that many consider to be the highest expression of European dance, ballet is a legitimate example. It is an expression of that aesthetic, just as traditional African dance I've referred to is an expression of an African aesthetic. (And, no. Actually, Singin' in the rain -- that's Gene Kelly.) Further, to say that an aesthetic is shared does <i>not</i> mean it is universal. Your sarcasm does your cause no good. Perhaps you should help Urthogie hunt up some sources.

<p>Might be interesting to see if there are sources that show that Cool is an Asian, South American, European, Central Asian, Australian, Indian, Turkish, Caucasian aesthetic or something?

<dd>An article on the history and origins of cool would be entirely appropriate, and I bet it could be done without resorting to original research. Such an article would of course cover multiple people's thoughts on this matter, and it would not pre-suppose one particular correct origin of "cool", excluding the others. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:43, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but you are incorrect. But let's get one thing clear, shall we? To do an article on the African cool aesthetic (which, if you will consult the sources) does, indeed, exist and entails several elements, does <i>not</i> mean that the phenomenon is exclusive to indigenous, traditional African culture/societies. Nor does it preclude treatment of cool as a pop culture phenomenon in all its various meanings across cultures -- or, even in traditional societies of other nations, if such a phenomenon exists. All it means is that that particular article will <i>focus</i> on cool in the African context. The title limits the scope of only that particular article and has no bearing whatsoever on other explorations of cool. It's no different from writing an article on <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_art.html" title="African art">African art</a>. No one reasonably would expect that an article so titled implies that there is no other art in existence. <i>Why is that so hard for some people to understand?</i> Seriously.
