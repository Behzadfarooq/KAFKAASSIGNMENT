<li><b>Question</b>. What is it that this article lacks that other Halls at Bristol have? It really does not make a lot of sense to look at articles on Halls at X in isolation. Some of the other articles are better than this one, I agree. I think this should have been given more time. 8 minutes is far far too short. Also note that this Hall is linked on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_University_2134.html" title="Bristol University">Bristol University</a> article with a link that differs from this title. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 11:21, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The question is not "what does the article lack" but "what does the Hall lack". And that's notability. As for the other Halls, Hiatt Baker has already been redirected, and rightly so. And if/when this article is deleted, I'll be nominating <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badock_Hall_a0d9.html" title="Badock Hall">Badock Hall</a> next. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 21:30, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, a dorm would have to be exceptional to warrant its own article, as their nature is to be non-notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable University dorm.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but improve. Several points.
<ul>
<li>Halls of residence of often more than "Dorms" with a function of just offering accommodation. They often offer tutorial support, provide rooms for senior members, a link between students and those senior staff members, and they play an important role in the social and sporting life of a university.</li>
<li>To Melcoir. Yes, <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badock_Hall_a0d9.html" title="Badock Hall">Badock Hall</a> is the next worst, but what about the two older halls where the article includes some history and architectual details. Are the older ones notable?</li>
<li>Merging to University article. There is already a brief table. More details would unbalance the university article. If you want a merge, I suggest merging all Hall articles to Bristol University Halls of Residence similar to what was done recently at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Exeter_Halls_of_Residence_b68a.html" title="University of Exeter Halls of Residence">University of Exeter Halls of Residence</a>.</li>
<li>The question of Halls of Residence, particularly in the British and Commonwealth countries, as opposed to the USA, needs to be thought through carefully and not done piece meal. I have suggested to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Universities_a389.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Universities">Wikipedia:WikiProject Universities</a> that they consider all the issues, but they do not seem to be active.</li>
<li>Students going to university want good NPOV information on Halls of Residence, not just the advertising POV material from the university itself. Of course that means we have to write good articles, but it does not mean we have to delete them just minutes after someone starts the article. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:51, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../w/i/l/Wills_Hall_c687.html" title="Wills Hall">Wills Hall</a> is borderline in my mind; <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifton_Hill_House_9073.html" title="Clifton Hill House">Clifton Hill House</a> is notable for its history. Obviously there is a continuum of notability for residence halls, just like any other category. This Hall is at the bottom.</li>
<li>Merging to one article is an excellent idea.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a consumer guide. And you know what, often an article needs to be nominated as quickly as possible. Otherwise we waste the time of everyone who edits it without suspecting the inevitability of its fate. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 22:24, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Where does it say "Wikipedia is not a consumer guide"? However, I also do not think that is what I was suggesting. I was not suggesting anything about value for money. I was suggesting that information is usefull and that is why people turn to encyclopedias. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 22:38, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My problem with that argument is that all information is useful to somebody. It doesn't say "Wikipedia is not a consumer guide" anywhere, but I think it's a reasonable reflection of our values. We don't have an article on every nursing home for the sole purpose of helping people decide where to put their parents. We also don't have an article on every university residence for the sole purpose of helping people decide where to put their kids. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 22:57, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Redirect</b> - article reads like a prospective students brochure. Oxbridge colleges are academic institutions in their own right forming a kind of federation, whereas University Hall is a creature of the University of Bristol.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Dormcruft.

The one keep vote there isn't factually correct. In addition, if a dorm was notable, Jester Dormitory certainly would be, as it is enormous. At the very least, <b>merge</b> this one into <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_University_2134.html" title="Bristol University">Bristol University</a>; when the deletion precedent I just mentioned was recreated some time later, someone simply redirected it to the main university page to save the hassle of another AfD. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 16:07, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment and question</b>. Coming from the UK and Australia, I dislike the term "Dorm", rather than "Hall of Residence" or "College", but I do not understand the US system. So I have a few questions - Do US dorms provide anything other than housing for students? Are Faculty (to use the US term) associated with a dorm? Do dorms compete against each other in sport? Is there any academic support (e.g.tutoring)? If the answer to these questions (or even most of them) is "no", then dorms are not like Halls of Residence and the comparision is not valid. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:18, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
