<li><strike><b>Strong keep</b>.</strike> All Wikipedia lists, articles, categories, etc. are inherently assumed to only include the most noteworthy items that could be included unless specifically stated otherwise. This principle applies universally to hundreds and hundreds of lists, such as: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_believed_to_have_epilepsy.html" title="List of people believed to have epilepsy">List of people believed to have epilepsy</a>, List of Europeans, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Eagle_Scouts_9cb4.html" title="List of Eagle Scouts">List of Eagle Scouts</a>, List of people who were cremated, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_have_disappeared.html" title="List of people who have disappeared">List of people who have disappeared</a>, List of virgins, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_World_War_I_veterans_8f91.html" title="List of World War I veterans">List of World War I veterans</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christians_ec4d.html" title="List of Christians">List of Christians</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_deaf_people.html" title="List of deaf people">List of deaf people</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sculptors.html" title="List of sculptors">List of sculptors</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_suicides.html" title="List of suicides">List of suicides</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Cubans_2ee3.html" title="List of Cubans">List of Cubans</a>. Noone could possibly be benefited by including "famous" or "noteworthy" in the title of any of those articles. It would just make the articles harder to find and give them extraneously long titles, plus "fame" and so on are POV terms. Having it be assumed that we wouldn't include non-noteworthy information into <i>any</i> Wikipedia list or article is a much more sensible attitude. As a general rule of thumb, if someone's noteworthy enough for inclusion in Wikipedia, they're probably noteworthy enough to include in the categories and lists they would fit into. Common sense is a very good thing to keep in mind. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 23:00, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Of course they don't. But it's dishonest to phrase this debate as whether or not a single sect of a single religion's list should be deleted, rather than making it clear that <i>hundreds</i> of lists are on the line with this one vote, not only every religious list (of which there are dozens), but every list that is similarly broad. Personally, I don't see why this couldn't be a perfectly useful list to numerous people, and the existence of the category makes it much <i>easier</i> to maintain, but whether you think this should be deleted or not, the debate should be clarified such that it doesn't look like we're attacking a single religion's list. Why did the nominator nominate "List of Roman Catholics" rather than just nominating <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christians_ec4d.html" title="List of Christians">List of Christians</a>? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:13, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Of course there are. And numerous categories and lists are doubles of each other, because neither a category nor a list is perfect; having both serves as a system of checks and balances, of sorts. Are you aware of the major advantages a list has over a category? If not, I'll gladly enlighten you about the problems with maintaining something like a category that's so much less centralized than a list, that lacks the coherent history file a list does which makes keeping it high-quality so easy. Obviously, categories have their advantages to (like being linked to on every page a member of the category is a part of), but you'd have a hard time arguing that lists don't have some major advantages over categories. Contrary to popular opinion, including both in some cases can actually give the best of both worlds; just something to consider, don't vote blindly because there's also a category of a similar nature. And even if one does, that person should make quite certain to do the same for the countless other articles of the same nature. There's no point having votes like this just to breed inconsistency; let's be straightforward about what is and isn't being voted on, <b>from the onset</b>! -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:13, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1) Not one of them says how they were made, what sources were used, or what objective criteria were used for inclusion. If they said "List of composers whose Wikipedia articles identify them as Roman Catholics" that would be OK, but they don't. It would just as much work to check them one name at at time as it is to rebuild the list from scratch.</dd>
<dd>2) This article purports to be a "list of Roman Catholics." But it is comprised of lists that say simply that they are lists of "Catholics." Are these lists restricted to <i>Roman</i> Catholics or not? There is no way to tell—other than to check every entry individually.</dd>
<dd>3) What are we to make of the section of List of Catholic composers that says simply "The great majority of composers listed on the following pages: The great majority of composers listed on the following pages: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_renaissance_composers.html" title="List of renaissance composers">Renaissance composers</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Category%7EItalian_composers_91a0.html" title="Category:Italian composers">Italian composers</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Category%7EFrench_composers_ccbe.html" title="Category:French composers">French composers</a>&#160;?" Plausible, but I hope we're shooting higher than "plausible." Whoever wrote that couldn't possibly know it is true <i>unless he counted them,</i> which would require knowing <i>which</i> were Catholic (or Roman Catholic), in which case they could and should have been <i>listed</i>. Conversely, knowing that "the great majority" of Italian composers about as useful as knowing that a stopped clock is right twice a day. It doesn't tell you anything useful unless you know which are Catholic, just as the clock doesn't tell you anything useful unless you know <i>when</i> it is right. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:21, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P. S. OK, I just checked a couple at random. <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Ravel_bc28.html" title="Maurice Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a> is included in List of Catholic composers, but our article on Ravel not only does not identify him as Roman Catholic, it says "Ravel was not religious and was probably an atheist." Shoddy. Perhaps someone hazarded a guess that the "great majority" of French composers are Roman Catholic and figured, hey, that's close enough for Wikipedia work. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:27, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>P. P. S. The very entry for Agnieszka Holland in "List of Catholic directors and producers" says she is "now roughly an agnostic." How does "roughly an agnostic" = "Roman Catholic?" The article on <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnieszka_Holland_2ceb.html" title="Agnieszka Holland">Agnieszka Holland</a> says she "was born to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, and was raised a Catholic." So, are these supposed to be "lists of people who were raised as Catholics, regardless of their parents' religious affiliation or those of their parents?" No, because the same list includes "<a href="../../../l/a/r/Lars_von_Trier_d20e.html" title="Lars von Trier">Lars von Trier</a>, convert." Once again, though, our article on <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lars_von_Trier_d20e.html" title="Lars von Trier">Lars von Trier</a> happens to say exactly nothing about the religious affiliations of himself, as child or adult, or his parents.</dd>

<li>Changing to <b>abstain</b>. The problem is actually rather with some of the sublists; lists of Catholics should be limited to manageable things, such as Catholic priests, religious writers etc, and perhaps notable Carholics in countries where they are a very small minority. Listing Catholic artists, politicians etc, in general and according to a loose definition of who is a Catholic, will be like combining almost every person from all lists by nationality for French, Italian, Spanish etc. people of that occupation in one list. I think everyone can realize that this is silly and unmaintainable. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 15:13, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I might've inspired that, sorry. I do think it seems like Catholic and Jewish lists were targeted disproportionately. That did strike me as slightly strange. There may have been too many of both kinds of lists, but I think it would've "set off flags" less if it had been more limited or gone solely after the marginal cases like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Catholic_American_Actors_4010.html" title="List of Catholic American Actors">List of Catholic American Actors</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_superheroes_cbec.html" title="List of Jewish superheroes">List of Jewish superheroes</a>. In the Catholic case two or even three Catholic lists were put on the same delete vote which caused me massive confusion because there'd be one that struck me as valid while the other two sounded like potential nonsense or redundant.</dd>

I think that things in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_belief.html" title="List of people by belief">List of people by belief</a> make many Wikipedians very uncomfortable. I can find versions of these lists in some encyclopedias as a Wikipedia article is in some ways comparable to a single Encyclopedia page. Still I want to respect that discomfort now that I'm aware of it, but at the same time I don't agree with it. I think in some cases you can know a person's belief and that belief makes them as much part of a "group" as nationality does, maybe moreso in some cases. Well in least you can know it as well as you can know anything. I mean many here act like religion is too iffy, but that nationality is not.
