<p>Nominating all these articles - although they all seem to have a decent amount of content, it's mostly bloated and isn't very meaningful. The articles in question are about <b>non-notable</b> characters in the manga and anime series <i><a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28manga%29.html" title="Bleach (manga)">Bleach</a></i>. Wanderweiss and Luppi (Bleach) aren't even properly named according to the naming conventions. These characters are non-notable because they basically appear for a handful of chapters (or pages, in D-Roy's case), and die. They have few (if any) distinct personality traits, and exist mainly for the sake of fighting the series' protagonists. Although I have personally improved D-Roy, Edorad Leones, Ilforte Grantz and Shawlong Qufand (see edit histories), I now feel that the effort was not needed and that these articles have no place on Wikipedia. All the valuable information in them can be condensed and <b>merged</b> into <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Bleach_series_2c58.html" title="Characters in Bleach series">Characters in Bleach series</a>. <i>See also: <a href="../../../b/l/e/Talk%7EBleach_%28manga%29_22bc.html#Character_articles" title="Talk:Bleach (manga)">Talk:Bleach (manga)#Character articles</a> (several users agreed with the deletion proposal)</i> -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 06:34, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'll abstain from voting for now. In my opinion, the articles were rather unnecessary to start with, but my main criticism of them is that they are a total pain to maintain, and often seem to be just one more location you have to remove the latest bit of unnecessary info from. Of course, they do pass the <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">Pokemon test</a>, or closer to home, are just as notable as <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaien_Shiba_890d.html" title="Kaien Shiba">Kaien Shiba</a>, so I'm split on this one.

<dd><b>If merge, merge by categories</b> I do admit some characters has too little backstory and information that they may not really require a separate article, but even if this article is to be merged, merge it into something like the "Hollow" article, since the Espada are hollows anyway. Of course, such merging may provoke cries of image removals, but on the other hand, keeping the images may cause the article to grow too big. That is all I'll say. 155.69.5.236Wakipudeo155.69.5.236</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I think they don't have enough backstory and unique information to stand alone, but I don't think they should be merged into already large articles like the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Bleach_8f0f.html" title="Characters in Bleach">Characters in Bleach</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_%28Bleach%29_31c9.html" title="Hollow (Bleach)">Hollow (Bleach)</a>. Perhaps all these pages should be merged into new seperate compiliation page? EikaKou
<dl>
<dd><b>Reply</b> Lists of Bleach Characters by Race might be the most sensible option if we were to divide them, since the current system within the Bleach Character article is by location of residence, which doesn't make much sense imo. However, I'm not sure that image removal is really a concern here. If one of those characters were to be in a flashback, or have survived somehow, or otherwise gain notability within the series, then I don't think there's really a shortage of scanned manga pages with the text shopped out, and they could be easily replaced. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 23:17, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think none of these articles should be deleted, especially Wanderweiss, as its very likely he'll become more important later on. He's probably an Espada and is still alive and likely will remain so due to his lack of fighting in the current assault. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.127.50.229 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.127.50.229_43e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.127.50.229">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd><b>Reply</b>. Anyone going to the <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanderweiss.html" title="Wanderweiss">Wanderweiss</a> page is almost certainly going to be a reader of the manga. It would be of no interest otherwise. So, ideally, the page should be made <i>useful</i> with <i>the manga's audience</i> in mind. Here is a list of important information on Wanderweiss' page which the average reader might not know off-hand:
<ul>
<li>He was human-sized as a hollow, prior to becoming arrancar. This suggests that he was a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_%28Bleach%29_31c9.html#Menos" title="Hollow (Bleach)">Vasto Lorde</a>. This would make him freakishly powerful, and certainly more significant than D-Roy could have hoped to be.</li>
<li>And, um...</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Merging the article and turning the page into a redirect does not prevent the page's recreation if and when (probably when) we know and care enough about him to warrent it. What we are trying to do is set a precidence. Specifically: If a pages is filled with nothing but useless information, <i>even for the relatively few readers who actually care</i>, then the page should not exist. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. Important information on the limited subject should be included in other pages discussing a more general subject. Take the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_%28Bleach%29_31c9.html" title="Hollow (Bleach)">Hollow (Bleach)</a> page for example. Creating a new page for each individual type of hollow would be pointless and actually hurt the core article. – <i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 21:37, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
