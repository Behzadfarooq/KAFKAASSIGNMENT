<p>Enterprise Audit Shell was just released this month. Google doesn't know much about it yet.</p>
<p>The official annoucement has been recorded in the sudo archives at: <a href="http://www.sudo.ws/pipermail/sudo-announce/2006-March/000062.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sudo.ws/pipermail/sudo-announce/2006-March/000062.html" rel="nofollow">Officia Enterprise Audit Shell announcement on sudo mailing list</a></p>
<p>The official open source project pages are at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/eash/" class="external text" title="http://freshmeat.net/projects/eash/" rel="nofollow">Official FreshMeat Project Page for EAS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eash" class="external text" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eash" rel="nofollow">Official SourceForge Project Page for EAS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eas.strchr.net/" class="external text" title="http://eas.strchr.net/" rel="nofollow">Official EAS Support Forum</a></li>
</ul>
<p>EAS has a significant history. Simply do a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sudosh" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sudosh" rel="nofollow">Google Search for Sudosh</a>. EAS is the new version of Sudosh, hence the release 2.0.00.</p>
<p>Regardless of EAS started out on Wikipedia as AFB, it no longer fits the requirements for deletion. The article isn't a commercial advertisement, it's free Open Source software. The article isn't a vanity page about myself, I don't even have a page about myself on Wikipedia. No where in the article is my name mentioned. The article has been rewritten to be an informative and descriptive about the software. The article also meets the Software requirements that it must be innovative. The entire reason why <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudosh.html" title="Sudosh">Sudosh</a> is so popular (all the Fortune 100 companies use it and many branches of the government) is because of its innovation. EAS replaced Sudosh and added newer innovative features on top of it.</p>
<p>The article has been completely cleaned up to fit the Wiki guidelines and is in similiar format to other <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Source_1846.html" title="Open Source">Open Source</a> software like <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudo.html" title="Sudo">sudo</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudosh.html" title="Sudosh">sudosh</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apache.html" title="Apache">apache</a>.</p>
<p>I don't understand why this article needs to be deleted.</p>

<dd>Software is considered to be notable enough for inclusion if it meets any of the following criteria:</dd>

<dd>2) The software is/was innovative, significant, or influential in some specific way, and this is verifiable from reliable sources independent of the software developer.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>EAS is innovative because it's the <b>ONLY</b> piece of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Source_1846.html" title="Open Source">Open Source</a> software that competes with the commercial UNIX auditting software <a href="http://www.symark.com/powerbroker.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.symark.com/powerbroker.htm" rel="nofollow">Sysmark PowerBroker</a> EAS is a very large piece of software that was developed over 1 year which was meant to be a free alternative to PowerBroker. <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudosh.html" title="Sudosh">Sudosh</a> originally did this, but was not as feature rich. Sudosh was replaced with EAS. Sudosh already has a huge following and track record. The confusion behind this deletion is because of the NAME CHANGE. <b>EAS IS SUDOSH</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By deleting this article you are effectively killing the EAS Open Source project because Wiki has a strong link to Google. People need to know about EAS and this article needs to remain on Wiki so that information can be shared. EAS was just released under this new name and peope will learn about it. EAS is the alternative to PowerBroker, which costs $1,500 per server installed. EAS is free. Why delete it? If it gets deleted, someone else will add it, and we'll go through this all over again.

<dd>Saying EAS is sudosh is complete bullcrap, sudosh is sudosh. Feature-rich means nothing. This is an advertisement for EAS, it's trying to convince people that EAS is better than sudosh. If you want this article to stay you will have to make it read like an article rather than a pamphlet. If this is deleted it will be a good thing, then the person who comes along to make the new article may make one that read like an encyclopedia entry, rather than an advertisement. 65.95.124.5 04:03, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>EAS is sudosh. I'm the author of both sudosh and EAS. I know. This isn't an advertisement. I gain nothing from this, I receive no money or sales from this. All of this software is open source. I don't need to convience people that EAS is better than sudosh. Check out the sudosh mailing list yourself, you will see tons of feature requests back from last year. I worked for 1 year adding these features and what grew from the requests was a new version which I simply called EAS because a lot of the original functionality has changed. The article doesn't read like a pamplet, if you want it better, let it stay and people will edit the article, just like sudosh has been editted. Dhanks 04:07, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> If EAS is really sudosh 2.0, why go through all the trouble of renaming it and just add a small section about it to the sudosh page? Satisfied customers would naturally look for an updated version of what they already own instead of looking up a whole new project. Simply using wikipedia to manipulate google search rankings is just plain <b>wrong</b> IMHO. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBige1977_d3fc.html" title="User:Bige1977">Bige1977</a> 04:13, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> EAS has branched from sudosh and turned into its own framework leaving sudosh behind. The name change was required. This article WAS NOT created to change the ranks in Google -- it was created to let people KNOW ABOUT THE NAME CHANGE. I've made comments in the article <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudosh.html" title="Sudosh">sudosh</a> that the name has changed to EAS. Obviously EAS has more to document that Sudosh, merging the articles would be confusing and large. Dhanks 04:20, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> solely on the grounds of using Wikipedia for advertisement. If your software cannot exist without wikipedia, then it ain't much.

<li><b>Compromise Proposal</b> I think it is more likely at this time that a user of sudosh, the current established product, would enter the query sudossh to find more information about enhancements, future versions, or information on competing products. Since Open Enterprise Shell claims to be sudosh version 2.0, in the interiem it should be best that it stay in the sudosh article. If in the future various open source unixish distros decide to include open enterprise shell, it then should get its own page in a more abbreviated form than it is now. Personally I think that Dhanks energy should be promoting his fork of sudossh to be included as a package with various unix/bsd distributions which would be greatly more important to his market share than a mere wikipedia article. <i>For now Enterprise Open Shell should be a redirect to sudosh, if dhanks promises not do change the redirect.. Sudosh should mention with a link to his project page that Enterprise Open Shell is a new fork of it.</i> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBige1977_d3fc.html" title="User:Bige1977">Bige1977</a> 07:30, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
