<li><b>Dont delete</b> The article compliments Dog behaviourist article, Operant Conditioning and training techniques. The reason Paul Rawlinson is used above any other behaviourist is purely arbitarty, the article is desmonstrative of a modern behaviourist and reflects and compliments the Dog behaviourist article by allowing the reader access to an increased level of information. I would not have been able with any conviction to write about other behaviourists as many are quite secretive in regards to their work. However, Stan Rawlinson is well published I do have information on him and if you would prefer it I will change this page to reflect him as he is widley published in the dog and sporting press. <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isopropyl.html" title="Isopropyl">isopropyl</a> is not correct this a first post.

<p>Completely unsourced, and a badly-formatted title. We have an article on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_rock.html" title="Progressive rock">progressive rock</a> and if that gets too big, it would be logical to split out subarticles such as history of progressive rock and origins of progressive rock. If an article on progressive rock in the 21st century is ever needed, it should grow organically out of a normal article, like as a subarticle of history of progressive rock. It's silly to have an article like this because 94% of the 21st century has not yet occurred. With all that said, I would have just merged it elsewhere except that there's nothing to merge because this is an unsourced list of albums and stuff that somebody decided was important -- hence, nothing to merge, and, even if an article on this topic was relevant, everything here would have to be removed because it is unsourced and opinionated, not to mention badly formatted and improperly titled (should be progressive rock in the 21st century, theoretically, but since this is more of a timeline than an article, it would be timeline of progressive rock in the 21st century). <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 23:46, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I have changed the formatting of the entry. You are correct that the title should be changed. Because the subject of progressive rock is very broad, I chose to tackle recent events because most of those are easily verifiable. I did not realize EVERYTHING, even fairly obvious items, needed to be verified. There are several sub-articles already on the "progressive rock" entry including lists which are full of opinion and debate. I think a timeline of progressive rock (even one that, for now, is just covering events and beyond) is valuable. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 02:11, 21 February 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 20 February 2006 (entry edited by Flonkus)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have sourced the article and tried to conform to a timeline format. I did some research and discovered several other musical genres with "timeline" articles, many of which have uncited sources and opinions. Please consider keeping this one or deleting all music timelines. For now, I requested a move (after asking for help) to change the article title to Timeline of Progressive Rock: 2001-present. I'd be more than happy to take on the task of doing a full timeline of progressive rock in the future as I have considerable knowledge on the subject. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 19:11, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please use normal titles, and create a normal timeline. Why would we need a timeline for the most recent six years but not prior? Why would we start a timeline for a century that's barely begun, focusing on a topic far more closely associated with the 1970s than the 21st century? If you must make a timeline, make a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_progressive_rock.html" title="Timeline of progressive rock">timeline of progressive rock</a>. The sources you've added are nice, but are not sufficient -- this is a timeline of "important, historical events" so you need to have a source that proves more than what occurred, meaning that it's fine to have a source that proves that Dream Theater released an album in 2001, that does not prove that that album's release was an important, historical event. And it's extremely inappropriate to use a band's official website to document something like this. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 19:45, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Work <i>with</i> me, please. I'm doing my part here and I am new to this process. I wanted to bring some attention to the current decade as the information on Wiki so far is sparse. I intended to cover other material later, but I will instead create a <b>full standard timeline</b> to resolve this apparent issue. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 20:33, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Regarding Dream Theater, the artwork mishap is certainly historical in this context. And I did not cite Dream Theater's website. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 20:33, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regarding "important, historical events", and "key recordings". I wanted to emphasize these words so that when others add/edit the page, they are discouraged from spamming, bias, etc. as much as possible. If this is the wrong way to go about this, I will just use the words "events" and "albums" that I've seen elsewhere. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlonkus_66b2.html" title="User:Flonkus">Flonkus</a> 20:33, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

They are completely unsourced, arguably preferencial. If you intend to hold a standard, why are these existing documents not held to the same?

<p>As the Daily Collections is a non-notable collection of flash animations, I propose this page to be removed. The article is very unorganized and polluted with vanity information. It seems futile to clean up the text, as it is very likely the article will gradually deteriorate to its present state in the future.</p>

<p>Because of the above, one or more of four actions should be taken:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The article's contents and history will be removed.</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. The article will be briefly summarized and placed into <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> as a short section.</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>. The article will redirect to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a>.</li>
<li><b>Userfy</b>. The article will be placed onto the user pages of the original editor, 24.109.9.205, and all primary editors.</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus</b>. I count 12 deletes, 5 merges, and 3 keeps. On a strict vote-counting schema, this translates to 60% consensus to delete, which is not enough. These articles should probably be merged because that's the highest number of non-delete votes, but even among the five merge votes, there is exactly two for InfoWorld joke languages, one for Joke programming languages, one for InfoWorld joke programming languages, and one with no suggestion. Where these articles should be merged to is a debate that doesn't need an AfD to determine. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">athphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b> ï</b></a> 02:46, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No offense to the person that wrote the grammar, but even that could easily have been done in "one school day". It's still nothing more than an extended joke. The grammar wasn't that well-thought out, e.g. "Y*KNOW" translates to the multiplication of Y times KNOW, which is not what the valleyspeak intends. If we merge them all we have to delete the giant quotes to avoid reconstructing the Infoworld article. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>‚Äî<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_25.html" title="February 25">02-25</a> 19:39Z</small></i></span>

<li>Well sure, it's not a perfect grammar and could have been done relatively quickly but the language phenomenon is more than just something made up in school one day by one person. I mentioned the grammar to substantiate notability for the language, not because it's perfect. People refer to VALGOL in other works fairly frequently. Heck, even some of the delete votes (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">User:Wwwwolf</a> for instance) concede notability, saying it's <i>well known</i>. I don't see why this needs deleting.

<dd><b>Comment</b> in some jurisdictions or geographies the term <i>village</i> has a different connotation than cities or towns which are incorporated and exclusive.

I just wanted my page on wikipedia so I could gain more notice since wikipedia is used by many people. And since I don't have to pay anything to get an article on wikipedia, I liked the idea of it. I don't have tons of money to spend just so I can get recognized. My previous abbrasivesness was, somewhat, uncalled for. I hope you understand what I've tried to say, and my intentions.</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I'm not even Canadian, nor do I live there, and it's interesting that you ascribe this to a personal motive, because that tells me there's something going on that maybe shouldn't be, 'especially' since there's seems ot be a whole group on WP concerned with Vaughan politics, if the other AfDs are any indication. Anyhow, I happened to come across the name "pm_shef" on a talk page, clicked on it because it looked interesting, saw that said Shefman wrote an article about another Shefman, looked at the article, surmised the relationship (and was proven correct), saw non-notability and a conflict of interest, and thus requested the AfD. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 05:44, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, if only in the name of the most basic fairness and because nominating this article for the third time in three months is excessive when the two previous consultations showed strong consensus for keeping the article. The first consultation showed 7 keep and 0 delete (discouting the anonymous user who voted four times) and the second showed 10 keep and 2 delete. I understand there's no limit to this and people can merrily continue to put up the same article for deletion again, and again, and again, and get their point on their thirty-sixth attempt when they have exhausted everyone. I also understand that the nominator was acting in good faith and seems to not have initially realized that this particular case had already been discussed at length and settled. Note that I have no particular interest in this debate and before today I had never even heard about the city of Vaughan. Actually, on the general principle I would agree with the nominator's reasoning, if we were to discuss a general rule or guideline. The mere fact for someone to be or to have been a city councillor is not in itself much of a claim to notability unless it is accompanied by some notable elements. But at the present time, the choice of this particular article for target in order to make a point is especially ill-chosen and especially unfair. People have actually been doing work in good faith in application of the previous decisions on this very case. Changing the decision now on a whim would be a waste of time both for the people who did that work and for the participants to the AfD discussions and would be detrimental to the trust and the cooperative spirit of the community. Therefore, if someone feels like proposing in the appropriate forums a discussion for explicit guidelines on the matter, let's do that, it's a good idea. Then we'll act according to whatever guidelines will have been agreed upon and for all similar articles. But until then, let's leave this article alone, there is no reason to single it out. It has earned some respite. <a href="../../../a/s/c/User%7EAsclepias_550d.html" title="User:Asclepias">Asclepias</a> 03:22, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Because both Ferri and Racco are proclaimed Liberals, and everybody else is not; even Racco's spouse, Mario Racco, is a Liberal MPP.

<dd>Wikipedia does not have a maximum length restriction on articles.

There's no provision for "this person can have an article, but they're not important enough to permit it to be longer than two lines".

I have just created such a page: <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaughan_Council_292d.html" title="Vaughan Council">Vaughan_Council</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> has to say about this *<b>Idea</b>: "perhaps instead of going through these AfD's every 3 months, we consolidate. We could get rid of the individual Vaughan Councilor pages and create one big Vaughan City Council page similar to Hamilton City Council, we could also expand that format, annotating the members names with short paragraphs detailing their previous career. There's even a Category for it Canadian City Councils. This probably isn't the place to have the discussion... but it could make everyone's lives a lot easier."</p>
<p>We would then *<b>Delete</b> this page and add it to <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaughan_Council_292d.html" title="Vaughan Council">Vaughan_Council</a>.</p>

<li>Hi there. You are free to nominate the other pages if you believe, in good faith, that they should not remain on WP. <i>En bloc</i> nominations have a tendency to produce no clear consensus, since some participants will judge the entries as one while others will make individualized decisions.

Agreed, but some case would have to be made that this is a common or significant pairing in the fandom; after all, every character ever has been paired up with another character in the same (or another) fandom at least a dozen times. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:53, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Information is too cumbersome to work into the article on I-95 itself. A single article with the content is a preferable solution to splitting the content across 15 articles for I-95 in each constituent state.

<li>Actually I think the Quidditch World Cup was only put in the GoF for two reasons: 1. There is no other Quidditch match in GoF thanks to the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triwizard_Tournament_fb0e.html" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, 2. It allows the reappearance of the dark mark, which unites Voldemort with his Deatheaters, in an eerie situation for all to see which inevitably creates a very dramatic scene of chaos. From what I can tell the Quidditch World Cup was equivalent (in length &amp; importance to the story) to that of any other Quidditch game played in the other HP novels. Granted in the HP world it is a very important event, but in the story itself it equates to all other Quidditch events. --<a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJelligraze_4085.html" title="User:Jelligraze">Jelligraze</a> 16:00, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As these papers all function the same way, the only variation between them appears to be their city, circulation, and how much the vendors keep. Those are mere statistics, which can easily be incorporated into the street newspaper article, perhaps in table form.

<dd>Sorry you feel you're being jumped on here, but these things tend to get listed quite quickly.

<li>Wikipedia is not the place to "submit new terminology" ‚Äî <i>ever</i>. We are ‚Äî or try to be ‚Äî an encyclopaedia, and our job is to document existing phenomena, not to advertise new stuff. That's why so many people jumped on it at once. That said, categorising the article as "vanity" was unnecessary: if there are good reasons to delete an article, then they can be raised without the dreaded v-word that often causes offence; if there aren't, then mere suspected "vanity" is not enough cause to delete. By the way, Sarcomical, tea cozies (I note we don't have an article about them; oh, the same!) are designed to keep your teapot warm for longer.

<li><b>Stong keep</b> He's run for election three times, written a bunch of books, created a bunch of websites and founded an unregistered political party. While each of those things on its own may or may not be sufficient for inclusion in Wikipedia, together they certainly are. Is Wikipedia diminshed by including this material? It isn't. Not one bit. Is it diminished by deleting it? Yes, it is. Firstly, there are people, like me an CJCurrie, who are interested in the characters who populate the firnges of the political scene. Wikipedia is exactly the right place for this sort of information because <b>Wikipedia is not paper</b>. Secondly, wha sort of message do we send out by deleting a lengthy article largely written by a fine Wikipedian like CJCurrie just because a few people think that the subejct isn't "notable" enough. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 13:04, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> . I like Ground Zero's summary, it pretty much sums up my thoughts on it. What's really good about the Wikipedia article is that it gathers so many sources into one article. This man has run in pretty much every election happening federally or provincially since around 1992 or so, and if he's now leader of a federal political party, which does occasionally get radio coverage (he's been interviewed), print media mentions, and has been endorsed by two federal politicans (see endorsement page on his site), it warrants an article. The fact that he's going on a rampage to complain about it in this case reinforces the need to keep it (if it wasn't so well sourced that would be another matter), not the need to delete it.

<li>A further comment on notability: I do not believe that one can (i) advertise oneself as the leader of a national political party, (ii) register over 65 ISBN titles and extensively advertise one's books, (iii) campaign for public office three times and (iv) [apparently] oversee a quasi-religious movement, and then (v) claim not to be a public figure.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>MERGE</b> to <i>9/11 Truth Movement</i>. There is little well-argued support for retaining a standalone article. Much of it is "but we have Pokemon articles". Well yes, we do. That doesn't have a great deal to do with <i>this</i> article though, which is largely unrelated to Pokemon. The 'merge to' arguments are well-enough supported, with the supposition that deleters will grumble but live with a merge as a compromise position that I reckon there's a reasonably consensual position on this. That said, a merge is an editorial decision. Fuddlemark's point about right's to express POVs is on the money, by the way. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:42, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Guys, it can be argued that it was non-notable for everyone else, but it is notable for those in the group. Its like saying that the religious festivite of a minor religion is non-notable, only since you never heard of it. I clearly showed that the most prominent people holding that view where present in that event. Notability does not mean whether <i>you</i> care, rather, if the <i>relevant</i> people care.</p>
<p>Is doing <i>"the report of the theorists"</i> not what wikiepdia is about? How can you vote delete for doing what wikipedia is about, <b>reporting</b> points of views?</p>

<li>No, everything that doesn't have enough content that it should be a separate article should be merged there. Salat should not be merged into Islam because there's more than enough content to discuss Salat in great detail on its own page, but still give a general overview of it in its parent page, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. I don't see that there's enough material here that this shouldn't be merged. My reasoning is, if someone wants to get an idea of what the 9/11 Truth Movement is all about, they shouldn't have to run all over the Wiki to find information. If this is worth saying, it's small enough in content that it's worth saying on the 9/11 Truth Movement, rather than putting shards of this topic all over the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 17:48, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A commision with a congresswoman participiated in it is nn and POV? Could you expand on HOW it is POV? I really like it when people say "delete, pov" to a article, without the slightest motivation on HOW it is pov.

<ul>
<li>It's my understanding she was not a Congresswoman at the time... though who can tell? The article has no dates. I do have to agree with Striver that "POV" is a rather weak reason to delete this article, as the article is about a <i>group</i> (and maybe an event? Who can tell?) with a POV, but that does not make the <i>article itself</i> have a POV that cannot be, you know, N'd. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 17:48, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have answered that, why do people keep ignoring the issues that make this relevant, and keep repeating things that DOES not make this relevant? Why dont you delete this sayng "they drank <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a>, that does not make it notable"?</p>
<p>This was the bigges things that happened to the 9/11 movement then, ONLY that makes it notable, even if you ignore that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There where VERY prominent people among the 9/11 truth movement there.</li>
<li>One of them got into congress a few month later.</li>
<li>A decade long Canadian mainstream journalist was present.</li>
<li>Media was there.</li>
<li>Families of the vicitims of 9/11 wherer there.</li>
<li>A world premier of a movie happened.</li>
<li>The whole event was recorded and is still distributed for download.</li>
<li>Notable writers where there</li>

<dd>The red links are there because not every single person is notable, for example the families of victimes are arguebly not notable in themselves.

</ul>
<p><b>Suckage</b> context and source: Conversations with friends, since spring 2003. "I'm going to be up half the night working on this project? It's going to be major suckage," apparent meaning: Suckage takes it's meaning from the extremely common slang word "suck" (v), meaning "to be terrible, horrible, etc." and turns it into a noun, so that everything that "sucks" can now be deemed "suckage". It is to be used in the most informal setting. type of word formation: Another example of affixation: suck + age (n-forming). dictionary entry: suckage, n. Anything that is terrible, unpleasant. [suck + -age] <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.197.45.171 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.197.45.171.html" title="User talk:71.197.45.171">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.197.45.171_b0ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.197.45.171">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>An encyclopedia has entries for all kinds of subjects, even the ones that don't interest you in person. The suckage is a strange community that reaches religious proportions... it is more a culture with ti's own ideals that just an online community.

<p>As a moderator of other BBS's I have seen the "SUCKAGE" in action, Not many people realize the groups origins were founded by Dan Parisi, this is important because it covers many aspects of Dan's biography.. a couple of other of Dan's claims to fame can be found as being the owner of the controversial domains whitehouse.com and madonna.com, the later in which, he was sewed by Madonna the singer for. I can point out MANY different sites on Wikpedia that reference another web site... but how many of them have an actual history&#160;?? Maybe if you let the suckage "GANG" tell the tale of the suckage, you will see the relevance of it. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Phreakwars (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Phreakwars_d222.html" title="Special:Contributions/Phreakwars">contribs</a>).</small> (first edit ever) The term Suckage should stay.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> In Fundamental Baptist circles an organization "should" fall under the authority of a church.

To date, COEBA has started over 20 churches with two more to start in 2006. Notability becomes more apparent when you consider what existed back in 1994. Thoughout the U.S. You could probably count Independent Baptist churches pastored by black men on your two hands. Today they number around 50! Over one third from COEBA activity.

<li>A non-wikipedia member wrote regarding this issue:</li>
</ul>
<p>COEBA stands as the only significant fundamental Baptist effort targeting church planting in black communities. The measurement of this organization's "notability" may be skewed due to a lack of understanding of COEBA's ongoing work. COEBA would be more properly termed a "movement" than an "organization." Its absence of tangible infrastructure renders its success difficult to quantify, particularly by the casual observer. However, closer inspection and polling of those directly affected shed light on this fundamental movement that is nothing short of a phenomenon.</p>
<p>In addition to the more than twenty churches planted, this effort has single-handedly redefined the perception of black Americans in fundamental circles. Of the more than 10,000 fundamental Baptist churches in the United States, significantly fewer than 100 are pastored by black American men. Most fundamental Christians have never served alongside a black person. The great majority of the pastors of those 10,000 churches have been acquainted with COEBA on some level. This has led to an unprecedented effort to understand, accept and evangelize black people either directly or indirectly through the ministry of these churches. COEBA has done more to raise awareness of the need and potential than all other efforts combined.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1990's, COEBA was a rare and dominant church planting voice in fundamentalism, thereby helping to spark a revival of church planting emphasis in many circles, irrespective of race. In the movement's brief twelve-year history it remains the unrivaled source of counsel, inspiration and hope for pastors, laymen and Christian workers with issues regarding fundamentalism and the black community. There simply is no other cause that holds the position that COEBA has in fundamental circles. More than 300 churches support this effort verbally and through financial contribution. A majority of fundamental Bible colleges and organizations stand firm in endorsement. With nearly five million missions dollars given through the ministries of COEBA churches, COEBA has proven that its foremost commitment remains that of world evangelism.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important facet of this movement is its training of the next generation of Christians, i.e., children in churches across the country. These youth possess great talent and skill and are leaders among their peers. Should the Lord tarry, they will grow into America's first measurable generation of fundamental black Christians.</p>
<p>COEBA's regional and national gatherings have consistently drawn representatives from hundreds of churches, Bible colleges and Christian organizations. Its most effective work, however, is through grass roots influence, counsel, education, encouragement and peer-to-peer contact. The impact of the COEBA movement vis-a-vis fundamental circles is an ever-evolving force that is changing the face of fundamentalism.</p>
<p>It takes time, and, perhaps, a generation to change the psyche produced by decades of missteps regarding Black America. Still, there are many on the bandwagon. Here is what several prominent fundamental leaders have said about COEBA: (the quotes below are copied from a 1999 COEBA magazine)</p>
<p>"COEBA, the vision of Lou Baldwin, a preacher of the gospel, draws my admiration and attention because it applies Bible remedies to the sinful human hearts of Bible-starved souls..." <b>Bob Jones III</b> - President, Bob Jones University</p>
<p>"I thank the Lord for the COEBA movement with the great objective of soul winning and the building of churches... This organization is doing a work that is much needed." <b>Dr. Lee Roberson</b> - Chancellor, Tennessee Temple University</p>
<p>"New Testament curches are the salt and light America needs. Praise God for Pastor Lou Baldwin and COEBA -- a gift from God to Black America." <b>Dr. Sam Davison</b> - Pastor, Southwest Baptist Church</p>
<p>"Pastors across America should thank God for raising men like Dr. Lou Baldwin ... It is my prayer that through COEBA many thousands of lives will be influenced as we move into the 21st century." <b>Dr. Paul Chappell</b> - Pastor, Lancaster Baptist Church - President, West Coast Baptist College</p>
<p>"COEBA is on of the greatest biblical missionary movements of this generation." <b>Dr. Don Sisk</b> - President/General Director, Baptist International Missions, Inc.</p>
<p>"This is a movement that has the hand of God upon it. The Lord has provided visionary leadership through Dr. Lou Baldwin to reach so many millions with the gospel." <b>Dr. Clarence Sexton</b> - Pastor, Temple Baptist Church - President, Crown College</p>

<li>Well, there are a <i>lot</i> more Muslims than 9/11 conspiracy theorists. That's why an Islamic concept such as <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fard.html" title="Fard">Fard</a> can be of significance to a great number of people, even non-Muslims. Problem Reaction Solution, on the other hand, seems to be a neologism used only within a small circle of persons with no discernible impact on the broader discourse (on 9/11 or anything else). See <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> (or maybe, considering the seriousness of all this, rather <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>&#160;:-).

<li>Well, even then it warrants at the most a well-sourced <i>brief</i> mention in the main 9-11 conspiracy theories article, and not its own article. Even so, what you call the "9-11 truth movement" is objectively the viewpoint of a small fringe minority (and for most others it's somewhere between paranoid silliness and downright offensive). All those articles of yours might be seen as being designed to give this fringe more weight than they are due - or, in other words, as POV-pushing.

<p>This is not a 9/11 neologism, it was <b>used prominently already in 1999</b>.</p>

<li><s><b>Reluctant keep.</b> Striver's often divisive and inflammatory, and openly admits that his views are waaay outside the norm. I think it's because of these things that this article is getting deep-sixed. This term has been used in news sources, and is in use all over the web. Yes, often in tinfoil-hat-style conspiracy diatribes. But it's in use. (Striver's also right about <a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass_worship.html" title="Ass worship">ass worship</a> -- wtf is that about?) This also seems a lot like an extension of the "Rally 'Round the Flag" effect, which seems to be the academically accepted version of this same concept (i.e., no shady government conspiracies, lizard men, Illuminati, space Nazis, etc.). If that article had been written, I'd suggest merging this content over there. In fact, as it stands, if this article survives (doesn't look promising), I'll probably move it to Rally 'round the flag and rewrite it... muahhahhahahahaha. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 18:41, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</s> Ehh, nevermind.

<dd>You are right, I do have an agenda: make Wikipedia a reliable source of information.

<li><b>Keep</b> ... unfortunately. Basically like everyone else said. Yes, it's conspiracy-cruft, but it's referenced enough: the term is widely used enough that we should have an article on it. And we can't just redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thesis%2C_antithesis%2C_synthesis.html" title="Thesis, antithesis, synthesis">Thesis, antithesis, synthesis</a> because Hegel used TAS to mean many things, while PRS its really only used to mean "conspiracy"; the meaning is related, but not the same. However, I would be much in favor of shortening the article by quite a lot. It should be something like three paragraphs long: one paragraph defining the term, and referring to Hegel, one paragraph about the term's creationg by Icke, and one list of references, one line per reference, not one paragraph per reference. If the thing is kept, and no one else will do it, I can do that. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 14:41, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Striver, please, you could at least try to make it a halfway decent article. As it stands, it's spectacularly bad. Personally, I think that we absolutely don't need it and should put all the "please improve me" templates we have on top of it. But unfortunately, I see no reason to delete it after the update. I'm tempted to abstain from my vote, but I guess that would be too much of a cop-out... Striver, I think you should cut the article in half at the very least, and try to layout it in a way that doesn't hurt my head. Please note that I don't have an agenda beyond keeping crappy articles out of Wikipedia as far as possible. I don't care about your conspiracy theories, as long as you clearly label them as such and keep them to a maximum of a few sentences here and there. That's about all consensus will give you, so don't fight it. You are entitled to an opinion, but NOT to valuable space in articles that should cover views that are way, way more subsantiated than yours.<a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMstroeck_3315.html" title="User:Mstroeck">Mstroeck</a> 21:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Seems to be vanity? Paul J Moss is not notable as far as I can tell. Googling turned up only a few bizarre hits:&#160;:<a href="http://www.astronomy.net.nz/frame19.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.astronomy.net.nz/frame19.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astronomy.net.nz/frame19.htm</a> (Scroll down that particular page!)

<dd>'Googling' turns up 6 million on some days and 12 million on others. The subject has been in #1 response for 5 out of 6 years, and many of the top 10 for many of those years. FACT. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 10:21, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>removed my single vote. If discussion doesn't take place here then how can the voting be valid, almost nil discussion took place elsewhere, and the cut and pasters have ripped this page apart so many times, it doesn't make sense, it's not the truth, it has serious ommisions, and it certainly doesnt have any balance. The history of this page shows blatant ignorance of the facts, superficiality on a broad scale, meanspiritedness that I knew existed but found hard to believe every other time I encountered it. The philosphy here is said to be construction, so if the article doesn't fit the rules, why not alter it, build a new one, get the known facts, be vigilant against how things appear on the surface, be all that a wikipedian can be. I have witnessed crowd behaviour here, emotion and assumption, hardly any reality, its a good learning zone about ourselves, at least I contributed to exposing that aspect to the clear minded. moza <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 10:17, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - owning a few domain names, sticking your name in a huge font on a couple of websites to fool google and taking a few pictures of the sky isn't really a big mark of notability, however worthwhile the last occupation is. It's a vanity article too - if it weren't for a humungous amount of edits by the article's subject, the article wouldn't exist.

!!! KEEP !!! Paul has some amazing photo's that have been recognised internationally, and the sharing of pictures between sites is mutual.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Being a candidate does ot amount to notablility. However, incumbant people do a lot of work, which if notable, should be documented. Stress is on the notability of the work done by them. Candidates can't do much with respect to notability in being a candidate unless they are engaged in some historic battle, which does require notability out of candidature. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.saxena_5aa8.html" title="User:Ambuj.saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.saxena_92b0.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.saxena">talk</a>) 07:25, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I just wanted to bring to everyone‚Äôs attention that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Greer_3d7b.html" title="John Greer">John Greer</a> a candidate for councillor in Toronto posted his own article in Jan. (which he admitted in the talk page). Soon after he posted it someone put it up for deletion. Even though he posted it himself the article won the debate to stay an article since he is a current candidate for councillor in the 2006 municipal election. With all do respect to Greer he really has not accomplished enough in the past to be an article and is pretty non-notable. His won the debate to stay so shouldn‚Äôt Ruffolo‚Äôs also? --Eyeonvaughan 09:01, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It hasn't won any debate ‚Äî there hasn't <i>been</i> one.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> The sport exists, and is popular in Germany, where it's known as Radball. Players use special bikes with U-shaped bars which they hold like sticks.

The problem with merging would be that the section would get unmaneagable and long and would detract from other useful information.

<li><b>Move</b> to templatespace. Set it up the way the main DYK is... the template contains the current tidbits and the template talk has an archive of all the previously displayed tidbits. A few trivia facts at a time are nice but the whole list may not be necessary in articlespace.

<dd>Yes. That template's talk page is empty though, unlike the main DYK template which has the stash of previously used and not yet used factlets. (or trivions, if you prefer, it's a <a href="../../../u/o/m/UOM_bb89.html" title="UOM">UOM</a> thing I guess)... Move these facts there, and then use the template in the portal in the main article too.

<dd>I agree with Lar. They should be driven by the the same information. The original idea was a template with the template talk pertaining the unused facts (as the wiki DYK) but it was changed for simplicity for users. The portal is a work in progress so please bear with me on the &lt;div&gt;. Also if it is to be kept it should be in the style of the wiki main page since it's an accepted style and it was the form from which it was conceived. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelr31_1d76.html" title="User:Joelr31">Joelito</a> 03:00, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Every one of these facts <b>already IS</b> in the encyclopedia though, and the links in the DYK tidbits show you where, this DYK is just a different way to get connected. As a surfer (I hit random articles for fun, for the discovery of what I might find...), I like to find interesting things that I didn't know were connected. Moving the facts to the specific articles reduces the serendipity effect by burying them where they're harder to find. They're all relevant to Puerto Rico, after all. Unless you're saying you think the DYK concept as a whole is flawed? I admit a POV there, I'm 6 for 6 on articles I initially created that were nominated for DYK being selected for the main page so I obviously like DYK. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:19, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>No</b>, we shouldn't create similar articles for <b>every</b> main article. That sort of feels like a strawdog to me... Please review my input to consensus (I hate calling it a "vote") above... I said <i>move it to templatespace</i> and make it be one unified template that is used both on the portal and the main article, with keep as a second choice. But I'd say that any subject big enough to have a portal may well be deserving of a DYK if the portal editors want to make one. They're adding valuable content and links.

If the consensus comes out delete though, now the previous DYK at the portal would be deleted I think as they're being merged... that would be a bad outcome. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 04:19, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I do not understand why the article is on this list in first place. Articles of the same category but for other different countries should be made as well. WP is not a random collection of information, but it is made to inform people about topics. That's wikipedia's essential function. Well, actually, if you think about it, wikipedia sort of is a random collection of information actually, since we cover everything from disasters to Miss Universe, from Religion and art to boxing, from Medicine to poverty....<i><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonioMartin_6aa4.html" title="User:AntonioMartin">Antonio Hyperactive Child Martin</a></i> 09:25, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although this article is quite different from most of wikipedia I belive it's to long to merge with <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and also consider that it contains to much valuable information as to simply delete it.

<li>This article is definitely too long to merge with <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, but the information is too varied to turn to prose.

<dd>Only one of those pages is at all relevant to this article, since most are within the WP namespace. If anything, the meaning of <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> is that article space pages should not link to Wikipedia space internal pages. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_Wikipedia_565c.html" title="Criticisms of Wikipedia">Criticisms of Wikipedia</a> is roughly on topic, maybe I'll add a "see also". <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:41, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>He's right, irrelevant. Your suggestions indicate that your (unspecified) NPOV claim is based on a fear that these articles are being used as examples to discredit Wikipedia. While this is not happening in the article, it is happening widely in the press.</dd>
<dd>You have the relationship backwards. It is How Wikipedia effects public opinion, not the public opinion of Wikipedia.<a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeago_6121.html" title="User:Yeago">Yeago</a> 22:48, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As the article exists, I can certainly see the motivation for the merge sentiment: it's mostly roughly things where the mass media was critical of WP. However, I've changed the intro a little bit to allow expansion to a topic more fitting to the title. Ideally, I'd like the article to include areas where WP affects public opinion, but not simply as a criticism of WP (not necessarily <i>praise</i> as such either, but more subtle external mentions of WP's effects, especially in how people understand authority and knowledge). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 22:46, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Yeago comments, the idea of the article isn't "What does the public think of WP?" Rather it is "How does WP influence public opinion on other topics". See the comment I just added to the article talk page for more clarification. It's sort of like an article on Conservative think tanks and public opinion... presumably it wouldn't be about "What do people think of the think tanks". <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 02:14, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tagged for speedy as pointless, unreferenced, unwikified, unconverted, unnecessary list - all of which are valid, and I'll add that it's also completely arbitrary and contains systemic bias, since no Sumos are listed.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I rarely vote to delete lists, and contrary to others I don't think lists that may be infinite or of an not knowable quantity, but this lacks any bearing as to time or relevance.

<dd>Here is an example for you Zoe. Here is the deletion page for "Culture defines politics" which they decided to make an external link: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Culture_defines_politics_c4e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Culture defines politics">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Culture_defines_politics</a>. This is the article which I discovered recently that they were trying to "wash". I created it but ****they**** deleted as "orignial research" but later on the hypocrites liked it so much that they were attempting to steal it!!!! Just like this article and the article on Revolution within the form, they will delete as "original research" and then, sometime in the future they will steal it. Or if someone else writes it, they will accept it. Me, they just hate. I could write an article on "Why the Sky is Blue" and they will delete it. See, I have a higher standard than anybody else around here, I should be proud of it, All work done by me will be deleted, nothing will satisfy them. They also deleted the Classical definition of republic as "original research". There was a comment recently posted about that <a href="../../../r/e/p/Talk%7ERepublic_9ee2.html#Article_is_still_horrible" title="Talk:Republic">Talk:Republic#Article_is_still_horrible</a>. I think it speaks volumes about what goes on around here. Wikipedia is a popularity and ideological contest. If you don't fit in, and meet their approval---you get harrassed and your stuff gets deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>The subject of the article is NOT original research. I quote from a published Classicist!!! He is actually responding in his quotes to earlier opinions. He proves the contention that Sparta got most of her stuff from Crete. I have of course made other deductions of value. You are free to delete those. I prefer an external link though because this of my learning in the subject area, I provide more evidence. Second, This article does fill a hole in the learning of the matrix of Dorian culture and Greek culture. This is nowhere on Wikipedia. This article is to fill a niche that you can not provide. An external link to this article is necessary and right. This article is necessary to understand What Socrates and Plato said.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 23:21, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The difference between the two is that your essay, interesting though it is (and surprisingly, a few of my IRL friends who are also greek have expressed similar sentiments), comes to conclusions of its own, while things like Kwisatz Haderach (personally I find it odd we even have articles on characters) are more of a descriptive thing. I don't think anyone here is saying that your writing is bad, it just isn't suitable for the kind of project Wikipedia is. You can be proud to have a well-argued, well-researched perspective, and if I were you I'd certainly make it available to the world somewhere, I just don't think here is the place.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have removed the original research part of this article, which was normative rather than descriptive. What remains is a discussion of a concept named by Garet Garrett and its historical antecedents. I am not sure this is notable enough to be encyclopedic, but it is no longer the original-research essay that it was previously. I would tend to think it is <i>not</i> notable -- the phrase only comes up twice each in books.google.com and scholar.google.com and 291 times in general Google search -- but perhaps it is important enough to parts of the Old Right to be worth mentioning. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 15:03, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks Macrakis. And you are also right in "...it is important enough to parts of the Old Right to be worth mentioning." Thanks for your work and for pointing out that this info is also important to a small minority of people---maybe not for the General Public---but for the few remaining out here, Thanks.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 00:12, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> The phrase and its meaning might merit a mention in the article on Garrett, but it doesn't seem to be a term used by many other than him. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 00:41, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. While Macrakis' edits have done much to make the article less POV, the article is essentially about a relatively uncommon neologism. At best, perhaps some mention of the term could be made in the Garrett article and the term redirected there. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ‚â† <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 02:08, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This concept seems to have a pretty small following in the world at large.

The article might be useful as a short description of how these scholars are collected under one banner, and a description of that would be useful as a link from the individual biographies as well as from the generic article. In any case, detailed recountings of their research seem to be more germane to the biographical articles since, as I noted before, they don't seem to have done much as a group besides collect the member's disparate work onto one site. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 01:16, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I started this page as a way to get the facts into wikipedia.I DISPUTE TKAT THIS PAGE AS IT STANDS IS <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>. Since this page deals with the policies and actions of politicians with a certain philosophy ,namely,the most contentious issue in our country today,why not tell it like it is.As long as we stick to the facts and don't call it like we see it,then how can it be a certain point of view?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The politicians who work to subvert the Constitution are not ashamed of their actions,why should I and you,not chronicle them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you go to the page on Diane Feinstein and the talk page you will find that it would take about 6 paragraphs to accurately list her furtherance of gun control.tHAT WOULD PRODUCE A WILDLY LOPSIDED ARTICLE that would look POV,but this page is about the efforts of the Anti-Gun Politicians to remove guns from the hands of civilians.Wheather you think the result of that course of action would result in a safer country or a bloodbath of disarmed citizens,is your point of view.I have not inserted any point of view,or conversely,in the over view,I have presented both sides.(Safety vs.power)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally,I AM offended.You can help edit this page and help keep it from becoming POV,but if you delete this page YOU guys are going to look to a bunch of people like some gun-control epithets.Try sticking to the facts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Matter of fact,I an really offended.If I type the fact that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,do have to include the fact that Islam doesn't agree with that fact,to meet the standard of NPOV/POV?</dd>

<li>Your remarks about 'this country' are quite mysterious. There's nothing in the constitution of this country about it. But, yes, a page can be NPOV merely by listing facts. The reasons for this page being POV are that it covers only one side of the debate, and refers to them in terms which may not be entirely acceptable (would everyone on the list accept the title of "Anti-Gun politician"?). And no, you can't just put that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. You can say he is accepted as the Son of God by the Christian religion, and that's OK. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 21:14, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Irredeemably POV per nom. The people on the list do not fit the definition given: "An anti-gun politician is a politician that believes that civilians do not need and should not own,carry,or use guns." They might believe in restricting guns to a much greater extent than many people would like, but not to the extent of the definition or the title of the page. The summary of the differences of opinion about the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_0bb9.html" title="Second Amendment to the United States Constitution">Second Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> is POV.

<li>It looks like it's unanimous.I'll comment on some of the points raised,and talk a bit more and then I think I'm about done replying to this.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it appears,as you say, that I have a pro gun control stance,then I must be masking my pro freedom stance quite well and staying NPOV.</p>
<p>List is encyclopedic.There would be more names added to the list.This is just a start.</p>
<p>I don't see anything 'mysterious about my comments .And the words were:our country,not:this country.Yes,there is something in the (Constitution is spelled with a capital C,when referring to the U.S.Constitution) about it.It is called the Second Amendment.The page isn't a debate,it is about politicians with a certain agenda.Who cares what title they would accept?They earn the title when they try to subvert the Constitution and they violate their oath of office.</p>
<p>Granted gun control beliefs come in varying degrees of extremism,just as I have seen in progun stances.I disagree that the summary of the summary of differences are POV.The assertions are all true and the citations are in the internet to be found,as the page expands.haha.I deleted the one citation i posted,the only one I could find that showed the picture of Diane with the AK.</p>
<p>Hi Jersey.I was not being uncivil to anyone,on the Ted talk page,I was expressing my opinion that Ted is a piece of crap.I think Adolph Hitler was piece of crap,too.Idon't have to be seen as a NPOV contributor,that rule is restricted to my article.You should not judge this page by MY point of view expressed on talk.I'm a nice guy,and darn it,people like me.</p>
<p>I don't know.Our country is one of a handful of countrys where the people still have guns.It isn't hard to 'get it'that this about the U.S.</p>
<p>As soon as someone changes his stand,he can be deleted from the list.It's called editing.You're really stretching for that one.</p>
<p>Anti-gun is,once again,a fact,Would 'gun safety advocate' be more appealing?</p>
<p>Once more time.If a page contains a statement that Senator Feinstein is a socialist sow that seeks to subvert the Bill Of Rights,Violates her oath of office,and wipes her butt on the U.S. Constitution,then I have made a POV statement.I have been as NPOV as the facts can allow.</p>

<li>I understand many people on opposing sides of the issue have strong beliefs about it. But again, while the people on your list may believe in gun control or restricting gun rights (or whatever is the most neutral way of putting it), they don't fit your definition: "An anti-gun politician is a politician that believes that civilians do not need and should not own,carry,or use guns." And picking on someone for not capitalizing a letter is like picking on someone for failing to place an end quote, using sentence fragments, or not putting spaces after punctuation. In an article it would matter, but on a talk page, not so much. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 20:45, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but needs work, possible rename. It's notable that some politicians are strongly pro-gun-control, and also that some are strongly anit-gun-control. The existing article is not sufficiently encyclopedic and neutral. I would prefer that it be rewritten from scratch with more NPOV and possibly <b>rename</b> to <b>Politicians favoring Gun Control</b> to enhance neutrality. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 21:48, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Don't see how any change to this could make it NPOV. The list is based on the premise that all politicians who in any way differ from the poster's views on guns should be grouped together. We have (according to the article as written) a politician who believes private citizens should not have guns at all, and one who says there should be some qualifications required for concealed carry. In this poster's POV, it seems, these are the same. Unsuitable for WP. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 03:08, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please separate the author/editor's POV and the article. If the editor who created it can't find his way to neutral POV then someone else can do the edits, but there's a difference between "the article can't be NPOV" and "this editor can't be NPOV". The breadth of the brush used is a POV issue, yes, but is repairable (along with the rest). It may be easier to nuke from orbit and rebuild elsewhere, but that may not be the best way forwards. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:21, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The list probably is (necessarily) POV, and in most cases, we shouldn't delete POV, just *edit* it; but here it's beyond hope: How can we tell who should and shouldn't be on the list? Moreover, it is ambiguous: "anti-gun"? are we talking pro-gun control or are we talking pacifist here, or are we saying people who think that certain people shouldn't have guns at certain times?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it's a useful stub, and I think it could be fleshed out into a better article. Even as a stub, the article says that it was published on April 20, that 2004 was their first annual such list, and the article describes how the names were arranged. ‚Äì <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 22:58, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is no copyvio here, as there is no list! While the article is currently a stub and cannot ever be as thorough as it should be sans copyright law, I'm willing to trust that it could turn into something rather useful. Quadell is quite correct that, even as it stands right now, it accurately describes what the list is and how the names are arranged. This is of at least <i>some</i> use. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>¬∑<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 16:56, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a useful referrent point for other articles that might be about people on the list. Stubs can grow, that being a prime Wikipedia mechanism. The article is certainly about a more notable topic than 90 percent of the lists that proliferate around here. If you feel the article is PoV, then don't delete it, edit it to make it neutral PoV, that is the Wikipedia way. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 18:38, 26 February 2006 (UTC) (see also endorsement of user Volatile's vote)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I believe the article is still useful (provides something to link to when mentioned in articles about those recognized by the list). Provided that the stub gets cleaned up a bit, the stub should remain. I'm not familiar with this list, but if Time publishes it on a yearly basis, wouldn't it be more appropriate to have a general article "TIME Magazine's 100 Most Influential People" and have all descendent lists (...of 2003, ...of 2004, ...of 2005,etc.) redirect there? <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVolatile_6023.html" title="User:Volatile">Volatile</a> 20:32, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am the article's author. This is the first wiki entry I've created. I see that it was originally tagged for speedy deletion because it is considered neologism. Is there a wiki criteria for what is considered neologism? I certainly was not the person that coined the term "Returnee" or "Hong Kong Returnee", but I concede it is a relatively new term. Also, I only created the entry several hours ago. I know it is short, but I plan on expanding it in the next few days during my free time. Any advice on how I can take this entry out of AFD status would be much appreciated. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 23:48, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> The text presented is integral to the understanding of the AYBABTU phenomenon but also is relevant to the <i><a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Wing_59e8.html" title="Zero Wing">Zero Wing</a></i> game page as well, which is in large part why it was made a separate page and not a subpage of AYBABTU. (Also, it was my understanding that subpages were discouraged.) The text was originally found in the AYBABTU article as mentioned above and existed peacefully without complaint for months or even years. Removal of this page would be hugely detrimental to the AYBABTU page and would completely defeat the purpose of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> laws.

<ul>
<li>Establish why the copyright hasn't been diluted due to clear lack of enforcement and widespread use.</li>
<li>Establish the identity of the copyright owner since the company is apparently dead. (If you don't know who owns the copyright, how do you know there is even a valid copyright? How do we know the copyright didn't lapse into public domain?)</li>
<li>Establish why this isn't simply fair use since the entire text of that opening statement is necessary to understand the phenomenon.</li>
<li>Establish why the concept of fair use of a copyrighted work somehow gets blown out of proportion in this case because the game didn't contain much text. If the game contained only three words, would it therefore be not fair use to repeat the three words since they compromise 100% of the words in the game? Of the entire copyrightable mass in the game, the text likely compromises a tiny percentage of the entire work.</li>

<dd>By the way, the comparison of this text to a song lyric is invalid. Lyrics are an integral part of the song. Without the lyric, the song's character changes fundamentally. This text does not bear the same kind of relationship to the whole copyrighted work as a lyric does to a song.</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep;</b> Apparently not a copyright violation; on all of the Internet, there are sites that contain this text. I'm talking about Flash movies, HTML pages, Quicktime movies, the lot. All of these movies show both the text and also the images from this game. The publishers, Naxat Soft and SEGA, have never, not once, attempted to enforce their copyright (if it is indeed their copyright; it could have been Toaplan's, and they are no longer in existence; there is no certainty about this at all). It would appear that there is no need to consider this for deletion, as it seems that the copyright holders of this material don't seem to mind fair use of their material. On a sidenote, certain important prerequisites for mentioning that this a copyright violation haven't been adhered to; like Nova SS mentioned, people don't seem to realize the extreme widespread use of this text, and its important in understanding the All Your Base Are Belong To Us phenomenon. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichiel_Sikma_a1b1.html" title="User:Michiel Sikma">Michiel Sikma</a> 06:56, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Erm, all those other websites using it are probably infringing on Sega and Naxat Soft's copyright too. And as I said, a few select quotes in the main article are indeed covered by fair use.

<dd>"They aren't pursuing their copyright, so let's infringe upon it" seems to me to be a pretty scary line of reasoning.

<li>The point here isn't the fact that "those other websites are also infringing copyright", the matter is that the copyright of this phenomenon has been ignored for so long, along with it gaining such widespread recognition, that it's become almost unenforcable and absolutely imperative to know the full text in order to understand the magnitude of its following. Although I do think that the Zero Wing translations article should be merged with <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a>, it's to be understood that there is no way that this text is not <b>fair use</b>.

<li>Please explain how fair use doesn't apply here. Having taught Internet law and fair use in workshops for many years, I'd truly like to hear your take on this.

Unless you can demonstrate a valid, current copyright and explain how a few lines taken from countless thousands doesn't meet fair use guidelines, I really don't think you have a case. <b>‚áí <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrossow_9951.html" title="User talk:Brossow">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brossow_c69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brossow">C</a></sub> 20:44, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm an anonymous user so feel free to disregard my opinion, but isn't the point not the fact that the sites that have the Zero Wing text are infringing copyright as well, but that whoever the copyright holder is doesn't seem to mind or enforce their copyright? I'd be in favor of a <b>keep</b>. --213.84.233.132 10:47, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> until and unless the copyright holder (whoever it may be) asks us to take it down. The text is necessary to understand the phenomenon, it's not long, the copyright holder doesn't seem to care, and replacing it with links to other sites is an unnecessary hoop for readers to jump through. <a href="../../../t/u/a/User%7ETualha_bd83.html" title="User:Tualha">Tualha</a> (<a href="../../../t/u/a/User_talk%7ETualha_df7e.html" title="User talk:Tualha">Talk</a>) 13:53, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Almost certainly fair use. Opening sequence is a very small part of the video game, but is important to understand "All your base" phenom and its origins. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesteve_4de4.html" title="User:Thesteve"><font style="background: darkblue;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">&#160;T</font><font style="background: #0000AA;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">h</font><font style="background: #0000CD;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">e&#160;</font><font style="background: blue;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">St</font><font style="background: royalblue;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">ev</font><font style="background: #6666FF;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">e&#160;</font></a> 22:33, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As TheSteve said above, the value of the entry in understanding the "AYB" phenom is the most important consideration. The text quoted is but a tiny part of the overall work.

A standalone article makes no sense, there is no context. The <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Wing_59e8.html" title="Zero Wing">Zero Wing</a> article already links to the All your base page, so there's no particular need for breaking it out as a standalone article. The 73 words of dialog quoted are a small fraction of the overall content of the original video game, well within fair use guidelines for quoting textual material. As others have pointed out, in all these years no copyright complaints were ever undertaken by the copyright holder even against the makers of the Flash animation or websites distributing it, and the Flash animation made extensive use of images as well as dialog. We have a strong presumption of fair use; if the copyright holder should one day change its mind about fair use, then there is always <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_immediate_removal_of_copyright_violation_2e67.html" title="Wikipedia:Request for immediate removal of copyright violation">Wikipedia:Request for immediate removal of copyright violation</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:13, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Definitely a hoax. Both pages appear to be pretty much fan-wishes for a revitilization of the series. The actors that are listed also make no sense, as if this were to be produced by Disney. They would not use actors from series on a Viacom (Noggin [Degrassi and Radio Free Roscoe]) or a Warner Bros (The WB [Smallville]) network.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry, but after searching IMDB, Animorphs, Toon Disney, and other sites that would have mentioned the series, I believe that it should be deleted since the author(s) have not shown us any evidence of credible sources for the Toon Disney series.

<p><b>Delete</b>. The article claims to be about "Plone Sprints", but really discusses "code sprints" in general -- the fact that one particular open source project (Plone) happens to use sprints is not worthy of an entire WP article by itself. I think it would be better to delete the article on Plone Sprints, and merge any information it contains into the existing article on <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_sprint.html" title="Code sprint">code sprints</a>. I can't see anything much in <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plone_Sprints_88f8.html" title="Plone Sprints">Plone Sprints</a> that is not already in <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_sprint.html" title="Code sprint">code sprint</a>, however. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilc_4027.html" title="User:Neilc">Neilc</a> 22:57, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Crystalballish, I guess. An article about something that never existed? And no references.

<li><b>Comment</b> Even though treatments for stories (not <i>episodes</i>) were written by erstwhile script editor Andrew Cartmel, <i>et al</i>, this is non-canonical.

<li><b>Comment</b> This article actually has some historical merit to it as an idea, but the implementation, sad to say, is amateurish. I actually do have references and sources to produce a proper article, just that I need to find the time and the anti-inertial energy to do it. Please feel free to <b>Delete</b> it if nothing happens within the requisite period, but just note that it may be recreated at some point after that in a hopefully improved form. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 09:49, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
