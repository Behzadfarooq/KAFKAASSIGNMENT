<li>I agree that he has made valued contributions; but on the other hand, so have millions of other people. I've done and raised a huge lot for the communities I've been in, supported by bundles of sporting and musical achievement; but I don't feel it's <i>encyclopedia</i> material. By all means, it's User Page material, but the work he has done, while useful, doesn't yet reach beyond that home town. Every single cadet team was set up by someone. I feel the wording there is a little harsh, but it's the point I'm trying to make. Eventually, I'll set up my own user page properly with a bio of sorts, but it'll be a user page rather than an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">Firien</a> 17:06, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The site is meant to include information to help and advise people from all over, one does not have to have an OBE or Knighthood. Rowan Cole is a topic that has been researched and to delete this topic would deprive the hundreds on British Police Cadets whom wish to learn about the origins of its creation. Perhaps all that is needed is a rewording of the article!!!! In Britain history is very important and one of the things any cadet learns is their institutions history. Don't delete without thinking.<small>unsigned comment made by anon<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.3.32.9.html" title="User:80.3.32.9">User:80.3.32.9</a>.

<li><b>KEEP</b> This article should be kept because this scheme that was created was the first of its kind. This means that to delete it would be depriving people of knowledge which is true. If we were to delete this we should ask ourselves why a lot of other articles are on this site. This artilce is extremely relevant because it is a scheme which has benefitted the public by people who are of my age. Teenagers today do not have an excellent image. It is nice to see that young adults or teenagers are trying to eliminate the "yobbish" image which a majority of the public hold today thanks to the media. Well done Rowan for a smashing scheme. I would also like to remind you that Rowan had won a "High Sheriff Of Surrey Award" For his contribution. The "High Sheriff Of Surrey Award" is one of the most prestigous awards to be one. I leave you with this one question. How many other people do you know that hold an award like that? We must remember that Rowan's contribution to the public is nationally recognised. Therefore because of it must be recognised on Wikipedia. <small>unsigned vote from <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.202.180.114.html" title="User:172.202.180.114">172.202.180.114</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.202.180.114_9ab4.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.202.180.114">contribs</a>) <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 20:17, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Honestly, some of the above votes are a bit hyperbolic. "The ability of modern democracy to prevail?" If the new cadet model is so great and emulatable, why don't you write about it in a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Police_Cadets_c0ea.html" title="British Police Cadets">British Police Cadets</a> article? You can tell us all about the differences between the different cadet programs, and communities *around the world* would benefit from your service to humanity. Maybe if you set a sufficient context regarding the cadet system, voters will realize how truly important and notable Mr. Rowan's actions were. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 20:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Firstly why dont we link this article to that and secondly one is not qualified to comment on other forces when one is only fimilar with Surrey. <small>remark from <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.3.32.9.html" title="User:80.3.32.9">80.3.32.9</a> (<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.3.32.9.html" title="User talk:80.3.32.9">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.3.32.9_936b.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.3.32.9">contribs</a>)</small>

<li>Maybe if you were more familiar with Surrey you would realize that it has "one of the lowest crime rates in the country" <a href="http://www.surrey.police.uk/Youth/about.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.surrey.police.uk/Youth/about.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and so the job of the police cadets there isn't that hard.

<li>How dare you make that arrogant comment, perhaps it is because the Police and others working so hard that crime is low. You arrogant . ... remove that comment at once, you obviously have no idea what your talking about. As for the article it should stay. <small>remark from <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.3.32.9.html" title="User:80.3.32.9">80.3.32.9</a> (<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.3.32.9.html" title="User talk:80.3.32.9">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.3.32.9_936b.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.3.32.9">contribs</a>)</small></li>
<li>Yeah... no offense to MPS but that was a tad demeaning. But as to 80.3.32.9, please note <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EImportance_ffbd.html" title="WP:Importance">WP:Importance</a> item 5. I don't think that person has enough reach as of yet to qualify for his own article. Frankly, most 17 year-olds, never mind everyone else, haven't really had enough time to establish notability worthy of an Encyclopedia article. The awards listed also seem kind of generic in the sense that a lot of people have similar awards and there is nothing really to distinguish this person from the rest of society in general. There are a lot of unsung heroes out there that save cats from trees or volunteer their time to the community but that doesn't qualify an article for them. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 03:06, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A quick skim through the history file shows that there are a set of IPs (<a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">172.202.180.114</a>, <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.3.32.9.html" title="User:80.3.32.9">User:80.3.32.9</a>, <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.171.198.5.html" title="User:62.171.198.5">User:62.171.198.5</a>) and one registered user (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trust2005_a0a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trust2005">Trust2005</a>) which are providing 'all' the keep votes. Their contribution history shows that other than the first, all have been involved in editing the Rowan_Cole article, and the first itself has only made contributions to this votes page as of time of posting. While the "High Sheriff of Surrey Award" sounds impressive, and does justify the question as above "how many other people do you know that hold an award like that?" it still begs the question of what the award actually means? I can happily claim that I have Sterling Achievement Awards in the Field of Excellence, but by not providing any further information on any such award it becomes a shell. I would be happy to see a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Police_Cadets_c0ea.html" title="British Police Cadets">British Police Cadets</a> article, especially if it contained information on how to set up something similar, or gave something more informative about the <i>Cadets</i> rather than what we see at the moment; if the item is notable or significantly informative, then that provides a base for relevant information about Rowan Cole. However before that article has substance the Rowan Cole article remains a vanity page.</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - You cannot delete this page. This page has only been on Wikipedia for a few months, and it would stupid to delete it already. The whole point of Wikipedia should be to have as much infomation as possible. In addition, Rowan Cole has done great deals for the community in Surrey and his Cadet Force has set an example for others across the UK. He has also recieved far more awards than most people do in their lifetime, and he deserves to be recognised. Wikipedia is not 'Who's Who', it is not meant to list only the rich, famous and those with MBEs after their names!! Deleting Rowan Cole's article would be like deleting the work of the little man!! acswanman</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - and adding info about him to as many other Wikipedia pages as possible, as at least one person seems to be doing, is not a good way to establish notability. <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk</a> 11:13, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> the sockpuppets continue to add nnanity to <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazel_Blears_f7b6.html" title="Hazel Blears">Hazel Blears</a> in an attempt to give the Rowan Cole page some links-from. Reversion wars are boring.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> vanity. As an aside I note that the IP who has been adding this to <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazel_Blears_f7b6.html" title="Hazel Blears">Hazel Blears</a> has also vandalised my userpage a couple of times today. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 13:21, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Morwen is being so hypocritical. She accuses Rowan Cole's page of vanity, look at her userpage. Does anyway care if she is a LibDem (poor her) or if she is an atheist. If she wants people to know that create her own website, no one on Wikipedia really cares. And she should get a life instead of deleting articles and parts of articles, shouldn't you be at work???</li>

<li>That's missing the point. Morwen accuses Rowan Cole of vainity, pot calling kettle black in my eyes. I have a feeling Morwen, OpenToppedBus and many others are just jealous they haven't done anything to warrant an article!!!!</li>

<li>Note that many unsigned notes above are work of User:Acswanman. If he is connected to blanking of Morwen's user page (and he at least <i>defends</i> the act) that constitutes vandalism. Anyone blocked him yet? Those who have created a full userpage do not claim to be notable. And if I met this Rowan Cole right now, I would be very suspicious of him or at least mention these events - his "friends" do not exactly improve his image with these acts.

Rowan is not yet notable outside this project, which has a history and a future outside of him (though the article as it stands doesn't really reflect this).

<li>After due consideration and a discussion with Rowan Cole, he has asked me to delete the page as he felt it made him feel uncomfortable and he also felt the page was premature. He also has asked me to pass on messages of thanks to those who voted to keep the page and to send also send his regards to those who did not. (unsigned comment by 80.3.32.9)</li>
