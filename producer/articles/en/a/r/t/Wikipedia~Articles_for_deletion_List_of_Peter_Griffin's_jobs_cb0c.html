<ul>
<li>The reason the Homer's jobs page exists is because the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer_Simpson_8936.html" title="Homer Simpson">Homer Simpson</a> page was way too long with the jobs, so it was split off into its own page. Plus, the article is considerably longer than this one. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 22:59, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Actually, it is relevent. Homer Simpson has had a LOT more jobs than Peter Griffin, which is why it is too long for main article. Peter Griffin has only had a few, most of which were one-off jokes as opposed to being major plot points, which many (not all) of Homer's jobs have been. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 01:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, that doesn't matter at all, not even one little itty bit. Doesn't matter in the slightest how many jobs each of them has had or how many they've had in comparison to each other or whether Peter's jobs are one-off jokes or more important to the plot.

<li><b>Keep</b> As fashionable as it is to poo-poo <i>Family Guy</i> continuity, the fact is that the job Peter had for most of the first three seasons, and his lack of job stability in the post-cancellation seasons is an important and notable aspect to scholarly critique of the show, with implications and commentary on shifting American labor relations in real life. The "indiscriminate information" argument only barely begins to apply to the one section on "jobs in throwaway gags"; the other sections are on "long term jobs held" and "jobs held for a significant portion of a single episode." <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnton_Mravcek_8ffd.html" title="User:Anton Mravcek">Anton Mravcek</a> 17:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The anti-<i>Family Guy</i> conspiracy lobby hopes to win deletion debates at this level so then they can go after the articles on Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg, Stewie and Brian. If they get those deleted, they will next gun for the article on <i>Family Guy</i>. But it's a mathematical certainty that they wouldn't be able to get the article on Peter deleted. They would then have to settle for the next best thing, which is aggressive pruning. I do recognize the need to occasionally prune the article about Peter. The infobox could get very long in the "occupation" field, the main body also can get unwieldy when people add jobs that he only had for one episode, or worse, a throwaway gag not entered into continuity. If I remove it from the Peter article to move it to this list article (which btw is nicely paragraphy for the continuity-relevant jobs and not all "indiscriminate info") then I achieve the pruning without looking like a deletionist meanie bastard. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromulent_Kwyjibo_1af7.html" title="User:Cromulent Kwyjibo">Cromulent Kwyjibo</a> 22:13, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
