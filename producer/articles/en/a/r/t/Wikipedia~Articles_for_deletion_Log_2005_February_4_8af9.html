<li>Respectfully, I think your reasoning is flawed. Wikipedia is not a group of morality police. If a group, however nefarious, is encyclopedic, it should be included.

<li>You've misunderstood me, or more probably, I didn't express myself well. My point is that the normal notability bar would rule out this article, anyway, and that we shouldn't be in any big rush to lower it; on the contrary, for the reasons stated, we should err on the side of caution. Clearly there are notable bad guys and we need to have them in the encyclopedia. We just shouldn't be bending over backwards to share the grandiose view that petty delinquents like the United Software Association have of themselves just because they have a website and troll Internet forums. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:40, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I did. As I keep saying; this group isn't notable, and we shouldn't be in any big rush to lower our standards for groups like this.

<p>Non-notable band. Apparently a high school band based in high school. Here is their history as recorded on their website:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Late in the year 2000, guitarist Joe Bitton and drummer Ben Roberts, Had the idea at the end of their 5th grade year to start a rock band. Although they didn't know how to do this, they had the ambition of an adult. Late in the year of 2001, Joe got his first guitar, and cherished it for months later. The first time he played it, he strummed every string and created a disastrous sound. Ben and Joe soon realized that even with Joe's ability to play the James Bond theme, there was something missing. Early 2002 singer Raffi Sweet joined the band and Bassist Andy Hughes joined as a band manager. Andy manly sat in the corner and said stuff like, "awesome" or laughed. After the band bombed their first gig at a party, they realized that their was still something missing from them. To solve this, Andy became a bassist. One year later the band got their first good gig, which was a party in the back of Joe's house with a crowd of maybe 40 people. Although they later would be playing for crowds of 500 people, they still look back at this as their best gig.Soon after, Emergency Exit went to Working Man Studios to put together a few tracks for a demo. They then gave the demo away in school, and people loved it. But as time went on they realized how amateur it was.A few months later, the band known as Blackstone, organized a concert called Stone-Fest. The concert was a great night with about a 100 person crowd. The band played for 4 hours and put on an amazing show.Within the years later various gigs were taken and turned down until 2004.</i></dd>

<p>Here's the scoop. I tried to get user Richardr443 to wikify this article because it does not fit the Wikipedia guidelines. it's a how to article. He kept removing the tag and then finally he vandalized all of my pages with a wikify tag when it isn't warranted. And then I suggested that it be transwikied to Wikibooks. I moved the article over to Wikibooks myself. And I put a speedy delete tag on it. And now, he's logging on with the IP of 24.9.112.127 and doing the same thing...removed the moved to Wikibooks tag and vandalized my pages again and he removed the speedy delete tag. Could we just delete this article from Wikipedia please? And if you go there, please re-add the vfd tag since I'm pretty sure he'll have it removed by the time. it's been moved to Wikibooks (link is <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Transwiki:Letter_writing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Transwiki:Letter_writing" rel="nofollow">here</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b>. Richardr443 recreated the article verbatim after it was deleted. How do we put a stop to this? This is ridiculous! Is there any way of preventing him from recreating this article?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I didn't get a chance to have a say about my article-- You deleted it too fast. Any way, the word <i>encyclopedia</i> comes from the Greek words <i>enkyklios paideia,</i> meaning <i>general</i> or <i>well-rounded education.</i> Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia, and to say that any article that is actually useful has to be moved to an obscure part of another site is strange. I searched for my article on Wikibooks using the query <i>Letter Writing,</i> and didn't even get a match. It must have been put in an obscure place (I didn't even hear of Wikibooks before Woohookitty told me anyway). In any case, useful articles make Wikipedia more interesting and individual articles more distinct from one another. The greatest strength of Wikipedia is that people can find almost anything they want to know by typing it into the search box. Don't deny anyone the right to find what they want to know!-- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardr443_de87.html" title="User:Richardr443">Richard</a></li>

<li>Dear Sir/Madam,</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an article at Wikipedia named <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Heindel_eaf2.html" title="Max Heindel">Max Heindel</a> (1865-1919) which I have expanded with entries (new articles) and related descriptions of this author's twenty three books (all entirely available online and all edited in almost every languages in the world). The book "How Shall We Know Christ at His Coming?" is one of these 23 books. It's title and <i>official</i> description is not to be taken as religious confrontation of any sort or to anyones' faith or beliefs - it is only the description of the book written in 1918.</p>
<p>In Wikipedia there are also other articles of books by other authors, one of my favorites is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scarlet_Letter_cf68.html" title="The Scarlet Letter">The Scarlet Letter</a> by <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathaniel_Hawthorne_7ca2.html" title="Nathaniel Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a> (1850).</p>
<p>I think if we look "Wikipedia" as an Encyclopedia we should be proud to present the description (even if small) of all those books, specialy those written much before our modern electronic days.</p>

<li>Even if these weren't or aren't copyright violations, they're advertising. That's the reason most copyvios aren't worth keeping even if legal permission was granted to use the text; it wasn't written to be an objective description, it was usually written to be a soapbox, a personal essay, promotional copy -- and yeah, that's all these "official" descriptions are. Let me quote a few choice bits from the almost 25 descriptions GalaazV posted verbatim: "This is the heart of the Western Wisdom Teaching pertaining to Health and Healing." "This volume will be of great value to students who are engaged in healing or nursing, whether they are attached to the orthodox medical school or to the nature-cure school." "No astrological student can afford to be without it." "The library of every astrology student should contain a copy of this essential reference book." The comparison with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scarlet_Letter_cf68.html" title="The Scarlet Letter">The Scarlet Letter</a> is laughable, because that article is not written solely by those who believe in the book and are trying to promote it. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 06:04, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Well, the sentences you have put here are outside their context and are from different books according to the theme of each book (Health, Astrology, Vegetarianism, ...) written by this author. Have you read any of them in order to know if those sentences are according or not with the contents of the books?</p>
<p>In my point of view the descriptions are reasonable and give a brief idea of each book contents. However, each description may be expanded by users who have already read each related book (one of the major things of Wikipedia is that anyone of us may give a responsible contribution to the articles).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think we have no right to discourage the effort made by any user, even if his/her work may seem incipient; neither to discourage any knowledge produced (which belongs to all mankind) only because it is not according to our own points of view.</p>
<p>Last, I made no comparison: it is true that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scarlet_Letter_cf68.html" title="The Scarlet Letter">The Scarlet Letter</a> is one of my favourites in North-American Literature. I have only stated it in order to show that there are books here presented from authors of the XIX and XX centuries.</p>

<dd>GalaazV, please read <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. You seem to think that anyone who shows up at Wikipedia automatically has the right to post <i>anything</i> they want to, regardless of how clearly it violates policy, and that "we" "have no right to discourage the effort made by any user". What effort? You posted those 23 descriptions, each copied verbatim from a single webpage, in the space of just over three hours. That comes to about 7.82 minutes per copy/paste, not exactly a tremendous investment of effort. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 07:16, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess you are right MacGyverMagic and I think I tried to justify it with words like "discourage" which now clearly sounds to me as an accusation I was making; which I do not intend to be since as you said I made copy of a webpage descriptions, although being at the time my thought that it would be good simple descriptions in order to present this author's work. I will re-write all the articles related to the books the best my english may afford, with my own words, including this one if not deleted.

Again, its relationship to <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undergarments.html" title="Undergarments">undergarments</a> exists only because it's an undergarment; in this case, however, the usuage is unique to a certain subculture, and therefore more about their referent than the mundane object being so repurposed. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlair_P._Houghton_f78f.html" title="User:Blair P.

<dd>Unique? How, exactly? And why doesn't the article say so? I submit that the supposed usage is not noteworthy or encyclopedic. The Japanese usage could be — but not in English. (And the Japanese article would essentially duplicate, in translation, <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undergarments.html" title="Undergarments">undergarments</a>. And perhaps bits of some fetish article.) Furthermore, the English usage isn't something that can result in the article growing until (and unless) the usage itself broadens. If it's sufficiently noteworthy within the Halflife 2 "subculture," then it might rate a mention in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halflife_2.html" title="Halflife 2">Halflife 2</a>, yes.

<li>Comment. I agree about the personal attacks. One should note that Mahaffy is frequenly misspelled (as Mahaffey) which probably affects your Google count, and further that Google may be somewhat unreliable as a notability metric outside of the United States.

<li>What's more, all the online media responsible for those Laci Peterson hits <i>did not exist</i> when French's tragedy was most current.

<li>I've just added information about the Green Ribbon of Hope adopted by her fellow students, teachers and friends at her school; the Green Ribbon Campaign continues as the major national campaign for missing children across Canada to this day. It also gave its name to the Green Ribbon Task Force, a controversial multi-agency police group that was later subject of an inquiry. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 18:28, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Setting the threshold at "what will matter 100 years from now" is not only impossibly high (much current Wikipedia content would fail this test) but utterly impossible to predict. Our only standard must be what matters today, because the readers of Wikipedia are using it today. Some crime victims become famous in their own right, sometimes by mere accident of circumstances: for instance <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlie_Brucia_f6a8.html" title="Carlie Brucia">Carlie Brucia</a>, whose name is much better known than her killer's. If the public has made someone famous for whatever reason, then they are "notable" for our purposes, regardless of youth or lack of personal achievements. In any case, Samaritan makes a very valid point that Google hit counts can't be compared for events that occurred before vs. after the current era of widespread Internet use. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 19:08, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

I will leave it to those more familiar with the facts to decide an appropriate title for that article -- perhaps something on the lines of French-Mahaffy Murders.

<li>'<i>Keep</i>. Household name in Canada. Article could be expanded to explain her family's role in preventing media from gaining access to videos. Also, there may only be 10,000 Google hits, but the Canadian population is small and Canadian media do not have the same global penetration as the US outlets that covered Laci Peterson.

<li>I have added info the murder given details of why Alejandro Avila was charged. The case is still going on and is continuing to attract publicity. As it could well be a capital case, it is likely to remain prominent for some time. Together with the Joyful Child Foundation being formed and the Samanta's Pride named after Runnion becoming active in Southern California, I consider that makes her notable.

<dd>Before anybody starts voting, I'm adding the two articles on specific movies, as I expect the nominator would intend, to this vfd, modifying Template:Vfd so their notices point here. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 17:34, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason I added these in first place is the fact that volume I is one of the movies promoting nmap. And someone had already writed about Matrix in nmap article. So I added the missing two (Haxxxor 1 and Battle Royal). I'd also see that Haxxxor movies are quite special underground productions. No basic hollywood stuf, but a erotic art.

If you wish for the policy to be changed, it's not as if somebody can just change the law and all will be different; it would have to be approved by the Wikipedia community and to be frank repealing such a fundamental, chaos-preventing policy will never get anywhere near enough support to pass. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 04:14, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was marked for speedy deletion by an anonymous user. I think it's far from a speedy deletion candidate, so I'm moving it here. It's written in a how-to, not encyclopedic form right now. I've got no particular preference, though I could see merging bits of it for <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fence.html" title="Fence">Fence</a> or Fence post/Fencepost?), and redirecting. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdc_936f.html" title="User:Cdc"><small>CDC</small></a> <a href="../../../c/d/c/User_talk%7ECdc_878d.html" title="User talk:Cdc"><small>(talk)</small></a> 17:49, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oops, my mistake.

<li>I'd suggest making Fence Post repair a redirect to Fence post repair for reasons of correct capitalisation. There was a VfD a few weeks back <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_The_shitty_asshole_bfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The shitty asshole">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The shitty asshole</a> which was a similar situation. I made one into a redirect to the other and asked that the outcome of the VfD be applied to the redirect as well. I believe that although not strictly according to policy it was accepted on the grounds of common sense. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 23:44, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not so much "unsigned" as "expanded to include the following paragraph" - sorry for any confusion. Anyway if we <i>can</i> define it, then wikipedia is a reference guide, and it would be nice to find out what such things are by searching on wikipedia (the alternative being a big payment to look at the standard) - if something claims to be a "standard" surely it belongs in wikipedia, same as the hundreds of pages we have for web standards? If we <i>can't</i> define it, then that's where my delete vote came from - it's incorrect as it stands, so if it can't be corrected then delete.

<li><b>Delete</b>, for reasons stated above. Besdies, "Spancil Hill", "Paddy on the Railway", "Kilkelly", "The Auld Orange Flute", "The Rocks of Baun", "Darby O'Leary", and plenty of others contradict this theory. I have to admit it does hold true for many though. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:40, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>FYI, "Spancil Hill" contains the following lyrics:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I payed a flying visit to me first and only love / She´s as white as any lily, she´s as gentle as a dove / She threw her arms around me, saying "Johnny, I love you still" / Ah, she´s Ned, the farmer´s daughter, the pride of Spancil Hill /</p>
<p>If that's not a reference to women, I don't know what is. Similarly, "Auld Irish Flute" is about religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants, and talks about a Protestant fellow who marries a Catholic girl (Women AND fighting). "Darby" contains the memorable line "I was hungry and tired and my spirits were low /for I got neither whiskey nor water."</p>

<ul>
<li>Ah, but it does not say that "women" is an element, but "the courting of women". Dreaming about a lost love is close, but not actually courting. Mentioning someone had got married in a single line of a song doesn't count either. And while there is rivalry betwen Catholics and Protestants in the Auld Orange Flute, there is not any actual fighting. Having low spirits and thirst from <i>not</i> drinking doesn't really make it a song about drinking, in my view. If you take there rules too widely you probably won't find a song anywhere that doesn't reference these elements. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:28, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I wouldn't oppose having useful content in this article, but currently it has existed for nearly a year and it contains absolutely nothing that the official <a href="http://thisamericanlife.org/pages/archives/archivemain.html" class="external text" title="http://thisamericanlife.org/pages/archives/archivemain.html" rel="nofollow">Main Show Archive</a> does not. And, if that page ever goes down, so will all of the links in this article...

<dd>Comment: This article is different from the Main Show Archive in one important aspect: it is a listing of <i>episodes</i> (organized by episode number), where as the Show Archive is a listing of <i>shows</i> (organized by date and including repeated episodes). For example, the Show Archive links to Episode 214 "Family Physics" three times because it aired three times, whereas our article lists the episode just once. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 06:54, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Update</b>: I've removed all external links except for one general link to the official archive page. I suggest that further discussion about which links, if any, to include take place on the article's talk page. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 02:43, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fancruft perhaps, but not more so than in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_episodes_%282003_series%29_b9c4.html" title="List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles episodes (2003 series)">most</a> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Curb_Your_Enthusiasm_episodes_bb7e.html" title="List of Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes">other</a> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jeremiah_episodes_151c.html" title="List of Jeremiah episodes">cases</a>. If the official page ever moves, we can update all the links here with a simple AWK script (that's how the links were created in the first place). If the official page ever disappears, we will still have a list of episodes as a memento. Another thing: if you say that you "wouldn't oppose having useful content" here, that suggests to me that you think the topic <i>is</i> indeed encyclopedic, and should be expanded rather than deleted. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 01:11, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Utterly pointless duplication of the program's own archive page. And if you could explain, without resorting to logic-chopping, what possible useful content that could be added here that wouldn't fit in <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a> I'd be grateful. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 02:05, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Pointless duplication</i> was not a deletion criterion last time I checked. You might have a point that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_This_American_Life_episodes_cfe0.html" title="List of This American Life episodes">list of This American Life episodes</a> could be merged with <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a>, but you could say the same about virtually every other article in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_television_series_episodes_357e.html" title="Category:Lists of television series episodes">Category:Lists of television series episodes</a> – it's almost always possible to make a case for why "list of FOO episodes" should be merged into "FOO". As for useful content, it would be helpful to cross-reference the episode list with contributor articles like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sedaris_4199.html" title="David Sedaris">David Sedaris</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Vowell_f542.html" title="Sarah Vowell">Sarah Vowell</a>, etc. The whole point is that this list can be properly wikified and expanded by us, whereas the official archive page cannot. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 03:02, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>You mean a stripped-down, automated, wholly unnecessary duplication of an existing website's content shouldn't be considered grounds for deletion? Hell, it borders on outright copyright violation.<br />
<i>You might have a point that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_This_American_Life_episodes_cfe0.html" title="List of This American Life episodes">list of This American Life episodes</a> could be merged with <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a></i>. That was precisely NOT my point. I repeat, what "useful content" could be added to the episode list that would NOT belong in the main article (or that of the contributors)? Answer: none.<br />
Do you have a point you can make without distorting people's positions? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 05:31, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, I'm not in the business of distorting anyone's position. Your prior point was that anything worth adding to this article could equally well be added to the <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a> article. That suggests to me that you're thinking any content (current or future) worth preserving could be merged into the main article. Like I said before, if there is a point here, it would apply essentially unchanged to a lot of other <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_television_series_episodes_357e.html" title="Category:Lists of television series episodes">episode lists</a>. Second, it's hardly a copyright violation, as one cannot claim copyright on a mere list of facts, which includes lists such as this, phone directories, etc. Also, if you check the history of this page, you'll see that it was cleary not created as a pared down version of the official archive page. I agree that this article should be expanded, which would make it even less of a copyright violation, if it ever was one. Third, I maintain that useful content can indeed be added here: we can provide content summaries and link them with other articles. In fact, I've just done so for a few episodes I remember off the top of my head. Now when you go to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trail_of_Tears_d650.html" title="Trail of Tears">Trail of Tears</a> and click on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Trail_of_Tears" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Trail_of_Tears" rel="nofollow">What links here</a>, you'll be directed to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_This_American_Life_episodes_cfe0.html" title="List of This American Life episodes">List of This American Life episodes</a> among other articles. This clearly cannot be done on the off-site official archive, and it could only be done in the main article <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a> if that included/transcluded the content from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_This_American_Life_episodes_cfe0.html" title="List of This American Life episodes">list of This American Life episodes</a>, hence my first point. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 06:49, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>First, I'm not in the business of distorting anyone's position</i> So you're an amateur, then?</li>
<li><i>That suggests to me...</i> Perhaps you should stick to what I wrote and not what you imagine I wrote.</li>
<li><i>Pointless duplication was not a deletion criterion last time I checked.</i> That suggests to me that you're not up on Wikipedia policy. You might want to read this, Perry Mason: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files</a></li>

If you removed all those links, all that would be left would be a short blurb about some of the 2004 episodes. Articles that are essentially lists of links to other web-sites are against Wikipedia policy, and even if they weren't, this so-called article can and should be replaced by a single sentence in the "External references" section of <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a>, letting people know that they can find information about particular episodes on americanlife.org. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:21, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>At present, it is 95% a violation of Wikipedia policy (being a list of external links), and 5% a useless list of blurbs about some of the 2004 shows. Removing the external links would make it 100% a useless list of blurbs about the shows -- so it is difficult to call that an improvement. The solution is to <b>delete</b> the article, as I said before.
<ul>
<li>So why don't we remove all <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_television_series_episodes_357e.html" title="Category:Lists of television series episodes">episode lists</a>?
