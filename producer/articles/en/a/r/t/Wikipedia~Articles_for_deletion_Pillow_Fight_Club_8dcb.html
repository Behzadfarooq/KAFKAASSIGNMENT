<p>How is this purely vanity? Someone must have had some serious sour grapes to consider this page, which is informative and one of the few sources of information on this "fad" purely in vain to the organizers. If that's the main objection limit the off going links.</p>

<p>This organization exists in the real world and has had press coverage. The San Francisco Chronicle article, which is linked to at the end of the page, would seem to clearly indicate that Pillow Fight Club is of interest to those outside the organziation.</p>
<p>This is TOTALLY valid!</p>
<p>I agree this is interesting to some and not a harmful entry. Please keep this entry here(JB, 2/15/06).</p>
<p>Someone must be really vengeful and spiteful to want this page removed. There is no other reason. I think the support for this page speaks for itself. If it's deleted, I'll probably stop using Wikipedia altogether, since its whole foundation would be flawed and its name a fraud. ---</p>

<dd>I'll elect to ignore the psychologizing, and say only that you must have a very skewed idea of Wikipedia to consider deletion of this page constituting 'fraud'.</dd>

Newsworthy, informative are not, in my opinion, valid criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a newspaper. 209.19.42.2 23:47, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Surely Wikipedia is not a newspaper, but that's not an actual policy, nor should newsworthiness preclude topics from Wikipedia. Yes, before this event took place the article probably wasn't deserving of a page but now that there existed such an event, that it is imtimately linked with <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_mobs.html" title="Flash mobs">flash mobs</a> which is itself is a legit topic (it would have been an actual flash mob if it was planned covertly), and it has garnered enough notoriety to become newsworthy, I believe makes this topic worthy of inclusion. Its clear it has elevated beyond something that was just made up and I'm sure someone can find the feathers around the ferry building to prove it. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 01:37, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The "event organizers" mentioned in the original post are parties unknown, who seek to remain anon &amp; who make no money or other gain through any aspect of an event. Organizers and participants are unorganized, which means the idea has spread for its own value, as a meme. The "promoters" are merely reporting on an open source idea that has international acceptance.--dr elys jimenez 07:12, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I saw Pillow Fight Club mentioned in Neil Gaiman's blog and didn't see an explanation. I came here to find out. Now, if it's something that people unrelated to the event would want to research, then it is informative.-E.C.</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>.</s> Wikipedia should not be used to promote memes, only document them when they have already become popular. That means we need good coverage of the event in independent sources (good ones - not blogs), <s>and sorry, but one slow-news-day story in an Israeli newspaper doesn't convince me that this is a global phenomenon.</s> --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 16:48, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Missed the SF Chronicle - now I see that we have actual third-party evidence that this encyclopaedia <i>is</i> being used to promote non-notable events. "Like many others, Davis learned of the pillow fight from a friend who directed her to a Web site -- <b>in her case it was Wikipedia</b> -- that gave details about a planned flash mob pillow fight on Valentine's Day in San Francisco." (my emphasis) Never mind the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> paper versus WP:NOT indiscriminate see-saw, this article is literally giving people the wrong idea about what we're here for. Even ignoring that, the two independent references documented two individual flash mobs, not a global pillow fighting fad, and individual flash mobs are generally not notable. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 16:53, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Your comment reeks of subjective judgement, Mal. First off: what is non-notable? What is your criteria for notability? Seems newsworthiness is not a criteria you'd use, although the topic passes your "good coverage in independent sources" criteria. If it helps any, Google has about 10 articles for the SF pillow fight.<a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=san%20francisco%20pillow%20fight&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?q=san%20francisco%20pillow%20fight&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Second, if you have content on an article that is promoting or advocating an event, you have an example of POV in an article, which would warrant <i>editing</i>. I will concede that the article outside of the opening section and the external links should probably be deleted, and perhaps the opening needs some editing too. However, you can argue any proper article on an event, say, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Winter_Olympics_f27d.html" title="2006 Winter Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a>, is functioning as promotion as well: all you need is a time and place. It's not the job of the editors to police what the contents of an article is used for by individual users. And the quote does not make it clear that the article was used for the purpose of promotion or as just as a reference. Lets not get into silly authoritarian <i>we need to make an example!</i> sillyness, it's gonna punish Wikipedia users more than the promoters. We on the Keep camp have proposed newswortiness as a criteria for notability, please present your own objective criteria and argue for it. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 05:39, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I already said, all your news articles prove one thing: that in a couple of places people had a couple of flashmobs in the form of a mass pillow fight. This article is a) trying to bulk up those isolated incidents into a global phenomenon and b) trying to turn it into a global phenomenon by using Wikipedia as a promotional tool. As for the Olympics, you might be interested to know that those have been going for decades and receive worldwide coverage from every form of media, and have already become notable without Wikipedia's help. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 13:37, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And it should be clear that I'm not denying that, yet I'm saying that's enough for inclusion within Wikipedia.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I heard about this page from an onlooker at the SF event who was delighted with the event and very pleased to find out more about it on Wikipedia <a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuota_b8dd.html" title="User:Quota">quota</a> 13:01, 20 February 2006 (UTC) As several people have pointed out to me, this was rather 'faint praise'. I should have added that I found it useful and informative, too. If (before some event) this page was used as promotion, then yes that's not Wikipedia. But if it is a professional and accurate record of events, then it is as useful as any other record of people doing extraordinary things for extraordinary reasons. <a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuota_b8dd.html" title="User:Quota">quota</a> 20:34, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. (I am a real user, not a puppet.) If this isn't true and notable, it should be. If Brian Peppers can be deleted simply because the whole phenomena is evil (even if perhaps marginally notable), than this can be kept because the phenomena is delightful (even if perhaps marginally non-notable). Anyway, with a Reuters story and lots of photographic verification, this seems to have more verification than many other marginalal articles that are kept. (However, the "Rules" and perhaps the "Sugesstions for attendees" sections should go.)<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 18:03, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
