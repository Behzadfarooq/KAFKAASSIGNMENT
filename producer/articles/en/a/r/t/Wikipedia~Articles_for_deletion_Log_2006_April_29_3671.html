<p>This article practically brags about being a POV fork of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a>. There also appear to be exactly two sources for the article: a single Encarta article and a personal website, and if the essays written by the owner of the personal website are eliminated as a source (which I believe they would have to be, by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) then the list is exactly four entries long. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:18, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>The article has three reference because only one editor has had time to add any other links. Lists have to start somewhere. I'm sure there are many other sources.</li>
<li>The OCRT reference is considered a reliable resource for other lists. Specifically the List for Groups Referred to as Cults which Antaeus Feldspar frequently edits.</li>
<li>There does not seem to be room for these quotes on the Groups Referred to as Cults list.</li>
<li>If Encarta considers making a list like this (albeit shorter) to be encyclopedic then why wouldn't Wikipedia?</li>
<li>The list is designed to be Neutral in POV in that it only reports on the viewpoint of reliable sources and does not express the views of the author. I don't think it can be any less POV than the list of groups referred to as cults which expresses the view points of journalists and cult experts.</li>
<li>The article needs to be viewed with the other articles in its category. It enhances the information provided by providing a heading which shows a real life viewpoint. If you look at the cult categories below you will notice that all the articles refer to the scholarly groups which point the finger at what they thing are cults. This list brings up the real world viewpoint that some other scholarly groups have to the contrary. I think it looks good in the category list below. It feels right to provide a balancing article on such a controversial topic. But if you all think it's too much of a POV fork and that then means that the article needs to be merged into another then so be it.</li>

<dd>Frankly, I am very surprised that OCRT was ever generally accepted as a source for <i>any</i> article. Part of the reason I have not protested it as a source for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a>, however, is that OCRT has a strong tendency (I would say "bias" except it might be misinterpreted as criticism of OCRT) <i>against</i> referring to groups as cults; thus, it is far more indicative when OCRT <i>does</i> come out and say "yes, this group actually should be regarded as a cult" than when they say "this group should be regarded as a new religious movement and <i>not</i> as a cult." (Please see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Partisan_websites" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Partisan websites</a>.)

<dd>I've reconsidered as you want, and I still say it's subjective. Microsoft does not determine what is encyclopedic; they clearly have a POV conflict of interest in producing an encyclopedia. The difference between a 'cult' and a 'religion' is whether the community accepts it or not. The Hare Krishna movement are a cult in Australia, but in India they'd be pretty tame. In Japan, Mormons are considered cultish whereas in Utah, they're normal. It's impossible to draw a distinction without being subjective.

<dd>I'm not sure: are you asking me a question? If so, could you restate? Interpreting what I think you're asking me, yes, there are certainly subsets of Hinduism that "are classed" as cults. The Hare Krishnas (ISKCON) come to mind: in New York or Sydney, they're considered a cult, whereas in Mumbai or Chennai ISKCON is a wholly unremarkable organization. All I'm saying is that every young religion was once considered a cult, because frankly a reasonable definition of cult is "a religion without any political or economic power".

<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b> Reasons why you are all wrong: 1. It's not an ad, we don't make any money 2. We're working on the first episode right now. 3.

<li>1) The first clause is utterly unrelated to the second clause: ads is ads. The Red Cross uses ads, your local county government uses ads. 2) So it's a NON-EXISTENT online show? Even less notable. 3) "Harmlessness" is not an article criteria. And kid? Insulting people is not the best way to get people on your side. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 03:48, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Black liquid solar collector demonstrator

Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton,
Alberta T6G 2J1 Canada
A solar collector, suitable for an undergraduate laboratory
project or lecture demonstration has been built and the details
of the construction and the way in which it can be used by students
in elementary or advanced courses is described. A simple and
efficient system results from using a black liquid to absorb the
energy and from using the thermosyphon effect to drive the liquid
through the collector.
A floodlamp is used as a <b>surrogate sun</b>.
The collector is of considerable current interest
in the field of solar energy.

<p><b>Keep:</b> The number of Google hits does not necessarily make one a notable musician. Bach's music had become fish wrapping paper because he lived a quiet life of non-self promotion and his music had fallen out of fashion, only to be saved by a few other musicians who understood his contributions. At that time, his pagerank on google would have been zero, too! This kind of "popularity" is what kills fine arts and keeps Britney Spears at the top - how sad! Jalal Zolfonun is undeniably one of the most important Iranian (and world) musicians today and without question deserves a page and then some here. Besides, if a page on "setar" or "traditional persian music" will remain on wikipedia, one cannot discuss those without discussing him. If you don't believe this, look at this link <a href="http://www.musicboxla.com/setcenofset2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.musicboxla.com/setcenofset2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for a CD containing the century's most important setar players listing him as one of less than a dozen.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He may not have that much of an Internet presence, but it's rather silly to straightforwardly use raw Google rankings as a notability guide for people in non-Western countries, and from the number and variety of sites referring to him (in various spellings), I am convinced he is genuinely famous.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Notability exists, but not enough to qualify for an article. The arguments presented by Azoolander (who, by the way, already put down "Keep" twice) and Baumfabrik are terrible arguments. An NY Times article on somebody's <i>son</i> does not make the father notable, and just because one band has a page doesn't mean another should. Zolfonun seems like he could be important to a small group of people, but that group is very, very small. In addition, if the article is kept, the page should be moved to just one name. And of course, if it's kept, the article needs to be cleaned up quite a bit. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 05:57, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but move to better title and make appropriate redirects.

<li><b>Keep</b> Information about a changing online game is never going to have a solid reference. Even much more popular games, which have major web sites and published guides - these are never as complete and up to date as the games themselves. I would contest the idea that a player who uses the game is doing original research: the game is a source of information about itself. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 03:49, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A game itself really can't be used as a source, in my opinion. It's not a document asserting facts with some level of evidence, it's an array of code and graphics created for entertainment. Experiencing them and then writing the experience on Wikipedia would fall under original research: research not documented anywhere else. It's like saying a person is a reference because a person can listen to them and then write it down on Wikipedia. And if there can't be solid references for 80% of the page, then it breaks the fundamental verifiability rule. —<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><small>THIS IS</small> M<small>ESSED</small></a><a href="../../../r/_/w/Image%7ER_with_umlaut.png_0647.html" class="image" title="Image:R with umlaut.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/a/ad/R_with_umlaut.png" alt="Image:R with umlaut.png" width="6" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/_/w/Image%7ER_with_umlaut.png_0647.html" /></a><a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><small>OCKER</small></a> <small><a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker">(TALK)</a></small> 03:54, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a comparion, think of a movie. A movie is also mostly 'graphics created for entertainment'. But certainly if someone watched a movie, then wrote an article about the movie summarizing it, this would not be original research - the movie itself provided the information. I see a game as no different. An exception would be if the writing were not merely summarizing, but inferring, such as if a user came up with their own interpretation of a movie, and wrote the article about that. But mere description I feel is fair. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 03:58, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, using the film/game itself as a source is most certainly original research as outlined in <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:05, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>In response to this comment, just so I can understand, I'm not sure what you're referring to - this part seems to me to say it is ok. "Primary sources present information or data, such as archeological artifacts; <b>film, video</b> or photographs... Research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged." Where does it say not to do this?</li>
<li>In relation to this article in particular, a great deal of the facts on this article I found with little effort just looking at the link provided on the page to the official site, and surely many more such as "Endless Online features a global chat function which acts as a chat room that every player in the game world can see." would fall under "makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge" - anyone who played the game would know this. While there are some facts on the page which would qualify, such as stating players motivations and feelings, and I agree should be removed, I feel there is sufficient content on the page verifiable from available sources that it should not be entirely deleted. They may not currently be cited, but there is a pretty good number of sources shown at <a href="http://www.endless-online.com/links-fan.html" class="external free" title="http://www.endless-online.com/links-fan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.endless-online.com/links-fan.html</a>, which I found from this article, which could easily do so. I'd reccommend cleanup, and citing these pages, but not outright deletion. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 05:11, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I figured I might as well just go ahead and do it myself - I've cited nearly every part of the page from available sources, and removed some that seemed inherantly unverifiable. There's only one (citation needed) still remaining, but it could also probably be dealt with by someone who knows the game. I don't play it myself, but was able to find the rest just from the links given by the game's official page. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 05:28, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>- Although many people think this should be kept, as I made point of in the discussion article, and as Messed Rocker has said before, things need to be verifiable via credible sources. Since this HAS NO VERIFIABLE DATA, it has no place on wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to point out, for the record, that [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] actually says otherwise about the "no verifiable data." If we take the official site of a product and a product to be parts of the same entity, documenting claims a site made about itself is perfectly acceptable. Documentation of claims to the contrary, or documentation of lack of evidence, is also acceptable. Take a look at the page as it exists now; it's fairly heavily footnoted and contains links to other sources that review or provide legitimacy for Endless Online. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> 18:23, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> on the exact same grounds in the last AfD. I really don't think verifiability is a problem here. The way I see it, games and game publishers can be used as a source (and they'll undoubtedly be more than glad to provide information about their games!), that's just normal <i>encyclopedic</i> research. For example, if I state "<i><a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_VII_4623.html" title="Ultima VII">Ultima VII</a></i> runs in 320x200 MCGA graphics mode", I don't need a frigging game researcher to write that in a peer-reviewed paper before I can use that fact. It's written in the <i>game box.</i> ("256-color VGA graphics". There it is. I kid you not. I can provide a scan and I swear I won't modify it.) I can install the game and run it in DOSbox and by golly, it runs in 320x200 MCGA mode. This, however, would be Original Research: "<i><a href="../../../e/t/e/Baten_Kaitos%7E_Eternal_Wings_and_the_Lost_Ocean_132c.html" title="Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean">Baten Kaitos</a></i> is an example how the Japanese are moving away from cloning <i><a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_III_dd8b.html" title="Ultima III">Ultima III</a></i> and going toward cloning <i><a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_IV_0a78.html" title="Ultima IV">Ultima IV</a></i>: the player's relationship with the gameworld is affected by their choices. The game features plotlines and clicés of <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_62cc.html" title="Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a></i> series, game mechanics of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_the_Gathering_c994.html" title="Magic: the Gathering">Magic: the Gathering</a></i> and marrying it with good doses of <a href="../../../b/i/o/BioWare_66af.html" title="BioWare">BioWare</a> Humour®." <i>That's</i> original research and op-edding.

In order to provide accurate information, we <i>have</i> to accept the game publisher as an accurate source of information, as they know best what the game is about. What we shouldn't allow them to do is to write the articles. The OR policy doesn't say anything about <i>New collections of sourced facts</i>, because if those are banned, we'd ban ourselves by definition. In closing, I <i>swear</i> I'll quit now. I suck.

<li>This is what I was trying to say. And if an article about a primary source cannot use that source as a reference, a <b>huge</b> amount of articles would have to be deleted. I looked around, and could not find a -single- article about a book, movie, or game that cited someone else when summarizing itself. If anything, they cited the book/movie/game itself, or it most cases, nothing at all, since it should be clear that's where it came from. Again, not for drawing new conclusions, but to say what the source itself says. I know two wrongs don't make a right, but I don't think they are wrong. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> says right out that compiling info from primary sources is encouraged.

<li><b>Comment</b>: To last few replies. I don't see why the company linking to these sites removes their reputabilty (if that's a word). It's not like this is an article about them, and they'd have a reason to lie to make themselves look good. But even if those are thrown out, a yahoo search for ("endless online" mmorpg) turns up 17,000 results. Just after a few minutes browsing them, I'm sure there's enough validation in there. The simple fact remains, this article now has more citations than I've -ever- seen about a video game, with the exception of a couple extremely popular titles. I would also just like to point out again, I don't want anyone thinking I have a personal agenda or bias here. I don't play this game, and I've never even heard of it before this AfD. I just think that this article has well above-average content and information to find, compared to most other non-mainstream games. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 05:40, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Here's just something for people to chew: Should the verifiability criteria put as the question "can verifiable third-party sources be found?", or the question "is there a <i>possibility</i> that verifiable third-party sources can be found?" It's almost like the question on Original Research: "Are there sources?" vs. "<i>Can</i> the statements be sourced?" I'm personally always leaning on the latter of these interpretations: It's not OR if something <i>can</i> be sourced to some work, it's Verifiable if the primary source exists, and there's a <i>possibility</i> that some independent source will show up and verify the claims.<br />
These rules are in Wikipedia to stop crackpots from pushing their theories as undisputedly valid knowledge. The rules aren't meant to stop discussing cult fictional works - that's what <i>notability criteria</i> is for! What I'm seeing here is trying to delete a work by simply stacking charges: we're proposing the article's deletion as a matter of <i>technicality</i>. "You can't verify this." The way I see is this: <i>Could</i> a reputable game magazine cover this game? (I'm guessing someone might already have.) <i>Could</i> some notable blogger review this game, for example? (Probably, and may already have.) <i>Could</i> some researcher go and conduct a methodical study of EO's player base? Now, you can ask these questions, and answer is a definite "maybe". Ask similar sort of questions about some crackpot scientific theory, and you get a definite "hell no, not even probable". --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 07:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You misunderstand the policies and what they are for, then. The three policies, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> are to be taken together as parts of a whole, and not to be applied separately. You also misunderstand <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> which quite clearly states articles <b>should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers.</b> Not facts that should be published, or will be published, but <b>have been</b> published. Your assertion that if there exists <i>a</i> possibility <i>that verifiable third-party sources can be found</i> the information can be added and the article exist are at odds with the policy. We could hypothetically bandy about coulds all day, but at the end of the day <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> clearly states <b>The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it.</b></li>
<li>Now that shouldn't mean stuff can't get added and then verified later, but given this article has existed since July 2005, surely that's ample time for people to find the sources they claim <b>could</b> exist. I'll quite happily change my vote if reliable, reputable, third party sources are found. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:43, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>However, if you go back and read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> again closely, particularly at the end in the section on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Self-published_sources" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">self-published sources</a>, you'll find that to document claims about an entity, <b>WP:V</b> allows for the source itself to provide documentation about itself, so long as that information has not been challenged by a third party. We're not using the information to document claims about another person or party, and since a lot of the information in this article is fairly basic material, the claims as they stand are fine. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 20:02, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

If that's true, I state here and now I want dibs on writing the article about my blog. You can source information from the primary source itself, but it cannot be the entire content of the article. Wikipedia is not a business directory and Wikipedia is a tertiary source, not a secondary source, which is what utilising only primary sources makes us. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:37, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I still don't see why the citations as listed are not reputable. Who, besides people who play the game and take the time to publish their own material on it, would know better? If you look through all the 3rd party sites, and the official site, they are all in agreement - there's no conflict of opinion on any of the information in the article, and given none of them have any reason to lie about it, let alone -all- of them lie about it, I see no reason not to believe it. Granted, self-published website may not be as widely reliable as say, a professional printed game guide, but web sites are quite commonly used as sources on wikipedia, not to mention I've seen way more errors in printed guides than I have on web sites of people who actually play the games themselves. And no, that doesn't mean every website should have an article, per notability, which this game certainly has.-<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 20:21, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This isn't about who would know better; after all, who would know better what members are in an unsigned band of schoolkids? Wikipedia is not a guide to the internet, it is an encyclopedia, and as such, requires third party, reputable sources on which to base articles. If this article has them, fair play, if not, well, sorry, but then it should be deleted. Wikipedia isn't the place to prove a topic's notability, it's a place to summarise it. If there is nothing to summarise, we can't have an article. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:57, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I still maintain that this is a slippery slope. If you start <i>demanding</i> reputable third-party sources for each and every separate assertion in Wikipedia, you end up with a lot of work. A practical example where we end up with this logic would be this: Let's see, today I read about <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Impact_%28film%29_50dc.html" title="Deep Impact (film)">Deep Impact</a>; I obviously can't believe a single word about the plot, because the plot summary is completely unsourced. Further, the article cites a disreputable source (IMDB, a film database based on user submissions). And the most shocking thing is that this is not an isolated incident; articles frequently include plot summaries without providing any other source besides the movie themselves (<i>presumably</i>, as it's not even cited), and all use this highly dubious web site as a source for cast and crew information! Is there something in English language similar to Finnish National Filmography - a printed, peer-reviewed, comprehensive film reference that also has detailed plot summaries? (Cripes, we have to abandon our reputation as an instantly updated encyclopedia covering new happenings instantly - those tomes get published like every 5 years or so and are always 5 years late, or whatever!) We need to take a really great big broom and start nuking everything and everywhere! (the crowd goes "POINT well made!"). And then, after 5-10 years of waiting for the movie journal to complete their tedious work, prepare for the great question that really makes the difference: <i>what benefit would this new version have, exactly, over the version we already have?</i><br />
I believe in verifiability just as much as everyone else. It's just that I believe the world isn't black and white (No movie reference work publication delay puns intended) and that verifiability is not necessary unless it is a matter where verifiability is <i>needed</i>. Some common sense, people.

<p>This article on an organisation within the fictional Star Trek universe has no sources, and appears (to me) to be either original research or non-canonical fancruft, for as far as I know, no such organisation is detailed in the episodes. If the organisation's canonical existance, along with the contents of the article, can be proven to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> through the use of reliable, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a> sources, I will reconsider.</p>
<p>This article was PRODed, with the prod removed by the article's creator. The only other changes made to the article were to remove a large section of text, although I believe the comments I made in both the Prod nomination and above still apply to the rest of the article. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 03:52, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> of the bunch of related articles this seems to be the one with the best coverage. Currently is does give undue promenance to Dewey but is does document many other important cycles which have been studied through history. The Verdic cycles in particular could do with expansion as this a well known cosmological model. I feel there is a need for an overall page on different theories of cycles. I've redone the page a bit to describe a few other cycles and make it less about Dewey work with a nice quote which pretty much demolishes the buisness cycle theory. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 13:09, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and let me explain that further. I usually have a very low tolerance for pseudo-science and I was expecting to go to this article and see a bunch of crap. But reading through it, I have to say it's pretty reasonable. This article doesn't really make any assertion other than complicated systems show periodicity, and people have studied that. This should be <i>prima facie</i> obvious. This is clearly evident in simpler systems like celestial mechanics, and I think that part of the article is eminently reasonable, being a list and description of well-known periodic motions inside the Earth-sun-moon coupled system. Of course, once we get into the social sciences things get pretty vague, but I have to say that this article is no worse of a violator than many current schools of thought in academia in the social sciences (and, of course, social systems are so complex that it always a stretch to apply mathematics to them anyway). Now, if someone rolled into this article and said something like "by studying the cycles in the ancient Mayan calendar, I predict that WW3 will happen in 2015", then we're talking bunk, but there's nothing like that here. In summary, I don't see anything inherently pseudoscientific here. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 15:49, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> per Kevin above, there is no single cohesive study of cycles however, which is the article's premise. The article cites <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources for a couple of <i>facts</i> which are mentioned, but provides no support for the <i>hypothesis</i> of the article itself. Thus, as it stands it is in violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, in that <i>the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources</i>. <small>—<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorge_ce73.html" title="User:Porge">porg</a><a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorge_Esperanza_cfdf.html" title="User:Porge/Esperanza"><font color="green">es</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../p/o/r/User_talk%7EPorge_e2a2.html" title="User talk:Porge">talk</a>)</sub></small> 20:36, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Deville, when you Googled, did you examine whether you were finding any hits not originating from websites by Ray Tomes, wiki articles by Ray Tomes, posts to various newsgroups by Ray Tomes, blog entries by Ray Tomes? Note that Tomes apparently has registered a number of websites, some of which have been mentioned in various of the these AfD discussions. When I did this search, I couldn't find ANY information about Dewey or Tomes's crank theories on the web which did not appear to have been created by Tomes (or a suspected sock). He has been enthusiastically promoting his ideas in many venues, so much so that the prospect of 10,000 hits manufactured by Tomes himself does not seem unlikely. Now, <i>do we really want to encourage all the worlds cranks to simply make sufficiently many blog, newsgroup, or wiki postings to promote themselves from a non-notatable crank to a "notable" crank?</i> I think not! ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:25, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not too much has been said about this article's candidacy for deletion.

<li>Hey thanks a lot <a href="../../../w/l/m/User%7EWlmaltby3_7843.html" title="User:Wlmaltby3">Wlmaltby3</a>, it's nice to know that I'm not the only one working on the article!

One thing though, I think that the "Trivia" section that I added should be kept in the article, so I'll add that back in.

<li><b>Keep</b> She gets quite a few unique hits on Google and seems to be a fairly well known author.

<li><b>Delete</b>, only solo work is a book that gets zero non-Wikipedia Google results. I think that it is self-published. Few Google results in general and many appear to be about her candidacy and involvement with a transit group. Other results are from meetup.com, various poetry sites and some about a 18th century thief with the same name. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:02, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> "Small Fanbase" isnt really that small, there are over 500 people on the forums alone. It is in a testing phase much like Dark Throne, in that it is still playable in the testing phase.

<li><b>Keep</b> Even though the game may be small in comparison to games like runescape and darkthrone, forgotten planets player base is strong. Most of the people that play forgotten planets would state it's a great game. I personally do not think that forgotten planets is in testing phase anymore as the DEVS have said they will always continue to release new features to the game. --Lowrie 10:07, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>Though there are not millions of people playing FP, the community is quite unique, The relationship between Developers and players is quite unique and they work hard to keep the game running well, and they listen to suggestions placed on the forums. The gameplay is also quite different that any other mmorpg that i have played. Beta testing ended almost 8 months ago. If you consider this phase of the game development the testing phase, then forgotten planets will never leave the testing phase, the developers are always working on new ways to make the game better and funner to play. I have been playing this game since almost the beginning of beta testing, and the developers keep adding stuff to keep the game interesting. I think that this game has been out long enough, and has a dedicated enough fanbase to be allowed a page on wikipedia. If other games get to have pages without anyone complaining, then why cant Forgotten Planets, ask any player and they will say that it deserves it.A crazy cranium 07:10, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

When that page is nominated, a vote will occur just like this one, and if a consensus is reached, the page will remain or be deleted, depending on the outcome. This vote, however, is only for Forgotten Planets. Pointing to other articles does not increase the notability of this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the original creator of the game. I agree, we are "small" and could probably be considered as in testing. Though, as has been pointed out we'll probably always be in a testing phase since our community is always offering suggestions as to what to add -- basically, there's no foreseeable end to the programming and development of ForgottenPlanets. If our entire "existence" is based on forever development, then what's wrong with being "in testing" that should eliminate our entry to the Wiki? In fact, that alone makes us a unique entry. In addition, many other games have been in Beta/Testing and still had articles on Wiki - those games are classified the same as us and yet they are still here.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do believe that the existence of this page in of itself shows the loyalty of the fan-base. I was unaware of the page's existence until recently. I do believe it should be pointed out that all opinions expressed here are not endorsed by Moon Lit Software and should not be taken advertisements, but simply the fans' excitement about the game.</p>
<p><b>In either case, for all fans of the game who want to post here, please keep things civil. Threats of other deletions won't help anyone's cause and only ruins what Wiki is.</b></p>

<p>I came across this gem while doing my regular patrol of Category:Conspiracy Theories (some of the pages in there have been the messiest articles I have seen on Wikipedia.) It is a very minor theory in one region of Sweden about the location of an ancient pagan group, and it seems extremely non-notable to me despite the article's length. The page has shown very little (if any) improvement since it was tagged for cleanup in <s>July</s> <i>June</i> 2005. Several editors called for its deletion a long time ago on its <a href="../../../g/%C3%B6/t/Talk%7EG%C3%B6taland_theory_7670.html" title="Talk:Götaland theory">talk page</a>. There is a (much shorter) article on the Swedish Wikipedia. I don't know what their inclusion standards are, but I think this theory is non-notable and a huge eyesore on the English Wikipedia, and that it should be <b>deleted</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 23:32, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The theory is highly notable. It has been around since the 1920s or 30s, but has roots going back to the early 19th century. A series of programmes about this theory and its proponents was broadcast on Swedish national television in the 1980s and caused controversy as giving a too uncritical and sympathetic image of the theory. It is not taken seriously by academic historians or archaeologists, but they have nevertheless had to debunk it. The current article is badly written, badly structured and unreferenced, and a better one could probably more easily be written from scratch. I would not be very sorry to see it go, but if it is deleted, this should not be used as a precedent against recreation. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 08:54, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: weird bit of folk history that has been around for two centuries. It does need a clean up, mainly because it presents the flaws in the theory far more extensively than the theory itself. The arguments for deletion on the talk page are a little strange, by the way - the notability of this theory is not affected by the political affiliations of the people involved, or the fact that it is laughed at by _real_ historians.

<li><b>Keep</b> and move for cleanup. Fairly notable, but badly written. I encourage editors to clean it up (I won't, because horror films tend to distress me and I'd like to avoid getting involved), but by <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> he deserves his own page (as the article is long and notable major characters deserve their own articles). Please do not respond to AfDs with "nn;" it isn't very helpful, especially if you don't mention how you've determined that the character is not notable. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> 09:27, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, as per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> "Major characters and notable minor ones (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction <b>should be covered within the article on that work of fiction.</b>" San Saba 15:46, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, but please see the next sentence: "If the article on the work itself becomes long, then giving such characters an article of their own is good practice (if there is enough content for the character)." This is why I pointed that out in my comment. The Wolf Creek article has gotten somewhat long, and while the Mick Taylor article needs some work, there's plenty of material to work with for his own article. Please see the examples in <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> of major characters being offloaded into separate pages.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Wolf Creek article is not long at all. I doubt if the Taylor character merits his own article even if it were; this is a recent horror movie with no sequels, and no adaptations (books, games, comics). <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 17:25, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Save</b> - This is a piece of information for the education and REFERENCE of others. An encyclopedia by definition is a compendium of facts, both clever and inane.

<li>I am perfectly willing to merge if it comes to that, but I would ask that you consider the page based on its reference value, and not on the notability to you of these people.

<li>This will be my last plea. I am appealing to all the administrators, the members, and the commoners. This article has about as much reference capability as the list of Eagle Scouts among wikipedia users. If there is a general consensus to delete this part of work, I will reluctantly submit to the administrators wishes. I don't wish to cause trouble or continue to rag on the marathon-runner administrators of Wikipedia. If you feel I should move it to a different wikimedia subsite, I will gladly comply. I just would like to have a simple final answer from the Admin. If you wish to leave me a personal message on the topic, feel free to use my user talk. It is currently nearly empty.

<li>You're right that we do have an article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Eagle_Scouts_9cb4.html" title="List of Eagle Scouts">List of Eagle Scouts</a>, but the important difference there is that that's a list of notable/famous people who are also Eagle Scouts, it's not a list of every Eagle Scout ever. Note that almost everybody on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Eagle_Scouts_9cb4.html" title="List of Eagle Scouts">List of Eagle Scouts</a> already has an article of their own, and only in a couple of cases is their notability/fame anything to do with scouting. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 21:01, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The number of Eagle Scouts is in the hundreds or even thousands, just as the number of the equivalent Royal Ranger GMA earners.However, the Ranger of the Year program cited is a competition based on talent in firecraft, ropecraft, Royal Ranger Knowledge, etc., and winners are the best in the United States among the tens of thousands of Royal Ranger members. These boys are the best of the best, the elite of their program. <a href="../../../r/r/p/User%7ERrpbgeek_0df1.html" title="User:Rrpbgeek">Rrpbgeek</a> 02:27, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

Judge for yourself the amount of work which goes into this competition. Then realize that every one of the boys who competes in ROTY has over 85 merits, and must go up against many others at their level of expertise. Now tell me straightforwardly that these people have not made a significant accomplishment, equal to or greater than the work necessary for becoming a Boy Scout Eagle Scout.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The link to the Dutch article is deceptive. The English article is about a planned micronation, the Dutch article about a Flemish TV program.

<dd>Ok, I read the Dutch article more carefully, and, yes, it's about a Flemish TV program, and the plot of that program is that the host will try and create this micronation. The English article agrees with this and states up front that the impetus from creating the micronation is the same TV program itself. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 17:34, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't understand what all the huff is about. Manjob is a term I've always heard and used so I figured I'd help wikipedia out. God knows you have everything else in here. But, if not everyone has heard of it then it's obviously something I made up. Just for the record, however, it is not a name change for the hand/blow-job. If you had read my article you would have known the difference. Also, how is urbandictionary.com a good source? Defitiely no neologisms there. I thought wikipedia existed to recognize obscure terms like manjob, which are cut from print encyclopedias due to censorship. I realize you can't allow everyone to post just anything and that there has to be some sort of editing process, but it seems like the few of you who haven't heard of manjob are holding your knowledge of urban culture (because those who frequent internet encyclopedias are in touch with urban culture) in quite high regard. Atiebout 18:45, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I think at best Manjob would be more appropriately entered over at Wiktionary as a dictionary definition, marked as a neologism (<i>Neologism: A newly and deliberately coined word.</i>) as it definately is not a "traditional English" word. I'm sure you can agree that it's a recent addition to the language (as in, the last hundred years) and that the entry is by far more a definition than an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>, it's definately an encyclopedia. We do, however, appreciate your willingness to help assist us in keeping this project up to date!

<li><b>Delete</b> very quickly, and please note that I was the one who tagged this for speedy deletion. Melissa wrote this herself in the third person. I disagree with Redvers that this article "asserts notability." e.g. "She was the first female cast member of Days of Our Lives" would be notable, "She was on Days of Our Lives" does not make her notable. "She caused a scandal when she blackmailed her candidate's opponent in the 2000 Senate elections" is notable, "She worked in the 2000 Senate elections" is not. &amp;c &amp;c. Also please note that many people have IMDB pages, including me, but this doesn't make them notable either. - <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbscissa_152a.html" title="User:Abscissa">Abscissa</a> 23:24, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> It's a dicdef with no hope for expansion. I can't imagine who this would help, since it's pretty obvious what oversleeping is. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G. Crawford</a> 16:59, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree, no more than a dicdef, with nowhere to go. I'm not sure that redirecting to <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep_disorder.html" title="Sleep disorder">Sleep disorder</a> is a good idea, because oversleeping in common parlance isn't necessarily a reference to any disorder. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 17:16, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I have attempted to expand the article a bit to provide some distinction between normal "sleeping in" by adults and teenagers which is not considered abnormal and <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypersomnia.html" title="Hypersomnia">hypersomnia</a> which is indeed a serious disorder. Some further information to define the difference between normal and abnormal oversleeping would be helpful for this article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBige1977_d3fc.html" title="User:Bige1977">Bige1977</a> 18:23, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Whilst it seems pretty limited, I think that this article could well have some potential. You could tie sleep patterns into it - for example (original research, this, but consider it an example), I find that I seem to oversleep more when I go to bed early. I can see that the scope of "normal oversleeping" is rather unexpandable-seeming, but things like the effect of oversleeping students on school grades (from a large-scale perspective, i.e. how much productivity is lost?) could be interesting and useful. --<a href="../../../d/g/j/User%7EDGJM_57c0.html" title="User:DGJM">Doug</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../d/g/j/User_talk%7EDGJM_6b9d.html" title="User talk:DGJM">talk</a>)</font> 21:10, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). 5 delete, 3 keep and I'm not entirely sure if the nominator still wants this deleted (see reply to Billposer further down in the discussion.) Regarding <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>, this joke seems to be in use more than referring to that page would imply, and with the references in the article I am not convinced this is original research either.

<li><b>Oppose deletion or redirect:</b> agreed, this article is looking a bit thin, has factual innaccuracy, etc., but nevertheless "Wormhole Physics" in Stargate is quite different to wormhole physics in reality. I suggest a disambiguation if you're worried about factuality. However, the article <i>does</i> explain some of the stated tenets of the Stargate take on wormholes (particularly the one-way and 38 minutes rules), and although it adds minimally to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28device%29.html" title="Stargate (device)">Stargate (device)</a>, it can be linked to from any other Stargate article (regardless of whether it <i>is</i> or not); indeed, we dont want anyone wanting to know about Stargate wormhole physics to have to read the entire article on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28device%29.html" title="Stargate (device)">Stargate (device)</a> just to get their information. The issue here is more one of notability than duplication of information, and on the topic of notability, i submit that this fictionalised field is one of the core ideas in the entire Stargate universe. the article needs work, yes, but doesnt need to be deleted. --<a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfakim_ccb4.html" title="User:Alfakim"><font style="border: solid 2px #4F87F9; background-color: #CBE6FF" color="#4F87F9"><b>&#160;Alfakim&#160;</b></font></a>-- <a href="../../../a/l/f/User_talk%7EAlfakim_b9e4.html" title="User talk:Alfakim"><font style="border: solid 2px #4F87F9; background-color: #CBE6FF" color="#4F87F9"><b>&#160;talk&#160;</b></font></a> 22:36, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think enough is known about Wormhole Physics to write a whole article on it.

The existing article says pretty much all there is to say, and that's not enough to warrant keeping it. A disambig is a good idea, though. It could point to both <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormhole.html" title="Wormhole">Wormhole</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28device%29.html" title="Stargate (device)">Stargate (device)</a>. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 22:41, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its not necessarily about searching, so much as that the article can be linked to from various other articles. There are many occassions when an internal link to Wormhole Physics (Stargate) would be useful, e.g. when in an episode "Samantha Carter writes a book about <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormhole_Physics_3ddc.html" title="Wormhole Physics">Wormhole Physics</a>". or others. --<a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfakim_ccb4.html" title="User:Alfakim"><font style="border: solid 2px #4F87F9; background-color: #CBE6FF" color="#4F87F9"><b>&#160;Alfakim&#160;</b></font></a>-- <a href="../../../a/l/f/User_talk%7EAlfakim_b9e4.html" title="User talk:Alfakim"><font style="border: solid 2px #4F87F9; background-color: #CBE6FF" color="#4F87F9"><b>&#160;talk&#160;</b></font></a> 13:19, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hm, I wasn't quoting a specific policy, but let me put it this way: the policy is that a writer with an audience of 5,000 is considered notable, correct?

<dd>I'd say "is a mayor" is an assertion of notability. The question is if it's a valid assertion or not. As a substub, I think the point is moot - even if an article on him would be acceptable, there is nothing there worth keeping. When deciding if mayors are notable per se, consider this: Are ex-mayors notable? We're not going to keep an article only as long as he's in office, that would be silly, but would we want an article about everyone who's ever been a mayor? --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 21:22, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. It is an entry about a the Oregon State college football team in 1967. They were unusual because they beat a team that was ranked #1 at the time and later would be the national champions. That wouldn't warrant an entry by itself; however, they also beat #2 ranked Purdue and tied #2 ranked UCLA. It is also important to note that one of the games known in college football as the "Game of the Century" featured UCLA (ranked #1 after USC lost) &amp; USC (ranked #3). (In fact, on Wikipedia, it is the only "Game of the Century" where the teams were not undefeated and untied &amp; also the only game where the teams weren't ranked #1 &amp; #2.) As such, these Beavers had ended both teams' perfect season and certainly merit an article for that reason alone. They also, however, beat Purdue, a #2-ranked team which had earlier defeated #1 Notre Dame.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
    As for the style, I thought that it would be best to try and tell it like a story, because I think it is a better way to convey the information than in a more formalized manner.  If you don't agree, I will assure you that you are more than welcome to alter any &amp; all of the phraseology to make it more encyclopedic.  I think I am correct about the Beavers being the only team to beat a #1 &amp; a #2, &amp; tie another #2, however, it would take a lot of research to confirm this.  I used to have a more reliable site for my more factual claims, but it dissappeared.  I could update this site when I find another good source, but it would take roughly a week's work to check that one fact.  I simply do not have the time right now, so I edited it out.
    The reason I wrote this was to inform the Game of the Century page, which contained a couple factual inaccuracies, which I edited out.  As for citing, what exactly do I need to show in order to pass that test?  
    Summing up, this team warrants a page because they did something unprecedented.  The information I presented is all true, but I am not at all tied to the way I presented it.  If you feel that I should cut down on the information presented, I easily could.  I think it's good the way it is, but, if you would like to change something to make it more encyclopedic, please do!  I think deleting is a bit draconian to simply editing it on your part.  If you guys could be more specific in your disagreements with the way I presented the information, that would be much appreciated as well.  That way, I could edit to improve the article.  This is the first page that I have created, so I could easily have made a bunch of Wikipedia-site errors; however, I think that the information contained in the article is rather solid.  Like you say, it could be presented better, but, without more specific critique, I would not know how to do so.

<li><b>Keep</b> OK, I admit it - when I first put this article on here it was the early hours, I was too tired to do any more coursework, and I thought it would be a laugh to see if I could try to put as bad an article on Wikipedia as possible. However, I wouldn't have put something on that deserved to get deleted, that would spoil the fun. There are far worse articles than this. As mentioned by everybody else, it is culturally highly significant, even though it's so low brow it's in the Marianas Trench. The only problem is that it seems every other visitor to the page adds a verse, sometimes paying little regard to properly formatting the text. I daresay it does need some more work on it. One final thought - I have also added an article on a well-known novelist... this was before I added this one. Not a single amendment or addition has been made to that page, but just look at the history for this one! Does this mean that people think her literary output is of less value than 'The Diarrhea Song'?

<dd><b>Comment</b> -- although there is understandable difficulty in finding particularly high borw sources for something like this, i recommdn that you type "diarrhea song" into google. 23,900 hits and if you go to the last page of hits you will find that most are still talking about this song. This establishes notability in our culture and the presence of all these hits verifies this notability , at the very least. If you truly think this article needs more verification, add the appropriate tag to the page. But please don't advocate the deletion of something with such clear cultural notability. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 22:23, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>redirected</b>.

This is partially in response to the "merge" verdict given for the last Afd, and partly to preserve the history in case someone DOES want to merge some of this. I also note a precedent at Afd that individual chapters of student organizations aren't typically considered significant enough for their own article. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:50, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Although this article has survived an AfD before, I want people to reconsider allowing individual fraternity chapters their own articles. Individual chapters are not notable enough, the only notable events on a truly national scale are usually something really good or bad. Also, greek system articles should be merged to their parent universities as lists in the student life section.

<li><b>Comment</b> How is it notable? If the notability is just because the chapter has won a few awards from the school and its national organization that would set a very low bar of notability. If that is the case, why don't we start writing hundreds of stubs about hundreds of fraternity and sorority chapters that have ever been recognzed by their national or school. I am not anti-fraternity, I am far from it being a past president of a fraternity chapter. But there is no value in stubs like these when all the information can be merged into ether fraternity or school's article. <a href="../../../d/s/p/User%7EDspserpico_ef61.html" title="User:Dspserpico">Dspserpico</a> 22:01, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> into a new article. One possiblity would be "False names for Harry Potter books" or something similar. However, I think it would be better to merge it with <a href="../../../u/n/a/Unauthorized_Chinese_Harry_Potter_books_6613.html" title="Unauthorized Chinese Harry Potter books">Unauthorized_Chinese_Harry_Potter_books</a> (again, probably under a new article name, such as "Harry Potter pre-release fervor"... Ok, I suck at creating names), comparing and contrasting how <s>gullible</s> anxious fans desperate for new installments were taken in by real but unofficial/fraudulent books in some cases and joke titles with no corrosponding books in other cases. It would start out as a stub, to be sure, but I think that the effects of the fervor leading up to new releases (and frustration when they aren't released as quickly as some fans would desire) is enough of an international cultural phenomenon to deserve an article, especially seeing as bits and pieces of that proposed article already exist under at least these two separate stubs. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 21:47, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Of the two above suggestions for merge, I personally prefer CanadianCaesar's. It is, after all, something that happened before the release of the book, and I'm not aware of it causing any controversy.

It is <b>not true</b> that everyone who shows up to a deletion discussion gets an automatic vote just for showing up.</p>

These people are blatently stupid and deserve the negative publicity they are getting.

<li><b>Comment</b> In order to assert the theorem, you need the martingale to have finite quadratic variation (and of course, a.e. path should be continuous). This is not just a math technicality, but it is the heart of the theorem. The representation theorem tells you that a BM-adapted, continuous, L^2 martingale is a brownian motion at a random time (or, if you want to make things more complicated, it is a stochastic integral driven by brownian motion). Now, the random time you need (or the process you need to integrate), is defined exactly by the quadratic variation of the original martingale. If we want to go through the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadratic_variation.html" title="Quadratic variation">quadratic variation</a> stuff for martingales, the representation theorem article is not the right place. On the other hand, IMHO the article does not meet the wikipedia standard right now. That's why I purposed deletion.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I have some doubts about the way to solve this problem: we could create an article for continuous time martingales, since they are the most commonly used martingales, both in mathematics and applications. In this case, we could state the theorem there. Otherwise, we could create some articles in order to cover this subjects: add info on quadratic variations article, etc, and then improve this article. By the way, I am not sure at all that the representation theorem should be on wikipedia. I hope to receive further comments. <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGala.martin_b836.html" title="User:Gala.martin">gala.martin</a> <small>(<a href="../../../g/a/l/User_talk%7EGala.martin_80bf.html" title="User talk:Gala.martin"><font color="#IF7777">what?</font></a>)</small> 00:02, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> If it's substantially wrong as written, but a legitimate theorem, then the remedy is to correct the errors, not to delete the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, the issue is not about the fact that the theorem is uncorrect. It is about if we want this theorem with its own article. And of course, it is better to decide that before correcting. A couple of months ago, I would surely thought we should keep the theorem, but I am changing my ideas about the best way to organize the math stuff. Anyway, I am convinced martingales' theorems are important and interesting.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>
<ul>
<li>I agree that the statement of the theorem is poor, but it is a start. Why don't we just rewrite it? Perhaps we could restructure it by the following layout?
<ul>
<li>1. the statement for continuous martingales and give a few references for the proof,</li>
<li>2. the statement for general martingales, and few references for the proof</li>
<li>3. then perhaps some motivation for it along the lines of saying that Brownian motion is the canonical continuous martingale, while compensated compound Poisson processes are the canonical processes for martingales with jumps and that all martingales are just integrals of a Brownian motion plus some sort of compensated compound Poisson process, and lastly</li>
<li>4. some places where the theorem is used such as in finance where it is used to prove the existence of portfolios <a href="../../../a/j/r/User_talk%7EAJR_1978_28c7.html" title="User talk:AJR 1978">User_talk:AJR_1978</a>.</li>

<p>Sark doesn't have a Commonwealth Games Association, nor does it compete at the Commonwealth Games as a separate team, but as part of the Guernsey team. This article's continued existence is similar to having an article on Bavaria's performance at the FIFA World Cup. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 00:00, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b>: Is it true that Sark does not compete under its own name, but as part of the Guernsey team? If so, then of course this should go. OTOH, I notice that the Commonwealth Games template has a separate entry for Sark. This of course doesn't prove anything, but is it possible Sark competes as its own entity? --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 05:59, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm positively certain that don't compete separately (and was just about to cite the exact same sources as Redvers just did, except with <a href="http://www.guernseycga.org.gg/" class="external text" title="http://www.guernseycga.org.gg/" rel="nofollow">Guernsey CGA</a>, too). In fact, the article recognises that itself ("Sark was represented at the 2006 Commonwealth Games by two shooters, Nick Dewe and Stefan Roberts, who compete for Guernsey in the Trap Pairs event"). The Sark tourism website is just doing its job as a tourist website: promoting the island as distinct from Guernsey. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 11:44, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, okay, maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I found it exceedingly hard to actually find hard information on this. What is particularly frustrating is that I can't seem to find an official list of the countries which competed in the 2006 games on the official 2006 games website. You'd think such a list would exist, but all I can get is a list of medal-winning countries. Anyway, I can't find the information that Bastin is pointing to, but <a href="http://www.thecgf.com/countries/intro.asp?loc=GUE" class="external text" title="http://www.thecgf.com/countries/intro.asp?loc=GUE" rel="nofollow">this link</a> from Redvers seems pretty convincing. Until someone can find an official link that Sark competes separately, I think we need to delete this page. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 02:33, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
