<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <s><b>Rename</b> to Ugly number since this is a property not a theorem(see comment below ↓). If it has been proven that it applies to only 2 natural numbers, it is extraordinarily notable, and the concept is any case encyclopedic. The article associated with the discoverer is very short, too, but that's not up for VfD because Google easily establishes notability. Not wishing to judge one article by another, but it seems that a theorem/concept from a notable mathematician has a fair shot at being notable itself (though is not guaranteed to be so). -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> July 2, 2005 00:54 (UTC)</s></li>

<li>I've not managed to find any references to this idea anywhere yet. After longer consdieration, I think perhaps this article is misnamed — without some <i>result</i>, it's hardly a theorem and more a property of numbers, like the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_number.html" title="Perfect number">perfect numbers</a>. I'd be tempted to move it to Ugly number in consequence. I've amended my vote. <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> July 2, 2005 01:58 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As Splash noted, not a theorem, and there is no reason to believe anyone calls this "ugly number", so you can't move it there either IMO. It's possible that there is something here that is encyclopedia-worthy, but in order to decide, we need a real name for the category, and some cites. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> July 2, 2005 02:23 (UTC)</li>

This is just a nonce definition of a minor mathematical property, therefore.

<li><b>Delete</b> I doubt this is true because 1458 is also "ugly". (1+4+5+8 = 18, 18 x 81 = 1458) Althought it seems there are no more of these through 1 million... <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangek_7161.html" title="User:Rangek">Rangek</a> July 2, 2005 18:00 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ha. Now the text says 1458 too. Nice. You know, it only took me like 5 minutes (well, 10 if you count the time it took to write the program) to search from 1--10000000 and uncover 1458. Does this "professor"'s "proof" mention 1458 or not? Since no one has cited any references, I guess we'll never know. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangek_7161.html" title="User:Rangek">Rangek</a> July 2, 2005 20:37 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yeah, I added 1458 to the article since it was already there, but in the midst of a bunch of off-the-wall silly stuff. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> July 2, 2005 21:07 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>delete</b>: On the basis of the text "This theorem is refuted since 1458 was repoted to happen," this is not a theorem, and therefore this article is nonsense. If the article can be fixed and the notability established, perhaps I would vote keep. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 2 July 2005 19:30 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Since the theorem is falsified by 1458, it fails the verifiability requirement. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 2 July 2005 22:14 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the proof that there were only 3 such numbers being <i>wrong</i> would not make the article unverifiable. This is not <i>mathematical</i> verification, but <i>encyclopaedic</i> verification. What makes the article unverifiable is that so far no source has been proferred (apart from a vague statement that <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masahiko_Fujiwara_e756.html" title="Masahiko Fujiwara">Masahiko Fujiwara</a> published this theorem in "a book which became a best-seller in Japan", which entirely fails to state the ISBN of the book or any way of determining what book is being referred to) for the theorem's publication by anyone anywhere. It's less about whether the proof is correct, and more about whether the statement that <i>such a (fallacious) proof was published</i> is correct. The only thing that the addition of 1458 does is cast yet further doubt on the existence of any actual source material. Peer-review of a mathematical article would have caught that error within minutes, as demonstrated here. It looks like what is actually happening is that the original publication and peer-review of this mathematical assertion is happening <i>here in Wikipedia</i>, which is not what Wikipedia is for. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 2005-07-03 00:06:09 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't fully agree with you. It's true that a false theorem could be encyclopedic, but that requires special circumstances. As you note, there's no evidence of that here. It is absolutely not verifiable that the information in the original article is correct, because in fact it was wrong. An encyclopedia article that simply stated "1+1=3" would fail verifiability even if there is someone somewhere who claims that it's true. You could instead say "Japanese mathematician xxx claims 1+1=3" and that might be verifiable, although it would probably be doubtful that it was notable. The article I voted on fit into the former category (made a claim that was demonstrably false), thus not verifiable. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 3 July 2005 06:27 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually the article that you voted on <i>was</i> of the "Japanese mathematician xxx claims 1+1=3" type. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_ugly_theorem&amp;oldid=17917342" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_ugly_theorem&amp;oldid=17917342" rel="nofollow">this version</a>, for example. However, given that the author has been incorporating results <i>derived from this very VFD discussion</i> into the article (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_ugly_theorem&amp;diff=18034268&amp;oldid=18027862" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_ugly_theorem&amp;diff=18034268&amp;oldid=18027862" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_ugly_theorem&amp;diff=18237369&amp;oldid=18162738" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_ugly_theorem&amp;diff=18237369&amp;oldid=18162738" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>.) it still appears as though the peer review is happening here in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 8 July 2005 15:04 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The ISBN number now listed is a genuine book (in Japanese) which has a sales rank of 92 on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">Amazon.co.jp</a>. I think further checking needs to be done about the contents of the book.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Besides 1, 81, 1458, and 1729, there are no "ugly numbers" up to 10<sup>9</sup>. It's also interesting that 1729 is the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardy-Ramanujan_number_f721.html" title="Hardy-Ramanujan number">Hardy-Ramanujan number</a>. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric119_9f87.html" title="User:Eric119">Eric119</a> 3 July 2005 04:32 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, I would hazard that the article is more or less correct. The result is natural because the number of digits grows logarithmically with respect to the number itself and so the product eventually falls short of the original number. Of course this isn't a rigorous proof. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric119_9f87.html" title="User:Eric119">Eric119</a> 3 July 2005 04:47 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Iff</i> the book is valid, then I see nothing wrong with <b>keep</b>ing this article, albeit probably under the name Ugly number. I also note that the article on 1729 cites 91 as having relevance as far as the Hardy-Ramanujan number is concerned, which is at the very least an interesting coincidence. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 4 July 2005 02:11 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> (pending further facts)</s>, but rename to (for instance) Fujiwara's ugly theorem, or perhaps Fujiwara's ugly property. An ISBN number is now given, so it's falsifiable (see <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/books/4480687114/250-3763696-4109838" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/books/4480687114/250-3763696-4109838" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on amazon.co.jp as evidence that the book exists), the current sales rank seems to be 132 which would certainly make it notable, especially if it turns out to be wrong. Masahiko Fujiwara is a mathematician at Ochanomizu University with 22 publications on MathSciNet. I also note that nobody seems to have checked the book. The name <i>Ugly theorem</i> reminds me of a fragment in Hardy's A Mathematician's Apology, in which he states that some theorems, while true, are devoid of any interest. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 4 July 2005 14:15 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, as per Vipersp51, and also because:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Its almost an insult having such a thing as a mathematicians <i>only</i> referenced work.</li>
<li>What is the relevance of such property?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Why is it almost an insult? Because it took me less than 15 min to find that this is true for 1, 81, 1458 and 1729, and no other number up to 5 digits.</dd>
<dd>Its easy to show that any number with 5 digits can't have this property:</dd>
<dd>The sum of the digits would have a maximum of 45(=5*9), a reversal of such number would at most 93 (reversing 39&lt;45), so any such product is less than 4185, which as 4 digits, thus is smaller than the target value.</dd>
<dd>This can be performed by any high school student studying math. A generalization of this for any number of digits is also relatively simple, yet quite boring to post on VfD.</dd>
<dd>Last, but not least, a Google search shows Ugly numbers as a completely different thing: <a href="http://acm.uva.es/problemset/v1/136.html" class="external text" title="http://acm.uva.es/problemset/v1/136.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5</i></a>.</dd>

<li>Masahiko is your friend! Is it true? Masahiko has been giving his opinion on how education in Japan ought to be. It seem as though he has a conservative idea. His main opinion is that Japanese children should not</li>
</ul>
<p>learn English while they're young.Instead, they should go back to Japanese classic literature. As I said in the article, Masahiko thinks great Math comes from the sense of beauty. So he thinks what children should do is to learn and memorize beautiful Japanese poems and phrazes.
