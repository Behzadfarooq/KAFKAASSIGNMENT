<p>Nominated for deletion because I can't find any record of this party existing (despite the fact that the article's believable enough internally). I tried searching for anarchists in West Paris but had little luck. I think it's a fake. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 18:35, 13 July 2005 (UTC) (Note: Please forgive any formatting errors here -- I haven't vfd'd something in months.)</p>
<p>Although I am not a user on Wikipedia I live in Paris and have heard rumors of such a party, however it is very low key. I am surprised to see an article on Wikipedia about it and believe that it is important that it remains on. -In-hawn Yeo</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you provide any news clippings about the party? If it's an actual organization, that would almost certainly change my position -- as it is, I can't find one site on the Internet that mentions "Demunich Gum", the alleged founder of the party, nor can I find "Demunican" used as a word in any context. Is it possible it's spelled in another way? <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 18:43, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I live in France and I think I have seen one of the minor parties named Demunican on a list. Although this shall be soon verified as to see if it really does exist, from what I have found so far from past achieves, there are traces of its existence. It would seem that there is a distinct connection between one of the german parties hence questioning its origin. Could it be that the Demunican party is related to Demunication that is a currently a small but influencial movement that is being issued in Paris? - Seijin Oh</li>
</ul>
<p>Having lived in Paris for a considerable amount of time and being immersed in the french culture for a considerable period of time i can verify the existence of the Demunican Party or more precisely that it is rumored that a party that goes by that name does exist. However there is no existing proof of who actually is a member and hence due to the lack of knowledge regarding them there are no mainstream articles available.- Cormac Vizzard</p>
<p>I am also not a user of Wikipedia but as Mr Yeo, I am also familiar with the party and its whereabouts. I am a resident of the neighbourhood of Passy and come into contact with the headquarters (located on the corner of Rue Beethoven and Rue Chardin). It seems to be very popular with the youths of the nearby schools, but as far as I can tell, it was founded in 2002 and would most probably qualify as a "One Member Party" as described in the article concerning the French Political Parties. It seems to be low key more than anything, and thus would be widely unknown as I doubt their base is strong enough for any actual Political action as</p>
<ul>
<li>Well as I study political sciences at Sorbonne I continuously hear about different low-key parties with few members that one can not hear about via the internet. This is the first such group I hear of, and I believe it is important to leave the article on as it will most likely encourage the other small political parties of Paris to make themselves more public rather than remain private and exclusive clubs. It would also greatly aid my research project on such groups, so would you please let the article remain on Wikipedia. -In-hawn Yeo

<li>Gentlemen (or ladies), thank you for your comments, but you don't seem to know about Wikipedia's policy of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a>. Unless you can produce reference to this political organization in published books, news media, or some other independent and reliable source, we can't leave it up. If you know it's been mentioned in newspapers, post some links so we can see that. If you don't, it doesn't matter how many people believe the party exists, we can't keep the article up. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 19:14, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>believe the term party is a glorification of their existance...more like hooliganism with ideals...but then again what is else is a revolution...but it is true they do exist...their most famous appearance was at the St. Lazare metro station where in 5 minutes like a swarm of ants they tore down every piece of advertising in the station and dissapeared...again there is no positive proof to say it was them as officially they don't even exist...but being a journalist in this city you learn things most others don't and I would be willing to wager that it was none other than the Demunicans</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortunately I was able to find an article I was looking at about these so called "Demunicans" and I have scanned it and uploaded it to my yahoo webpage. Hopefully this will verify their existence. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/inhawnyeo/objpol.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/inhawnyeo/objpol.gif" rel="nofollow">demunican</a></li>

<p>Who is to say what type of knowledge is notable or not. Isnt the very purpose of an encyclopedia to gather information from as many different resources as humanly possible in order to further our knowledge and understanding of the world we live in today. The fibre that separates an internet encyclopedia from one in binding is that here space is limitless causing knowledge to be limitless and the thirst for knowledge to be perpetual. Hence those for the deletion of this article should think once more about what they are truly asking for and should learn to see the world from outside the claustrophobic environment they choose to inhabit.</p>
