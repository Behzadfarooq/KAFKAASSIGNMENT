<dd>It is not speculation. The key point for this article is that it is information confirmed prior to the books release, under 26 hours ago.

<li>Now that the book is out, this can be <b>deleted</b>. Not that I care for Harry Potter, though.

<li><b>Keep</b> Just because we're not fans of a paticular series, is NOT a reason to delete information on a paticular topic. This is factual information about a topic that happens to have a great appeal to many people. That is the sort of thing this wikipedia was meant to do, provide a place for the community to talk about and post relavent facts for topics that interest them. So while i myself am not a fan, I say keep it.
<ul>
<li>I voted "delete" because this article is useless now that the book is out, not because I'm not a Harry Potter fan. I would have voted "delete" for Star Trek XI (Crystal Ball) or Star Wars VII (Crystal Ball) too. Had I noticed this VfD before the book was out, I would have voted "keep" or abstained. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 18:59, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it is important to recognise that Harry Potter is a unique phenomenon - not even the His Dark Materials trilogy caused such a stir even though many would argue that it probably should have given its formidable subject matter. The leaks, speculation - its all part and parcel of the Potter experience. Given that - I think deleting for its own sake would be a huge mistake. Information can be re-organised, re-named - but it is valid exactly because of the uniqueness of the situation. I am glad to see that Wikipedia provides such in-depth detail and I honestly dont see how anything that has been done either here or in the main article (especially the summaries - which are just brilliant!) contradicts what this enterprise is supposed to be about. The main article can't possibly house everything and I think this is a very worthwhile repository. I agree with whoever said that "Cleanup is required to remove duplicate material and cite sources, but that's no reason for deletion." Keep it. Severina 18:51, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but cleanup, rename to something a little more decent (like "Rumours prior to the release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" or something) and follow a clear format of "This was the rumor... This was how fans reacted... This is what happened in the book." --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_ce06.html" title="User:AceMyth">AceMyth</a> 21:17, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Information that is encyclopedic and relevant to a particular audience is NEVER useless. It is not your job to delete things just because you don't think it's relevant. Cynicalkane 21:39, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This may be very helpful for researchers working in the area of publishing policy, trade secrets, information flow, memes etc. Knowing almost exactly who, what and when revealed something from the unpublished, but highly demanded book is invaluable. Agree that cleaning and renaming will help. 82.210.153.132 21:50, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or send it to some fan's user page. Wikipedia is not a Harry Potter rumor site.

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It looks like a combination of a) outdated rumors compiled before the release of the book, and b) spoilers from the book placed by one persistant editor he keeps trying to delete them from the main book article. The first is pure fancruft and the second doesn't belong here. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:23, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This was split from the main article to allow the new info to go in, but to keep the information at the same time. It contains the <i>confirmed</i> information befre the books release, which was a mere 15 hours before this vfd was started. Any Harry Potter fan will find that of interest, (making it not fancruft.) If you want a rename, how about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince/Archive. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESonic_Mew_47a9.html" title="User talk:Sonic Mew">talk to me</a> 00:35, July 17, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Any Harry Potter fan will find that of interest, (making it not fancruft.)</i> That statement makes NO sense whatsoever, since <i>fancruft</i> means "of interest ONLY to fans", not "not of interest to fans". --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 09:11, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but badly needs cleanup. I suppose this could also serve as a collection of all the major rumors floating around, and with a note on each of them whether that rumor was true or false (and if it's false, what the truth is). Shouldn't be merged with the main HBP article because that would make it way too long. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatherGuidoSarducci_cfef.html" title="User:FatherGuidoSarducci">FatherGuidoSarducci</a> 01:39, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with main article (first choice); or <b>Delete</b> (second choice). Book is issued, only need for one article.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Davidbod. I suppose this stuff is a hair more notable than the various Pokecruft, but fancruft and speculation belong on fansites, not in encyclopedias.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> This is a good archive of the titbids of intformation and leaks leading upto the release of the book.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It documents an unprecedented phenomenon within Western popular culture. Never has any book been the subject of this kind of pre-release hype, never has this kind of local pageantry been inspired by the release of a book, either for adults or for children. Knowing the details of what was speculated about a forthcoming installment provides understanding as to what was important to this subsection of the general public at this time.

<li><b>Comment</b> on renaming: On the talk page for this, I suggested renaming the article to Pre-release speculation about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, as a cleaner alternative to an anon's suggestion of Pre-release speculation as to the content of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. Having a rum(o|ou)rs page about it doesn't make sense, since it has already been released (and thus there won't be any more rumors). Pre-release speculation sounds like a better phrase to put in the title to me, and it gets around having some word in parentheses at the end of the title, and the US/UK spelling issue. Any in favor? --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 22:25, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Information about the widespread speculation should be included in the merge. However, this is not the same as noting every theory that was speculated. I.E. it is okay to say that millions of fans debated the identity of the Half Blood Prince. That's because that entails a notable amount of speculation. It is not okay, however, to say that the best theory is Bill Weasley and then give a page-long explanation of the reasons why. It is not necessary to include every last theory proposed because they are not the interesting part. If there was something especially notable about any of them, such as a radical or controversial prediction, that would be different. Right now, however, the article's focus is on what was believed, rather than the fact that people believed it. In fact, its stated goal is to say "what was known" prior to the release. This is just a deliberate limit of the information we have on HBP. This is not acceptable on Wikipedia, where we strive to be comprehensive. We would never have an article on "what was known about chemistry in 1942," although that is a part of history. I am going through the article now. I will remove most of the guesses and previews themselves while leaving notable information about them. I will leave what is necessary to support the previous.
