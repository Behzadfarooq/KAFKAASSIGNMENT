<li><b>Keep</b> This is a hoax, and wikipedia should clearly state this. <s>It would be best to lock the article to a version like 20:00, 4 December 2006 12.199.100.178, which was almost correct.</s> On a second note: it indeed is not a hoax. Is was an art project created by Hardy Burmeier. Other people (boingboing?) made a hoax out of it. The German page I linked in 'discussion' explains the motivation of the art project. I think this art project is worth an article in wikipedia.

It appears to be an attempt to see how much traction BoingBoing can give to a hoax by getting people to link to it and post about it, artificially inflating its <s>notability</s> Googlability.
