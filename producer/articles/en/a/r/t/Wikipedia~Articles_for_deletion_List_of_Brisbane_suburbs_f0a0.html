<li><b>Keep</b> per JROBBO. Note this deletion does not really come under any particular deletion policy, except maybe duplication. Also I'd note that such a list exists for every Australian city (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_places_in_Australia_62c0.html" title="Category:Lists of places in Australia">Category:Lists of places in Australia</a> for examples). Brisbane has the unique feature that over half of its suburbs fall under one <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Government_Areas_in_Australia_72da.html" title="Local Government Areas in Australia">local government authority</a>, which skews the debate in that city - there are suburbs beyond it (Pine Rivers, Redland, Logan etc) which in any other city, and certainly according to the ABS, would be included in such a list, but are not included by Brisbane editors. By deviating from the Australian consensus on lists of suburbs for cities, in such a way that one city does it one way and the rest all do it another way (while recognising that this is a consensus amongst Brisbane editors), it seems to go the opposite route from forming standards for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australian_places_223a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian places">Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian places</a> to begin with. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 09:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

However, the surrounding shires suburbs, although part of <i>greater</i> Brisbane, is not included.

<dd>That's very inconsistent with what's in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> page which mentions that the Brisbane metropolitan area now encompasses parts of Logan City, Beaudesert Shire, the Gold Coast City, some of the councils to the north, etc. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Brisbane_suburbs_15ce.html" title="List of Brisbane suburbs">List of Brisbane suburbs</a> should have <b>all</b> the suburbs within the Brisbane metropolitan area, not just ones in the Brisbane City Council; although it would be fine for the category to continue to reflect the council's suburbs, so long as that difference is made clear at the top of the page. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 22:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No idea why it says that, but the wording should be changed to reflect the <i>greater</i> Brisbane area, not the Brisbane metropolitan area (which is the Suburbs within the BCC). As the metropolitan Brisbane area does not include Logan City suburbs, Redlands Shire (eg Capalaba, Cleveland), Beaudessert, Caboolture (more closer to Sunshine Coast than Brisbane, but is inbetween those areas). --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">Arnzy</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/n/User_talk%7EArnzy_d126.html" title="User talk:Arnzy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arnzy_0c85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arnzy">contribs</a>) 01:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm looking at all the other 4 major cities and several minor ones, and seeing a very different definition of metropolitan. If it's based on city council boundaries, Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide would be tiny areas with populations in the 4 and 5 digits. Yet they count areas more than 60km from their CBD (32 in Adelaide's case, as a smaller centre). Some parts of Pine Rivers and Redlands in particular aren't even 15km from Brisbane, a city of comparable size to Perth. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 11:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It has been stated before, the suburbs you refer to that belong to Logan City and other areas are not considered to be part of brisbane by anyone who actually lives here. Unlike the 4 cities you mention where the other areas are considered to be part of the main city. Ask a resident of pine rivers shire 'where do I live', and they will not reply 'brisbane'. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmeraj_5b0a.html" title="User:Rimmeraj">Rimmeraj</a> 12:20, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll keep it short (as we are well and truly off-topic), but just to say I do know people in both Redlands and Logan who describe themselves as Brisbane residents, the ABS does not differentiate between Brisbane and other cities, and that forms the basis of my belief that the situation isn't so different that it requires a radical departure from Australian norms. This discussion, however, should as cj said continue elsewhere. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 05:25, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Except that Brisbane is a special case, they control the largest area by LGA, and thus the Brisbane suburbs are by the ones within the BCC area. As suburbs in Logan City, Redlands, Caboolture (Caboolture is considered Sunshine Coast sometimes) are not considered as part of metropolitan Brisbane, but rather <i>greater</i> Brisbane. As rimmeraj said, ask anyone from the outer LGAs where they live and they will <i>NOT</i> reply Brisbane, but the appropriate area (eg Logan, Pine Rivers, etc). --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">Arnzy</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/n/User_talk%7EArnzy_d126.html" title="User talk:Arnzy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arnzy_0c85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arnzy">contribs</a>) 01:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
