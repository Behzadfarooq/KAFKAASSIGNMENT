<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Comment</b>. About "it seems as if it were written by a studio executive", just summarize the reactions from the people involved instead of quoting them in full, and the problem is solved. Other than those quotes, I don't see anything objectionable with the article. As Qutezuce said, it is just an article about a future film (one that's been talked about in the press quite a bit) like any other. This one's pretty high-profile, so while of course it could get cancelled (ANY future film could), there are plenty of sources verifying its existence. I think it would be more usefull for Wikipedia to have an article about it than to not ackowledge its existence because there's a slight chance that it won't be released (a chance which is always there with any future film). See: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. Unless you're advocating that ALL future film articles on Wikipedia be deleted, I don't see any reason to single this one out. If you ARE advocating that, this is not the place to do it. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 13:58, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: One more thing, the article needs more references or external links than just one from IMDB which requires an IMDBPro membership.

<li>If it "has been talked about in the press quite a bit" then those press references should be cited in the article.

<li><i>"Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place"</i>. The film isn't "almost certain" to take place; like I said, films get cancelled all the time and this one has been in development (with Elton John) for over two years at least (see <a href="http://www.comingsoon.net/news.php?id=3273" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comingsoon.net/news.php?id=3273" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).

<li>Even if plans do occasionally fall apart, that's not for us to say. From the looks of the evidence we have, this will be happening. I'm sorry you disagree. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:23, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, a movie is not an event, it is a movie, so that section does not apply. This article is not about the date of the release of the movie, or the premiere party -- it is about the movie itself. And the movie currently exists, it does not exist as a series of 80000+ individual frames with accompanying audio, but it exists in the press, it exists in a early pre-production stage. Whether or not it actually comes out is a not relevent. If you want to argue that this be deleted you should be arguing that this film in its current state does not warrant inclusion because it is not notable enough. My counter-argument to that is that future films are acceptable fodder for articles (the Wikipedia is not a crystal ball section specifically mentions articles about future films when it says that those articles must be careful not to be advertising, hence it makes them acceptable articles as long as they are written in an NPOV manner), and this film in particular has merited mention in the press. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 06:12, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with what Qutezuce just said. Even IF the film doesn't come out, it's been talked about in the press enough to warrant an article. There are films which have never been released that have articles about them (see: <a href="../../../u/n/f/Category%7EUnfinished_films_9363.html" title="Category:Unfinished films">Category:Unfinished films</a>). If it is never released, the article could be changed to say that very fact in the opening line; that it was an animation project for which Elton John was to do the soundtrack that was never released. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, so I see nothing wrong with having an article on an unreleased film. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 14:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
