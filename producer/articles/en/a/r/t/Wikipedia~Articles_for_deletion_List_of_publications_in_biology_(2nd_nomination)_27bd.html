<ul>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - This article is far too broad and biased toward certain publications. It is impossible to list all notable biology publications. This is an absurd idea. Also, many articles here are posted by the writers themselves (aka vanity). --24.163.65.156 22:04, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - It is the subject that is broad. The list of subcategories makes it workable. To be of value it doesn't need to list ALL notable publications, only a few in each area - then it serves as real value to those looking to find more information. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveWolfer_b631.html" title="User:SteveWolfer">SteveWolfer</a> 16:21, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move</b> to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_publications_in_biology.html" title="List of important publications in biology">List of important publications in biology</a> or something more specific. Personally I think its a great idea to attempt to list the most important publications in a field - I think it would be very useful to a lot of people. However, there need to be tougher inclusion criteria to prevent an overload of self-promotion. I'd suggest defining the inclusion criteria more strictly, eliminating the "Latest and greatest" option (since a "latest and greatest" idea should be inherently important otherwise and a separate listing may allow people to sneak in cruft because its new. Also, its probably a good idea to delete all the entries that don't establish why they're notable. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 00:33, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Making a page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_publications_in_biology.html" title="List of important publications in biology">List of important publications in biology</a> would violate <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> since you would be expressing your point of view on deciding which biology publications are important and which are not. And even if you could determine notability of all publications listing every single 'notable' publication is physically impossible. In my opinion, it would just be best to add a category of Biology publication/literature and then mark all biology literature pages with that category. [This may have been already done, you need to check]. --24.163.65.156 02:02, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Taken too literally, EVERYTHING is POV (isn't it your POV that 'importance' can't be determined except as POV?) We need to focus on value to the readers as well. This can be a valuable source of information. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveWolfer_b631.html" title="User:SteveWolfer">SteveWolfer</a> 16:21, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. However, all entries should not be kept if they do not assert importance and users should be free to call for a debate on the talk page about whether an entry should be deleted or not. If consensus can be reached about entries this is an important introduction for people to what are the most important publications in particular areas of biology. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 08:51, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: this is something hard to impossible manage without stable article feature and expert overview. It has value but WP isn't yet ready for such articles. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 02:34, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, more useful than a category because it can explain when something was published and why its important. And yes these things all belong in a category together. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:08, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> to Seminal publications in Biology or a more specific name, otherwise <b>delete</b>. While it would be nice to have an annotated list of the key publication, these pages don't seem to do the job, ending up as a rag bag of books by peoples PhD advisiors. There might be a way to make such lists work by making them more specific and being vigriously monitored. Limiting the scope could work, say with one page for key historical works (say 100 years old or more), one for paradime shifting/breakthrough works, one for text books and one for popular science books. p.s. I've just removed all those entries which don't assert importance. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 14:38, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> to Seminal publications in Biology or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_publications_in_biology.html" title="List of important publications in biology">List of important publications in biology</a> and live with the fact that it will be a conflict magnet and draw lots of 2nd rate books and need lots of attention. It is worth it. Few things are as valuable as a place to discover a good book in the subject area you want. Be firm in deleting entries with no justification or support and mark those in dispute with a letter D (in brackets) to indicate it is in dispute but has multiple supporters. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveWolfer_b631.html" title="User:SteveWolfer">SteveWolfer</a> 16:04, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and do not rename. It's useful as is. <a href="../../../7E/k/_/User%7E_K_952c.html" title="User:~K">~K</a> 17:26, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> list cruft that takes too much effort from too many good people to police. It should be a category at best. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 21:27, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think it should stay, they could tighten up the criteria by including only publications that have merited an article for an author, the main theory purported or the book itself i.e Darwin's origin of species would count on all three, some of the others on this page would count on two counts as well. I still think this is an important page as a start for people, even if it doesn't conform to usual Wiki policy, although I think with my suggestion it gets closer. If absolutely necessary I'm sure we could get references that talk about science references in these sort of terms or even reviews in journals and newspapers. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerri_G_3a66.html" title="User:Terri G">Terri G</a> 14:01, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (although I wouldn't oppose a rename). It is a useful page. <a href="../../../i/t/u/User%7EItub_c2f2.html" title="User:Itub">Itub</a> 15:28, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and possibly rename</b>. Could be of interest to someone looking to purchase a textbook in a particular area. As it's an extremely basic guide to a few key publications in various biological subjects, a large number of people should be able to verify the book/article's importance, reducing the inherent PoV problems. Renaming could be useful; I'd suggest 'basic' or 'fundamental' rather than 'important', as many of these are student texts. Alternatively, it could be split into textbooks and historically significant research articles. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 19:38, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
