<dd>See my question for Dark below. How is this list any different from those lists of people who are left-handed? Catholic? Eagle Scouts? Personally, I don't like these lists, but if Wikipedia allows list of famous people, why does this one pose a POV problem when others do not? Also, all but one of the people left on the list can be confirmed as a Military Brat. I left one because her biography's sound like a person who could have been a military brat, and somebody obviously added her thinking she was.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 18:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Many people consider the word "brat" to be a rather crude slur. It isn't meant to be so here, but if you're not familiar with the history of the word it's a fair assumption. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 19:45, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed... but if the criticism comes from a lack of understanding of the term, then I have to ask, does TBC still feel that the list is POV? I'm asking this because this is a work in progress, and I can't address the concern if the concern is based upon an incorrect understanding of the term. Does he say that it is "undeniably POV" because he sees the "Brat" and doesn't understand the meaning? Or is there another reason that I am missing that makes this list different from other lists of famous people? It also raises questions about the need to have this AfD if the original proposer did so failing to understand the term.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 20:03, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've never said that I thought the term had some sort of negative connotation. Anyhow, yes, I do feel the list is still POV, mainly because the list contains numerous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;diff=85036336&amp;oldid=85007881#Possible_Military_Brats---branch_of_service_or_status_unconfirmed" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;diff=85036336&amp;oldid=85007881#Possible_Military_Brats---branch_of_service_or_status_unconfirmed" rel="nofollow">"possible" military brats</a>, meaning that the writer is only assuming the person is a "military brat". --<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 22:22, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, I don't see how POV comes up, as there is no bias in saying they are possible military brats. In fact, given the comments afterwards, I'd say "Unknown Branch of service" would be a better title. But really, I think your criticsm is off-target. That problem isn't POV at all. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:45, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I deleted the ONE person whose status was unconfirmed. AS I mentioned above, all of the others (in that section) are known to be military brats, just not the branch of service. If you hit "Edit page" on your link you would see that all but one had comments associated with them stating that their status as a military brat was confirmed. In subsequent edits, these comments were brought to the main user page to be visible. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 23:13, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Responding to Manticore's comment, when the heading says "status unconfirmed", it gives me an impression that the author of the page doesn't know if the person is still in the army or not, thus POV. As for Ballonman's comment, please realize that when I first commented <i>none</i> of the "possible" military brats were confirmed.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 00:57, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, then perhaps that's something to change yourself to make more clear, or bring up on the article's Talk page. I can understand your problem, but it's not a deletion problem, it's a content-problem. They are different things. In this case, the thing to do is seek out confirmation/refutation. I don't much care whether it's left there or not pending that action, since it's not derogatory in any way, but if you do, move it to the talk page. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:08, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Um, we're discussing something because you brought it up. Now I would say this is clearly a better choice for the article's talk page, but you didn't bring it up there, so it gets discussed here. And while sometimes content does merit deletion of an article, it doesn't always. Too many people jump to deletion when other choices are much better. It's quite a bother really. And in response to your question below, we don't need a list of EVERY person. However, some folks like to see examples, so providing a few people is worth doing. Since the backgrounds of many people are verifiable, and that often includes the circumstances of their childhood, it's perfectly reasonable to put that information in this article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:18, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I brought it up because AfD is a <i>discussion</i>, not a vote.

<dd>Also, why do we need a list of every person that a <i>slang</i> (albeit well known) term applies to? For example, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grease_monkey.html" title="Grease monkey">grease monkey</a> is a notable slang term for a mechanic, but that doesn't mean we should include every notable mechanic, real or fictional, within the article.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 04:53, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why do we need lists of famous Baptist? Catholics? Left-handers? Personally, I don't like these lists, but the reason why one would keep it here is because [Military Brat] isn't simply a slang term. [Military Brat]s are people who have been affected by who/what they are. Military Brat is used to indicate one who has been affect by a particular culture.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 07:53, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Military Brats" is, and has always been, a slang term. Whether or not a person is effected by the term does <i>not</i> make it any more formal. For example, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slur.html" title="Ethnic slur">ethnic slurs</a> have often effected millions of lives, yet does it mean we should list many of the notable people that they apply to?--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 19:07, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ethnic Slurs are slurs, not a description of a culture or sociological group of people. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Brat_c539.html" title="Military Brat">Military Brat</a> is a term used to describe a unique identifiable researched culture. To call a person an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slur.html" title="Ethnic slur">ethnic slur</a> does not describe describe the socio-economic-cultural influences that have contributed to who that person is. It says more about the person using the slur. Psychologist and sociologist do not study <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slurs.html" title="Ethnic slurs">ethnic slurs</a>, they study the population that the slurs represent. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_brat.html" title="Military brat">Military brat</a> does tell you about the person it is used to describe. To know that somebody is a military brat tells you something about that person's upbringing and what made that person who he/she is. So your comparison to an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slur.html" title="Ethnic slur">ethnic slur</a> is a strawman agrument. I am still waiting for somebody to give me a reasonable rationale as to why a list of famous military brats is less appropriate than famous left-handed people! Or any one of the other lists on Wikipedia. I don't care for lists, but I'm still waiting for somebody to give a rataional why this list is worse than left handers!<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 21:51, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I've stated above, <b>slangs should not include lists of people that apply to the term</b>.

<dd>The term may be used primarily in the US/Canada/Britian, but the phenomena is universal.

<li><b>Keep and Clean-up</b> There are some poorly written parts in this article, but I don't see it as deletion material. It is a valid concept, and a commonly used phrase. Better than civilian dependents anyway. BLP problems don't really apply, since there's nothing inherently pejorative about being a military brat. POV? I'm afraid I don't see how, except for being US-centric, but that's hardly a surprise. Worldwide perspective is hard when you're editors are condensd into a small area. At the least though, keeping some examples is a good idea. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:51, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Then mark the page as unsourced. Doesn't mean it's not unsourceable. I found at least one book with the title as "Military Brats" and a google scholar search coms up with more <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Military+brats&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Military+brats&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Seriously, this article might be sketchy, but it's certainly improvable. As for the examples, um, check their bios on Wikipedia. I checked a dozen. Some may be iffy on the whether or not they were a military brat, but most of their Wikipedia articles do mention a military background. The only exception I found was <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Hamill_2513.html" title="Mark Hamill">Mark Hamill</a>, and well, <a href="http://www.starwars.com/bio/markhamill.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.starwars.com/bio/markhamill.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> confirms it, so not a problem in his case.

<dd>As for the "POV list." The list of "Unknown" brats was MUCH longer. I'm not a big fan of lists, but having said that, you can find list of famous people in almost every category: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_left-handed_people.html" title="List of famous left-handed people">List of famous left-handed people</a>,<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Eagle_Scouts_9cb4.html" title="List of Eagle Scouts">List of Eagle Scouts</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Baptists_e040.html" title="List of Baptists">List of Baptists</a>, or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_tuberculosis_victims.html" title="List of famous tuberculosis victims">List of famous tuberculosis victims</a>. If a list, by default is POV, then all of these lists have to be deleted. Many of them are not well cited. When I was working on it last night I eliminated a number of people I couldn't confirm and this has been a subject of discussion on the articles talk page. But is not worthy of deleting the article on this principle. I debated adding links to the one's I found, but chose not to for consistency. (This section and the one on pop culture are my two least favorite sections.)

<dd>Being a military brat is a fact too... one either has a military parent or one doesn't. The article quoting Admiral Blair, Admiral Blair says, <i>There’s a <b>standard term for the military child: "Brat."</b> The Navy also uses the term "Junior," but "Brat" seems to cut across all the services. While it sounds pejorative, it’s actually a term of great affection.</i> <a href="http://www.pacom.mil/speeches/sst2000/milchild.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pacom.mil/speeches/sst2000/milchild.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Military brat is not synonymous with Brat. Mary Edwards Wertsch, author of "Military Brats: Legacies of Childhood inside the fortress" says that brats have such values as idealism, antiracisism, loyalty, patriotism and honesty. These phrases would not be used if brat was derogatory. ("Military brats are a special breed" by Rudi Williams American Forces Press Services.)</dd>

<dd>I think I just realized something, are you associating the term Military Brat with the term Brat? If so, I understand better your concern. In which case, it is completely unjustified as it does not represent what the term Military Brat means. Military Brat is not in any way derogatory. IN fact, most brats embrace the term. The two terms are not interchangeable, being a military brat is a point of fact, not opinion.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 17:38, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Let me ask you a question, is the reason why you think the "POV List" is POV because you believe that it is a judgement on the people cited? That by calling "Mark Hammill" a military brat we are evaluating him in some derogatory manner as compared to stating a simple fact? Are you interpretting the list as "Mark Hammill is a spoiled brat" as compared to "Mark Hammill's father was in the military?" If so, then your concern about the "POV list" has been addressed. It is not a judgement on the individuals, but rather a statement of fact. Did the person listed grow up as a military brat? <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 18:04, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As for the statement, <i>There appear to be few or no sources for ... even the definition itself.'</i> Do a quick search through wikipedia articles and I doubt if you will find many that cite sources for the <b>definition itself.</b> The only time you might find a citation is the use of an usual term/phrase. The term military brat is not an unusual term that needs special sources to define---ask ANY military brat what that means and they will give you a similar definition. This is common knowledge.
<dl>
<dd>Reading Dark's comments about "Brat" being an opinion, I think he said, "even the definition itself" is in reference to the "POV list." I think he was looking for a definition as to why these people were "Brats" not realizing that "Brats" is a term used positively in reference to military dependents.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 19:44, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um, School life, Frequent and Unexpect moves, impact on Military Member's careers may be unsourced, but they are hardly "extreme" original research. I wouldn't even say it's original research. If you want sources try: <a href="http://www.militarychild.org/pdfs/press/ConferenceLooksMilitaryBratsJuly05.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.militarychild.org/pdfs/press/ConferenceLooksMilitaryBratsJuly05.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> or <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Aug2001/n08202001_200108203.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Aug2001/n08202001_200108203.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. All these positions are well-represented in terms of study and reporting on them. Even Patriotism is documented elsewhere. Yes, this article may be poorly written, but your comments are an exaggeration. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:00, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still think most of it is original research. Remember, we are an encyclopedia, a secondary source; we are supposed to summarize and report in a neutral manner on what is written in <i>reputable</i> primary sources. All those sections do not cite any primary sources (and I frankly doubt you can find any neutral, respectable sources), so it very much looks like original research, or at least private opinion by the original contributor (which is also unacceptable by encyclopedic standards). I very much urge everyone to stand back and reflect, for a moment, whether this information is really appropriate for a respectable general-knowledge encyclopedia, such as Wikipedia aspires to be. <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 02:40, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um, to me, it's an unquestioned "Yes, of course Wikipedia should have information on this subject" as Military brats are a distinct population, in fact, the whole problem of civilian depedents is a real issue of substantive importance, and it is unique enough to warrant its own article. And I'm sorry, but there is a fair amount of scientific study on them. Here's an example: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=S7E4fqYEgMwC&amp;dq=Military+brats&amp;psp=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=S7E4fqYEgMwC&amp;dq=Military+brats&amp;psp=9" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. That certainly seems reputable to me. The US Gov't also does reports. See page 28 of this document <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0180.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0180.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> for a description of what the services do. I'm sure the GAO has more, but they have so much, it's hard to find things sometimes. But they certainly meet the criteria of a neutral, respectable source. There's probably more from other country's militaries, and having that would be important, but I must admit ignorance of that. I find your perspective on this article difficult to comprehend. I can understand saying this article isn't great, and needs work, but your arguments for deletion just don't make sense to me. Problems perhaps, but rectifiable ones. Why is this article any different than an article on <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_body_shape.html" title="Female body shape">female body shape</a> or <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_family.html" title="Nuclear family">nuclear family</a>.

<dd>I can -- just possibly -- agree with the solution proposed by the author of the comment just below: slash the article to a paragraph or so, and build up from that using actual sources.

<dd>I disagree, as this article just isn't bad enough that it needs that kind of action. There are times that is a good idea, but in this case, it simply is not necessary.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Wow what a terrible article in its current state - so full of POV and OR. The listcruft needs to be trimmed down as well (possibly to zero). However, all excessive harshness aside, "Military brat" is a term thats definitely widely used (do a title search on Amazon.com). Recommend after the AFD, the closing admin slashes the article down to a paragraph or so (or message me, I'll do it) and building it up from there using some actual sources. Pretty much delete all the content, but keep the title. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 20:22, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I personally don't like lists of people, but before we get rid of the list, I want somebody to explain to me how a list of military brats is less acceptable than a list of famous left-handed people? Or Eagle Scout? Or people who suffered TB? Somebody (or multiple somebodies) took a lot of time to compile the list and without sound justification, I'm reluctant to get rid of it. I am not trying to be belligerent, but rather understand what the criticism is.

I ask you to look at the article as it stood <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;oldid=84869444" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;oldid=84869444" rel="nofollow">two days ago</a> and compare it to what was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;oldid=85036336" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;oldid=85036336" rel="nofollow">proposed for deletion</a>. Then compare that to what <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_brat.html" title="Military brat">now exists</a>. This is a work in progress. I posted to the Wiki Help Desk asking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Help_desk#military_brats" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Help_desk#military_brats" rel="nofollow">| help/advice</a> because I knew it needed help---but there was only so much I could do in one night. As a person who has just recently started to become active on Wikipedia, this has been a very disillusioning process. I saw an article that was in desperate need of improvement and that has personal meaning to me. Start to work on said article. I ask for help/advice and instead of spending time improving said article, I have to defend it here. Yeah, I know that most people are saying <b>keep</b>, but that doesn't alleviate the frustration. BTW, the changes made tonight will be the last one's I make for a few days---I'll be travelling the rest of this week. But to be honest, I may or may not resume this endeavor when I return. Does the article still need help? Yes. I hold no illusions that it is finalized (I didn't even proof my own text), but I don't get paid by wikipedia to fix poorly written articles or put up with this. Again, as an essential newbie, this has turned me off of wikipedia somewhat.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 10:05, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>COMMENT:</b> Three other things to note. First, I have ordered two books from Inter Library Loan on the subject. Those will probably take a few weeks to arrive (long after this AfD is over.) Second, there are few other articles out there that I think need a lot of work. What can I do to prevent those articles from being nominated for deletion while enhancing them? This one most likely came to Dark's attention via the help desk or recent changes. If I start working on an existing article I don't want to have to defend it in an unfinished status.
