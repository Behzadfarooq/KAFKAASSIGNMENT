<li><b>Comment</b>: How did we get two articles on the same surname? The thing is, there are surnames in Chinese with the same spelling but different characters and tones. Does this mean editors would prefer to have, for example, a discussion of two discrete surnames in one single article (avoiding the use of the Chinese character and tone mark in the article title)? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 18:29, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and <b>Comment</b> surnames are different, Chinese characters in title are necessary here, since many <b>different</b> surnames have same romanization, but they are absolutely not the same thing.

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_%28surname%29.html" title="Li (surname)">Li (surname)</a> article does group it by character, so I'm not sure what your objection is here. The problem here is that this is a very unlikely search term and Wikipedia article titles are generally optimized for searching purposes. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:30, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It doesn't work well by grouping CKV surnames by pronuciation, in this case, Wikipedia currently groups "李", "黎", "理", "里", and etc in a single article. This is a bad idea. Since these surnames are totally different, and no relations among them except its romanization. This is say Chinese surnames. But the same surname "李" (and many others) also found in Korea, Vietnam, and Singapore, and they have the same origin and written form, but different pronuciations and romanizations in different countries (unfortunately!), so don't you think it makes far better sense to group all "李"s, not "Li"s in a single article? <a href="../../../y/a/o/User%7EYao_Ziyuan_1354.html" title="User:Yao Ziyuan">Yao Ziyuan</a> 23:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> My objections aren't to this. My objection is simply that this is a limitation of the system. Since use of diacritics <i>and</i> non-latin characters in main article titles (ie non-redirects) are strongly discouraged (because of certain limitations of the English-language keyboard and older systems which don't render Chinese characters without additional software; this matters less with redirects, but is a problem for the main article), there's no way to have an article with the title mentioned, without it being very messy. Non-latin characters are discouraged in non-signature usernames for this reason as well. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 01:16, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I see. But use Chinese character in title is the most effictive way to disambiguate for surnames. In China, when people ask someone for their surnames, he/she will answers the question like: <i>"Lǐ", and the "Lǐ" with 木 at top and 子 at bottom.</i>, so you see, this is way too long to suitable for disambiguation titles. Second, it is the page creator's business to name the title, other readers and editors can safely ignore the Chinese characters in title, and read or edit the article without any inconvenience. <a href="../../../y/a/o/User%7EYao_Ziyuan_1354.html" title="User:Yao Ziyuan">Yao Ziyuan</a> 01:43, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - as far as the English language is concerned, these are the same name.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - This is not a "sort" thing. This is what something actually to be. 李 and 黎 are different, just like any other two surnames are different, pronuciation doesn't make too much sense when considering surnames, but the written form is the most important. <a href="../../../y/a/o/User%7EYao_Ziyuan_1354.html" title="User:Yao Ziyuan">Yao Ziyuan</a> 04:09, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep separate</b>. 李 and 黎 are separate names, and both are common. If you don't like Chinese characters in the title, then use Pinyin tone marks, but the articles should be kept separate. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 04:16, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep separate</b>. True it is that "Lǐ (李)" is an unlikely search term for English-speaking users, but so are other foreign-named article names such as <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblioth%C3%A8que_Fran%C3%A7ois_Mitterrand_%28Paris_Metro_and_RER%29_a67e.html" title="Bibliothèque François Mitterrand (Paris Metro and RER)">Bibliothèque François Mitterrand (Paris Metro and RER)</a>. It is inappropriate to group different things in the same article simply because they have the same romanisation. An analogy is the provinces of <a href="../../../s/h/%C7%8E/Sh%C7%8Enx%C4%AB.html" title="Shǎnxī">Shǎnxī</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanxi.html" title="Shanxi">Shānxī</a>. These two provinces have the "same" romanisation, and it is unlikely that anyone would be typing search names with tonal marks, yet we work around it by spelling the former differently (as <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaanxi.html" title="Shaanxi">Shaanxi</a>). Imo, <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_%28surname%29.html" title="Li (surname)">Li (surname)</a> should be a disambiguation page, splitting off into articles about the various different surnames. We have the technology to disambiguate, so why shouldn't we do it? --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/m/User_talk%7ESumple_b763.html" title="User talk:Sumple">Talk</a>) 05:14, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> pointless fork per nom. The contents are duplicated except that the <a href="../../../l/%C7%90/_/L%C7%90_%28%E6%9D%8E%29_%28surname%29.html" title="Lǐ (李) (surname)">Lǐ (李) (surname)</a> article excludes the people with surname 黎. From a navigational pov, I agree with <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a>. An <a href="../../../q/w/e/Qwerty.html" title="Qwerty">qwerty</a> or <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerty.html" title="Azerty">azerty</a> searcher will certainly be content with a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disambiguation.html" title="Disambiguation">dab</a> within the page <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_%28surname%29.html" title="Li (surname)">Li (surname)</a> rather than type the name with awkward accents which are not on the keyboard. The only problem, though is the linking of articles to chinese wikipedia for the different Li's. There is <a href="../../../../zh/%E6%9D%8E/%E5%A7%93/_/%E6%9D%8E%E5%A7%93.html" class="extiw" title="zh:李姓">only one Li</a> article at the moment, so let's not complicate matters, and deal with the problem when it comes up.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I do not understand your view described above quite clearly. But I think the goal of English Wikipedia is to describe <b>fact</b> in English language. Here the fact is several different family names are discussing in one single article, so split these family names, have each of them their own article. Nothing wrong, right?

<li><b>Keep seperate</b> We cannot have one page covering so many radically different things.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The original article does quite a good job to describe and disambiguate the different Chinese characters with the same 'Li' sound, and also provided direct links to a number of individual biographies. I simply feel that placing a dab page like the one <a href="../../../y/a/o/User%7EYao_Ziyuan_1354.html" title="User:Yao Ziyuan">Yao Ziyuan</a> did (and which I have reverted for now) is unhelpful to the English-language user who by this initial stage is forced to be able to recognise the differrent Chinese characters (or the pinyin marks) which I think is mighty unfair. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:09, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I encountered this problem with creating the <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a> article. Luckily the other surnames pronounced Yuan are very minor so they could be dealt with in a footnote. In the case of Li, this cannot be done, as the surname 黎 is statiscally important enough to warrant its own section at the very least. However, I don't think that creating separate articles using Chinese characters is a solution. As has already been stated, it is an unlikely search time, and the use of non-Latin scripts is discouraged on Wikipedia. Also, the title looks decidely clumsy. In the end, we have to accept that this is an English language encyclopedia. Its articles necessarily take the perspective of the English language, even when dealing with Chinese concepts. Inserting Chinese characters as a reference tool parallel to the English is one thing, but it is quite another to use Chinese characters as meaningful entities by themselves. This runs the risk of shifting this English encylopedia to a foreign language one. I think we can only try to explain and differentiate Chinese surnames within the article itself. <a href="../../../y/e/u/User%7EYeu_Ninje_bda4.html" title="User:Yeu Ninje">Yeu Ninje</a> 13:25, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>few keyboards are so equipped. But let's put that to one side for a moment. I completely understand where <a href="../../../y/a/o/User%7EYao_Ziyuan_1354.html" title="User:Yao Ziyuan">Yao Ziyuan</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">Deadkid dk</a> are coming from. They are approaching the problem from a Chinese linguistic angle, whereas in fact we need an English linguistic solution. To occidentals, they are not radically different: it hardly matters whether a "Li" is "李", "黎", "理", "里", the starting point is still an 'L' and an 'i' on the keyboard. They are no doubt at that page to learn more about the distinctions, and perhaps the subtleties of the pronunciation, so it is convenient (indeed essential) to group them together. Furthermore, the average person searching English wikipedia is probably as incapable of recognising the different chinese characters, or correcly use the accents which make up the 4 pinyin tones, as I am incapable of deciphering arabic writing. So when trying to move this debate forward, I would suggest that the above editors considered how they would respond when faced with navigation pages based on, say, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_script.html" title="Arabic script">arabic script</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">sanskrit</a>. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:42, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I do agree that alphabeticisation can still fail&#160;; a picture can often paint a thousand words, to coin a phrase. The debate which you linked to above still does not propose any solution which is workable to the average English user of wikipedia. In fact. it pretty much mirrors the one we are having here. But really, how would you respond when faced with navigation pages based on, say, arabic script or sanskrit, bearing in mind you're in English wikipedia? <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:13, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm trying best to make my solution workable to average English users. My solution: (1) Title style: <i>Pinyin (Chinese character) (surname)</i>, pinyin is readable for English reader, Chinese character here for removal of ambiguities, <i>(surname)</i> tells average users what Pinyin here mean if he/she has no background knowledge of Chinese names. (2) A user do <b>not</b> have to know Chinese characters: The characters is in bracket only for disambiguation purpose, readers and editors can safely ignore it and reading or editing the article, use what Chinese text in bracket is page creator's business. I'm trying my best for <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, since pinyin is PRC stuff, but the surnames might be used in several different East Asian countries. I can't find another romanization better for this situation (might be somewhat unfair to Korean speakers, but I'm trying my best). <a href="../../../y/a/o/User%7EYao_Ziyuan_1354.html" title="User:Yao Ziyuan">Yao Ziyuan</a> 14:27, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Nominations (linking to page of the day, FAs, AfDs) requires the article title to be pasted in.

<li><b>The fact:</b> completely different surnames might have exactly the same pronunciation and romanization, but on the other hand, many same surnames of China origin have found and extensively used in other East Asian countries with different pronunciations and romanizations. Chinese character to Roman is not a relation of one-to-one or one-to-more, but more-to-more. The relation is too complex to figure out what the surname actually be only by its romanizations. There is no way to organize each surname under one single article title unless we use Chinese characters in title to disambiguate (only for disambiguation purpose). I'm propose to use "Pinyin (Chinese) (surname)" form of title for surname articles, this can be read and edit (but not create) by both people who can or cannot speak Chinese, no matter if he/she has installed Chinese font. As a IT/computing expert, I see no technical problem by using Chinese characters at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../y/a/o/User%7EYao_Ziyuan_1354.html" title="User:Yao Ziyuan">Yao Ziyuan</a> 08:27, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think I can see the fundamental difference between the "Keep" camp and the "Merge" camp: If you think of this as "an article about the <i>surname 'Li' in English</i>", then the "different" <i>Li</i>s should be in the same article. But, if you think of this as "an article or articles about the <i>various East Asian surnames</i>, which <i>can</i> be written as "Li" in English, then they should be kept separate. Obviously, coming from a Chinese cultural background I see things from the latter p.o.v., whereas I would guess that editors from a non-East Asian background would see things from the former p.o.v. So I guess the question we are really asking is, what are we trying to write an article on: the "English" word (surname) <i>Li</i>? or the underlying Asian names that "Li" represents? If the former, merge. If the latter, separate. --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/m/User_talk%7ESumple_b763.html" title="User talk:Sumple">Talk</a>) 08:02, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The thing that have puzzled me most in this discussion is the fact that people who wish to keep the article, take the Chinese language as the norm and then tries to fix whatever is "lacking" in the English language. The fundamental problem is that no two languages correspond one to one, and we should not try to impose the logic of one language on another. I want to stress that this is a two way street: my experience is that editors on other language versions of Wikipedia (such as Chinese) are sensitive to impositions of foreign language logic on their language - and we should be equally sensitive here at English Wikipedia. I am not saying that languages don't change and that Wikipedia should not reflect that. But this is not the place to reinvent language and for want of a better norm we should stick to the norm "in Rome do as Romans" do, or 入乡随俗 as we say in Chinese.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It doesn't matter that the chinese character has many meanings - we only care about the meaning that applies in this particular case. This is no different from someone with an English name that can be pronounced in many ways and have different meanings. Suppose someone was called 'Tom Bow' - Bow can be something that shoots an arrow or the front part of a ship - and it can be pronounced in two different ways and spelled 'Bough' and sound the same. We don't care because it's just a name. The fact that the same kinds of ambiguity exists in chinese isn't a reason to start making things even more confusing for English readers. Pick whichever meaning applies and put it in brackets after the name if disambiguation is necessary - explaining the differences in detail inside the article. Putting a symbol that it utterly incomprehensible to almost all of our readers quite simply doesn't help in any way - in fact it makes matters worse because we can't read it aloud OR type it. The precedent this would set for other articles would be unbearable. If we allow this, then shouldn't the article on Aristotle be called Ἀριστοτέλης instead because 'Aristotle' is only an approximate spelling based on the latin alphabet? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 05:35, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's not a fair comparison at all. The various "Li" surnames are actually written differently *and* pronounced differently in Chinese. When properly transliterated, whether via Pinyin or W-G, many of them look different. All they have in common is that, when transliterated in English, they are commonly written the same way.</dd>
<dd>It would be analogous to, say, there being two towns, one called <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes%2C_Greece_2264.html" title="Thebes, Greece">Θήβα</a> and the other called <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes%2C_Egypt_aa8c.html" title="Thebes, Egypt">niwt</a></i>, but which are both called "<a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes.html" title="Thebes">Thebes</a>" in English. Yet, we keep them on different pages because <i>they are different things</i>.</dd>
<dd>The distinguishing feature of the present debate from the Thebes situation is that we have no effective way to technically disambiguate the various surnames that correspond to "Li".</dd>
<dd>And, as I have said before, IMO the fundamental question is whether we are having an article about the English transliteration "Li" per se, or the underlying Asian surnames which are represented by it.

<dd>So call the article Li (surname pronounced as XXX) where 'XXX' is whatever most accurately approximates the correct pronunciation using the English/Latin character set. There must be <b>some</b> means to disambiguate these articles without resorting to a useless and incomprehensible (to most of our readers) symbol. I simply do not believe that you couldn't (with a little imagination and subject matter expertise) come up with some means to state the differences between these surnames without resorting to a chinese character. Remember, I'm only talking about the title of the article. I have no problem whatever with appropriate use of the chinese character in the body of the article or in the body of the disambiguation page for 'Li'. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 15:02, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The problem which underlies our discussion is the structure of the language. Chinese is words are all monosyllabic with 4 tones (mandarin only), and there may be a number of homonyms for each tone. I had proposed the Li 1/2/3/4 elsewhere as a partial solution to the issue, as chinese scholars are familiar with the notation which represents the tones in mandarin. However, the simple fact is that it cannot be suitably disambiguated without either chinese characters or the use of extremely long descriptions like "Li" with 'mu' at top and 'zi' at bottom, in which case I vote for the latter. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:24, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Rename</b>. I guess if we keep all the <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li.html" title="Li">Lis</a> in one article, it would eventually become way too long. I would recommend that we rename them all according to their sound. Those special characters are not good to be included in the article title, so we can adjust them to be something like these:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Lī -&gt; Li (1) - Probably won't need it as there is no matching Chinese lastname.</dd>
<dd>Lí -&gt; Li (2) - Which is most likely for 黎 only.</dd>
<dd>Lǐ -&gt; Li (3) - Focus on 李, but address 理 or 里 also if necessary.</dd>
<dd>Lì -&gt; Li (4) - 立?</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - here is Jimbo's take, straight from his talk page:</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>First, a rant, and then some limited support for your proposal.&#160;:)<br />
<br />
I am deeply, deeply opposed to the use of ALL non-English characters in the titles of articles in English Wikipedia in most cases. This is already a horrible problem in such cases as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem_c9b6.html" title="Stanisław Lem">Stanisław Lem</a>. Look closely at that... it contains the character "ł", which is not an English character. Therefore, it is wrong as a title for an article in the English Wikipedia. Because of the nature of English as a mongrel language with no official academy or spelling rules, there can be rare exceptions where some special non-English characters are extremely well known as part of a proper name. I accept this. So be it. But this is not license to play it deuces-wild and dispense with the entire English spelling system.<br />
<br />
The correct name of Munich, in English, is Munich. This despite the fact that it could be written as the Germans write it: München, or perhaps even Anglicized as Muenchen. The correct English name for the capital of Japan is Tokyo. It would be deeply wrong to write that "The capital of 日本 is 東京." It would be also wrong to say "The capital of Nippon is Tōkyō... or any other variant. <i>In English</i> the name is "Tokyo".<br />
<br />
Now, having given that rant, I find that I must take what might seem to some a contradictory position. In the case you are considering... purely for disambiguation purposes, the subject of the page is, in a sense, the character itself. I find this to be an interesting proposal, and I promise not to blow a gasket about it. It is not for me to decide of course.<br />
<br />
(And notice that although I think the community has made a deeply wrong decision in the case of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem_c9b6.html" title="Stanisław Lem">Stanisław Lem</a>, I keep mostly quiet about that, too.)<br />

<li><b>My comment from Jimbo's talk page</b> - Jimbo, I am one of the participants in the debate whether to use Chinese characters in page names and I would like to thank you for your input. However, I think it is wrong to draw a parallel between the use of diacritics in Latin-based names and Chinese characters.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>First, it is hard to draw the line where diacritics should be considered non-English or not. Not long ago, it was considered proper English to write: coöperation, reënactment, rôle and archæology, etc.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, in case diacritics are used, it is very easy to create disambiguation pages that will lead the user to the "correct" page. Type <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem_c9b6.html" title="Stanisław Lem">Stanisław Lem</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanislaw_Lem_1bd3.html" title="Stanislaw Lem">Stanislaw Lem</a> and you get directed to the same page.</dd>
<dd>However, when it comes to the use of Chinese characters in page names, we are potentially raising a barrier to many users, at least as long as we can assume the majority of English Wikipedia's cannot type Chinese. If we set a precent for this, there is nothing that prevents us from creating pages with Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, Cyrillic texts, which may make parts of Wikipedia inaccessible for many users.</dd>
<dd>Just my two cents.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep; Merge</b> other articles into this one. I just now searched for 李, and now I find here that my search is seen as an "unlikely" one for English speakers. I would note that if popularity of search terms is a determinant of inclusion within this reference site, then a great many more of these 1.5 million English articles are also unlikely to be searched, and need to be deleted along with this one. I was hoping to search for people across the East-Asian spectrum who shared the same surname as the first Korean president, Rhee Syngman. With due deference to Jimbo Wales' xenocentrist and somewhat insulting view that "all foreign place names must be rendered in English" (as if the native languages simply did not exist at all, or were all on their way to extinction, or at any rate were unlearnable to us daft, monolingual English-speakers), it feels kind of tedious for me to complete my search here without resorting to a direct search of the 李 character. I do see some merit in restricting foreign language characters in titles, but I also see that total anglicization of every other language puts up a serious barrier between users like me, who actually set foot outside of their own country, and languages that really exist and are used in this world. This is an English encyclopedia, yes, but encyclopedic topics do not only exist within English-speaking countries, and I would prefer to have the privilege of being able to connect with ideas in other languages without muting them with romanization. Frankly, it makes me feel like an idiot to not be able to search for 李, and it makes me want to turn to other sources. Now, there is certainly a lot of duplication with this surname, but this 李 article here is the most complete so far, at least for my present search, including lists of both Korean and Chinese prominent bearers of the name. The other articles should be merged into this, preceded by a disambiguation page connecting me with the article, Lee (Korean name). It might be best to simply put the 李 title on that disambiguation page. Retaining the diacritic is immaterial... I wouldn't even see the need to put any romanization on a 李 disambiguation page.

<li><b>Comment</b> - It may have eluded you that there are other language versions of Wikipedia and that many articles are interlinked. That is the beauty of Wikipedia as a whole. However, it seems that rather than improving Wikipedia in their native languages, many Wikipedians prefer to write articles in English Wikipedia. No problem in and by itseld, but the end result is that the linguistic hegemony of English is perpetuated by many people who are opposed to it. I use Chinese Wikipedia on a daily basis, and occasionally contribute to it, but I'm often struck by the fact that it is so small - it turned 100 000 articles only recently! --<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 23:28, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If kept, it really boils down to what we rename the page since it is clearly unfeasible to have a Chinese character in the page title. After some thinking, I propose using <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Family_Surnames_916b.html" title="Hundred Family Surnames">Hundred Family Surnames</a> to disambiguate the names to achieve a standardized and one-to-one translation of surnames. For example, 李 would be Li (4th surname in Hundred Family Surnames). This is better than the "take the meaning" approach since meaning don't really apply in the case of surnames, and Li (surname that means plum tree) or Li (surname that means to stand) looks pretty ridiculous. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 03:51, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
