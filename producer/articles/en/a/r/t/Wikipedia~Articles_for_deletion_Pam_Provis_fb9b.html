<p>Appears to be primarily nonsense. While the two external links do indeed go to things written by someone of this name, most of the rest appears to be false. I can't find any proof that Iqaluit State University exists, that Provis wrote a paper called Latin Americans in Canada: A Chance to Develop the North (supposedly about Mexicans living in the far north of Canada), that it was later the basis for a government study, that there's a company called Provis and Sons Drilling Ltd, and so forth. I suspect someone has invented a fictional biography, borrowing the name to give it a sense of credibility. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 01:04, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I was a colleague of Provis' at Carleton University. The article seems to have a few minor inaccuracies, but is not a fictional biography. I'll try to get in contact with Provis to fix the errors. Jruta 07:25, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Iqaluit is a city, not a state. It's also in Canada which doesn't have states but provinces and territories. The section on unpaid library fines seem to point to an inside joke. Ifnord 15:33, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.I was just told about this from a friend who works with Pam through the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. I am not sure why this would be deleted. Besides two factual errors such as the Iqualuit State, should be Iqualuit City University. Besides that the only other error is that Provis and Sons Drilling Ltd was sold a few years back to Petro Canada. Ms. Provis’ work have been extremely important and influentional inside the department as well as in the Northern Development academic community.Powerinputreset 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I can't find a single mention of "Iqualuit City University", either — or indeed, any organisation which has both "Iqualuit" and "University" in its name. And even if "Provis and Sons" was sold "a few years back", there should still be mention of it somewhere. It certainly isn't mentioned in Petro Canada's <a href="http://www.petro-canada.ca/eng/media/10303.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.petro-canada.ca/eng/media/10303.htm" rel="nofollow">historical overview</a>, which mentions all manner of other aquisitions. And you'd think that someone who had been "extremely important and influentional" in an academic field would be referenced <i>somewhere</i> on the internet in relation to that field, but she isn't. Given that both Keep votes here have been made by new users with no contributions anywhere else, I'd consider it probable that they're both the hoaxer in disguise. (And anyway - even if all this content is all true, it hasn't meet the criteria of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, so should be removed unless reputable sources can be found.) -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 23:40, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>From what I understand, Iqualuit City University is not a separate institution. It is subunit of Nunavut Arctic College in which is in its first year of operation and is able to grant degrees through Brandon University. On the issue of the Petro Canada sale, Ill be honest I don’t know much about her husbands business, I just knows Pam Provis. Pam is in fact going to be presenting a paper at this years Aboriginal Policy Research Conference in which she is the keynote presenter. She has published multiple articles in the Journal of Indigenous Development and the International Migrant Development Journal.Powerinputreset 17 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Odd, then, that the <a href="http://www.nac.nu.ca" class="external text" title="http://www.nac.nu.ca" rel="nofollow">Nunavut Arctic College's website</a> doesn't mention it. The Brandon University website doesn't mention any connection, either. (Someone has since changed the article to refer to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_the_Arctic_34a4.html" title="University of the Arctic">University of the Arctic</a>, an institution in <i>Finland</i> — but <i>their</i> website doesn't mention Inqalit either). As for the journals — I can't find any evidence that either of them exist. (There's one reference to something called the <i>World</i> Journal of Indigenous Development, which was planned to be launched in Australia at the beginning of this year, but no subsequent mention of it.) Nor can I find anything connecting this "keynote speaker" to the Aboriginal Policy Research Conference, either at the next conference (not "this year", but in 2006) or the last conference (2002). (And this is still ignoring all the other problems, such as any mention of her supposed "bestseller" about Latin Americans in the Arctic.) -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 01:35, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well as I stated it’s a first year project so it might not be one their website yet. As to both those journals, since I am the editor of International Migrant Development Journal can tell you that exists. Pam is in fact going to have another article published in our first issue of the 2006, “Conclave Electoral Process: A Concept for the Inuit”. Powerinputreset 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Amusing that Ms Provis is described as "a frequent commentator for the BBC on regional issues" on the strength of a comment from her on the bottom of a BBC article. Those comments are basically 'reader mail', of a slightly lower order of notability than getting a letter printed in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a>, and to describe her as a 'frequent commentator' is nonsense. (Interestingly, the quote is taken completely out of context in the 'Controversy' section. Either there are indeed several different associates of Ms Provis writing this, or one schizophrenic.) --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 09:29, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is a clear hoax. Besides the above criticisms, the article claims Ms.Provis is an academic at 2 universities and an "important theorist regarding bicameralism in the subnational Canadian context". Then the article points you to a BBC article which Ms.Provis submitted a comment for, in which she states that she is "studying development policy in university". A professor who is at the "forefront" of her specific field would not claim to be studying general development policy when giving their opinion.Spanky 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
