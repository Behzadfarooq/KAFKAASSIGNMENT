<p>The result was <b>limited keep, with qualifications</b>. Nearly every commenters agrees that the fact of the eclipse on a given day is notable and encyclopedic. The dispute is whether this particular eclipse warrants an individual article, as it is not significantly different (from a layperson's point of view) from any other exclipse. On reading the debate, there is consensus here to <b>merge</b> the raw data from this article to a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lunar_eclipses.html" title="List of lunar eclipses">List of lunar eclipses</a>. To my great surprise, this article does not yet exist. Such a list should be created forthwith, and this article merged to it. In the meantime, it is inappropriate to delete this information outright, and there is no consensus to do that. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 23:35, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

And to get to the root of the case; what warrants the existence of a Wikipedia article, is when people want encyclopedic information about a particular subject.

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Troy and Korinkami, I was also looking for specific information on this eclipse and the article may want to add further data from astronomic websites. mcmurray's comment above is wrong if applied to total lunar eclipses, they do not occur with the same frequency of generic eclipses (last total eclipse visible from the UK was in 2004), and they are hardly ever the same, unless you specify what you mean by <i>the same</i>. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarTar_ec7b.html" title="User:DarTar">DarTar</a> 10:53, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>: The same thing happens with the Earth and the moon and the Sun. They are simply visible from different locations due to the rotation of the Earth, or something like that. My point is that the information you are going to get that differentiates it from any other lunar eclipse from this article is trivial at best. Date, time, location viewed from. Just my opinion though.<a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_mcmurray_93f4.html" title="User:A mcmurray">A mcmurray</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_mcmurray_aaf1.html" title="User talk:A mcmurray">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_mcmurray_ce89.html" title="Special:Contributions/A mcmurray">contribs</a>) 11:00, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Sorry to blather so much. But this could be resolved by having an article on <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_lunar_eclipse.html" title="Total lunar eclipse">Total lunar eclipse</a>, if they are different from the partial ones, which they are. Anyway, again nothing inherently notable about any individual total lunar eclipse. The information could be in one article for all total lunar eclipses. Otherwise, since this stuff is predictable far into the future, we could fill the wiki with articles about lunar and solar eclipses for all time. Just a thought.<a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_mcmurray_93f4.html" title="User:A mcmurray">A mcmurray</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_mcmurray_aaf1.html" title="User talk:A mcmurray">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_mcmurray_ce89.html" title="Special:Contributions/A mcmurray">contribs</a>) 11:04, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: While I agree there's nothing <i>inherently</i> notable about any individual total lunar eclipse, that doesn't imply that all total lunar eclipses are necessarily not notable. Each total eclipse is actually different since the relative positions of Sun, Moon and Earth are never exactly the same, leading to a different experience from Earth for each. People <i>remember</i> individual eclipses, so why not write about them? Give the article a chance to grow beyond a stub, to see how "notable:" it has been for people - it's too soon to judge now. <a href="../../../j/a/v/User%7EJavaWoman_1873.html" title="User:JavaWoman">JavaWoman</a> 11:43, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One more thing, if this, or any other eclipse, is notable, say for duration (which I don't know whether duration of eclipses and totality and such varies or not from eclipse to eclipse) then, perhaps I would feel differently about an individual article for the eclipse but I just don't think it is feasible to have one about every single eclipse, it just doesn't make any sense to me.<a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_mcmurray_93f4.html" title="User:A mcmurray">A mcmurray</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_mcmurray_aaf1.html" title="User talk:A mcmurray">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_mcmurray_ce89.html" title="Special:Contributions/A mcmurray">contribs</a>)

<dd>I do agree that the current article should be improved, I <i>strongly disagree</i> on the other hand that any <i>information you are going to get that differentiates it from any other lunar eclipse</i> would be trivial. On top of what you suggest, there's plenty of valuable information (that you may still find trivial) to be added for genuinely interested readers, including values on the Danjon scale, eclipse-specific pictures (which may save <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lunar_eclipse#Better_photos_for_the_3_March_eclypse" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lunar_eclipse#Better_photos_for_the_3_March_eclypse" rel="nofollow">spammy submissions of low-quality images</a> in the main article on Lunar Eclipses) as well as dozens of links to authoritative external articles that covered the event. I even think it would be a nice idea to have templates for astronomical events and maybe a consistent naming scheme.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Lunar eclipises are a dime a dozen and are not at all considered notable individually. The only reason the March 07 event received any press at all was because it was visible in major locations in the eastern US.

<li><b>Delete</b> The information given by the article may be of use to people now, as it is a current event, but in the long run this article is unneccessary and rather unencyclopedic, as it seems to be something that belongs in a farmers almanac. Also, virtually all of the information in the article is available in the main article for <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_eclipse.html" title="Lunar eclipse">lunar eclipse</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's mostly raw data in prose. Would be better served by a table at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lunar_eclipses.html" title="List of lunar eclipses">List of lunar eclipses</a>. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 15:47, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Not Notable? Are you kidding? This was the best lunar eclipse seen across the widest populated area for decades. Every eclipse is a unique event and shows a unique view. If you know nothing about it you'll think they're all the same. But if you know nothing about it you need such pages kept!<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Beard_c412.html" title="User:Mark Beard">Mark Beard</a> 22:06, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If this one was so notable, why doesn't the article contain anything to show it? All the article does is say when the eclipse occurred, where it was visible, and how it rated on the Danjon scale. If people are interested in keeping that information on Wikipedia (which is fine with me), it is much better placed on a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lunar_eclipses.html" title="List of lunar eclipses">List of lunar eclipses</a> than on this specific article.··· <a href="../../../r/u/u/User%7ERuudVisser_f4a0.html" title="User:RuudVisser">rWd</a> · <a href="../../../r/u/u/User_talk%7ERuudVisser_bebd.html" title="User talk:RuudVisser">Talk</a> ··· 14:56, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That can be a sign that the article is incomplete rather than that the subject is non-notable. Google News gives 82 results (not all of which are non-trivial, I'll admit), but here are a few: <a href="http://www.wadi.ae/test.php?news&amp;pag=1&amp;id=2397" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wadi.ae/test.php?news&amp;pag=1&amp;id=2397" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=22038" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=22038" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.playfuls.com/news_005177_Total_Lunar_Eclipse_Over_Next_One_in_August_28_This_Year.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.playfuls.com/news_005177_Total_Lunar_Eclipse_Over_Next_One_in_August_28_This_Year.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/9587/1066/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/9587/1066/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=nation_world&amp;id=5089676" class="external autonumber" title="http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=nation_world&amp;id=5089676" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.
