<li><b>Do Not Delete.</b> I can't believe how stuck up everyone here seems to be. Who cares how many hits or users the site has- that shouldnt matter. Wikipedia isn't designed around things only catering to multi-million users/customers, thats silly.

<p>This is actually a very popular "underground" message board with ties to the "inside" of the 49ers front office. Usually with news released before the AP or the actual official web site. Also with its mentions to other sites, I dont think advertisement is the goal.<small>— 68.98.120.85 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.98.120.85_4ed7.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.98.120.85">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<p>Okay - as the author of the article in question I'm a little irked by this. First of all, I just wrote it and planned on seeing how it looked and going back in to edit it to sound "less advertis-ish" around 5 minutes after I wrote it, but it had already been flagged for deletion and I couldn't edit it. Despite the fact that I seem to be advertising webzone and paradise more than the site itself...</p>
<p>Sorry it isn't GenMay or some massive conglomerate message board guys, but wiki has articles on the color of Tom Cruise's naval lint for God's sake... there isn't room for a small blurb about a reasonably popular underground message board? 1000 users is hardly "small" in my book, but that aside, the administrator of the board (who is not me) runs the message board in conjunction with a 49ers news site (49ersnews.com) that provides inside information on the team and its activities, and has on several occasions "scooped" stories about player signing, injuries, departures, hirings and other such events before the official site and other fan boards. I would have included that when I went in to edit that, but as I said, it was flagged for deletion so quickly I couldn't even retouch it to read better.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't even bother giving me that "possible single issue account" BS - I work at an intelligence agency and troll wiki for hours a day. If I see anything else left out, I'd add it. Trouble is, in my research, most of the things I'm looking for are already here, so I have no use for adding stupid BS. I just happened to look it up, and it wasn't there one day, so I decided to add it.</p>
<p>Man, what a giant crock if this gets deleted. I'd like to point out there are articles that are complete garbage about very insignificant things - and yet THIS of all articles gets deleted. Here's a couple: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel_lint" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel_lint" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel_lint</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_momma" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_momma" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_momma</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_stretching" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_stretching" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_stretching</a></p>

You can not rate article merits against articles that don't fall under the same umbrella criterion.

This article fails under this part of the guidelines: <i>Even if an entire website meets the notability criteria, <b>its components (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article.</b></i>. The website you keep referencing doesn't have an article itself so referring to it doesn't make sense. It's membership is very low as I can find forums with twice or five times the membership numbers and still not qualify for articles. I'm sorry if you feel that as navel lint gets its own article that the forum should too but there are rules and guidelines to wikipedia. –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 09:09, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>My name is Scott, and I am the person creating this set of articles. Or trying to -- they are being deleted before I even finish editing the basic outline for them!
<p>First of all, I have no connection to Sonar or its manufacturer other than the fact that I use their program.</p>
<p>The idea for creating a Sonar wiki came about on a huge Sonar forum, due to the fact that there is tons of great information there, but it's not systematized, and as on all forums it is hard to find the prime information and harder to separate it from everything that surrounds it.</p>
<p>Plus, Wikipedia's article format is ideal for this sort of systematization of the creme de la creme of information -- there are entire books written about using this software, so it is obviously information that is in demand and useful.</p>
<p>At the forum, the strategy was to create an outline and then have users go and fill it in. But that takes a bit of time -- so I beseech you to please give us a week or two to get up to snuff.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p><b>Mostly Delete</b> I think we should have an article on Cakewalk Sonar itself, otherwise delete per above. Dave 02:18, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> -<b>Baffled</b> I'm frankly baffled at the speed and zeal with which the Sonar articles are being deleted. This is not an attempt to get "free web hosting" (which is a wee bit offensive) nor to put up useless garbage or advertising. It is an attempt to create an encyclopedic collection of the very best knowledge culled from over 404,000 forum posts (<a href="http://forum.cakewalk.com/tt.asp?forumid=2" class="external free" title="http://forum.cakewalk.com/tt.asp?forumid=2" rel="nofollow">http://forum.cakewalk.com/tt.asp?forumid=2</a>) by world-class mastering engineers, mixing engineers, musicians, acousticians, home recordists and others. If this content is not appropriate for Wikipedia, I must ask you why Wikipedia happily hosts articles about virtually every other piece software used for audio recording, but not Sonar:</p>

Otherwise, please let us try and create our Sonar articles. Thanks,Scott S Sadowsky 01:54, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> You seem to have missed the point. The purpose of this nomination is not to remove Sonar software from Wikipedia. The purpose is to delete a massive user guide for Sonar. None of the other softwares you cite above have anything like the user guide you're trying to build here, and if someone tried to create one, it would be nominated for deletion the same way. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 01:59, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - citing other articles that should be deleted isn't an argument for saving this one. Nobody will stop you creating <i>an</i> article for Sonar Cakewalk if it is encyclopedic and you can establish that it is a notable piece of <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">software</a>. What isn't acceptable is to create a wiki within wikipedia consisting of hints and tips and how to guides. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 02:01, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<i>Comment </i><b>User guides", advertising, inconsistencies</b> So encyclopedic information about a piece of software is not permissible, but blatant advertising is? In any case if someone says he is seeking, for example, to exterminate all birds, but only "happens" to kill crows, pointing out his failure to follow his own stated goals certainly is an argument. Finally, the fact that the Sonar info is broken up into several different pages is simply to make editing less overwhelming -- not to create a separate wiki. You must admit that dealing with the back-end (editing view) is no small challenge once there's a fair amount of text. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by S Sadowsky (<a href="../../../s/_/s/User_talk%7ES_Sadowsky_4dc6.html" title="User talk:S Sadowsky">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_S_Sadowsky_7cfc.html" title="Special:Contributions/S Sadowsky">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have a very nice solution for you, Scott. 1) Get a Cakewalk Sonar wiki up at wikia. 2) Place Sonar Cakewalk instruction manual type information in Cakewalk Sonar wiki. 3) Create a Cakewalk Sonar article that describes the software, not a howto. 4) Link to the Cakewalk Sonar wiki from the Cakewalk Sonar article. What you really want is for people to access this information, right? So having it in its own wiki will be cleaner and easier to maintain.

<p>This was nominated for deletion in July 2005 (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hadiths_related_to_Mut%27ah_017a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hadiths related to Mut'ah">the first nomination</a>), but it passed. Since that time, this article has been tagged with a {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} template. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the article could ever have that template removed. As the nominator from the first AfD said, Wikipedia is not a source for <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadiths</a>, but that's exactly what this article is. It doesn't read very well and, as it has existed for the past fourteen months, is far from encyclopedic. A couple external links or a few paragraphs in another article (perhaps <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikah_Mut%E2%80%98ah_e429.html" title="Nikah Mut‘ah">Nikah Mut‘ah</a>) may work, but I fear this article is unsalvagable. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 01:11, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

And it is evident from the article that it goes to great lenght in providing scholarly opinions and interpretations of those specific hadith. It is well sourced and a notable subject, quoting from the most prominent Islamic scholars. Yes, it needs to be cleaned up, and has not been done so in a long time since the topic is highly scholarly and hence, it lacks a large number of people editing on it, but that is not a valid reason to delete an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Scholarly input aside, this article makes no sense at all to someone unfamiliar with the subject. It has been listed as needing cleanup for a very long time. If someone could please rewrite according to the manual of style, and with sufficient context that a non scholar can understand it, I might consider a keep vote.

<p>The article at <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshattri.html" title="Kshattri">Kshattri</a> was created to mislead Wikipedia readers. The objective was to create a mischievious article ridiculing the Khatris with false information, and to redirect the real <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khatri.html" title="Khatri">Khatri</a> article to it.</p>
<p>The Khatri (Kshatriya) page is a previous incarnation of the same thing. It should also be deleted.</p>

<li>I am not sure what a "ghit" is, but the film draws 341,000 hits. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%229%2F11+press+for+truth%22" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%229%2F11+press+for+truth%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%229%2F11+press+for+truth%22</a> There's quite a difference and I believe 341,000 proves notability. Whether you believe the film to be "cruft" or not, it is wrong to remove all mention of it from Wikipedia, for whatever stated or unstated reason. We are here to serve our users. If you view the film and object to its contents for factual reasons, that could be treated in the article or "discussion" page. But simply attempting to delete articles other editors begin for such reasons (especially flawed reasoning such as the wildly inaccurate claim there are only 344 hits) is just wrong, and against what we stand for here. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 02:36, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> After reviewing the sources, I have found that the article does NOT pass notability requirements. The NYT mention is NOT an article that focuses on, and only on the movie (which is required. The article must be a full-length featured article about the subject only). It is only a mentioned as a small part of related 9/11 events happening on or around 9/11/06. Rotten Tomatoes is not used as a 'reliable source'. Amazon is used to verify the movie was made though, as is the AOL movies listing but neither provide a reason the movie is notable. <i>Slant Magazine</i> and <i>Hub Weekly</i> are not a print magazines but rather are blogs...which removes them as a reliable sources (blogs are not normally allowed, per wikipedia policy). <i>Scoop</i> is not a reputable website (and this is just a press release), and hence is also voided as a reliable source. Nothing notable about this and does not have multiple, independent, third-party, reliable, full-length featured articles about the film.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: that is why it is called a "stub." There are a lot of such articles throughout Wikipedia, and we don't delete them all for the reason that they are short. A blow-by-blow description of the film's contents, how it was made, etc. can of course be added but that takes time, with the contribution of various editors (which could include you). But it seems that, at least so far, your edits consist solely of attempting to remove articles written by other editors, and not to create any new ones of your own. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 21:12, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Is fantasy more significant than fiction, or is it simply a question of whether consumers bought more of one and fewer of another?

<li><b>Comment</b>: In discussion about another 9/11-as-inside-job movie that was successfully ground down to zero by the deletion police, I mentioned the comparison to <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Life_as_a_Dog_c251.html" title="My Life as a Dog">My Life as a Dog</a>, a Swedish movie. Someone pointed out that it was nominated for two academy awards. But when I mentioned it to my Swedish relatives they thought it was rather insignificant or uninteresting. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie myself. What's my point about all this? Here is a fictional movie, that came out long before wikipedia was around--indeed, the internet, as such, only had 5000 computers on it at the time. So documenting it is documenting a piece of film arcana. On the other hand, we have here under consideration a serious movie about a deadly serious subject having extensive interviews with people <i>whose relatives died on 9/11</i> ... and we're having a discussion about deleting coverage of this topic. Have folks even seen what the Jersey Widows and other family members have to say? Go watch the movie and tell me it's not for real what these people feel and perceive. I think most of the people on this page are either arrogant or heartless. I'm beginning to feel like assuming good faith of these other editors is a sick joke. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaimiddleton_a602.html" title="User:Kaimiddleton">Kaimiddleton</a> 08:13, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Whether you and your Swedish great-uncle have heard of <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Life_as_a_Dog_c251.html" title="My Life as a Dog">My Life as a Dog</a> is utterly irrelevant - the movie has gained substantial coverage, been nominated for or awarded many prizes, launched the career of a major director, and is clearly significant (and pretty good, by the way). Equally, your strong feelings on viewing the movie "9/11: Press for Truth" are utterly irrelevant to the discussion at hand: the question is whether the movie in question has enough significant independent coverage to justify an encyclopedic article and allow one to be written. As far as I can see, this movie passes the low threshold required, so I've voted keep - this despite loathing conspiracy theories. Other disagree.

<li>Comment: I don't think the film represents a conspiracy theory. It sets out a timeline and focuses primarily on the government's failure to investigate promptly and fully as in previous disasters of a similar magnitude, and particularly on the failure to answer the questions developed and posed by family members to the 9/11 Commission, once that committee was finally organized, over the objections of the Bush administration. Probably a lot of the comments implying that the film is akin to some of the other 9/11 conspiracy films come from people who haven't seen it. A glance at the strongly political userboxes of the editor who put this page up for deletion suggests there may be other overarching motivations for his actions (whether conscious or subconscious) than lack of "notability" of this film. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 11:06, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. "Don't see" is the key phrase here, as it seems you haven't seen the film before voting here. As mentioned above, there are no conspiracies discussed in the film; it is a straight discussion of facts regarding the 9/11 timeline and investigation, and the families' reactions. So what you and many editors say above is really quite inaccurate, and reflects poorly on you in that you would vote without <i>verifying</i> that what you say is correct. When you say it's not "any more notable," does that mean, then, that this documentary is <i>less</i> notable than <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludicolo.html" title="Ludicolo">Ludicolo</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laughing_Man_%28Ghost_in_the_Shell%29_e14e.html" title="Laughing Man (Ghost in the Shell)">Laughing Man (Ghost in the Shell)</a>, or <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vala_Mal_Doran_92bc.html" title="Vala Mal Doran">Vala Mal Doran</a>?

<p>I can't find any evidence that this competition has received any media coverage, and it really just appears to be a competition conducted on a math webforum - see <a href="http://www.mathlinks.ro/Forum/viewtopic.php?p=475445" class="external text" title="http://www.mathlinks.ro/Forum/viewtopic.php?p=475445" rel="nofollow">this link</a>. It may be sponsored by the Art of Problem Solving, but I don't even really see any official evidence of that; the only other source on this which I could find was the AoPS Wiki, which, like this one, is freely editable.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> If you are going to nominate a book for deletion, then please go down to the library and do some real research. It's irritating when I see people nominate a book off of just doing a quick Google search, looking at the Ghit number and basing their entire AFD on it. There are many other sources for research that are just as powerful as the net, and just as accepted for sources. While I agree that all articles need to be verifiable, The book was published by a notable publisher and did win the awards noted (which a quick check at the local library can confirm). But since it is fairly obvious that would be too much work for some people here, I'll stick to their preferred (and inherently flawed) researching tool.</li>

<p><i>Nonetheless there is no dictum against any book that is reasonably spread or otherwise well-known or remarkable. Ask yourself if several libraries or bookshops, or a no-subscription website have a copy of the book, so that other wikipedians can easily consult the book, or at least have access to on-line or press-published reviews of the book.</i></p>
<p>Remember this book was published in the 1970's...way before the internet, hence press-reviews online will be scarce. Not many Ghits for "The Mark of Conte" but it is a 70's printed book and this does pass because of it's awards and wide spread among libraries around the world. Looking online though shows MANY libraries have a copy of this book. The first Google page has the Boston Public library and the Juneau Public Library (that's a spread...Boston, NY and Juneau, AK). The next page has the Cairo American College, in Cairo Egypt listing the book on their shelves, as well as the Wheaton Public Library (wheaton, IL), City of Tempe Public Library (Tempe, AZ),Logan Public Library (Logan UT) and a listing by the The Missouri State Library and Nassau Library System (Nassau, NY). A search of the ODIN database for the Tri-State area of North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota found that 52 libraries in those states carried the book. I think that proves this is a keep. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 06:24, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep or delete depending upon the reason</b>. Tour articles are definitely justifiable in a number of cases, as some of Wikipedia's better existing tour articles attest. For many artists, concert performances and tours are a more powerful and/or popular manifestation of their work than their albums or singles, the latter two of which Wikipedia relentlessly documents. That said, this <i>particular</i> article is an ungodly mess; much more than two (inconsistently formatted) setlists are needed to justify a tour article, and the 'Worldwide popularity' section is mostly off-topic. So a case could be made to delete this article and let someone else write a new one, if they can include material warranting an article. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 03:24, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, the nominator is wrong.

Given that this article cites "My Casio Exilim EX-S600 Digital Camera, and myself" as its references, it clearly isn't based upon sources.

<li>Deliberately citing yourself as a reference is within the field of original research. Beyond that, even if the article is well-written, the topic isn't that notable. A style of architecture is noteworthy, but not every one of the thousands of examples of it are. A company may be noteworthy, but not necessarily everything it makes. A particular device may be described in general, but not every make and model of it need be explored in depth. There are explanations of what cameras are and what they do; we don't need an article about <i>every</i> camera. <a href="../../../d/j/c/User%7EDjcartwright_74e5.html" title="User:Djcartwright">Djcartwright</a> 20:11, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

Four months later the article <i>still</i> lacks cited sources, and existence of reliable sources appears unlikely. Although "strip monopoly" scores pretty well on Google (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Strip+Monopoly%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Strip+Monopoly%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">11,800 hits</a>), none of them appear to qualify as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for anything official. Rather, Monopoly is a popular game and some people will naturally start inventing "strip" versions of it and post their own private rules on the internet. (Compare this to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strip_poker.html" title="Strip poker">strip poker</a> which is more widespread and which had a world championship(!) arranged in London.) Note that a number of those who argued for the article's inclusion in some form last time did so provided that sources were provided.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I must admit the idea of playing it this way had never occurred to me before. There are some comments in the previous AfD listing suggesting a merge of a sentence or two into the main article, but without anything which works as a reliable source I don't see that as the best of policies. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 09:06, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My first thought was a proposal to merge this with <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strip_Poker_f1e9.html" title="Strip Poker">Strip Poker</a> to create a "Strip versions of other games" article, but Strip Poker appears to be (as mentioned) a more widespread...er... sport(?), so it's probably not appropriate to do that. Judging by the amount of text in this article (so many rules, just get naked!) i'm hesitant to propose deletion. Maybe the best course would be to <b>Merge</b> as a footnote to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">Monopoly</a>. I notice that other versions of Monopoly have their own pages as well, but they appear to be more 'official'. I don't think the 'strip' aspect alters the original game enough to warrant it's own entry - they appear to have virtually identical rules, albeit with the inclusion of the obvious. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnebravemonkey_d240.html" title="User:Onebravemonkey">Onebravemonkey</a> 09:17, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Boardgamegeek.com is kind of authorative, isn't it? I would use their material as a source, but still, like Onebravemonkey, I don't see the need for an entire article.

<p>Jose Luis De Jesus Miranda is (or is not) a cult leader, dpeending who you believe. A search for the exact name cult and a search for the exact name -cult give approximately equal numbers of hits, but both numbers are small. A few mainstream cites, but only really for his organisation, on which we do not have an article. So I say delete this, since we have here two sentences, of which one (the one with citations, ironically) is the subject of an edit war. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 07:25, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While I would prefer an article on the organization rather than the person, the fact there's a few mainstream citations about his organization makes him the leader of a notable cult.

<li>Friends of mine do observe this 'holiday' in one way or the other, me too (yes, I am a coder). This is no new idea, it's been around for a while.

Google is not the only means of finding reliable sources, but in this case it should provide a fairly good guideline. If the holiday was celebrated by a recently discovered tribe with no written language then maybe we expect to find a lack of references on the web, but that's not the case with a coders' holiday.

<li>Yeah, but it's not about whether the <i>idea</i> exists. Neither that link nor the one that's been added acknowledge it as anything more than a semi-joke proposed holiday.

<li>I've given an URL to a Polish article which clearly states that 13/09/2006 is the Programmers' Day. I assume that company such as IDG is a reliable source. At this point I don't really know what else you expect. It's obvious Programmers' Day is not an official holiday, however, the fact that it was mentioned on a website of a respectable magazine and the fact article on Polish Wikipedia was created on 25/07/2003 proves that it's not new idea shared among small group of people and as such should be mentioned on Wikipedia. The thing that astonishes me the most is that you want to delete Programmers' Day but want to keep SAAD whereas both <i>holidays</i> are a semi-joke and unofficial. -- mina86, 217.96.228.130 14:47, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please don't create straw men, or use the fallacious "If article X then article Y." argument.

<li>All I'm saying is that I don't understand what's the big difference between Programmers' Day and the other days which make the former nominated for deletion. The article I cite also reports that "<i>Many programmers considered this day</i> [256th day of the year] <i>the informal professional holiday.</i>" And finally, the <i>other</i> people documenting this holiday are the editors of PC World. -- mina86, 217.96.228.130 13:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Firstly, it hasn't got to be "a day off", it's more like April Fool's Day (that also to <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">Sjc</a>). MacGyver: Common sense doesn't help in any case (ref to your google evidence). BTW when I googled for "Programmer's Day" I found alot of hits that were referring to the article's topic - of course in between babble about "a programmer's day looks like..". On the other hand, deleting does not stop me from 'celebrating' that day. And the lack of 'written' documents about it that don't just cite wikipedia (or rather the tiny fractions of google hits that don't!), doesn't make it easy to come up with evidence. <a href="../../../b/u/l/User%7EBullhaddha_d015.html" title="User:Bullhaddha">tim</a>

<li><b>Comment</b> No one makes any claims about "organic growth" to any article other than schools.

<li>Thank you for the example. I will refrain from making that comment in the future. Incidentally, slightly off-topic do you have an example that isn't a school where organic growth was an argument used and the article didn't end up getting deleted? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Can't say that I do. I much preer arguments of verifiability and encyclopaedic value. Arguments like <i>notability</i> and <i>organic expansion</i> seem to be a euphanism for <i>I got nothing</i>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:02, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just wondering if someone wrote an article about a random friend of theirs and we declared it to be not-notable would you see that as an <i>I got nothing</i> argument? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I might. The article you imagine fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> - but <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> uses the word <i>notability</i> with respect to people - so it's not really a comparable case (since then, there is a relevent guideline or policy that discusses notability). But it's not transferable, guidelines that set notability set specific criteria because notability isn't subjective if it's to be used for deletion per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:18, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Two questions. First, if people explain why they think something isn't notable or if they use some set of criteria that they consider to be reasonable notability criteria is it then acceptable? Second, if the existence of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is what matters does that mean we can only make notability arguments if an essay or proposed guideline exists? This would seem to lead to the absurd result that if I write an article about my left sock it can't be deleted on lack of notability grounds since we don't have a standard for socks? (and don't any jokers dare point to <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:04, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Within the context of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> notability has a very specific, nonsubjective meaning. Here no such policy exists. As for your sock, it could be deleted based on the policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - who cares about notability? On a more practical level, I would argue that <i>if</i> we wanted to have a notability guideline for things generally, we'd be happily surprised to discover we already have it - <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - a far more neutral point of view on whether something is notable or not. Not <i>Do I find this notable</i>? but <i>Is there a significant viewpoint that finds this notable</i>? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:02, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So notability is only a standard that we are allowed to apply if someone has an essay or proposed guideline? Does that mean that if I write a list of what I consider to be notable that is then an acceptable thing to cite since it is objective? As to the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as a gatekeeper that doesn't work well with schools because many schools will be permanent stubs following <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> yet because we have verifiable information we are forced to have articles. To use an example without the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issue there might be easily enough info to write an article about a local attraction or building, should we then definitely keep that based on the same criteria? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:25, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I mean notability is a standard we should only apply if there's a guideline or policy - proposals and essays are not good for this. Will some schools stay eternal stubs? Possibly, I have no idea. But I don't really think <i>stub</i> is a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 22:30, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Many schools close as no consensus and at least one has been deleted within the last few months. There isn't any "common law" standard for them. Furthermore, saying that the deletion arguments don't hold water isn't an argument but a statement. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:05, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For high schools, there's an obvious precendent to keep, for elementary schools its not as strong - this is a high school, however. There is a definite common law to keep all high schools. As for the deletion "arguments" not holding water, that's only an observation. The closing admin will be able to see it to be transparently true, however, so I just felt it appropriate to call attention to it. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:18, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No there isn't any such precedent. No consensus means just that- no consensus. The fact that they are kept is inherently procedural. Furthermore, even now highschools are occasionally deleted. See for example <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rochester_Hills_Christian_School_cdb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rochester Hills Christian School">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rochester Hills Christian School</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:26, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One exception to a long standing tradition does not precendence destroy. Nor does <i>no concensus vote results in keep</i> change that high schools are kept by the common law. The precendent exists and is real. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No consensus does not provide any precedent. Under many common law systems (to use your favorite analogy) there are the equivalent of procedural keeps all the time. For example for the US Supreme Court if a justice is recused and the resulting vote is a tie the lower court is upheld and no precedent is established for future cases. So using your analogy these aren't keeps. Between that and the counterexamples(there are other similar counterexamples) the precedent claim bears little weight. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:01, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It does serve precendent value, which is most obvious if you consider the purpose of precedence. It makes no sense to apply standards unevenly, nor is it benficial to anyone involved. High schools (almost) invariably end up getting kept - the precedent is that they are kept (though occasionally through no concensus - doesn't matter, the article is still kept) - and this is the precedent I appeal to. Combined with the fact that the article passes every relevent guideline or policy that could be applied to argue for deletion, the precedent is just the icing on the cake. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:06, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>Ok, so here we disagree. No consensus does not serve the same purpose of precedent. It simply says "the community doesn't agree on this either way. To be on the safe side we will keep it for now." That isn't the same at all as the community agreeing to keep. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:08, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>A precedence of outcome is a precedenct that's merely a descriptive statement and should have no bearing on whether we treat it as precedent at all. In fact we don't apply that sort of logic- note an AfD that closes as no consensus is not treated as a relevant precedent for keeping if something becomes re-AfDed. So we don't even do that in the individual case, let alone the general. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:25, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - stupid listcruft. Though I will note that the supposed "legal concerns" cited in previous AfD's struck me as sort of stupid as well. The ever-so-important and fascinating info about each warez group is mostly not verifiable (plus nobody cares), though I will grant that it's not really a problem to verify that the groups exist, as some people claimed in previous AfDs. Tangentially, only a small minority of warez groups will ever earn their own articles, e.g. <a href="../../../d/r/i/DrinkOrDie_e684.html" title="DrinkOrDie">DrinkOrDie</a>. As an organizational method, I would be more than satisfied with seeing all the genuinely notable warez groups inside the Warez Groups category. I think that works just fine, no need for a list. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 10:49, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, many of the entries on the list are considered notable enough to have articles of their own, so their status should be verifiable enough to keep on here. Being a magnet for vanity, unsourced statements, and vandalism isn't a criteria for deletion--otherwise we'd delete <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

<li><b>Comment</b> Alt account, a list provides a nice one-line summary that a category cannot: replacing a list like this with a category loses useful information.

<li>It discriminates. All these groups are warez groups and if it's properly cleaned up, they're going to be only that minority that recieves third-party coverage of their activities.</li>
<li>It's not original, all of these groups have been identified as warez groups in other sources.</li>
<li>This article doesn't contain directory information, like web page links or phone numbers, just encyclopedic description of the groups.

<li><b>Comment</b>. A senior executive at a large corporation can sometimes have rather more power than an elected politician, even though their activities might not be as well documented. This discussion is about notability, not about inappropriate behavior by new or anonymous editors. In general, I think that it would be helpful to have more articles about senior corporate executives, and I am afraid that this discussion will discourage editors from writing such articles. I'm also concerned that Wikipedia is better at providing coverage of the entertainment industry than it is at covering shipping lines and their senior executives. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 04:48, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Allow me to explain the reasons. Firstly, in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, it is stated that the band or individual in question has to release two or more albums to satisy the inclusion of the topic here.

Moreover, in a <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?as_q=Siahi&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=title&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.sg/search?as_q=Siahi&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=title&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for the band in question was done, it failed the <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOGLE_1973.html" title="WP:GOOGLE">WP:GOOGLE</a> massively. Although there was about a hundred hits, almost (or all) of the hits were <i>NOT</i> refering to a band at all! Thus, it is also impossible to verify the article as well and even primary sources for the subject in question was impossible to find. To add weight to my argument, the external link of the article sends me to an error page as well! Thus, this article has to be deleted based on the various criterias on this project. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 14:45, 14 September 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is not a game guide, and it's not even a crystal ball thing. The article is about something that was announced, but hasn't been talked about since it's announcement. Crystal ball would be understandable if it speculated on what the class was, but seeing as the information is from Blizzard themselves, it's not speculation. And as described above, a game guide would indicate that you learn how to play the game, and you don't here, it simply tells you what this is. If you mark this as a game guide we should just delete all articles about any game on Wikipedia. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 07:31, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, it is <i>sort of</i> a game guide. It's not a strategy guide or a walkthrough, but it <i>is</i> intended to be a guide to an aspect of a game. What else would one call it? A biography? An anthropology article? It doesn't mean that we need to delete every article about games; just the ones that offer excessive detail by giving obscure (or unused) character classes their own articles. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 12:06, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The existence of the project is verifiable, but I don't think it's notable. It's a web-based charity project and this article was basically written as an advertisement for it. It claims to be a huge project, and the name would lead one to believe that, but there are actually fewer than 800 participants. Perhaps it will break the world record of 25,000 some day (I doubt it) but Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. We shouldn't be keeping this article around just because the subject <i>might</i> be notable someday. The only news coverage is based around advertisements and press releases from the project. I'm not sure whether this falls under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but it fails both. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 13:53, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not exactly sure why this was deproded. Anyways, the article claims that some Dutch hotels require that you sweep your own room with a "Dutch sweeping style". The whole thing strikes me (and at least one other editor who put up the prod) as highly doubtful. Note that I'm not contesting that the requirement that you clean your own room does not exist but that most likely is not as widespread as the article suggests, is not as typically Dutch and has nothing to do with a sweeping style. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 14:50, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if true (and that's unlikely), without sources, we can't take the editor's word for it.

<p>I am the company's CEO and therefore my view might be regarded as biased. I believe, however, that our industry has a major change on how people live their lifes and the emergence of what we refer to as Auction Culture (see also Daniel Nissanoff's 2006 book on FutureShop. We are the oldest player in Europe and are often asked by the media (BBC, ITN etc.) to comment on major issues in online auctioning (like recently where we were asked to comment on the eBay strike in the UK).

<li>In respect to Wikipedia we have endevioured to include as much factural information in the article as possible, and have followed closely the model of i soldit entry (another major chain). In answer to the question of the oldest drop shop in Europe, this is difficult to prove. However we have been trading since 2003 and there are 42 drop shop in the UK and europe who have opened after us. We are the only substantial chain of eBay drop shop in the UK (i.e. more than one store) and recently raised £2.1M in funding (a total of £4M over the last three years).</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> A "bluepeel" is a propriety name (owned by Dr. Obagi) for a varient of traditional TCA acid peels for skin treatment. There is no reason to have a featured entry on a specific product as compared to to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_peel.html" title="Chemical peel">chemical peel</a> which already exists. There is little to distinguish this product from hundreds of other formulae in this general category <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroliver_c7f0.html" title="User:Droliver">Droliver</a> 16:18, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> Bluepeel non-surgical face lift should remain as an article. While the Obagi peel is a chemical peel it is not identical to other chemical peels. It has a different formula that makes it unique, much in the same way that Coca-Cola has a unique formula that sets it apart from Pepsi-Cola. Both are colas, but both have their own Wiki pages. Both are trademarks owned by their respective organizations. The same could be said about the various distributions of Linux. An RPM for RedHat Linux will run on Fedora and Centos, as they are almost identical, however they are different distributions of the same core product.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Comparing a small market product to multi-billion dollar corporations (Coke/Pepsi Co.) kind of misses the point. There in fact is little to distinguish Obagi (other then its brand identity) from hundreds of similar products. For the purposes of Wikipedia I think all chemical peel type of treatments are better addressed in a single heading without proprietary product entries.<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroliver_c7f0.html" title="User:Droliver">Droliver</a> 03:38, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless some incredible notability surrounds Bluepeel. For example, is it now the standard formula used by a vast majority of dermatologists? Does it differ significantly from the other untold numbers of Trichloroacetic Acid Peels alluded to on the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_peel.html" title="Chemical peel">chemical peel</a> page? Without some significant separating factor of notability or inventiveness, I don't think the article should stay. Sure, RedHat, Fedora, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi have their own articles because they are huge entities. A cola I brew myself and sell at a local market stand to a few thousand people a month or a Linux kernel I put together aren't notable enough to warrant a Wikipedia article <i>unless</i> they show signs of or do become the next Coke/Pepsi or Fedora/RedHat. <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 21:50, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

The principle of splitting long articles up with short introductory paragraphs in the main article, linking to a fuller article on a sub-topic is well established (if people believe less detailed content needs to be included that needs to be decided editorially using article talk pages, not the blunt all or nothing afd result). However, here we have the trouble of two articles serving the same purpose. As this is the one up for deletion, I'm deleting this one.</p>

<p><b>I disagree</b>; the 9/11 conspiracy theories page is over 120 kB in size and needs to be split up. This article is already 22kb, and probably should take other parts of the other article as well and will probably end up being about 30 kB in size. We have seperate pages for <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a>; just because people are kooks doesn't mean that they aren't notable, and given how many people believe in the 9/11 conspiracy theories (especially regading WTC 7) I think it is relevant to Wikipedia. In any event, having a 120+ kB article is rather unreasonable; its just too long and deserves to be split up into a number of subarticles rather than just being a 40 page long mess. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 20:52, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No. we are voting on a matter in a compartment. That is the continued existence of this separate article. It does not matter that the article has merit or has no merit, since it is <i>also</i> contained within the "parent article". Voting for a split is done on article talk pages. Where a split has already happened by virture of a '<i>bold edit</i> (and no harm in that) the original material must be removed and a short prćcis put in its place. Since this was not completed the article we are voting on is, by definition, a POV fork. So, let's get rid of it. Then, if it is the correct thing to do, let's have an editor who understands the issues split it properly and completely. I'm disappointed, because I view the concept of a split as correct. It is <i>this unfinished split</i> that must be ended. there was nothing to prevent the splitting editor from finishing the job, nomination or no nomination. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 19:39, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>C'mon, don't be a bureaucracy type&#160;:) The discussion on the Talk:9/11 Conspiracy theories had begun before TitaniumDragon created this page. 4 or 5 ppl were discussing this matter. There was no clear consensus - everyone stood with one's arguments. Then, sort of indenpendently, this page was created and the case went "public". I see it as a continuation of that discussion, I understand you may not. I know it does not follow "protocols" but since we're already here - don't let the bureaucracy machine got you between it's gears&#160;;) --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvNaut_b0e8.html" title="User:SalvNaut">SalvNaut</a> 22:15, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I know it looks like bureaucracy. But this AfD has become so complex and so oddly political that it would genuinely behove us to delete the thing, and to do the split as a separate exercise. There is a huge danger of confusion otherwise, and the closing admin doesn't stand a chance of getting it right. There are times when a procedure is needed, and when things have become overcomplicated, such as here, I believe process is approriate. Note that <u>I am in favour of a proper split</u>. I just do not think that this is the discussion to do it in.

Thus articles which are notable, not original research and which have or strive to have a neutral POV should be created and survive deletion attempts.

<li><b>Comment</b> I do not see the logic in this argument from the encyclopaedia's perspective. I am not singling you out, here, but am really answering all such comments. As an encyclopaedia it is part of Wikipedia to document in an encyclopaedic manner the phenomena of the world. The various conspiracy theories, whether pseudo-science or founded on reality, are individually and collectively a phenomenon worthy of inclusion, the more so since they are properly cited. The article that has been split off and the parent article which spawned it have a place here. The rationale for the split is simply a matter of filing, not a matter of forking any point of view. We need to be very clear that this anniversary period of the atrocity is a period when clarity of thought about an article set to which many people have a huge emotional attachment is essential. Let us please look at editing standards, not at other issues. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 10:16, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Tom, this is not a POV fork. This is not the article about "how did it happen" but "what common people (and some researchers) say about it" on the Internet. This could change your view on sources. As Thomas said(<a href="../../../9/2F/1/Talk%7E9_11_conspiracy_theories_b1d3.html" title="Talk:9/11 conspiracy theories">Talk:9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, the criticism would apply even stronger on the splitted page. I see it a bit like <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a>. You must admit that CD became a very notable myth. It is a fact from the field of sociology that many people do not want to belive the official explanation of the collapse(with a variety of reasons for it - <i>looks</i>, CTism, <i>pseudoscience</i>, NIST report, WTC7, science(?Jones), etc..). The topic is definately worth it's own article.

<li><b>Question</b> This AfD is a strange phenomenon. As a general principle we split articles which are too long into articles which reference other articles.. Patently the parent article is too long. According to the author all that has been done is to split out and slightly reword for clarity the section suggesting CD, but that the new article is a verbatim (plus minor edits) version of the original text. Under those circumstances how can it be a fork? How can it be allowing conspiracy theories to grow, and how can it suddenly be non NPOV? Surely there can only can only be a fork if the original text has been left behind? I admit to not checking in detail if the text remains in the original article. If it does then the simple solution is to finish the split and discard this AfD? Perhaps the author would comment on this. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 13:43, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

If the believers of the official story have a point to make then that is provided space on wikipedia. Alternate viewpoints are also provided space. This issue is not large, it is huge. Over 100 million Americans believe something fishy is going on with 9/11. And that's just Americans. Just because en.wikipedia.org is in English doesn't mean it is the "Voice of America." If wikipedia can have individual articles about and obscure <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haikouichthys.html" title="Haikouichthys">primitive fish-like animal from the Middle Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China</a> then it definitely has the space, in fact the imperative, for articles about the thesis that the collapse of the twin towers and building 7 on 911 due to fire, an unprecedented historical event, is untrue, and that the event is more consistent with controlled demolition.

<dd><b>Comment</b> WP: OR and WP: RS are very important, which is why this page is so well sourced. All research is original; OR bans users from doing original research then putting it into articles. However, this is not OR from readers, but external OR which is readily verifiable. As WP: RS points out, our job is to report facts and opinions; a lot of this article is about opinions of people, and as such the title of the page reflects this. Additionally it is pointed out who thinks these things and why, the sources of these opinions, and the sources they got their information from (such as video footage of the event). This article has very few things which are not sourced, and though it could certainly use some work making it read better and sound more professional, on the whole it is one of the better sourced articles on Wikipedia; it isn't like <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy.html" title="Therianthropy">Therianthropy</a>, other articles I try and deal with but which have severe problems with source material being unreliable as it makes sweeping claims but often does so without any actual basis for those claims, and as they are trying to describe a phenomenon rather than what otherkin.net says, it is a problem. This article doesn't have this problem as it is about what conspiracy theorists say and various theories they hold and why they hold them; the fact that they are conspiracy theorists doesn't matter as we want to know what they think and why, not what actually happened. This article describes one of their theories, and is, I think, pretty clear on the matter. It needs some work, and I'd be glad to have help cleaning it up. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 23:29, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Completely impertinent comment</b> - I'm wondering, if the Illuminati were trying to provoke the US into war, why didn't they just do a nasty UNCONTROLLED demolition? It would have done a hell of a lot more damage to nearby buildings, plus it wouldn't have set off the radars of the <s>conspiracy nutbags</s> defenders of truth and justice. Furthermore, I think it was a poor decision to let the towers sit there smoking for so long before they collapsed, they could really have killed a lot more people if the collapse took place ~30 minutes earlier.

<li><b>Completely impertinent response</b>: Actually, the way the Towers were designed, pretty much any failure of its internal support structure, no matter how or where it was caused, would have let to a straight-down collapse. You might be able to have designed a way to "get lucky" and have the collapse tend to be directed a few hundred feet in one direction or the other, but that's about it. A lot of people think that if, say, you'd knock out all the ground supports on only one side of a building, that it would tend to tip over horizontally like someone knocking over a soda bottle. But that's just not the way physics works. (Okay, okay, if Godzilla came along - a really f---ing <b>gigantic</b> Godzilla - and yanked the towers right out of the ground with his mighty paws, I'm sure a lot more damage would have been caused in the immediate area.

<li>Yeah, one of the things I've heard about skyscrapers is that firefighters really fear this type of design that tends to "pancake" vertically (usually without much warning) in a chain reaction fashion.

<li>Indeed, I thought at first it would likely tip over as well, but once I thought about it at length I realized that the physics I'd learned in HS pretty much showed that it would just pancake. The only way a building like that wouldn't is if it actually got hit hard by something which pushed the building a long ways horizontally without destroying enough of its veritcal integrity that it would just collapse straight down or near straight down. Of course, some of the local stuff might be ejected, but given the building stood up to the inital blow (a plane really doesn't weigh -that- much compared to something as big as the WTC towers) it should have pancaked. Of course, a lot of the basis of the argument is that the tower shouldn't have collapsed at all, given no other scyscraper had. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 07:02, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Commment</b> Anyone who takes an objective look at the 9/11CT article in its present form can see that much of the material on the WTC needs to be removed for the sake of length, surveyability and general tidyness. No consensus can be won for simply deleting it. So the split is the best way forward.

<li>Yes, but let's do it properly. Splitting is not complete until the old article has the stuff removed. That has led to this whole discussion. Far better to start again by deleting this (but allowing re-creation), recreating with a proper split, and splitting out other splittable stuff correctly. This then becomes an exercise in controlled editing, not in POV fork discussions. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 09:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've read your comments up there and here. Starting the case from the begining doesn't appeal to me (will it take so long, too?) but I trust that your experience tells you (and the closing admin) the right thing to do. Just to note: some have already started working on Controlled-Demolition Theory (9/11 Conspiracy Theory) article and it's more current than the subsection in <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>.--<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvNaut_b0e8.html" title="User:SalvNaut">SalvNaut</a> 10:37, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>One more thing - we aren't here to excercise but to write a better article. This split has been proposed many times before but a group of editors decided to keep all <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> in the single article (so the article to be clumsy I guess). My POV is that it was mainly due to their POV on the CTs - this should not matter here. We want a better article which deals (contra&amp;pro) with CD theory. The topic deserves it. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvNaut_b0e8.html" title="User:SalvNaut">SalvNaut</a> 10:55, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>By <i>exercise</i> I mean the noun, not the verb. I also mean <u>let us get to a datum point and then split</u>. To this end any editor can <b>be bold</b> provided they do not create a POV fork and provided the split is performed correctly, which this one, technically, was not. Splitting the article into correctky manageable chunks provides readability and editability, thus a better article is written. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 11:12, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Correct. If for example the namespace was more focused on 9/11 World Trade Center conspiracy theories in general (Including for example the theories on Larry Silverstein's insurance stake, the gold reserve beneath the WTC, and so forth) it would not be a PoV fork, and would still serve the purpose of trimming the main article to manageable standards.

The <i>Globus Cassus</i> project was proposed - and published - by a notable architect in notable circumstances (the Venice Architecture Biennale), it has been widely discussed and is therefore worthy of an article. It is worth noting that <i>Globus Cassus</i> is largely a thought experiment, since there is no pragmatic basis for its implementation in the near future anyway. With that in mind, the project is akin to many other "futurist" proposals such as <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terraforming.html" title="Terraforming">terraforming</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstellar_travel.html" title="Interstellar travel">interstellar travel</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a> or <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_ecological_system.html" title="Closed ecological system">closed ecological systems</a> that if ever realised would undoubtedly pose major problems, but that are unlikely to be realised anyway and that, right now, serve as thought experiments.

<dd>It's a putrid concept for a number of reasons. 1) It's most likely entirely impossible regardless of reasonably imaginable future technology. 2) It would certainly destroy much life and destroy the world as we know it. 3) Most of the world's current problems are solveable by us with technology we already have. There's no reason for poverty, hunger, most disease deaths, environmental degradation, etc. except that these are the necessary price for maintaining the priveleged lifestyles of a very small percentage of the world's population. Globus Cassus presupposes that we cannot or will not solve these problems without resorting to a mega-project of monumental risk, expense and dubious (at best) viability... but if Globus Cassus were actually necessary, humanity would already have passed the threshhold of survivability. (And if humans had already settled such issues as competitiveness and conflict, then Globus Cassus would be unnecessary). 4) Even if it could be realised, it sets up an inherently risky dichotomy: there are two halves of the world facing each other which, given what we know of ourselves, suggests a future of terrible hemispherical rivalry and conflict. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 01:55, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I counted ~21,000 refs for insex.com, and 1,420 refs for insex.org. Just looking up "insex" does give around ~586,000, but just a quick looks show most of them seem to have nothing to do with the company. I see references to intersex, to a band called insex, and to a 2006 movie called Insex. Perhaps with all of my years in the BDSM community I've managed to miss it. The article, especially minus the two web site references, is almost a stub. The only think that seems notable to me is that the claim is made that it was targeted by the Bush admninistration and put out of business. I wonder how many sex oriented web sites have gone out of business as a result of the aggressive policies of the Attorney Generals office?

<dd><b>Comment:</b> 21,000 hits still seems a lot for a non-notable company; there is a featured article around here about a Australian netball player "Cynna Kydd" that would only return 2,000 refs. Anyway, the fact that it is almost a stub can't be a reason for deletion, since it was created merely one day ago. Plus it does have a certain worldwide notability, there is even an article on the Japanese Wikipedia for instance, <a href="../../../../ja/i/n/s/Insex.html" class="extiw" title="ja:Insex">ja:Insex</a>.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The point made above would be fine but those issues aren't disputed. His sexuality is, and as always when the issue of possible bisexuality or homosexuality arises with an historical figure, those objecting to it demand infinitely greater detailing and citations than heterosexual speculation. The scenario always goes like this: (a) someone inserts the claim (b) claim disputed and citation demanded (c) citation provided (d) single citation disputed as slim evidence and claim deleted (e) claim inserted with addition citations (f) detailed and referenced claim now disputed as imbalancing the article (g) article split off (h) split off article now claimed to be unnecessary. Rinse and repeat. In other words, it's impossible to placate bigots, because they only operate on a policy of absolute denial. The split off article is the best compromise to provide detailing of the possibility of Lincoln's bisexuality, given that even the mere suggestion of such will never be accepted, or indeed tolerated, by some, and further, because Lincoln's relationships were of a complexity that requires length to properly detail their context for both sides.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> None of that really matters. The topic of this article was not created by one Wikipedian and one Wikipedian isn't the only source for the claim that Lincoln may have been homosexual. The article has a number of citations that show a number of authors have made this claim. Whether the claim is true or false is somewhat immaterial to whether this article should be kept. There is clearly some debate on the issue amongst a number of notable scholarly sources and this is a topic that is noteworthy enough to stay. In any case, the article does not claim that Lincoln was in fact homosexual. The conclusion it seems to draw, insofar as it draws any conclusions, is that he might have been homosexual or bisexual, but probably was not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerDeathRobot_f4ad.html" title="User:KillerDeathRobot">KillerDeathRobot</a> 19:10, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There's been a great deal of speculation as to Abraham Lincoln's sexuality for a while, and whenever a large publisher releases a book that mentions it, it gets nation wide coverage. For me, that does establish the notability of the subject. I don't see the article as being POV. There's (at least in some of the sections) mention of the arguments as to why some of the "evidence" doesn't show him being gay. This is the sort of subject that I can see people looking up in Wikipedia the next time a book that mentions the subject comes out (no pun intended). --- <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethling_7cd1.html" title="User:Bethling"><font color="#BB45AA">The Bethling</font></a><a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBethling_721d.html" title="User talk:Bethling"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 04:08, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article deals primarily with the debate over Lincoln's secuality. That debate is academically notable as the article makes abundently clear. Whether in fact Lincoln was actually gay, straight, or bi is almost completly besides the point. Claims that this should be deleted or merged because we can never conclusively prove anything in this debate also miss the point. If that was the standard of notability, then almost all articles on history, anthropology, archeology etc (at least the interesting ones) should be deleted. Indeed, almost any article involving competing claims and contravsial subjects would need to be deleted. Wikipedia does not require that issues be settled. Only that they be verifiable. The material in this article cites crediable secondary sources in a notable controversy. It also discusss criticisms and alternative interpretations. This is fair game for a stand alone Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 05:19, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per KillerdeathRobot and others above. The topic is a subject of scholarly debate (Just the same as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a>) and whether or not it's true does not matter (Just like with ID--and who would argue that <i>they</i> have an agenda?) as long as the article is sourced per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The article is not perfect but it certainly not grounds for delete. As a side note, I do like the suggestion to rename to Personal life of Abraham Lincoln for the reasons mentioned by JimWae. Not only would that lessen the claims of an <i>agenda</i> behind it, it would open the article up to other relevant details of Abe's life. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:35, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Obvious Delete</b> What's next on Wikipedia, we write articles called, "Food preferences of Abraham Lincoln" and people vote to keep based on how well sourced it is? There's no reason or purpose to such stuff. It might be enjoyable to speculate whether or not Lincoln enjoyed cherry pie more than apple pie, but really, an encyclopedic article on such a preference? Hey, did he prefer white socks or black socks? Obvious POV fork and complete nonsense. Let's not let idle minds with lot's of free time for historical speculation ruin a perfectly good encyclopedia.<a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 11:28, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If several books and numerous scholarly articles and a number of symposia were available that dealt with "Food preferences of Abraham Lincoln", then yes we should have such an article. I personally happen to have a strong interst in food and culture. But those materials aren't there and so neither is the article. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> and others may feel this is trival. They are welcome to their POV. But there is sufficent debate, controversy, and documentation to warrent the inclusion of this article. Regarding, the title, I think it should remain as is. It accurate reflects the issue, without sensationalizing it. Would people really be happier with an 'Abe was gay' kind of thing? <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 15:59, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>MTG Twincast is to my knowledge the only website dedicated to delivering news and strategy specifically for the United Kingdom. In the three months since its' inception MTG Twincast gets 650 unique visits a day and our fan membership has doubled in the last 30 days. The site's run on a non-profit basis and has many sponsors and links from other local and commerical Magic stores and clubs situated in the UK.</p>
<p>Although the site has a bulletin board, the web content is updated on average 3 1/2 times per week, in the month of August it received 13,000 page views. Although our project is in its' infancy I would not call it non-notable.</p>

<ul>
<li>I find it absolutely appalling that 'Dave' accuses the society of being a drinking society when he can clearly know absolutely nothing about the society. Before making such assertions perhaps he should contact some of the frontbench politicians, such as the former leader of the Conservative Party Michael Howard, who attend the society's events and ask them whether the society debates serious issues or engages in drinking. Perhaps he should also ask the 150 students who attended the Michael Howard event (average weekly attendance at the Cambridge Union is rarely over 30). And as for there being 39 hits on google, your average Cambridge student lives in the real world.</li>

<dd>It should be clear to anyone that the society exists and has held the events listed with the frontbench politicians named in the article about the society on wikipedia. This can be easily checked with those politicians' offices and Peterhouse itself if necessary. It should be clear to anyone that any society that holds the events the Peterhouse Politics Society does is a serious society and thus merits its entry on wikipedia: it is utterly ridiculous to suggest that so many famous politicians would come to the society's meetings if it were merely a 'drinking' society. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ppspps (<a href="../../../p/p/s/User_talk%7EPpspps_5491.html" title="User talk:Ppspps">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ppspps_ec2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ppspps">contribs</a>) 18:43, September 14, 2006.</small>

<p>The Comments by 'Dave' are immature, ignorant and wrong. As it has been clearly stated, the Peterhouse Politics Society is worthy of note based upon its reputation and standing within the University of Cambridge as a focal point and premiere speaker society for political discussion and debate. If Dave is so concerned about pointless drinking societies appearing on the pages of Wikipedia, perhaps he should turn his attention to the entry for the illustrious Pitt Club, a drinking society par excellence. As already noted, if he is so concerned about Peterhouse Politics Society being a drinking society, perhaps before making wild and inaccuarte assertions he should contact the prestigous speakers cited in the list of Peterhouse Politics Society. But be warned, they are all extremely busy people who probably would not take kindly to having their time wasted with questions from an individual who evidently knows nothing about what he is debating and has far to much time on his hands. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mrsthatcher (<a href="../../../m/r/s/User_talk%7EMrsthatcher_df3d.html" title="User talk:Mrsthatcher">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mrsthatcher_d90e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mrsthatcher">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>I agree - and even now I am uneasy about the Pitt Club article, too. I would be happier if it were an article on the phenomenon of clubs devoted to Pitt, and his personality cult, in general. (The Cambridge Pitt is hardly notable beyond those who've attended the university). Yes, you're right that it can't help its age, but it's not just the age that means it is not notable. It has not had enough impact beyond Cambridge to warrant an article of its own; this is what matters rather than the significance of the speakers (which is why the speakers are in Wikipedia for the most part) - a section in the article on Peterhouse is more appropriate, I think. (Sounds like a good society though - wish it had been in existence when I was there) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreycap_0a24.html" title="User:Greycap">Greycap</a> 18:40, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>True, but keep in mind that the article was written by himself. Furthermore, Google turns up virtually no results on this guy except for an occasional web page written by himself. Because of this, it is nearly impossible for any other Wikipedians to contribute to the article, and there is no way of confirming the objectivity of most of the information there. Therefore, this would be considered a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">vanity article</a> according to Wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../t/s/c/User%7ETschel_8cd0.html" title="User:Tschel">Tschel</a> 20:00, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Very weak keep.</b> It may be vanity, but as <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> states, "vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion, but lack of assertion of notability is." If he's a staff writer for a major newspaper and had a role on a national reality show, I'd be inclined to say he meets notability thresholds. That being said, this barely qualifies as a stub. Also, both claims are unverified. If the guy really is a journalist, I'd expect him to come up with something more substantial than this. <a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleather_9646.html" title="User:Pleather">Pleather</a> 00:30, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>True but if you google Johnny Diaz and Boston, you can verify that he is a reporter and see some of his articles. All his information is verifiable.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, in its new state (3 short sentences), all the information certainly is verifiable. However, the article now makes no assertion of notability. Yes, he may have played a token role in a national reality show, but thousands of the rank-and-file can make that claim. I really don't see any reason to keep this article. Before it was pared down, it made all kinds of wild, unverifiable claims, and now, in its "just the facts" form, it lacks any kind of significance.</dd>

<dd>It's not hard to figure out why the article is here in the first place. This fellow is writing about himself! But is his <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a> significant and neutral enough to justify an encyclopedia article? Maybe not. --<a href="../../../t/s/c/User%7ETschel_8cd0.html" title="User:Tschel">Tschel</a> 21:33, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A search of his name shows that he was part of a reporting team at the south Florida Miami Herald newspaper where he shared a Pulitzer Prize when that news organisation won the prize for the coverage of Elian Gonzalez, the little Cuban boy who washed up ashore in Miami and who was seized by the federal government via Janet Rio in 2000. Between the MTV show, the Thomas Roberts news item and the Pulitzer prize, perhaps Mr. Diaz should remain as a wikipedia article.</p>

<p>Was a highly negative article about an Austrailian businessman convicted of fraud. Mostly blanked supposedly at the request of his family. Information is at least partially verifiable from the Austrailian government PDF link provided. But I'm not sure that this person meets notability requrements. An Austrailian business-man convicted of fraud. I don't find him in Google, other than WP mirrors. So, while the negative versions of the article are likely salvagible even under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, if he's not really notable, why bother.

<p>The result was <b>Delete.</b> Ignoring the potential copyright issues, and also ignoring the article's authors' and defenders' involvement with the organization, it is plain to see that the article's contents fail to establish the movement's notability aside from the involvement of certain notable individuals. This discussion also fails in this respect - notability and worthiness of an article based on our inclusion guidlines have not been established. While the existance of the organization is verifiable, some of the lofty claims made here are not. If the organization were to verifiably become truly notable like so many of the religions, groups, cults, movements, philosophies, and ways of life listed on Wikipedia, then inclusion would be a given. However, at this stage in the movement's existance, this is not the case. --Jeffrey O. Gustafson - <i><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_Shazaam_7ee3.html" title="User:Jeffrey O.

If these entries are considered encyclopedic, then Portland Movement content has it's place in this Wikipedia - the affiliation with McKean as well as the ICOC are factors which make the Portland International Church of Christ a notable congregation in the context of Wikipedia. Please assist by pointing out examples of "sermon-like" content in the article, they should be discussed, and then edited or removed appropriately.

<dd>Mr. "Plether", my affiliation does not change the aforementioned contextual facts. How do you recommend rewording the above quote, "Beginning with nine members, the Latin ministry grew to 70 members as of 2006?" Removing references of God's influence on the phenomenon of church growth, or references that are similar ("x" happened because of God) is feasible, albeit awkward given the religious subject matter of this article. This fact (the growth of a ministry) is related, as it illustrates the momentum that the Portland Church is creating, much like the Boston Church created during the formation of the Boston Movement (now the <a href="../../../i/c/o/ICOC_e2ba.html" title="ICOC">ICOC</a>). <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlynx_c005.html" title="User:Merlynx">Jeremy Ciaramella</a> 21:58, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I can't see why you would delete this. The ICOC became, at one time, the fastest growing religious movement in the world. That is a notable accomplishment. Kip McKean led this movement, and it began by breaking away from the traditional Churches of Christ. This is not a non-notable church, simply because it is the church in which Mr. McKean has again broken away from the 'organized' church - except this time he created the church from which he is breaking away. His prior break had great impact on the Churches of Christ and the world. This break may have similar results, and a thread should be maintained so this can be documented. Other persons notable for breaks with traditon: Martin Luther (using the above criteria, should we not delete the entry on Lutheran Church?), Jonh Wesley, John Calvin, William Tyndale - the list goes on. Kip McKean is a modern reformist - and the Portland Chrurch is certainly noteworthy enough to stay listed in Wikipedia. If you remove this article based on this complaint, you must then remove all protestant reformers and their resulting denominations on the same grounds.Scooterjonz 20:11, 14 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Scooterjonz (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scooterjonz_04e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scooterjonz">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></dd>

<dd>Article regarding the Portland Church of Christ. The Portland Church remains one of the fastest growing church's of Christ in the country. For all practical purposes the church attendance as of Jan. 2004 was 120 people with 1 baptized teen and 2 campus students. In two years time the church has multiplied three times its size to 360. They have grown the campus ministry to well over 55 people on 11 campus in the Portland area. They also have now built up a zealous teen/middleschool ministry with well over 45 people. All of this growth has been accomplished while simultaneously sending out and supporting numerous church plantings. For 2006 the church is on a pace to baptize over 100 people. There are many churches of Christ with larger numbers of members yet, unfortunately, are not as dynamic (dynamic meaning in a state of change and growth). Static churches remain the same for a period of time and than wither away. The Portland Church of Christ believes in praying for those churches and answering any call for help that might come. The church also believes in making positive changes for their community, state, country and world. These facts are true and verifiable. While any church such as Baptist, Catholic, and Methodist have their critics - not unlike the Portland Church of Christ - it behooves the Wickipedia researcher to have fair and accurate information available so that an intelligent and logical person can make a fair judgement.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. First of all, this was speedy-deleted yesterday as copyvio (it's a cut-and-paste from a church website), then reposted today. Secondly, the text hardly bears out evidence of a so-called "movement". There are vague references to "discipling relationships" in areas outside of Portland, but the only clear claim of organizational momentum is the growth of the Portland International Church of Christ from "approximately 275 disciples" ( i.e. congregation members) in 1996 to "Over 500 in attendance on Sundays" today. Those are the only hard numbers asserting notability, so far as I can tell.</li>

<dd>Thirdly, for a mass movement with "the dream of evangelizing the entire world in a single generation," this one appears to have attracted almost no mention in the media. I get a grand total of 34 Google hits for "Portland Movement" in conjunction with "Kip McKean", its purported leader, of which ten are derived from Wikipedia. With all due respect, while this may well at some point become a notable mass reform trend, it isn't now. --<a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleather_9646.html" title="User:Pleather">Pleather</a> 22:44, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was the one who reposted the article. The article was probably mistakenly thought of as a "copyvio." This article is not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CSD#A8" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CSD#A8" rel="nofollow">CSD A8 "copyvio"</a> however. Most of the article is original. I also was not notified by the editor concerning the copyvio as stated in the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. Some quotes and ideas were taken from some Portland Bulletin articles merely to better justify and back the ideas in this article. If this article is on another website please list the website's url as I do not belive this is possible since I have been in possesion of the writing until it's posting. As far as the "global movement," there is a clear listing of congregations around the world and the US that are affiliated with the Portland Movement. I can put a listing of affiliated congregations if this helps clear things up. With all that said, the Portland Movement is in it's infancy and therefore not as clear as say the former ICOC.

Is referring to these groups' websites considered proof of being notable - or is that considered an internal source?

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>: Please explain in detail how this church is non-notable compared to say, <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahu_Christian_churches_7d5c.html" title="Lahu Christian churches">Lahu Christian churches</a> or any other article such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_comic_strips.html" title="List of comic strips">List of comic strips</a>. My point is is that a notable church to one person may not be a notable church to another. Many people are watching what is going on in Portland.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: As has been explained, you have to show from verifiable, independent sources (ICOC is hardly independent) that the church or movement is notable. What is the total number of followers? It all seems very small and limited. I'm not comparing to other churches or other articles (perhaps they are deletable as well), and a list is a different thing, as that is (logically) a list of things that are themselves notable or non notable. The comics on that list (at least the Franco-Belgian ones) have sold millions of copies, have been constantly in print for decades, have been translated in many languages, ... All of them are the source of multiple independent reviews, articles, and often complete studies. They are clearly notable. And could you give some examples of the "many chruch movements of the past that never really got very big yet are still considered notable"? Exclude those that led to mass suicides or large court cases for sexual abuse and so on, as those are notable for those reasons, not for being a church movement as such... As for the copyvio, how are we to definitely know (in a legally safe way, according to Wikipedia policy) that it is the same person that has written the article, and not someone who has just copied it from that website? And an article written by one of its key subjects is often a bad idea and may easily violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, as you can see in sections like "Division" (calling the new vision "reactionary" is a clear example of POV. Forums "poisoned" the members is another example. The movement is less than a year old, and has no outside sources. It is non notable, not verifiable, written from a clear POV, and is technically a copyvio. More than enough reasons for a deletion. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:42, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It is <i>very</i> difficult to write from a perfectly NPOV. Everyone has built in biases and therefore will never <i>truly</i> write from a <i>perfectly</i> NPOV. I have tried my hardest to make sure that the article is NPOV. I welcome any suggestions and have already noted your previous suggestions. As far as the copyvio, a letter has been written to Wikimedia that states clearly that I have been comissioned by the Portland Church to write this article.

<dd>Jeremy, I've moved your comment above to its own thread, as it's generally considered unproductive to insert comments, out of chronological order, in the middle of a thread. Also, you'll note that I added the <b>Comment</b> tag. This is a very useful tool for keeping these discussions readable, as it distinguishes additional information from one's original opinion on retention.

<dd>Secondly, the debate at hand is NOT copyright violation; that was the criteria for the "speedy delete" process, which is now over. Please, please understand that the topic at hand is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a>. Just because something is described as a "movement" doesn't make it so: hard data--numbers and facts--make it so. I see "The Portland Church currently is actively overseeing congregations in 8 different nations" and "The Portland Movement is a part of the ethos of <a href="../../../k/i/p/Kip_McKean_1c63.html" title="Kip McKean">Kip McKean</a>". What, exactly, does "overseeing congregations" mean? How does "ethos" relate to notability? <a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleather_9646.html" title="User:Pleather">Pleather</a> 18:49, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I did not realize that the debate for "speedy delete" process was over. Thank you again for clarification. To oversee a congregation means that the Portland Church directly influences, trains, and works with the given local congregation and its leadership. That local congregation shares the same goals as the Portland Movement, and the same/very similar church building methodologies. It also means that the local church does not practice <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomy.html" title="Autonomy">Autonomy</a>. Ethos is defined as "the character or disposition of a community, group, person, etc." and the ICOC is a large community of churches, with <a href="http://www.icocinfo.org/church_directory.html" class="external text" title="http://www.icocinfo.org/church_directory.html" rel="nofollow">thousands of members</a> - even after its upheavals. The Portland Movement is a part of this community - albeit contraversial - and recording its activity in relation to the ICOC community and a key individual (Kip McKean) rounds out the description of the ethos of the ICOC and Kip McKean. Futher defining both of these entries' dispositions in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlynx_c005.html" title="User:Merlynx">Jeremy Ciaramella</a> 19:33, 15 September 2006 (</dd>

<p>Having two (and only two) consistent members in the lifetime of a band isn't a very interesting thing, not least because there must be a vast number of such bands - most bands only have 3 or 4 members to begin with. Surely all duos would fit in this list as well?</p>

<li>Its very title doesn't reference a particular topic - the term "golden age" is not a universally agreed-upon term for any given time frame - some say it's the short era between the Viking era and the "400-year night"; others say it's from 1870 to 1920, corresponding with the national romantic movement, others think it's about now.</li>

<p>Smallish outdoor shopping center (strip mall) with a layout similar to an indoor mall. According to the article, the shopping center includes 257,452 square feet; many malls and shopping centers have <i>single stores</i> with more floorspace than this.</p>
<p>I could see having an article about a strip mall this small, if it also had historical significance, monuments or landmarks, or some other reason for having widespread renown. But all we have are hopelessly unverifiable statements about the location's popularity with teenagers and skateboarders.</p>
<p>The article's talk page mentions that the article shouldn't be deleted because "it gives information on a shopping center/mall. It gives information for locals who would like to find an area to shop or dine." but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a local shopping and dining guide. <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a> currently holds that shopping malls aren't inherently notable, and this particular one strikes me as being nowhere close to notable.</p>

<dd>I apologize for neglecting to include an explanation. My main concern is due to the fact that there are no guidelines for Notability for Theatre Companies, which is what this form of sketch comedy would best fall into. It should also be pointed out that the term "cult following" generally suggests a small but tenacious group of fans, commonly of the high school to college demographic. I agree that the group does not meet the broad Notability requirement for Comedy for national fame, because they have not found national exposure. However, as I have stated elsewhere, theatrical troupes are by necessity tied closely to the community, and usually do not seek national coverage, nor are likely to get it. Nonetheless, the argument <i>could</i> be made on the Comedy Notability requirement for "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city"-- as evidenced by the Bloomington Reader's Poll. The articles cited, while not as diversified as I would have liked, are nevertheless drawn from dates over the course of over two years, and suggest a continued fanbase. Their lasting power as a noteworthy troupe in Bloomington could also be inferred from the fact that the group has existed since 1999 but remains popular, despite the fact that the majority of attendees would graduate yearly from Indiana University and move away. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodAaron_ddcb.html" title="User:GoodAaron">GoodAaron</a> 19:34, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm hesitant to use the H word here but the veracity of this article is hard to establish. The fact that these are the sole edits of the creator is not reassuring. Apparently linked to Andre 3000 but Google doesn't know about that. Apparently won the "Paul McCartney Songwriting Award" but Google is not aware that such an award exists. Apparently stared in a production of "The Wiz" but, wait for it, Google never heard of that either! There is another Keith Brooks, however, which apparently is somewhat notable as a soul/Gospel singer and an author listed on Amazon. They are most definitely not this 21-year old. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 19:36, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm really not sure what the Google search is supposed to prove, since most ocurrences of the suffix would necessarily be as part of other words, rather than as a free-floating separate word.

<dd>(1) Would you care to take the time to explain to me, clearly a lesser mortal, what those "basic facts about linguistics and search engine algorithms" are?</dd>
<dd>(2) Maybe you mean that there's a webpage out there that discusses "-inista" without using it in isolation? But such a webpage would surely use at least the three words cited in the article, wordinista, sandinista, and feminista. Google searches for <i>feminista wordinista</i> and <i>feminista sandinista</i> yield 0 results. A Google search for <i>feminista sandinista</i> yields lots of results, but none of the top results, at least, is actually about "-inista."</dd>
<dd>(3) Even if there are sources out there that are actually about this term, the article as it stands cites no such sources. It's OR. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:09, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most basic fact is that there would be many possible ways in which words using the suffix could be discussed without "inista" occurring as a free unbound form.

<p>This is, in essence, a random YouTube video which for some reason has its own article. Deprodded by an anon, this comes nowhere near being notable but has gained some popularity amongst internet forums. Some sweeping references have been made to it in a couple of magazines, but it's hardly been the subject of "multiple <b>non-trivial</b> published works" which WP:WEB requires. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 21:30, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> The article in questionf features information on a popular flash animation that has been featured on multiple pages, YouTube NOT being the main focus or its original intention. In fact, this isn't a YouTube video at all like every other user has attempted to make idle claims to. Misrepresenting this article in order to have it deleted shows poorly on those working against it. Researching and investigating the topic in question before openly calling for deletion is the first step in creating a fair and well-maintained "Free Encylopedia." The article focuses on several points of note, including the satirical nature of the flash animation which is based on the popular Metal Gear Solid. If anything, the article should be revised to include more potentially useful information to anyone creating their own satire of popular video game fiction. With the publication in two widely circulated magazines (with links included), this video has already generated a good deal of non-internet related publicity for itself that is anything but "trivial" <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECiroryder_7623.html" title="User:Ciroryder">Chad Schaeffer</a> 23:35, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm just glad you actually investigated Crab Battle a bit more. A popular flash video that is known through-out the Metal Gear Solid community. With this being a popular satire, could it merely be suggested that this article be linked to as a satire or fan-fiction creations of Metal Gear Solid? And my rant was long and all over the place, but I do believe I touched on all of the neglected points of note for this article. I'd also like to note, that the article was not originally created by the person who created Crab Battle, thus indicating some desire to inform people about this satirical work of flash fiction. Further review of your own Google Search will also yield links to various forums, fan-created sites, etc. Also, how does this not fall in line with Wikipedia hosting a site about YTMND <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YTMND" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YTMND" rel="nofollow">[74]</a>, a site dedicated to "trivial" work. -- <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECiroryder_7623.html" title="User:Ciroryder">Chad Schaeffer</a> 11:17, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then document it on a MGS wiki. This is a general encyclopaedia, for documenting things which are verifiably significant to the wider world. Tangential content regarded as "kewl" by groups of fans of particular video game does not in most cases qualify as having encyclopadic merit. And this is not "elitist", Steel is an active editor on CVG topics, and was made a sysop even though most of his edits are to CVG topics. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:09, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I took a look at those "references" and like Steel said, they are trivial! Its not the publicity that needs to be non-trivial (Chad Schaeffer says publicity is non-trivial which is not important), its the references that need to be non-trivial which means that an external source needs to devote significant text on explaining the subject. In all the references I looked it was only mentioned in passing, as a "cool thing to see". Nothing more.

<li><b>Comment</b> You should do more precise searches.

Always put quotation marks around the name and you should always exclude wikipedia from the search by putting a " -wikipedia" (space, minus sign, no space, wikipedia.) With a generic phrase like "Crab Battle" you need to include a second keyword to get a proper representation of the google results. Adding "metal gear" (w/quotes) does this. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22crab+battle%22+-wikipedia++%22metal+gear%22+&amp;num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22crab+battle%22+-wikipedia++%22metal+gear%22+&amp;num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">example</a>. Finally, we want to look at how many of the pages google chopped out because they were duplicated.. go to the last page in the google search. It will give the message "we have omitted some entries very similar to the 206 already displayed." So ~230 unique results out of about 26,900 (or less than 1%) are unique. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 05:58, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Please listen to my orignal comment. I did not say "all YTMND's don't deserve their own article" or "YTMND doesn't deserve its own article." I said, every YTMND on YTMND(or flash movie on Newgrounds) doesn't need it's own article, <b>unless</b> it has gotten some outside attention. As far as I can tell, MGS3: Crab Battle has only been popular on Newgrounds. The article makes the assertion that it has been viewed over a million times and yet google searches only get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;num=100&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22MGS+3%3A+Crab+Battle%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;num=100&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22MGS+3%3A+Crab+Battle%22" rel="nofollow">479</a> hits.

Also, as I state in the aforelinked thread, there was that one other editor who was able to step in and provide a discography, so there IS some interest. May I also remind you that in the early - mid '80s, one album's worth of material could be as little as eight songs? Seeing as though the band recorded a total of six singles (which equals out to at least twelve songs as per the traditional definition of a single), the minimal total output of this band of 12 songs would equal out to one traditional eight-song album and one four-song mini-album.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I wouldn't create an article for another group I'm a fan of, Language, because I know they only recorded a five-song EP and released a couple of singles. That's a minimal total of seven songs, not enough to comprise a pre-CD era album. I might create one for the songwriter/leader of the group, Steven Hale, because of his involvement with other groups (including one whose lead singer, Debbie King, was Gang Of Four lead singer Jon King's sister), but I recognize that an article on Language wouldn't go anywhere. This isn't the case with Academy. I will be eliciting information and assistance from other, TRUE "80s music fanclub bulletin boards" (BTW, on a fansite forum community, people don't discuss groups in such a cut-and-dry manner), and I am confident I can get the required assistance. The article was deleted just one day after it was created. Give it (and me) some time to gather information. If you see the same information on it after a month, then feel free to say, "Ha, see? You couldn't gather up the proper amount of information, even after calling out the cavalry. NOW we can talk about deleting the article."

<p>First at all, we - the authors - don't have any commercial aim. as Pan Dan point out. I dont understand the obstination to delete a new technological term that increase each day their worldwide use, i.e. IBM initiative of identification are using this ID-MeshUp term, for complex system of distributed networks. You can revise lots of other more obsolete, confuded and bad explained terms i.e. Mashup. Technical articles, comments, podcasts, workshops are using the similar term mashup with different definitions creating confusion. Let us to start defining first meshup that it is now clear, used, understandable and defined at least in Europe, where all is not only based on web integration and applications. If there isn't lexis matches now there are at least one wikipedia match that it is often what the practitioners are looking for the explanation in wikipedia. When We finish with the Meshup article We will start with mashup. I agree that the inclusion of the past bibliography in this article were confusing. Please by patient because this article is not easy to write. Ferran</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Is this a neologism as well? Though I'm not aware of a guideline on it, an article should only concern one subject. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusaabdulrashid_053f.html" title="User talk:Musaabdulrashid">Musaabdulrashid</a> 00:49, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ferran.Cabrer Musaabdulrashid, Good morning. I am absolutely agree with you hat this a neologism. Meshup is a Recent technological term, but it is unique and well defined by specialist in IT in particular to network information and communication, when they have to interconnect distributed and heterogeneous data, devices and networks to provide new IT services or applications. If you consider that neologisms don't have space i wikipedia, I delete the article of meshup. thanks in advance for your understanding, Ferran Cabrer en Ferran Cabrer i Vilagut Skype: Ferran.Cabrer CONSEN.org CONSEN (EEIG) Euro-Group Euro-Cluster pro-Information Society Information &amp; Communication Environments Jaume Fabra 12 08004 Barcelona</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> re: "neologism." To be fair, I don't think the problem with the article is that Meshup is a neologism. I also don't think that the article concerns more than one subject as Musa implies. It seems to me the article is about a technology called Meshup, which would be fine if Meshup were notable, but it's not. I brought up WP:CORP and WP:WEB in my nom to make the point that even if we tried to save the article by somehow viewing it as a business or a website instead of a technology, then it still wouldn't pass WP's guidelines. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 12:53, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>A good reason to get rid of it, as I still don't know what this is about.
