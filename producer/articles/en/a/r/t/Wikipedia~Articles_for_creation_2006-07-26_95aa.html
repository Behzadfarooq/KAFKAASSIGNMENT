<p>The Order of Daedalians claims to be America's premier fraternal order of military pilots. The Order of Daedalians was started on 26 March 1934, at Maxwell Field, Alabama, by Lieutenant Harold L. George. He was one of 35 W.W. I Regular Army commissioned pilots who formally established the Order of Daedalians. The purpose was stated to be to "... perpetuate the spirit of patriotism, the love of country, the memories, sad and pleasant, of our service during that period (W.W.I) and to further cement the ties of comradeship which bound us together in that critical hour of our nation's need...."</p>
<p>The idea was first expressed by Brigadier General William "Billy" Mitchell, who determined there was a need to honor the W W I pilots. Virtuall all of the over 14,000 W. W. I aviators who were commissioned as officers and rated as military pilots no later than the Armistice on 11 November 1918 has a founder Membership in the Order of gay Daedalians even though some did not, during their lifetime, participate as active members. At first, active membership was open only to Founder Members and their descendants (Hereditary Members.) In the early fifties Named Memberships established thereby insuring a new source of members for the Order of Daedalians. A qualified applicant interested in membership must be nominated by an active Daedalian and the application, endorsed by three other active Daedalians, must then be sent to National Headquarters for approval.</p>
<p>The Order of Daedalians established the Daedalian Foundation in 1959 to conduct educational, scientific and charitable activities in support of the Order's Tenets and Objectives. The Foundation is an IRS tax-exempt 501(C) (3) organization that relies on contributions,donations and bequests from the Daedalian membership to fund a comprehensive and varied scholarship program. The Foundation also publishes the Daedalus Flyer, the official journal of the Order of Daedalians.</p>
<p>In 2001, membership criteria were changed to authorize memberships for ex-commissioned officers whether or not they retired, and for all Flight officers and warrant officers who held ratings as military pilots of heavier-than-air powered aircraft.</p>
<p>In 2002 membership criteria were again changed to authorize memberships for WASP.</p>

<p>The Teseracte Players are Boston's premier travelling shadow-cast for the Rocky Horror Picture Show.</p>
<p>What is the Rocky Horror Picture Show? The Rocky Horror Picture Show is the movie adaptation of Richard O'Brien's musical, The Rocky Horror Show. The movie didn't do well in theaters when it was released in 1976. It was later shown as a midnight movie in New York City and a cult classic was born. The movie often plays late night around the world. It's going strong 30 years from its' release.</p>

Le mot Malfiance est un nom de famille utilisé dès le 16th siècle par les nobles et bourgeois. Il ne prend qu'en 1988 sa définition entière lorsque un entrepreneur décide d'ouvrir sa taverne dans le Nord-Pas de Calais, environs de Saint Omer. Un anthropologue de l'école de Vanjack, Allemagne de l'Est. découvre le secret de la signification du mot à travers un intense travail d'interprétation exceptionel sur le vocabulaire excentrique parlé par les berlinois, eu égard au fait de la progression intense des taxes sur le revenu des familles bulgares les plus nécessiteuses. Il était accepté que la Malfiance ait une signification intermédiaire entre la méfiance, qui signifie se méfier de quelqu'un, et la défiance qui est l'action de défier.</p>

<b>Lewis Barnavelt</b> is a fictional character who appears in a series of children's gothic horror novels by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bellairs_87a7.html" title="John Bellairs">John Bellairs</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Strickland_8060.html" title="Brad Strickland">Brad Strickland</a>. In each book, the group faces and overcomes various evil forces usually bent on ending the world.</p>
<p>In 1948, Lewis' parents are killed in a sudden car accident, and Lewis moves to the fictional town of New <a href="../../../z/e/b/Zebedee.html" title="Zebedee">Zebedee</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, to live at 100 High Street with his uncle, Jonathan Barnavelt. Lewis soon learns the truth about his uncle, their neighbor Florence Zimmermann (a kindly witch) and their house, that Jonathan is a wizard and the house used to belong to a warlock, Isaac Izard and his wife Selenna. After Lewis unwittingly ressurrects Selenna in an attempt to impress his friend Tarby (an act which drives the other boy away), Lewis helps to locate the clock that Isaac hid within the wall of the house and destroys it, sending the evil witch back to the grave permanently. After making friends with <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Rita_Pottinger_b908.html" title="Rose Rita Pottinger">Rose Rita Pottinger</a>, Lewis continues his adventures over the next several years.</p>
<p>At the start of the series, Lewis is a shy, overwight ten-year-old who enjoys reading. He is at one point described by Rose Rita as a worrywart, albeit one who displays true courage in genuinely dangerous situations. Though often the target of bullies, Lewis has been known to stand up for himself at times, either with the aid of outside forces (such as Rose Rita's presence or the amulet of Simon Moss) or later with his own courage. He has also been known to cause some of their supernatural problems, albeit accidentally, but more often than not will also be the one to help set things right.</p>
<p>In "The House With a Clock in Its Walls", it is said that when Lewis grows up, he becomes an astronomer working at Mount Palomar, and will discover that the magic egg he recieved that first Christmas is capable of showing him scenes on other planets.</p>

<p><b>15 Days in India: Where to Go</b></p>
<p>It would be good idea to spend more time in a few places rather than visiting too many places. Travelling within india is not quick unless you can afford to fly all the way. It also depends on what you want see and what you enjoy the most. Lot of people come to India to see the cultural beauty of the place rather than scenic beauty. Below is the list of must see places in India recommended for 15 day trip.</p>
<p>1. Rajasthan (west) - must see, real colors of India (I was born there). 2. Goa (west) - if you are a beach fanatic 3. Kerela (south) - God's own country, back waters, very scenic 4. Darjeeling, sikkim (east) - For the pleasure of mountain railways and tea 5. Mysore (south) - Historical town</p>
<p>It's recommended that you do not cover more than 2 of these places if your trip is just going to be just for 15 days. Consider taking the palace on wheels tour of rajasthan, it's very very expensive ($3500 per couple of 1 week).</p>

<p>T.A.

In 1986, although it had fallen into disrepair, the barn was listed on the Washington State Registry for Historic Preservation. In 2000-2001 the barn was restored by Bill Leonard, the grandson of T.A. Leonard, at a cost of over $90,000.</p>
<p>The barn's 12 sides have 30 windows and a large dormer. The 60-foot diameter structure has 3 levels inside. The main floor was used to house dairy cows and work horses and the upper levels held feed and tools. The story in the Spokesman Review tells of the kids using the barn as a playground.</p>

<b>NeoGen: Kerk vir 'n Nuwe Generasie</b> (<a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans.html" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> for <i>'Church for a new generation'</i>) is a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> youth movement functioning within the NG Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church) - in particular the NG Kerk Welgelegen. The church is located in La Provence Street in Welgelegen, in the Northern Suburbs of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Town_7c7b.html" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>.

<p>The first steps toward the development of an innovative concept for the Dutch Reformed youth service started in December 2004 under leadership of youth dominee (<a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans.html" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> for pastor) Alwyn Carstens and dominees GP Kellerman and Michiel Strauss. Bettie Strauss, daughter of Michiel Strauss and <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praise_and_worship.html" title="Praise and worship">praise and worship</a> leader from 2003 – 2005, approached Sybrand Strauss and Steyn Strauss (respectively brother and cousin of Bettie Strauss) to start a praise and worship band with the promise of playing in any style they would prefer. They were joined by Emile Kotzé (lead guitarist) and Wessel le Roux (drummer) and covered traditional Dutch Reformed hymns with a strong <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> influence.</p>
<p>During 2005, Sybrand, Bettie and Steyn began talks of a purely youth-focused church, conducted in a manner different to any <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Reformed_Church_a08f.html" title="Dutch Reformed Church">Dutch Reformed Church</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> and greatly influenced by <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillsong_Church_e785.html" title="Hillsong Church">Hillsong Church</a> in Australia. They approached the NG Kerk Welgelegen’s Youth Commission and in the end of November 2005, the concept of NeoGen: Kerk vir ‘n Nuwe Generasie was approved by both the Youth Commission and the Church Council. Bettie resigned as praise and worship leader at the end of 2005 to do her practical year for her studies in <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_therapy.html" title="Speech therapy">speech therapy</a>. Sybrand Strauss took over as praise and worship leader and Steyn Strauss as creative director of NeoGen.</p>

<p>There are rumours that NeoGen was started in Cape Town, South Africa in the late 1970s by a Dutch Reformed Church rebel and youth pioneer, Skaats de Wet. According to legend, de Wet rebelled against the Dutch Reformed Church's involvement in <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> and started the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> youth movement, NeoGenerasie (Afrikaans for Neo Generation) which later evolved into NeoGen.

<p>Major K.S. Chandpuri was commanding a company of a battalion of Punjab Regiment occupying a defended locality in Laungnewala in the Rajasthan Sector. On 5th December 1971, in the early hours of the morning, the enemy launched a massive attack on this locality with infantry and tanks.</p>
<p>Major Chandpuri exhibited dynamic leadership in holding his command intact and steadfast. Showing exceptional courage and determination, he inspired his men moving from bunker to bunker encouraging them in beating back the enemy till reinforcements arrived.</p>
<p>In this heroic defence, he inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and forced them to retreat leaving behind twelve tanks. In this action, Major Chandpuri displayed conspicuous gallantry and leadership.</p>

<p>Plastic Venus were the musical expression of a large section of angry and defiant Israeli youths in the early 90's. Combining <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_rock.html" title="Noise rock">noise rock</a> guitars, relentless drumming and the inimitable performance style of singer Ronit Bergman (often leading to gigs meeting an early ending), the band appeared in numerous small venues in Tel Aviv to an increasing following.</p>
<p>The first Plastic Venus album (originally released in 1993 through 3rd Ear and later remastered and reissued by Fact records) is a testament to that period and a glaring example of a true noise-rock classic.</p>
<p>The original line-up of the band included, besides Bergman, Guitarist Yoram Gur, Bassist Hagar Magen and drummer Ilan "Diamond" Leibowitz. After the completion of the recordings for their debut album, the band (sans Diamond, who sadly passed away in 2005) moved to London and went on touring Europe and eventually recording Helven Park (for producer <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Newman_a7e9.html" title="Colin Newman">Colin Newman</a>'s Swim records) in 1995.</p>

<p><b>AFA OS</b> Is a set of add on libraries to improve the non-developed Amiga OS 3.9, It gives features such as antialised text, and improves the speed of core libraries inside Amiga OS.</p>
<p>"The goal of AfA OS is to bring modern features like Antialiasing (AA) to the AmigaOS since there is no further development for the 68k AmigaOS since OS3.9. AfA OS replaces AmigaOS core libraries with their more advanced AROS (Amiga Research Operating System) counterparts."</p>
<p>Much of the development of AFA OS is based on AROS, The libraries are backported from AROS to 68k, This allows users of classic 68k amigas the chance to use modern features such as the ones stated above. AFA OS can also be used in conjunction with other Amiga OS improvements such as AIAB(Amiga In A Box).<a href="http://www.amiga.org/modules/myalbum/photos/2373.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amiga.org/modules/myalbum/photos/2373.jpg" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>

<p>Life through the lens</p>
<p>What can I say, I've been shooting film ever since...</p>
<p>Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work with many of the best cinematographers around. The great thing is that I was exposed to many approaches and styles. I learned what I liked and I learned how to problem solve for a variety of lighting situations.</p>
<p>My favorite lighting style is to shoot with natural-looking, motivated light sources. I enjoy working with large soft sources and then "paint" in the shadow areas. I work very hard to make certain that whatever story is being told is enhanced and communicated with the light and images.</p>
<p>To me, the best cinematography is the kind that takes you into another world&#160;? cinematography that brings you the experience of the story and makes you quickly forget that you are watching a movie. Seamless and realistic.</p>
<p>The great masters of light who inspired me include Dante Spinnoti, ASC Heat, The Insider, Vilmos Zsigmond, ASC Sugarland Express, The Deer Hunter, Don Burgess, ASC Cast Away, and Contact, and John Toll for his brilliant work on Legends of the Fall. Finally the greatest master of light in my opinion is Rembrandt. His art has truly been inspirational to me. My favorite piece is The Polish Rider, a magnificent work of art.</p>
<p>Directors I admire include Akira Kurasawa Ran; Tony Scott Enemy of the State; Ridley Scott Gladiator; Gus Van Sant Good Will Hunting; and Michal Mann Insider and Heat.</p>
<p>I've been blessed by being able to make a living doing what I love to do."</p>
<p>A CONVERSATION WITH RAJIV JAIN (WICA)</p>
<p>QUESTION: Where were you born and raised? RAJIV JAIN: I was born on the 29th of November, 1964 at a Civil Hospital, in Lucknow, India in a working class (Indian term: Lower Middle Class Family), hard core Hindi speaking family. I spent my formative years in Etawah which is nestled in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. That is where I grew up. It was a one-horse town with a one-horse bank. I had a great child-hood though. We came from a fairly closed in urban area, and suddenly I was in this environment where we could ride bicycles out into the bush. We also had the river. It was beautiful. I loved the outback and the wide-open spaces. My father was working in a bank and we moved / on transfer every two to three years. My mother is whole world centered around her kids and the home, so as you see, I led a very sheltered childhood with little or no contact with the outside world so to speak off. My father had a still Instamatic camera that fascinated me but I was forbidden to lay my hands on it, its funny but somewhere my curiosity in photography actually developed I was forbidden to touch that camera. My dad envisioned me as a Doctor, Engineer or an IAS officer.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Your Qualification... RAJIV JAIN: I went to the University of Lucknow in Lucknow, State of Uttar Pradesh and also I had the good luck of going to the Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts (Bhartendu Natya Academy/ Bhartendu Natya Akademi), Lucknow. I majored in Stage Craft and minored in Stage Lighting, intending to become a Light Designer. QUESTION: Did you plan to follow in your father's footsteps? RAJIV JAIN: I don't think I ever saw myself in the banking profession. I actually caught the filmmaking bug when I was around 10 or 11yrs old. A Satyajit Ray movie called Shatranj Ke Khilari was being filmed in my neighborhood in Lucknow. I watched the trucks going up the street, and then snuck around to the house where they were shooting. I watched them setting up the lights and cameras. I was in complete awe.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>QUESTION: Were there any other influencers in your family? RAJIV JAIN: My mother is a religious person. I had often watched her pray, I do not think I need to elaborate for who all those prayers went up for. Our careers and our future was my mother is utmost concern. I still remember that moment as if it were yesterday, i was chatting with mom as she cleared the dinner dishes and she happened to ask me what i wanted do with my life after getting my diploma from drama school, at that precise moment i had a piece of 35mm still film in my hand "I would like to do something with this" I said looking at the film. Its been a long journey since then but my mom stood by me in those formative years and guided me every step of the way. I was very keen to join the Film &amp; television Institute of India, but i failed to qualify for the entrance exam, however moving from still photography to theatre and then cinematography seemed like a very natural progression.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Were you interested in movies in those days? RAJIV JAIN: Ya sure! like any other kid my age the world of movies fascinated me, it was not the case of being star struck every aspect of the movie interested me, so it came as a very spontaneous reply when one of my all time favorite professors (Guptaji) asked me what I wanted to become in life? " I want to make a career for myself in the film world, i want to create magic behind that screen". So yes, my love for cinema goes back a long way. I grew up watching Hollywood &amp; Indian movies. I was not drawn to foreign films. American films were the ones I enjoyed seeing. Not any more than most kids, but I managed to see the big hits of the time. My dad took me to see Lawrence of Arabia, Dr. Strangelove, The Longest Day during the 1970s. He loved the big historical dramas. I became a movie buff during the early 1980s, while I was going to Drama School in Lucknow. Some of my bohemian friends and I happened to find a folk &amp; classical music &amp; dance theatre, professional drama company, amateur still photography club and underground cinema called Lucknow Film Society. They showed classic and new wave films. They were usually 16 mm images projected on a wall. That is where I discovered the world of cinema. I remember seeing Metropolis and Citizen Kane, and films by Bergman, Fellini, Truffant, Welles, Cocteau and Stan Brahkage. That was during my late high school and early college years. I began reading about movies and directors and started clicking photographs. I did see one movie that changed my life at that time- it was a Goddard film called Contempt that Raoul Coutard shot. It was a Cinemascope film, which was very similar to what I was doing in still photography, although obviously twenty years prior to that. It used a lot of primary colors. It was a movie that put a lot of emphasis on composition and it had wide shots and long tracking shots with two little people walking against a big red wall. That was the first time that I made the connection in my mind that maybe films was where my career was headed. I was starting to feel limited by still photography. It was the first time I recognized the potential of cinema where by a narrative story can be told in a visual way.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Were there particular movies that made an impression on you? RAJIV JAIN: Citizen Kane, Vertigo, La Regle du jeu, The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, Tokyo Story, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Sunrise, Battleship Potemkin, 8-1/2, Singing in the Rain, Lawrence of Arabia, Dr. Strangelove, Bicycle Thieves, Raging Bull, Vertigo, Rashomon, Seven Samurai.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Tell us about your background? RAJIV JAIN: My first encounter with the physics of light came by accident. One day, as I was cleaning paint brushes in a darkened garage, light falling through a crack projected an image onto the wall turning the room into a giant camera obscure. My first exposure to film was with a process camera attached to a darkroom the size of my apartment. It just so happened that one of the Surendra jija ji (universal sister in law) he was a very avid 35 mm photographer who always had his Nikon camera strung around his neck. He got me interested in photography and encouraged me to go to Kanpur, with him to take stills of a student demonstration in 1980 s. That was my first experience with a camera where I was able to express myself by taking photographs. I started studying photo manuals-trying to learn about composition. I looked at how artistic photographers used the foreground and colors and light and shadows. That fuelled my desire to learn more and more. I had a full time job in a darkroom and was going to a photography studio at night and taking pictures on weekends. That just was not satisfying my thirst for learning more about photography. After finishing my education in Lucknow in 1985 I relocated to Mumbai / Bombay and started as an runner / apprentice / trainee in low budget serials, features and industrials.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Were you thinking at that point in your life that you wanted to get into narrative film making? RAJIV JAIN: I must admit, I never thought there was much of a chance for me to work in Mumbai / Bombay. It was very very hard for north Indians to get a break in Bombay.. The only other place they were making movies back then was in Calcutta and Madras. I decided to learn English, with the concept that I might go over there and give it a try. Of course, with all the work I was doing, I never got into any real sequence of lessons; and I am partially dyslexic, so it was difficult learning a new language.</p>
<p>QUESTION: How did you get started in the business? What did you do? RAJIV JAIN: I started as a gofer, apprentice, trainee, spark, grip, key grip, loader, best boy, focus puller and worked my way up to gaffer (Indian term: chief assistant to DOP).</p>
<p>QUESTION: How long did you work as an assistant? RAJIV JAIN: Oh, around 8 years.</p>
<p>QUESTION: What did you do when you completed you assistant job? RAJIV JAIN: I worked in Mumbai / Bombay on documentaries, industrial films and commercials as a camera assistant and gaffer. They were all small projects. I worked with a couple of cameramen who were shooting locally. It was mostly 16mm and a little 35mm, mainly to make some money. While I was doing that I was still shooting mainly short films and some documentaries. I was always working on my craft and building my reel, with the idea that one day I would shoot features. When I got out of assistance ship, I gaffed a bit, assisted a little bit and was shooting industrial films, documentaries, commercials and other small jobs. I shot sales films for medical companies promoting new products and techniques, small dramatic religious films for a company T-Series, which distributed them to temples, and some variety shows. I got a lot of jobs through people I knew in during my assisting days. It's very important to make friends because they're the ones who are going to want to bring people they know along when they get a job. We had our own revolving group of guys who all did different jobs depending on who was shooting and who was gaffing.</p>
<p>QUESTION: When did you decide to concentrate on cinematography? RAJIV JAIN: Immediately. I thought the directing process was too long, and I liked being a cinematographer. During my second year of drama school In 1985, I worked for three to four months for a Lucknow television station. It was my job to select what was good enough to make up the programme. It was a great internship. I also learned the craft as a second and first assistant cameraman in Mumbai / Bombay under Ashok Mehta ( WICA), Binod Pradhan (WICA) &amp; K.K.Mahajan (WICA).</p>
<p>QUESTION: What was the deciding factor in making that decision? RAJIV JAIN: I didn't want to look back some day and regret that I never tried. I didn't want to be 80 years old wondering if I could have succeeded. If I failed, I could have gone back to Lucknow knowing I gave it my best shot. So, I came to Mumbai / Bombay in the midst of a fuel crisis - just traveling in auto rickshaw was a big challenge. I went around interviewing at various DOP s because they were much more accessible than big feature film operations. There was no way I could get in the door at any of those places. After about three months, money was running low. I was walking by a kind of a warehouse in Mumbai / Bombay on a Saturday, and I could see though an open door they were building sets. I remember thinking; they would not be working on a weekend unless they were behind. So, I walked in, found the foreman and told him I was a carpenter. He asked if I had any set-building experience? I lied and said yes. It was only a half lie because I had built many sets for plays in drama school. The only similarity is that they are both made out of wood. They were building sets for television commercials.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Did working as a gaffer help you in cinematography? First in India Gaffer means Chief assistant to DOP. We do not have the tradition of gaffer. I approached that job thinking like a cinematographer. I would bring a new technique or a new type of light to the attention of the cinematographer I was working with, suggesting it as something that would help to tell the story in a better way. I think I learned more by watching other cinematographers work than anything else. One of the only ways to really learn cinematography is from another cinematographer. That is how I think the knowledge gets passed on. You end up picking up little pearls of wisdom along the way. The most important things I learned by watching other cinematographers at work were not technical, but how to make the set comfortable for the director and actors, and how to make it a creative environment instead of a technical environment.</p>
<p>QUESTION: How did you get into T-Series music videos? RAJIV JAIN: I tried to work as a freelancer for a while but it was tough to get into the union. There was a company called Super Cassettes Studios that was run by the late Gulshan Kumar in Bombay. They had an editing place first and then they opened up an online editing facility. They were hiring a lot of people at that point and I had some experience as a cameraman and crew person, so they brought me in to be an all around studio maintenance guy. I also learned to run the tape machines. When I got in there, It was quite a small place at the time, so I learned all kinds of things. I had already done two videos at that point. I was working in the studio on commercial stuff and they would bring in union lighting cameramen, and I would sometimes work as an operator for them. I was kind of a lighting technician for them, so I learned more in that studio in the space of one-and-a-half year than anywhere else. It was a very intense education because they brought in high-quality video being recorded to one inch. We used the Sony camera and it was quite a good camera. I still think it is better than the cameras that are out there now, but we were always trying to get a film look out of it. We would play with the filtration and black levels and all kinds of lighting to see how we could get it to look like a film.</p>
<p>QUESTION: That sounds like it was a great experience for you? RAJIV JAIN: Yeah, I got to shoot a lot and be fairly creative with the camera on that video. I also got to be in the postproduction process. It was a really exciting editing process, and then we did some kind of in-studio effects as well, which I got to shoot. That was a real good break for me and then the director put me forward for a lot more projects after that. I started doing documentaries. I went on the road with them and on tour three times. I did a documentary in Delhi about the recording of music videos, which we shot on video; all the documentaries we shot on video, but it really gave me an opportunity to play around with the image and lenses and moving the camera. It was great!</p>
<p>QUESTION: What was your first feature? RAJIV JAIN: My first feature as an independent DOP was Army (1994) starring Sharukh Khan, Sridevi &amp; Ram Shetty directed it. It was color in anamorphic. I changed the contrast with lighting to eliminate all the gray tones. That was my signature, pure blacks and whites with no grays. Late Mukul S Anand visited the set when I was shooting, and later I worked with him for his production house MAD Films on his commercials (1994).</p>
<p>QUESTION: What do you look for when you are reading a script? Is it the story, the director, a combination or something else? RAJIV JAIN: Usually it is the story, but there are some people who are so talented and good to work with that I am always inclined to say yes; I shall go anywhere. I think primarily it is the story that has to grab me. I don not necessarily think about it visually at that point...ideally it would be a film I would love to go see. I am also looking for something different than I have done before. I crave variety. It is a combination of things. At first, I thought the script was the most important thing, but I discovered scripts are constantly changing. It is not so much about the shots you make. Cinematography is about the environments you create. A film is a reflection of a series of two-dimensional images projected on a white screen. It is static flashes of light projected through a lens that somehow stimulates the brains of people in the audience and create a three-dimensional moving world. When you agree to shoot a film, you are making a moral commitment - it is an obligation you owe to the director and to the audience. There has to be a visual continuity that makes the audience feel like they have witnessed a slice of life. I tend to be more interested in the concept of a film. I ask the director to tell me what they want to do with the film. There was one film called Army. The movie is two and a half hours long, and it is the only movie I have worked on where only two pages changed during shooting. It is the best script in a Indian movie that I have ever worked on. There are not many experienced cinema directors in India because many of them are from TV. I have tried to train myself to understand what is necessary to make a film for the cinema.</p>
<p>QUESTION: What were some of the other low budget movies you worked on? RAJIV JAIN: I do not claim the ones before Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi. The first thing I did out of my being an independent was a small movie named Rasta that was shot over 15 days in Jaisalmer and never got released. It was my first full-fledged narrative experience. I did other films after that. Those films played a big part in putting things together in subsequent movies because you learn from your mistakes. You learn that there is no time like the present on a film. There is no going back. You need to plan and also persevere through the hard times on a film. On lower budget and independent films, those hard times come all the time. There is no easy shoot, because the powers of commerce are bearing down on your shoulders. The main thing I learned doing these movies is that you have to answer to yourself eventually. You have to pace yourself and stay true to the purpose. When we made Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi (in 1998) I had a clear idea of the purpose and that told us how to shape the look, but I did not know it worked until it was screened. I was terrified looking at the dailies and not knowing if I was on the right path. When I saw the first rough cut, it was probably my most terrifying and most exciting experience.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Your recent work includes two features. The last one was Badhaai Ho Badhaai. Describe your experience shooting a comedy feature. RAJIV JAIN: Comedy can be tragedy. I believe the hardest part about it is that if we shoot everything flat, it is just going to look like a flat comedy. Comedy is bright but you still want to see texture in the sets. In comedy, I think a lot of times it plays static because it is about the comedy, it is not about the joke. If the joke is happening in the frame, people should be listening. If you move the camera to tell the joke, it is distracting. Now, if you move the camera for a reaction in the picture itself, that is a different thing. I think comedy is harder to light than drama. There are different levels of comedy and I photographically see each level differently.</p>
<p>QUESTION: How did you get started shooting commercials? RAJIV JAIN: While I was still assisting in camera, the production company called and said the agency wanted me to shoot their next commercial. I had never shot 35 mm film, so I was shocked. I still remember the slate with my name on it. That was a magic moment. The commercial came out good, and that lead to other commercials, mainly in India. Shooting commercials, I learned how to collaborate with many different people, jumping from one project to another with many different looks and locations. I think I have applied a lot of what I learned from shooting commercials on to shooting features. It is not a conscious thing. I was just in so many different situations solving the same types of problems.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Who were some of the cinematographers you worked with on commercials? RAJIV JAIN: I worked with Binod Pradhan (WICA), Vikas Sivaraman (WICA) and then Ashok Mehta (WICA).</p>
<p>QUESTION: Did you move back and forth between commercials and feature? RAJIV JAIN: I did almost one feature film in three years. The rest of my time was on commercials. Commercial work is very interesting because you can try a lot of tools first. In India now, commercials deal a lot with aesthetic so it is just like still photography, and you learn to create different worlds and they are eager to get those kind of non-realistic worlds. I learned to take risks, because if you want to achieve something special you have to try, and sometimes you succeed and sometimes you do not but then that is all part and parcel of the learning process.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Have commercials affected the way you shoot movies? RAJIV JAIN: They give you a firmer grasp of the possibilities for what you can achieve with photography. You get a lot of experience creating different looks in different ways that may apply to a movie. The more you shoot, the more you learn. Occasionally, you will discover something new that you can build on.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you have a particular style that makes your work recognizable? RAJIV JAIN: I think everyone has got his or her style, but I would hate for someone to go in a movie theater and say 'Oh, RAJIV JAIN shot that because that is his style.' I would like them to say, 'Oh, who shot that?' I think you have got to be more versatile in your looks these days. Every film is different, so you like to think that you can put something different into each movie as opposed to creating a repetitive look.</p>
<p>QUESTION: How many features, commercials, music videos have you shot? RAJIV JAIN: 5 features, almost 600 commercials , 150 music videos &amp; lots of documentaries, corporate &amp; industrial films.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Have all your projects been restricted to India or have you done shoots abroad as well? RAJIV JAIN: I shot in Austria, France, India, Mauritius, Nepal, Holland, Russia, Singapore, Sri lanka, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates &amp; United Kingdom.</p>
<p>QUESTION: How did you finally get into the Western India cinematographer s Association? RAJIV JAIN: The association opened up during the mid-1970s. If you could document 30 days of work with one company or 90 days with a series of companies, you could apply to get into the Association. I had experience both in commercials and movies as an assistant, and also as a cinematographer on five feature films. I had much better documentation as an assistant for getting in the union. I was a loader for K.K.Mahajan on five features &amp; two TV serials, and I was an assistant for Binod Pradhan on two features &amp; approx. 300 commercials and Ashok Mehta on two features &amp; approx. 100 commercials. I pulled focus for one year until I moved up to chief assistant &amp; camera b operator.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Is cinematography a talent that you are born with, a skill you learn, or both? RAJIV JAIN: I think you have to be born with the ability to visualize. As a child, I spent a lot of time looking out of the window in school when I should have been looking at the books. I got scolded for it many times. I grew up and yet I still do it. I still fantasize, more than I think an average person would dare to do. Out of that kind of daydreaming, you end up making images that take on a kind of reality of their own. Movies have influenced how we make love, what we wear, how we eat, how we walk, how we talk, and how we act in everyday life. You have to be able to walk across the bridge into this imaginary world and be able to walk back. One of the tricks is that you have to know how to handle light. You must have a feeling for different kinds of light. Where do you get that knowledge? You have to know film like the back of your hand. That is a skill among others that you have to learn. Even as a kid, I responded to light emotionally. It is always been a part of me. Filmmaking grabbed me at a young age and gave me a voice I did not have in any other part of my life. I am lucky to have found an outlet for that. I ca not imagine doing anything else.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Finally do you ever get used to the fact that you are living your dream? RAJIV JAIN: The night before I shot my first commercial for Late Mukul S Anand, I only got two hours of sleep and I had a panic dream that our interior hallway set had been built less than half scale-it was kind of like. We could not walk on it much less film on it. There was no room for our lights or the actors. In my dream, I kept asking, 'How are we going to shoot in this space' After 600 commercials &amp; 5 Feature Films later, I still do not sleep much the night before the first day of shooting. The truth is that I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to earn my living by using shapes, colors, contrast and movement to bring a story to life. I love the collaboration with the director, production designer and actors and the passive collaboration with the composer, editor and writer. When I hear a carefully crafted musical score and images that I have photographed come together on the screen it brings tears to my eyes. It is really incredible how the music can enhance my work. I have talked to composers about this and they tell me it is the same for them when they hear their music and see how the photography works with it. We have almost no contact during the making of the film, but are key collaborators in the emotions that bring it to life on the screen.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you feel a sense of responsibility since a lot of people will be influenced by the movies you make? RAJIV JAIN: I feel a responsibility towards the public and for a business that I have loved all my life. I take a lot of pride in the fact that I can work in Bollywood in the tradition of the great filmmakers who were here before us. Movies have brought something into our lives, and we have a responsibility to give something back.</p>

<p>Imago Records, an American label, formed in 1990 by Terry Ellis, was a joint venture with BMG. In its four years of operation it signed six artists who sold over 100,000 units of their debut albums in the US alone: Baby Animals, Captain Hollywood, The Rollins Band, Aimee Mann, Paula Cole, and Love Split Love. Of those, Baby Animals’ first record sold 500,000 worldwide (4 times platinum in Australia) and the Rollins Band sold 250,000 units in the US on their first and 500,000 on their second albums. The label was to issue Kylie Minogue's eponymously titled 1994 album in the USA but, as the joint venture with BMG (Minogue's international label) was dissolved in 1994 the album never appeared. Terry Ellis retained ownership of the Imago catalogue and artist contracts.</p>

<p>Once known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bag_On_Line_Adventures" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bag_On_Line_Adventures" rel="nofollow">The.Bag.Online.Adventures.</a>, <b>The Amory Wars</b> is the re-titled, 5 part saga of the characters Coheed and Cambria and their universe, as originated in the music of the band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coheed_and_cambria" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coheed_and_cambria" rel="nofollow">Coheed and Cambria</a>, and more specifically, by their frontman Claudio Sanchez. Having previously discontinued a comic series by artist Wes Abbott after only 2 issues, and having not been satisfied with a graphic novel by artist Christopher Shy, Claudio has now teamed with artist Gus Vazquez to hopefully tell the story of Coheed and Cambria once and for all.</p>
<p>The new title of the series was announced about one week prior to the 2006 Comic-Con in California. Claudio and all three artists that have been involved with the project attended the convention to man the Evil Ink booth (the comic company created to release Claudio's story), selling the remaining copies of the discontinued comics and graphic novel, as well as an all-new Amory Wars Sketchbook created to announce and give insight into the new direction of the series. The sketchbook included a preview of Gus Vazquez's illustration work for the main characters, a rough script for the contents of the first actual entry in the comic series (due out February 2007), updated character profiles, and a biography of creator Claudio Sanchez. Though a limited run of the sketchbook was available at the convention ($10 per book), it may or may not see a reprint in the future.</p>
<p>(Details on the story to be posted by someone who bought the book)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-26_95aa.html" title="Edit section: Charles Gibbs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Charles Gibbs</span></h2>
<p>Charles Gibbs was an American pirate who began his career as a privateer in the US Navy during the War of 1812. In subsequent years he became a privateer for America, eventually becoming captain of his own ship.</p>
<p>Gibbs is, oddly, remembered for both his cruelty as well as an odd streak of kindness. Although he confessed to slaughtering whole crews when sacking ships- a number that reportedly totaled over fourhundred men- he occasionally took prisoners. One such prisoner was a teenaged Dutch girl who had been aboard one of the vessles Gibbs and his crew had raided. Rather than kill her, Gibbs brought her aboard his own ship (probably hoping to ransom her) and defended her from his crew. Unable to lay a hand on her, the crew eventually resorted to poisoning the girl.</p>
<p>Gibbs was eventually captured and hanged at Ellis Island, NY in 1831. His final words were: "No mercy did we ever show, for dead men tell no tales." So it is Gibbs we have to thank for that famous saying.</p>

<p>David &amp; the Giants were truly pioneers in the early days of Contemporary Christian music. David Huff &amp; his twin brothers, Rayborn &amp; Clayborn, were born into the Kingdom of God in 1977 &amp; spent the next 20+ years ministering in churches across the U.S. &amp; around the world. During this time, D&amp;G also had many other members such as Keith Thibodeaux on drums from 1979-1989, as well as Lance Huff, Kellye Huff, Gerald Hagan, &amp; Dennon Dearman. While David W. Huff continues his career as a solo artist, the Huff brothers do continue to perform on occasion as, David &amp; the Giants. In the 60's &amp; 70's, David &amp; the Giants were a very successful Rock 'n' Roll band, &amp; played with many famous groups &amp; artists such as; Styx, Black Oak Arkansas, Cheech &amp; Chong, The Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Chuck Berry &amp; Stevie Wonder to name a few. They had many regional hits including, "Ten Miles High" &amp; "Superlove. Their drummer, Keith Thibodeaux, was the former Little Ricky on the "I Love Lucy" show. Keith would eventually leave D&amp;G because of his decision to serve the Lord, but would later re-join the new "Christian" David &amp; the Giants in 1979. Here's a list of some of the songs released by D&amp;G on 45s back in the secular days:</p>
<p>Rockin' Robin / I'll Always Love You (1963-64?? David doesn't remember!) On Bended Knees / Someday You're Gonna Be Sorry (1967) Ten Miles High / I'm Down So Low (1968) Superlove / Rolling In My Sleep (1968) A Letter To Josephine / Supergood Feeling (1970) Love 'em &amp; Leave 'em / Don't Say No (1970)</p>
<p>Solo releases by David W. Huff:</p>
<p>Mary Browne / When It Rains (1972) Glory Hallelujah / The Apple Song (1973) Sweet Marjorene / Don't Kill Me (1977)</p>
<p>Released on BANG Records by Muscle Shoals Horns:</p>
<p>Born To Get Down / Hustle To The Music (1976)</p>
<p>These songs seem to be "mystery" songs that were released on 45s according to David Huff, but no one seems to have ever seen them:</p>
<p>GROOVY KIND OF LOVE FOOL NUMBER ONE I NEED LOVE I'LL MAKE IT 'TIL TOMORROW IT'S GOTTA BE LOVE LIGHTS OUT THEN OUR LOVE WILL START OVER WITHOUT YOUR LOVE</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of confusion as to the D&amp;G discography. The albums released are as follows:</p>
<p>1977 - SONG OF SONGS 1978 - THIS ONE'S FOR YOU 1979 - STEP IN MY SHOES 1980 - ALMOST MIDNIGHT 1981 - HEAVEN OR HELL 1982 - DAVID &amp; THE GIANTS 1983 - RIDERS IN THE SKY 1984 - INHABITANTS OF THE ROCK 1985 - UNDER CONTROL 1987 - MAGNIFICAT 1988 - STRANGERS TO THE NIGHT 1989 - R U GONNA STAND UP 1990 - DISTANT JOURNEY 1992 - LONG TIME COMING 1993 - GIANT HITS 1995 - ANGELS UNAWARE 1996 - DREAM 2000 - REALLY 2003 - PROCLAIM 2004 - PROCLAIM (Reissused on CHRISTIAN Records)</p>
<p>Many people are not aware that "Song of Songs" was David &amp; the Giants' first Christian album, recorded in 1977, the same year that they were born into the kingdom of God. The first 4 albums featured a 4th member of D&amp;G, Gerald Hagan, who played piano &amp; later went on to produce many Christian albums. Gerald has since passed away, but his beautiful piano playing can still be heard on these classic recordings. This album contains the original version of the song, "Save Me", as later recorded on David Huff's "Really" album in 2000. David once said that the music to "Save Me" on this album was the original music that was to be used for the secular release of this song. Another former secular song by D&amp;G, "Glory Hallelujah", is also included on this album.</p>
<p>In 1978, David &amp; the Giants released their second album, "This One's For You". This album contains the original studio version of the song, "Noah", as well as many other classic D&amp;G tunes such as "He's Coming Back". In the early Christian days, D&amp;G were without a drummer. Keith Thibodeaux, the former Little Ricky from the "I Love Lucy" show did not rejoin the band until 1979. Thus, the first 3 Christian albums by D&amp;G feature Owen Hale, a left-handed drummer, on drums. This album, unlike all of those that would follow, is the only one that was recorded at "Studio In The Country" in the state of LA. All future albums were done at Huff studios in Laurel, and later Forest, MS.</p>
<p>"Step In My Shoes", the 3rd Christian release by David &amp; the Giants, has a depth &amp; an anointing unlike any other D&amp;G release. David once said that this was always one of his personal favorites, partly because it was the first to be recorded totally at Huff studios in Laurel. This album features Gerald Hagan on lead vocals on one song, "The End Of Time". This is the only D&amp;G song that does not feature David on lead vocals.</p>
<p>1979 marked the year of Keith Thibodeaux's return to David &amp; the Giants. The following year, in 1980, D&amp;G released their 4th album, "ALMOST MIDNIGHT", which contains many D&amp;G favorites such as, "The Well", "Ten Miles High", (a former secular tune) and "Holy Rain" which was recorded live, and also appears on David's latest solo project entitled, "Proclaim". "ALMOST MIDNIGHT" is the only D&amp;G album that contains live recordings. Another live recording from the album, "Upper Room Experience", is also fan favorite.</p>
<p>"The Lord called us to be evangelists through our ministry of music, and that is what we still are today. We love to see people give their hearts to the Lord and to be born again of water and the Spirit. This is the greatest thrill in our lives because this is what makes the Lord happy." -- David Huff, from the book entitled, "Four Giant Steps" 1988</p>

<p><br />
Ballot Bouncing: Adding up the 2004 election.An in depth look into the controversy surrounding the 2004 elections questioning the validity of false registration, miscounts, and a bi-partisan war waged over voters ballots.</p>
<p>Chemtrails: a hidden path to disaster. A special expose analyzing various sources of data regarding the validity of the governments use of Chemical Atmospheric Manipulation (CAM). We go undercover to some of the most secretive labs and government facilities to bring out what could possibly be one of the most horrifying stories of the decade.</p>
<p>UPDATE from the field!!!</p>
<p>Probing deeper into the Chemtrails story our CTL associates are currently collecting first hand testimonies from individuals who bellieve they have been affected by the CAM procedure. Anyone that would like to be part of this expose please contact our line producer Mike Cosgrove to schedule an interview. Interviews will be scheduled begining July 28th ending September 1st.</p>
<p>Forsaken: a Monsignor's silent fight to save his faith.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>An affluent, pioneering Midwestern Catholic parish, affected by the clergy abuse crisis, is the setting for this incredible story. Despite endless media attacks over a two year period, wrongful accusations by people including a city's mayor, an FBI agent, a State's Attorney, and other highly influential and powerful individual's attempts to silence him, a loyal Monsignor continues to shepherd his parish through these trying times. We uncover the real facts concerning a calculated conspiracy to ruin the pastor's leadership and priesthood, those who have misplaced the blame and the reasons why they wanted to point the finger at someone else.</p>
<p>UPDATE from the field!!!</p>
<p>June 6th 2006: Having gone to the Kane County Courthouse we have a new development in the story as we continue to uncover the truth. Rockford Diocese lawyer Rozovichs has spoken to the judge in chambers regarding the Allison Ward settlement case. ALSO we had a wonderful opportunity to speak with both Mrs. Kate Bochte and Mrs. Mary Lou O'Halloran, who were able to shed real light into what is really going on in this suspicious case. What was seemingly a one sided slant against a Parish is now becoming a large scale scandal that reaches as far up as the Bishop himself. More facts to develop later as we are able to interview more individuals connected with the case, and get to the real truth of the situation.</p>
<p>UPDATE from the field!!!</p>
<p>We mentioned in our June 6th update that CTL interviewed Mrs. Kate Bochte and Mrs. Mary Lou O'Halloran. That posting was nothing short of a lighting strike. The Bochte and O'Halloran mention generated a tremendous influx of phone calls, letters, faxes and emails providing our staff with hard documents, tips, personal observations, opinions, past newspaper articles, letters and unique bio information. Watch for short selected video highlights of the Bochte and O'Halloran interview.</p>
<p>CTL's cameras where in St. Louis, Missouri this week. CTL interviewed Canice Timothy Rice, Monsignor Jarmoluk's personal attorney. Two full days of intense and terse questions and answers provide riveting insight. Mr. Rice supplemented his interview with voluminous records, demand letters and general correspondence which shed further light on this developing documentary. CTL will post a selected sample of Mr. Rice's demand letters and critical documents with video excerpts in the following days.</p>
<p>WEEK OF JUNE 19th THE FIRST OF SEVEN SERIES MARK CAMPOBELLO</p>
<p>CTL will be on site, in Mark Campobello's hometown, profiling the man who became a catholic priest in the Rockford Diocese. We will examine through the eyes of his classmates, relatives and associates his early childhood, his school years and religious training.</p>
<p>Executive Producer's Note</p>
<p>CTL has received many, many inquiries over the past week, attributable to Mary Lou O'Halloran. Mrs. O'Halloran has contacted individuals, newspaper reporters, religious officials, attorneys and staff of CTL to voice demands, complaints and insist that CTL produce this documentary according to her view. Many of these individuals have called CTL to ask questions on behalf of Mrs. O'Halloran. CTL recognizes the past historical and current modus operandi of Mrs. O'Halloran. CTL has previously interviewed those who know Mrs. O'Halloran. Additional interviews are being added to our production schedule. Focused lenses and interviews will determine Mrs. O'Halloran's influence or lack thereof, on the administration of the Rockford Diocese, priests and religious, members of St. Peter, St. Patrick, Holy Cross and John Newman Parishes, newspapers, government officials, people of Geneva, St. Charles and surrounding Illinois communities. CTL will highlight an inside look at each individual member, and the collective effects or failures of "The Group of 14". CTL will show you the past and current hype and myth, then the real.</p>
<p>Due to overwhelming response and requests to participate in this documentary, CTL will implement a 24/7 Message Board (click here for usage rules and guidelines) and radio call-in talk show specific to FORSAKEN. Check this site for time and dates. Become a part of this documentary. Please mail, fax or email information and comments. Allow 5-7 working days for response and scheduling.</p>
<p>Special thanks to our readers who informed our staff that Mrs. O'Halloran was passing out informational sheets on behalf of SNAP at the Chicago Cathedral, June 11, 2006. We investigated. It did not take long to find members of the Chicago Cathedral who agreed to be interviewed.</p>
<p>Jordan Water Crisis: Al Arza's glass is half empty. Our foreign correspondents working independently of their BBC roots takes a harrowing look inside of a town that is being starved of water because of their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>UPDATE from the field!!!</p>
<p>Our BBC team has hit a bit of hard ground out on location, facing tremendous resistance from local governments. They will keep pressing forward despite a huge snag in shooting schedule. We wish them all the best and are letting them know that we are behind them 110%.</p>
<p>UPDATE from the field!!!</p>
<p>Congratz on all the hard and dangerous work out corrospondents have done this last year in producing the Jordan Water Crisis segment for our global media team. Currently they are reviewing their primary footage hopefull that they have obtained more then enough to forge an amazing story. Post production to start shortly, ready for Cannes next year.</p>
<p>Grounded: a Union's failure to protect. 5 years after the September 11 attacks the airline industry is still struggling to keep it's financial head above water. At it's core it is the companies workforce that is doing all the paddling, but it's muscle, their local mechanist and worker union, is slowly loosing strength.</p>
<p>Update from the field!!!</p>
<p>June 7th 2006: after the June 1st Continental Airline ratification of a new contract that preserves pay rates, establishes job security and provides a defined benefit pension plan through the IAM National Pension Plan. Kevin Hufford IAM rep from loc 106 seeks movement that will make this groundbreaking agreement a standard for all IAM represented workers.</p>
<p>Update from the field!!!</p>
<p>June 22nd 2006: an exceptional job to the CTL LA crew who were able to field over 60 interviews with key players in the AIM and Alternative LAbor Unions these past months. With over 200 hours of footage our editors have their work cut out for them, but the coverage on this story will not be sacrificed. Great job everyone for wrapping a tremendous project, one which we hope will open communication between employers not only in the Airline industry but globally.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>CTL NYC is constantly producing the highest quality independent, documentary programming for the free market. Our contention is to report the news accurately, and maintain that all views and opinions expressed in any CTL NYC production never reflect those of the producers or associates of the company. Without filtration, it is our pledge to seek out the untold truths and educate both those that choose to listen, and those that refuse to learn.</p>

<p>[www.Habbox.com] is a fansite dedicated towards Habbo Hotel UK. The fansite is the biggest and most popular fansite on the hotel, and has affected the history of the habbo community in many ways.</p>
<a name="The_Beginning" id="The_Beginning"></a>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-26_95aa.html" title="Edit section: The Beginning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Beginning</span></h2>
<p>Habbox was first set up by the famous ex Hobba Mizki. It was taken over by sierk and is still now owned by sierk but often changes manager of the site.</p>
<p>Habbox became known for it being one of, if not the first, fansite to show Rare Values for the hotel. Many people began following the fansites values and the fansite soon was getting thousands of people visiting every month.</p>
<a name="Growth" id="Growth"></a>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-26_95aa.html" title="Edit section: Growth">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Growth</span></h2>
<p>Habbox under the management and guidance of sierk began to grow, creating more departments and coming up with new ideas. In the early stages habbox consited of news, rare values and articles but it soon grow to having alterations, ask the hobba, help and safety, radio, forum and habbox tv.</p>
<p>Habbox also had a very successful help desk that was taken over by DJ-3000, who later became Habbo X. This is where rivalry with [Impetuous.net] began, as both helpdesks were seen as the top helpdesks on the hotel. Impetuous later became official Habbo UK Staff and is rumoured to have become the hotels third hotel manager Callie. But this comes into it more later on in this article!</p>

<p>Habbox begun to lose popularity in late 2005 when habbo uk released its official fansite list. Two things lead to its decline, it was kicked off the official fansite list for breaking the rules and many new fansites begun starting up causing many fans to go to other fansites and get jobs there. This also led to some of the more dedicated staff setting up their own sites in the hope to get it on the fansite list.</p>
<p>Habbox 2006 is still getting thousands of visitors to the website and many people using the forum</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-26_95aa.html" title="Edit section: Expanding into different parts of habbo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expanding into different parts of habbo</span></h2>
<p><b>Habbox TV</b> [HabboxTV.com] began with an enthusiastic team that worked on getting many shows together especially the most popular habbo tv show 'The Street'. Unfortunately after many hackings the site began to continuously go under maintanance and many staff got fed up waiting and left. The Streets producers even set up their own website so its fans could continue to enjoy the series!</p>
<p><b>Habbox radio</b> Originally owned by jrh2002, who was a hobba it was at its biggest at this time. With jrh and mizki doing shows many people tuned in to listen to the Hobbas and find out the secret events they were hosting. After a fall out with sierk jrh left the radio taken the site with him (he owned habbox radio). Habbox then started up [habboxlive.com] that at first recieved near the same ratings but after mizki and a few other high profile dj's left the site lost its fanbase. The site like the TV begun under going maintanance every month causing many DJ's to lose interest with the site. It is now up and running at the momment but the DJ's may only get upto 30 listners whereas before it peaked to the 100-200 mark. Habbox Help Desk Habbox Help Desk was originally owned by mizki but taken over by DJ-3000. DJ turned it into one of the most successful departments on habbo and even won official awards for the fansite. The higher up staff featured in an event in safety week which pit the best helpdesk workers against each other with DJ-3000 coming second. The helpdesk declined when DJ left and is now hardly ever used.</p>
<p><b>Habbox Forum</b> This is still up and running and regularly get's over 100 members of the forum at the same time. [Habboxforum.com] has a dedicated fan base and is where many of the new staff members are choosen from.</p>
<a name="Controversy" id="Controversy"></a>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-26_95aa.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p><b>Rivalry with Impetuous.net</b> Most of this rivalry began as habbox's and impetuous's help desks became the most popular help desks on the game. Run by Dj-3000 and Cheezy2 the two helpdesk's often appeared at the top of the popular list. Staff from each fansite began arguing when advertisers would come into the rival helpdesk trying to steal its customers. There were many heated discussions, which lead to many habbos being banned. The rivalry stopped when impetuous became habbo staff and the fansite began to go downhill. Cheezy2 was also heavily critisized by sierk and other higher up staff members for sucking up to the Habbo Staff. This lead to an image being posted of the habbo cheezy2 raping a dog. Along with an article written by sierk about cheezy2 this lead to many seeing habbox as a bully trying to gain more power. Habbox saw it as Cheezy2 trying to turn staff members against habbox. The rivalry between habbox and impetuous does not exsist anymore seeing as impetuous has closed the website and helpdesk.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Hackings</b> In 2005 habbox begun being targeted by hackers from the hotel. The hackers would redirect the site to porn sites or post rude picture on the website. This continued for a long time and lead to the downfall of habbox tv and in some ways habbox radio. Sites like krews.net posted habbox dtaff emails and in osme cases phone numbers and home adress which was illegal and often led to the site being closed down. The hackers would often disguise themselves as a fan of habbox and work their way into the team whilst gaining access to the website. they would then post vulgar images or redirect the site.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Staff Leaving</b> Habbox has had many high profile staff leave after being upset by how the site was run. Founder Mizki left after an argument with sierk, which lead to a few staff leaving in protest. One of these staff was Jrh2002, another hobba who also owned the radio. This caused a lot of habbox fans to leave and join other fansites.</p>
<p>DJ-3000 also left after he felt sierk was becoming to focused on making money out of habbox through VIP and adverts. This lead to many of the helpdesk team leaving in protest and ended up with many ex staff spamming the forum. This was seen as a low point in habbox's history as many people saw habbox as going downhill from this point on.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Becomming an unofficial fansite</b> Habbox became unofficial mainly after one of its more respected staff Max wrote a dodgey report and displayed dodgey pictures on the site. The dodgey picture was of Cheezy2 and a dog, and the reports was of a new version which had not been released yet on habbo. It was against fansite rules and the Habbo Staff acted in the only way fair kicking the fansite off its list. This led to some habbox staff resenting Cheezy2, Impetuous, Becs and later on Callie.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Impetuous/Callie</b> After they became unofficial many fingers were pointed at Cheezy2 and his very close friendship with Callie and Impetuous. They believed he persuaded the staff to make habbox unofficial after the image posted on the site of his habbo and a dog. This led to many people speculating if Impetuous/Callie was the same person (Impetuous became habbo staff just before manager jibbi left, out of nowhere Callie appeared and became manager). Many people said habbox were paranoid and that they were looking to blame someone but later on this was proved true. After many things such as Callie and Impetuous supposedly had admitted they were the same person, they used the same computer thus the same habbo and they used the same name/email. It is said that habbo kept the identity of Callie secret as Impetuous is known to have had a rivalry with habbox.com and it would create favouritism.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Rare Values</b> Habbox has come under criticism for supposedly controlling the rare value system. The Rare Values infact are a guide for the hotel but many people follow the values strictly. It is seen as a positive thing on the hotel as it stops newer users from being cheated out of their furni. It is also seen as one of the main reasons why habbox still gets thousands of people visiting. Other fansites started putting up values and casino owners started their own sites but many of these prjects were stopped after hackings or lack of work towards the updating of the values. One of these websites was owned by one of the richer habbos vodor, but after his habbo and fansite were hacked he gave up habbo even when people were speculating that it would become the place to find super rare values.</p>

<p>When China was divided into Southern China and Northern China during the Song Dynasty, songzaju arose in the souther region. It is a form of Chinese drama that emphasizes a perfect synthesis of recitation of prose and poetry, dance, singing, and mime. The early songzaju resembles a slapstick comedy. The most importnat party of the zaju was a physical battle between characters on the play.</p>

His primary power is that he can find anything and everything. When he finds something he honks. Finder can even fly (as a helicopter does-he spins his ears atop his head as rotor blades) if necessary in order to find what he has been asked to locate. His one true place is operating a "Lost and Found" service on the beach. Was in the rescue party for "snafu"</td>

She sings a song that turns 'good' experiments (i.e. rehabilitated experiments) to 'bad' (i.e. evil). Stitch and Reuben are immune to this, as they were made after her. The spell can ahe be reversed by Angel singing the song in reverse or by playing a recording of it backwards. She also has a beautiful voice. At first, Stitch saw Angel <i>as</i> an angel, so he named her Angel. Angel pretended to like him, but was luring him into a big trap. Upon seeing her, Stitch immediately fell in love, leaving him unable to realize what might have otherwise been guessed -- Angel is working for Gantu! In the end, she falls for Stitch and changes her ways, but is nonetheless captured by Gantu but later rescued in "Snafu" and makes another appearance in "Leroy and Stitch" when Angel whiped out a couple of the leroy clones; saving Stitch. Angel was also seen in "Remmy" Dancing in a congo line with several other Experiments. Angel's last appearance was in Leroy and Stitch saying "aloha" for a picture in Lilo's photo album.</td>

<p>The Hong Kong Regiment also known as The Volunteers was formed in May 1854 when the Crimean War led to a reduction of the British military presence in Hong Kong. To help bolster the defenses at a time when marauding pirates were still a hazard on the China coast local volunteers were called for. A total of 99 Europeans were recruited-mostly British, but with some Portuguese, Scandinavians and Germans.</p>
<p>3 September 1995 - The Royal Hong Kong Regiment (The Volunteers) disbanded.</p>
<p>The Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong was signed in Beijing on December 19, 1984. On May 27, 1985, instruments of ratification were exchanged and the agreement entered into force. It was registered at the United Nations by the British and Chinese Governments on June 12, 1985.</p>
<p>In April 1992 the decision was finally taken by Security Branch of Hong Kong Government to formally announce that the Regiment would disband in September 1995.</p>
<p>1854 - disbanded The volunteers disbanded when Stability in Europe.</p>
<p>1862 - Hong Kong Volunteers In this year the Volunteers regrouped, In 1864, they were called out to help subdue a serious outbreak of rioting between British and Indian soldiers. 1866 - disbanded The second period in arms lasted only another four years; enthusiasm again diminished with the return to more settled times.</p>
<p>1878 - Hong Kong Artillery and Rifle Volunteer Corps In 1878, they were raised again as the Artillery Volunteers and since that time a volunteer force has been permanently in existence in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>1917 - Hong Kong Defence Corps The volunteers were actively engaged in guard and patrol duties during World War I when, owing to the recall of the British forces, they were the only military unit left in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>1920 - Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps In 1933, the volunteers acquired their first armoured car-Ford chassis, costing $1,500. It was equipped with an armour-plated body and mountings for two machine-guns. Later, four other chassis were bought by the government the bodywork being constructed by the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company. The original armoured car was scrapped before the outbreak of World War II, but the remaining four all played an important role in the Battle for Hong Kong in December 1941 .</p>
<p>1941 - Hong Kong captured by the Japanese The volunteers, renamed the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, met their severest test in the bitter fighting that took place in the crucial weeks before the fall of Hong Kong on Christmas Day. Out of the mobilised strength of 2 200 of all ranks, 289 were listed either as missing or killed, and many others became prisoners of war. Some, however, made their way into China where the British Army Aid Group was formed to assist the Chinese Government in the struggle against the Japanese. A further group made its way to Burma where it joined the famed Chindits under General Orde Wingate. The services of the defence corps were later recognised by the award of 19 decorations and 18 mentions in despatches for gallantry and good service.</p>
<p>1949 In 1949, the Hong Kong Regiment were reorganized and became part of the Hong Kong Defence Force, which also included separate air and naval units.</p>
<p>1950 New regiment's headquarters are located at Happy Valley on Hong Kong Island.</p>
<p>1951 The new combined defence force was granted the title 'Royal', and replacement colours were entrusted to the care of the regiment as successor to the defunct Defence Corps.</p>
<p>1957 The services of the defence corps during WWI were recognised by the award of the battle honour 'Hong Kong'.</p>
<p>1961 - The Hong Kong Regiment (The Volunteers) The role of The Hong Kong Regiment (The Volunteers) changed from that of an infantry battalion to a reconnaissance regiment six British Ferret armour cars (equipped with .30-inch machine-guns) were acquired. The regiment was reorganize to form a headquarters, headquarters squadron, three reconnaissance squadrons, an infantry company and a home guard company.</p>
<p>1967 The Volunteers were called out during the six-month disturbances in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>1970 - The Royal Hong Kong Regiment (The Volunteers) The naval unit was phased out and in 1970 the Royal Hong Kong Defence Force was itself disbanded-the two remaining member units, the Hong Kong Regiment and the Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force, officially becoming separate entities. At the same time, both were granted the 'Royal' title by Queen Elizabeth, and the words The Volunteers' were incorporated into the Hong Kong Regiment's title.</p>
<p><br />
1971 Partly because the modern-day regiment had, since 1961, been organized and trained as a light reconnaissance unit and partly because the original Hong Kong Defence Force no longer existed in its old form, it was decided that the regiment should have new colours. So, with the approval of the Queen, the single guidon of a reconnaissance unit was presented in 1971.</p>
<p>1979 The regiment was called out on June 16, 1979, to assist the civil powers over the problem of illegal immigration from China. At times as many as 130 men were deployed in the border area for periods of not less than three days.</p>
<p>1980 In mid-October 1980, the regiment was deployed on the border for a week in lieu of the autumn camp and achieved considerable success in apprehending 555 illegal immigrants; more than one per volunteers on duty. On 24 October, a few days after the border tour, the Governor ordered a full call out of the regiment in the wake of his announcement of the end of the 'reached base' policy, to bolster the security forces in the event of a massive influx of illegal immigrants during the following three-day grace period. Since 1980, the regiment has returned to the border annually to relieve the Regular Army, and will continue with this deployment by relieving the police twice a year as from 1 992 onwards.</p>
<p>1991 The Regiment has played an important role in manning temporary accommodation for Vietnamese migrants. The most recent Operation Midwife, on Shek Kwu Chau, lasted for 5 months from June to November1991.</p>

<p>The NSCA Certification Commission, the certifying agency for the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA), offers two credentials for fitness professionals. The Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist® (CSCS®) and NSCA-Certified Personal Trainer® (NSCA-CPT®) certifications are considered the Credentials of Distinction in the strength training and conditioning and personal training professions. These certification exams focus on the “real-world” responsibilities of personal trainers and strength training and conditioning professionals.</p>
<p>The exams are considered to be the most difficult in the industry to earn, which is one of the reasons why they are highly respected and why those who have acquired these credentials display them with a great deal of pride. The CSCS and NSCA-CPT credentials have gained the reputation among employers and industry experts as being the most respected and preferred fitness-related credentials. The exams have been validated; this process signifies that individuals are tested over the knowledge, skills and abilities necessary to be competent in their respective professional career areas.</p>
<p>One factor that distinguishes the NSCA’s certifications from other certifications is the fact that the CSCS and the NSCA-CPT are the only fitness-related credentials to be nationally accredited since 1993 and 1996, respectively, through the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the credentialing branch of the National Organization for Competency Assurance (NOCA). Based in Washington, D.C., the NCCA measures the ability of certifying organizations in any industry to accurately discriminate between qualified and unqualified professionals. To earn the recognition of the NCCA, a credentialing body must demonstrate an ability to develop and administer psychometrically sound exams through a series of criteria.</p>
<p>Additionally, since the NSCA’s inception in 1978, the organization has had a focus on strength training and conditioning. The acknowledged content experts that prepare the exams are responsible for the rigorous nature that truly discriminates between qualified and unqualified professionals. In fact, based on published data, the CSCS and NSCA-CPT exams are the most difficult fitness-related certification exams to pass and the most commonly sought after credentials in the field.</p>
<p>The CSCS certification was created in 1985 for professionals who apply scientific knowledge to train athletes for the primary goal of improving athletic performance. The credentialing program encourages a higher level of competence among practitioners and raises the quality of strength training and conditioning programs provided by those who are CSCS certified. CSCS credential holders conduct sport-specific testing sessions, design and implement safe and effective strength training and conditioning programs and provide guidance regarding nutrition and injury prevention. Recognizing that their area of expertise is separate and distinct, CSCSs consult with and refer athletes to other professionals when appropriate. To earn the CSCS credential, candidates must pass an exam comprised of two sections, one of which is one and a half hours in length and another that is two and a half hours in length. The Scientific Foundations section consists of 80 multiple-choice questions and is designed to assess a candidate’s knowledge in the areas of exercise sciences and nutrition. The Practical/Applied section consists of 110 multiple-choice questions. Forty of these are in conjunction with a video, which assesses competencies in exercise techniques, functional anatomy and testing procedures. The remaining 70 questions pertain to program design, organization/administration and testing/evaluation.</p>
<p>To be eligible to sit for the CSCS examination, the candidate must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution, be a currently enrolled college senior or hold a degree in chiropractic medicine. The candidate must provide documentation of at least a BA/BS degree defined by the United States educational system. In addition, the individual must be currently certified in at least adult CPR. CPR certifications that are only awarded through the Internet are not accepted. CSCS examination fees range from $260 to $415. CSCS preparation materials range from $17 to $275. Today, more than 18,500 professionals from a variety of academic and professional backgrounds hold this prestigious credential. Not only is the CSCS the credential of choice for strength training and conditioning professionals, but thousands of athletic trainers, physical therapists, chiropractors, researchers, educators and sport coaches have earned the CSCS credential to highlight an additional or enhanced area of expertise.</p>
<p>The NSCA-CPT certification was developed in 1993 for professionals who work one-on-one with their clients in a variety of environments, including health/fitness clubs, wellness centers, schools and clients' homes. Personal trainers are health/fitness professionals who, using an individualized approach, assess, motivate, educate and train clients regarding their health and fitness needs. They design safe and effective exercise programs, provide the guidance to help clients achieve their personal health/fitness goals and respond appropriately in emergency situations. Recognizing their own area of expertise, personal trainers refer clients to other health care professionals when appropriate. The NSCA-CPT exam thoroughly tests the knowledge and skills that are necessary to successfully train both active and sedentary physically healthy individuals, as well as individuals with special needs. Today, more than 7,500 fitness professionals hold this prestigious credential. The NSCA-CPT credential is highly valued and often required for employment at health and fitness facilities and corporate wellness centers throughout the country. Over the years, the NSCA-CPT has continued to set the standard for personal training as the most well respected personal trainer certification through national and international recognition.</p>
<p>To obtain the NSCA-CPT credential, candidates are required to pass an examination that focuses on client consultation/assessment, program planning, exercise techniques, safety/emergency procedures and legal issues. The three-hour exam consists of 140 multiple-choice questions, 35 of which correspond with video segments assessing knowledge primarily in the areas of exercise technique and client assessment. The remaining questions pertain to the exercise sciences, client assessment, program planning and safety-emergency issues.</p>
<p>To be eligible to sit for the NSCA-CPT examination, the candidate must be currently certified in CPR. CPR certifications that are only awarded through the Internet are not accepted. Although no formal post-secondary course work is required, candidates are expected to have a good knowledge of biomechanical concepts, training adaptations, anatomy, exercise physiology, program design guidelines and the content of current position papers pertaining to special populations. NSCA-CPT examination fees range from $260 to $415. NSCA-CPT preparation materials range from $17 to $275.</p>
<p>In order to develop the CSCS and NSCA-CPT exams, the NSCA Certification Commission and its independent testing service, Applied Measurement Professionals, Inc. (AMP), analyzed the job requirements of strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals. Through the efforts of the NSCA Certification Commission’s Job Analysis Committees and in conjunction with national surveys of people in these professions, the framework for determining the exams’ content and relative weighting of job-related content areas was established. People who work as personal trainers and strength and conditioning professionals were surveyed to determine what they actually do and what they have to know to perform their respective jobs. It is important that the CSCS and NSCA-CPT examinations assess competency in these areas, not the memorization of a textbook or other preparation materials. Respected content experts, with the assistance of AMP, prepare the exams and are responsible for the rigorous nature that serves to discriminate between qualified and unqualified professionals. Each year, these individuals review every exam question and each answer option plus related statistics from every exam. All of the exam questions pass through multiple reviews by these content experts in strength training and conditioning (CSCS Examination Development Committee) and personal training (NSCA-CPT Examination Development Committee). Because of this level of scrutiny and “proofing,” the time required for any given question from the time it is first written until its first use on an exam is at least 18 months. Also, each exam question MUST have an academic and professional reference that identifies one certain answer as correct and defensible. Also, after each exam, the comments made about each question are reviewed before the score reports are mailed out.</p>
<p>The competition that fitness professionals face on a day-to-day basis requires that they are well informed regarding the latest fitness innovations, program design and exercise techniques. This is why continuing education in the fitness industry is very important. Fitness professionals should be required to stay up-to-date on the latest research findings and trends in order to design proper programs for their clients. In order to remain certified, the Executive Council of the NSCA Certification Commission requires that each CSCS and NSCA-CPT complete a specified number of continuing education units (CEUs). Certification is designed to protect the public from individuals who do not have proper training or skills. A direct requirement of certification is recertification through continuing education. By requiring continuing education, certifying agencies document that those who once demonstrated a required level of competency by passing a certification exam maintain a higher level of knowledge, which makes continuing education a very integral part of a fitness professional’s career.</p>
<p>In an effort to validate its position in the fitness certification marketplace, the NSCA Certification Commission conducted a survey of 770 employers of CSCS and NSCA-CPT credential holders in 2004. When the employers were asked which organization’s certifications and/or licenses they preferred their employees to hold, more than 88% of the employers chose the CSCS and/or NSCA-CPT.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of information available regarding the many certification and licensing choices that exist and what the benefits of each may be. The NSCA Certification Commission conducted this survey to determine the perceptions and opinions of employers of CSCS and NSCA-CPT credential holders and what elements of the CSCS and NSCA-CPT certifications were most important to employers.</p>
<p>The survey revealed that those holding CSCS and/or NSCA-CPT credentials were deemed valuable to an organization based on the characteristics of quality of work, knowledge, ability to apply knowledge, earning potential and that they were less of a liability risk. CSCS and NSCA-CPT certificate holders demonstrate these characteristics because the CSCS and NSCA-CPT exams focus on the “real world” responsibilities of strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals.</p>
<p>Other key findings from the survey included: • When employers were asked if NSCA Certification Commission certifications increased the chances of a prospective employee being hired by their organization or facility, 86% of those employing CSCS certificate holders and 87% of NSCA-CPT employers agreed. Individuals who have passed these challenging exams have demonstrated a level of commitment that is beyond that of strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals who have earned a less challenging or less respected certification.</p>
<p>• When employers were asked if NSCA Certification Commission certified individuals were more likely to advance in their careers compared to individuals who are not NSCA certified, 88% of those employing CSCS certificate holders and 80% of NSCA-CPT employers agreed. The CSCS and NSCA-CPT credentials substantiate a professional’s competency level to employers and demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the tasks that are expected of them.</p>
<p>• CSCS certified professionals have demonstrated an understanding of the advanced applications of exercise program design as it relates to sport performance. Ninety-three percent of employers believed that CSCS certified individuals will improve athletic performance of athletes in their programs because their sport-specific knowledge allows them to work with any athlete regardless of sport or fitness level.</p>
<p>• One hundred percent of employers in a health club or gym setting consider NSCA-CPT certified individuals to be very knowledgeable fitness professionals. NSCA-CPT certified professionals have demonstrated the ability to assess, motivate, educate and train clients regarding their health and fitness needs. These skills include those needed to work with special needs populations, such as prepubescent youth, pregnant women, the elderly, athletes or persons with medical concerns.</p>
<p>• Employers believe the most important areas of competence for fitness professionals are in technique instruction, program design and a sound knowledge in the exercise sciences. The CSCS and NSCA-CPT exams focus on these competencies because the exams are scientifically based on the responsibilities of strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals. Industry experts and psychometricians who specialize in developing certification and licensure examinations oversaw the exam development process to ensure the exams are valid and reliable and demonstrate key characteristics of competency for strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals.</p>
<p>• Half of the employers surveyed believed the NSCA Certification Commission’s credentials reduced the risk of lawsuits. The NSCA Certification Commission conducted a thorough task analysis of both strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals to develop legally defensible certifications. The Scope of Practice for a CSCS or an NSCA-CPT is a legal and professional description of the knowledge, skills and abilities of a CSCS or an NSCA-CPT certificate holder. For this reason, the exam development process and exam administration for the CSCS and NSCA-CPT certifications are defensible in a court of law (i.e., the exams are valid and reliable and lack bias).</p>
<p>The results of the survey make it apparent that employers view the CSCS and NSCA-CPT credentials as the premiere certifications in the fitness profession. This is proof that those who hold one or both of these prestigious credentials can be proud to know they have obtained the most rigorous and challenging certifications available and these credentials will improve their chances of being hired and assist them in future career advancements.</p>

<p>[www.myspace.com/steeplesscream Steeples] as a band formed in early 2006. First started as Watching Me Watching You in the spring of 2005, the group was made up of three members: Alex Barnard, Blake Foster, and James Hammontree (formerly of Someplace to Hide). The threesome wrote a total of 4 songs which we never recorded. After two shows, one in December of 2005 the other in January of 2006, the group decided to make a few changes. Daniel Weaver was added and the group changed their name to Steeples. After a few months of writing, they played their first show as Steeples in April of 2006. In May of 2006 they recorded 6 songs, yet to be released. As of now they plan to write and record more material and begin touring.</p>

<p>Johnson V. Agina</p>
<p>CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND.</p>
<p>No. 78-5374.</p>
<p>Argued March 28, 1979. Decided June 20, 1979.</p>
<p>The telephone company, at police request, installed at its central offices a pen register to record the numbers dialed from the telephone at petitioner's home. Prior to his robbery trial, petitioner moved to suppress "all fruits derived from" the pen register. The Maryland trial court denied this motion, holding that the warrantless installation of the pen register did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Petitioner was convicted, and the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>
<p>Held:</p>
<p>The installation and use of the pen register was not a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and hence no warrant was required. Pp. 739-746.</p>
<p>(a) Application of the Fourth Amendment depends on whether the person invoking its protection can claim a "legitimate expectation of privacy" that has been invaded by government action. This inquiry normally embraces two questions: first, whether the individual has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy; and second, whether his expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as "reasonable." Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 . Pp. 739-741.</p>
<p>(b) Petitioner in all probability entertained no actual expectation of privacy in the phone numbers he dialed, and even if he did, his expectation was not "legitimate." First, it is doubtful that telephone users in general have any expectation of privacy regarding the numbers they dial, since they typically know that they must convey phone numbers to the telephone company and that the company has facilities for recording this information and does in fact record it for various legitimate business purposes. And petitioner did not demonstrate an expectation of privacy merely by using his home phone rather than some other phone, since his conduct, although perhaps calculated to keep the contents of his conversation private, was not calculated to preserve the privacy of the number he dialed. Second, even if petitioner did harbor some subjective expectation of privacy, this expectation was not one that society is prepared to recognize as "reasonable." When petitioner voluntarily conveyed numerical information to the phone company and "exposed" that information to its equipment in the normal course of business, he assumed the risk that the company would reveal the information [442 U.S. 735, 736] to the police, cf. United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435 . Pp. 741-746.</p>
<p>283 Md. 156, 389 A. 2d 858, affirmed.</p>
<p>BLACKMUN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C. J., and WHITE, REHNQUIST, and STEVENS, JJ., joined. STEWART, J., post, p. 746, and MARSHALL, J., post, p. 748, filed dissenting opinions, in which BRENNAN, J., joined. POWELL, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</p>
<p>Howard L. Cardin argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was James J. Gitomer.</p>
<p>Stephen H. Sachs, Attorney General of Maryland, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were George A. Nilson, Deputy Attorney General, and Deborah K. Handel and Stephen B. Caplis, Assistant Attorneys General.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p>This case presents the question whether the installation and use of a pen register 1 constitutes a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, 2 made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961). [442 U.S. 735, 737]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>On March 5, 1976, in Baltimore, Md., Patricia McDonough was robbed. She gave the police a description of the robber and of a 1975 Monte Carlo automobile she had observed near the scene of the crime. Tr. 66-68. After the robbery, McDonough began receiving threatening and obscene phone calls from a man identifying himself as the robber. On one occasion, the caller asked that she step out on her front porch; she did so, and saw the 1975 Monte Carlo she had earlier described to police moving slowly past her home. Id., at 70. On March 16, police spotted a man who met McDonough's description driving a 1975 Monte Carlo in her neighborhood. Id., at 71-72. By tracing the license plate number, police learned that the car was registered in the name of petitioner, Michael Lee Smith. Id., at 72.</p>
<p>The next day, the telephone company, at police request, installed a pen register at its central offices to record the numbers dialed from the telephone at petitioner's home. Id., at 73, 75. The police did not get a warrant or court order before having the pen register installed. The register revealed that on March 17 a call was placed from petitioner's home to McDonough's phone. Id., at 74. On the basis of this and other evidence, the police obtained a warrant to search petitioner's residence. Id., at 75. The search revealed that a page in petitioner's phone book was turned down to the name and number of Patricia McDonough; the phone book was seized. Ibid. Petitioner was arrested, and a six-man lineup was held on March 19. McDonough identified petitioner as the man who had robbed her. Id., at 70-71.</p>
<p>Petitioner was indicted in the Criminal Court of Baltimore for robbery. By pretrial motion, he sought to suppress "all fruits derived from the pen register" on the ground that the police had failed to secure a warrant prior to its installation. Record 14; Tr. 54-56. The trial court denied the suppression motion, holding that the warrantless installation of the pen [442 U.S. 735, 738] register did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Id., at 63. Petitioner then waived a jury, and the case was submitted to the court on an agreed statement of facts. Id., at 65-66. The pen register tape (evidencing the fact that a phone call had been made from petitioner's phone to McDonough's phone) and the phone book seized in the search of petitioner's residence were admitted into evidence against him. Id., at 74-76. Petitioner was convicted, id., at 78, and was sentenced to six years. He appealed to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, but the Court of Appeals of Maryland issued a writ of certiorari to the intermediate court in advance of its decision in order to consider whether the pen register evidence had been properly admitted at petitioner's trial. 283 Md. 156, 160, 389 A. 2d 858, 860 (1978).</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction, holding that "there is no constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed into a telephone system and hence no search within the fourth amendment is implicated by the use of a pen register installed at the central offices of the telephone company." Id., at 173, 389 A. 2d, at 867. Because there was no "search," the court concluded, no warrant was needed. Three judges dissented, expressing the view that individuals do have a legitimate expectation of privacy regarding the phone numbers they dial from their homes; that the installation of a pen register thus constitutes a "search"; and that, in the absence of exigent circumstances, the failure of police to secure a warrant mandated that the pen register evidence here be excluded. Id., at 174, 178, 389 A. 2d, at 868, 870. Certiorari was granted in order to resolve indications of conflict in the decided cases as to the restrictions imposed by the Fourth Amendment on the use of pen registers. 3 439 U.S. 1001 (1978). [442 U.S. 735, 739]</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>The Fourth Amendment guarantees "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures." In determining whether a particular form of government-initiated electronic surveillance is a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, 4 our lodestar is Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). In Katz, Government agents had intercepted the contents of a telephone conversation by attaching an electronic listening device to the outside of a public phone booth. The Court rejected the argument that a "search" can occur only when there has been a "physical intrusion" into a "constitutionally protected area," noting that the Fourth Amendment "protects people, not places." Id., at 351-353. Because the Government's monitoring of Katz' conversation "violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied while using the telephone booth," the Court held that [442 U.S. 735, 740] it "constituted a `search and seizure' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment." Id., at 353.</p>
<p>Consistently with Katz, this Court uniformly has held that the application of the Fourth Amendment depends on whether the person invoking its protection can claim a "justifiable," a "reasonable," or a "legitimate expectation of privacy" that has been invaded by government action. E. g., Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 143 , and n. 12 (1978); id., at 150, 151 (concurring opinion); id., at 164 (dissenting opinion); United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1, 7 (1977); United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 442 (1976); United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 14 (1973); Couch v. United States, 409 U.S. 322, 335 -336 (1973); United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 752 (1971) (plurality opinion); Mancusi v. DeForte, 392 U.S. 364, 368 (1968); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 9 (1968). This inquiry, as Mr. Justice Harlan aptly noted in his Katz concurrence, normally embraces two discrete questions. The first is whether the individual, by his conduct, has "exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy," 389 U.S., at 361 - whether, in the words of the Katz majority, the individual has shown that "he seeks to preserve [something] as private." Id., at 351. The second question is whether the individual's subjective expectation of privacy is "one that society is prepared to recognize as `reasonable,'" id., at 361 - whether, in the words of the Katz majority, the individual's expectation, viewed objectively, is "justifiable" under the circumstances. Id., at 353. 5 See Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S., [442 U.S. 735, 741] at 143-144, n. 12; id., at 151 (concurring opinion); United States v. White, 401 U.S., at 752 (plurality opinion).</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>In applying the Katz analysis to this case, it is important to begin by specifying precisely the nature of the state activity that is challenged. The activity here took the form of installing and using a pen register. Since the pen register was installed on telephone company property at the telephone company's central offices, petitioner obviously cannot claim that his "property" was invaded or that police intruded into a "constitutionally protected area." Petitioner's claim, rather, is that, notwithstanding the absence of a trespass, the State, as did the Government in Katz, infringed a "legitimate expectation of privacy" that petitioner held. Yet a pen register differs significantly from the listening device employed in Katz, for pen registers do not acquire the contents of communications. This Court recently noted:</p>
<p>"Indeed, a law enforcement official could not even determine from the use of a pen register whether a communication existed. These devices do not hear sound. They disclose only the telephone numbers that have been dialed - a means of establishing communication. Neither the purport of any communication between the caller and the recipient of the call, their identities, nor whether the call was even completed is disclosed by pen registers." United States v. New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 167 (1977). [442 U.S. 735, 742]</p>
<p>Given a pen register's limited capabilities, therefore, petitioner's argument that its installation and use constituted a "search" necessarily rests upon a claim that he had a "legitimate expectation of privacy" regarding the numbers he dialed on his phone.</p>
<p>This claim must be rejected. First, we doubt that people in general entertain any actual expectation of privacy in the numbers they dial. All telephone users realize that they must "convey" phone numbers to the telephone company, since it is through telephone company switching equipment that their calls are completed. All subscribers realize, moreover, that the phone company has facilities for making permanent records of the numbers they dial, for they see a list of their long-distance (toll) calls on their monthly bills. In fact, pen registers and similar devices are routinely used by telephone companies "for the purposes of checking billing operations, detecting fraud, and preventing violations of law." United States v. New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S., at 174 -175. Electronic equipment is used not only to keep billing records of toll calls, but also "to keep a record of all calls dialed from a telephone which is subject to a special rate structure." Hodge v. Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 555 F.2d 254, 266 (CA9 1977) (concurring opinion). Pen registers are regularly employed "to determine whether a home phone is being used to conduct a business, to check for a defective dial, or to check for overbilling." Note, The Legal Constraints upon the Use of the Pen Register as a Law Enforcement Tool, 60 Cornell L. Rev. 1028, 1029 (1975) (footnotes omitted). Although most people may be oblivious to a pen register's esoteric functions, they presumably have some awareness of one common use: to aid in the identification of persons making annoying or obscene calls. See, e. g., Von Lusch v. C &amp; P Telephone Co., 457 F. Supp. 814, 816 (Md. 1978); Note, 60 Cornell L. Rev., at 1029-1030, n. 11; Claerhout, The Pen Register, 20 Drake L. Rev. 108, 110-111 (1970). Most phone books tell [442 U.S. 735, 743] subscribers, on a page entitled "Consumer Information," that the company "can frequently help in identifying to the authorities the origin of unwelcome and troublesome calls." E. g., Baltimore Telephone Directory 21 (1978); District of Columbia Telephone Directory 13 (1978). Telephone users, in sum, typically know that they must convey numerical information to the phone company; that the phone company has facilities for recording this information; and that the phone company does in fact record this information for a variety of legitimate business purposes. Although subjective expectations cannot be scientifically gauged, it is too much to believe that telephone subscribers, under these circumstances, harbor any general expectation that the numbers they dial will remain secret.</p>
<p>Petitioner argues, however, that, whatever the expectations of telephone users in general, he demonstrated an expectation of privacy by his own conduct here, since he "us[ed] the telephone in his house to the exclusion of all others." Brief for Petitioner 6 (emphasis added). But the site of the call is immaterial for purposes of analysis in this case. Although petitioner's conduct may have been calculated to keep the contents of his conversation private, his conduct was not and could not have been calculated to preserve the privacy of the number he dialed. Regardless of his location, petitioner had to convey that number to the telephone company in precisely the same way if he wished to complete his call. The fact that he dialed the number on his home phone rather than on some other phone could make no conceivable difference, nor could any subscriber rationally think that it would.</p>
<p>Second, even if petitioner did harbor some subjective expectation that the phone numbers he dialed would remain private, this expectation is not "one that society is prepared to recognize as `reasonable.'" Katz v. United States, 389 U.S., at 361 . This Court consistently has held that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he [442 U.S. 735, 744] voluntarily turns over to third parties. E. g., United States v. Miller, 425 U.S., at 442 -444; Couch v. United States, 409 U.S., at 335 -336; United States v. White, 401 U.S., at 752 (plurality opinion); Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 302 (1966); Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427 (1963). In Miller, for example, the Court held that a bank depositor has no "legitimate `expectation of privacy'" in financial information "voluntarily conveyed to . . . banks and exposed to their employees in the ordinary course of business." 425 U.S., at 442 . The Court explained:</p>
<p>"The depositor takes the risk, in revealing his affairs to another, that the information will be conveyed by that person to the Government. . . . This Court has held repeatedly that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities, even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed." Id., at 443.</p>
<p>Because the depositor "assumed the risk" of disclosure, the Court held that it would be unreasonable for him to expect his financial records to remain private.</p>
<p>This analysis dictates that petitioner can claim no legitimate expectation of privacy here. When he used his phone, petitioner voluntarily conveyed numerical information to the telephone company and "exposed" that information to its equipment in the ordinary course of business. In so doing, petitioner assumed the risk that the company would reveal to police the numbers he dialed. The switching equipment that processed those numbers is merely the modern counterpart of the operator who, in an earlier day, personally completed calls for the subscriber. Petitioner concedes that if he had placed his calls through an operator, he could claim no legitimate expectation of privacy. Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-5, 11-12, 32. We [442 U.S. 735, 745] are not inclined to hold that a different constitutional result is required because the telephone company has decided to automate.</p>
<p>Petitioner argues, however, that automatic switching equipment differs from a live operator in one pertinent respect. An operator, in theory at least, is capable of remembering every number that is conveyed to him by callers. Electronic equipment, by contrast, can "remember" only those numbers it is programmed to record, and telephone companies, in view of their present billing practices, usually do not record local calls. Since petitioner, in calling McDonough, was making a local call, his expectation of privacy as to her number, on this theory, would be "legitimate."</p>
<p>This argument does not withstand scrutiny. The fortuity of whether or not the phone company in fact elects to make a quasi-permanent record of a particular number dialed does not, in our view, make any constitutional difference. Regardless of the phone company's election, petitioner voluntarily conveyed to it information that it had facilities for recording and that it was free to record. In these circumstances, petitioner assumed the risk that the information would be divulged to police. Under petitioner's theory, Fourth Amendment protection would exist, or not, depending on how the telephone company chose to define local-dialing zones, and depending on how it chose to bill its customers for local calls. Calls placed across town, or dialed directly, would be protected; calls placed across the river, or dialed with operator assistance, might not be. We are not inclined to make a crazy quilt of the Fourth Amendment, especially in circumstances where (as here) the pattern of protection would be dictated by billing practices of a private corporation.</p>
<p>We therefore conclude that petitioner in all probability entertained no actual expectation of privacy in the phone numbers he dialed, and that, even if he did, his expectation was not "legitimate." The installation and use of a pen register, [442 U.S. 735, 746] consequently, was not a "search," and no warrant was required. The judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>
<p>It is so ordered.</p>

<p>[ Footnote 4 ] In this case, the pen register was installed, and the numbers dialed were recorded, by the telephone company. Tr. 73-74. The telephone company, however, acted at police request. Id., at 73, 75. In view of this, respondent appears to concede that the company is to be deemed an "agent" of the police for purposes of this case, so as to render the installation and use of the pen register "state action" under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. We may assume that "state action" was present here.</p>
<p>[ Footnote 5 ] Situations can be imagined, of course, in which Katz' two-pronged inquiry would provide an inadequate index of Fourth Amendment protection. For example, if the Government were suddenly to announce on nationwide television that all homes henceforth would be subject to warrantless entry, individuals thereafter might not in fact entertain any actual expectation of privacy regarding their homes, papers, and effects. Similarly, if a refugee from a totalitarian country, unaware of this Nation's traditions, erroneously assumed that police were continuously monitoring his telephone conversations, a subjective expectation of privacy [442 U.S. 735, 741] regarding the contents of his calls might be lacking as well. In such circumstances, where an individual's subjective expectations had been "conditioned" by influences alien to well-recognized Fourth Amendment freedoms, those subjective expectations obviously could play no meaningful role in ascertaining what the scope of Fourth Amendment protection was. In determining whether a "legitimate expectation of privacy" existed in such cases, a normative inquiry would be proper.</p>
<p>Mr. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.</p>
<p>I am not persuaded that the numbers dialed from a private telephone fall outside the constitutional protection of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>
<p>In Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 352 , the Court acknowledged the "vital role that the public telephone has come to play in private communication[s]." The role played by a private telephone is even more vital, and since Katz it has been abundantly clear that telephone conversations carried on by people in their homes or offices are fully protected by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. As the Court said in United States v. United States District Court, 407 U.S. 297, 313 , "the broad and unsuspected governmental incursions into conversational privacy which electronic surveillance entails necessitate the application of Fourth Amendment safeguards." (Footnote omitted.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Court today says that those safeguards do not extend to the numbers dialed from a private telephone, apparently because when a caller dials a number the digits may be recorded by the telephone company for billing purposes. But that observation no more than describes the basic nature of telephone calls. A telephone call simply cannot be made without the use of telephone company property and without payment to the company for the service. The telephone conversation itself must be electronically transmitted by telephone company equipment, and may be recorded or overheard by the use of other company equipment. Yet we [442 U.S. 735, 747] have squarely held that the user of even a public telephone is entitled "to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world." Katz v. United States, supra, at 352.</p>
<p>The central question in this case is whether a person who makes telephone calls from his home is entitled to make a similar assumption about the numbers he dials. What the telephone company does or might do with those numbers is no more relevant to this inquiry than it would be in a case involving the conversation itself. It is simply not enough to say, after Katz, that there is no legitimate expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed because the caller assumes the risk that the telephone company will disclose them to the police.</p>
<p>I think that the numbers dialed from a private telephone - like the conversations that occur during a call - are within the constitutional protection recognized in Katz. 1 It seems clear to me that information obtained by pen register surveillance of a private telephone is information in which the telephone subscriber has a legitimate expectation of privacy. 2 The information captured by such surveillance emanates from private conduct within a person's home or office - locations that without question are entitled to Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment protection. Further, that information is an integral part of the telephonic communication that under Katz [442 U.S. 735, 748] is entitled to constitutional protection, whether or not it is captured by a trespass into such an area.</p>
<p>The numbers dialed from a private telephone - although certainly more prosaic than the conversation itself - are not without "content." Most private telephone subscribers may have their own numbers listed in a publicly distributed directory, but I doubt there are any who would be happy to have broadcast to the world a list of the local or long distance numbers they have called. This is not because such a list might in some sense be incriminating, but because it easily could reveal the identities of the persons and the places called, and thus reveal the most intimate details of a person's life.</p>
<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p>[ Footnote 1 ] It is true, as the Court pointed out in United States v. New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 166 -167, that under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. 2510-2520, pen registers are not considered "interceptions" because "they do not acquire the `contents' of communications," as that term is defined by Congress. We are concerned in this case, however, not with the technical definitions of a statute, but with the requirements of the Constitution.</p>
<p>[ Footnote 2 ] The question whether a defendant who is not a member of the subscriber's household has "standing" to object to pen register surveillance of a private telephone is, of course, distinct. Cf. Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128 .</p>
<p>Mr. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom Mr. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.</p>
<p>The Court concludes that because individuals have no actual or legitimate expectation of privacy in information they voluntarily relinquish to telephone companies, the use of pen registers by government agents is immune from Fourth Amendment scrutiny. Since I remain convinced that constitutional protections are not abrogated whenever a person apprises another of facts valuable in criminal investigations, see, e. g., United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 786 -790 (1971) (Harlan, J., dissenting); id., at 795-796 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21, 95 -96 (1974) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 455 -456 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p>Applying the standards set forth in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring), the Court first determines that telephone subscribers have no subjective expectations of privacy concerning the numbers they dial. To reach this conclusion, the Court posits that individuals somehow infer from the long-distance listings on their phone bills, and from the cryptic assurances of "help" in tracing obscene [442 U.S. 735, 749] calls included in "most" phone books, that pen registers are regularly used for recording local calls. See ante, at 742-743. But even assuming, as I do not, that individuals "typically know" that a phone company monitors calls for internal reasons, ante, at 743, 1 it does not follow that they expect this information to be made available to the public in general or the government in particular. Privacy is not a discrete commodity, possessed absolutely or not at all. Those who disclose certain facts to a bank or phone company for a limited business purpose need not assume that this information will be released to other persons for other purposes. See California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz, supra, at 95-96 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).</p>
<p>The crux of the Court's holding, however, is that whatever expectation of privacy petitioner may in fact have entertained regarding his calls, it is not one "society is prepared to recognize as `reasonable.'" Ante, at 743. In so ruling, the Court determines that individuals who convey information to third parties have "assumed the risk" of disclosure to the government. Ante, at 744, 745. This analysis is misconceived in two critical respects.</p>
<p>Implicit in the concept of assumption of risk is some notion of choice. At least in the third-party consensual surveillance cases, which first incorporated risk analysis into Fourth Amendment doctrine, the defendant presumably had exercised some discretion in deciding who should enjoy his confidential communications. See, e. g., Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427, 439 (1963); Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 302 -303 (1966); United States v. White, supra, at 751-752 [442 U.S. 735, 750] (plurality opinion). By contrast here, unless a person is prepared to forgo use of what for many has become a personal or professional necessity, he cannot help but accept the risk of surveillance. Cf. Lopez v. United States, supra, at 465-466 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). It is idle to speak of "assuming" risks in contexts where, as a practical mater, individuals have no realistic alternative.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, to make risk analysis dispositive in assessing the reasonableness of privacy expectations would allow the government to define the scope of Fourth Amendment protections. For example, law enforcement officials, simply by announcing their intent to monitor the content of random samples of first-class mail or private phone conversations, could put the public on notice of the risks they would thereafter assume in such communications. See Amsterdam, Perspectives on the Fourth Amendment, 58 Minn. L. Rev. 349, 384, 407 (1974). Yet, although acknowledging this implication of its analysis, the Court is willing to concede only that, in some circumstances, a further "normative inquiry would be proper." Ante, at 740-741, n. 5. No meaningful effort is made to explain what those circumstances might be, or why this case is not among them.</p>
<p>In my view, whether privacy expectations are legitimate within the meaning of Katz depends not on the risks an individual can be presumed to accept when imparting information to third parties, but on the risks he should be forced to assume in a free and open society. By its terms, the constitutional prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures assigns to the judiciary some prescriptive responsibility. As Mr. Justice Harlan, who formulated the standard the Court applies today, himself recognized: "[s]ince it is the task of the law to form and project, as well as mirror and reflect, we should not . . . merely recite . . . risks without examining the desirability of saddling them upon society." United States v. White, supra, at 786 (dissenting opinion). In making this [442 U.S. 735, 751] assessment, courts must evaluate the "intrinsic character" of investigative practices with reference to the basic values underlying the Fourth Amendment. California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz, 416 U.S., at 95 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). And for those "extensive intrusions that significantly jeopardize [individuals'] sense of security . . ., more than self-restraint by law enforcement officials is required." United States v. White, 401 U.S., at 786 (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>
<p>The use of pen registers, I believe, constitutes such an extensive intrusion. To hold otherwise ignores the vital role telephonic communication plays in our personal and professional relationships, see Katz v. United States, 389 U.S., at 352 , as well as the First and Fourth Amendment interests implicated by unfettered official surveillance. Privacy in placing calls is of value not only to those engaged in criminal activity. The prospect of unregulated governmental monitoring will undoubtedly prove disturbing even to those with nothing illicit to hide. Many individuals, including members of unpopular political organizations or journalists with confidential sources, may legitimately wish to avoid disclosure of their personal contacts. See NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 463 (1958); Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 695 (1972); id., at 728-734 (STEWART, J., dissenting). Permitting governmental access to telephone records on less than probable cause may thus impede certain forms of political affiliation and journalistic endeavor that are the hallmark of a truly free society. Particularly given the Government's previous reliance on warrantless telephonic surveillance to trace reporters' sources and monitor protected political activity, 2 I am unwilling to insulate use of pen registers from independent judicial review. [442 U.S. 735, 752]</p>
<p>Just as one who enters a public telephone booth is "entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world," Katz v. United States, supra, at 352, so too, he should be entitled to assume that the numbers he dials in the privacy of his home will be recorded, if at all, solely for the phone company's business purposes. Accordingly, I would require law enforcement officials to obtain a warrant before they enlist telephone companies to secure information otherwise beyond the government's reach.</p>
<p>[ Footnote 1 ] Lacking the Court's apparently exhaustive knowledge of this Nation's telephone books and the reading habits of telephone subscribers, see ante, at 742-743, I decline to assume general public awareness of how obscene phone calls are traced. Nor am I persuaded that the scope of Fourth Amendment protection should turn on the concededly "esoteric functions" of pen registers in corporate billing, ante, at 742, functions with which subscribers are unlikely to have intimate familiarity.</p>

Kissinger, 434 F. Supp. 1193 (DC 1977); Socialist Workers Party v. Attorney General, 463 F. Supp. 515 (SDNY 1978). [442 U.S. 735, 753]</p>

<p>At midnight on July 31st 1834, the Abolition Bill which the British Parliament passed earlier in the year went into effect, ending over 300 years of slavery. It had been a long and brutal struggle to end this inhumanity. Many revolts and uprisings had occurred in Jamaica but most were local in nature and were put down with relative ease. Not so on Easter Sunday 1760.</p>
<p>Tacky, a Coromantee Chief was from the Guinea area of the West Coast of Africa, as were many of the slaves sold to plantations in the St. Mary's Parish of Jamaica. Tacky's position as overseer on the Frontier plantation gave him the opportunity to draw up some simple but effective plans to gain freedom and to easily get them to his trusted followers both at Frontier and neighbouring Trinity plantations. They decided to wait until Easter Sunday when they knew no one would suspect what was to follow.</p>
<p>Sometime before daybreak on Monday, Tacky and his followers began the revolt and easily took over the Frontier and Trinity plantations while killing their masters. Bolstered by their easy success, they made their way to the storeroom at Fort Haldane where the munitions to defend the town of Port Maria were kept. After killing the storekeeper, Tacky and his men stole nearly 4 barrels of gun powder and 40 firearms with shot before marching on to overrun the plantations at Heywood Hall and Esher. By dawn, hundreds had joined Tacky and his followers. At Ballard's Valley, the rebels stopped to rejoice in their success, as one slave from Esher decided to slip away and sound the alarm. Obeahmen quickly circulated around the camp dispensing a powder that they claimed would protect the men from injury in battle and loudly proclaimed that an Obeahman could not be killed. Confidence was high.</p>
<p>Soon there were 70 to 80 mounted militia on their way along with some Maroons from Scott's Hall, who were bound by treaty to suppress such rebellions. When the militia learned of the Obeahman's boast of not being able to be killed, an Obeahman was captured, killed and hung with his mask, ornaments of teeth and bone and feather trimmings at a prominent place visible from the encampment of rebels. Many of the rebels, confidence shaken, returned to their plantations but Tacky and 25 or so men decided to fight on.</p>
<p>Tacky and his men went running through the woods being chased by the Maroons and their legendary marksman, Davy. While running at full speed, Davy shot Tacky and cut off his head to prove his feat for which he would be richly rewarded. Tacky's head was later displayed on a pole in Spanish Town until a follower took it down in the middle of the night. Tacky's men were found in a cave near Tacky Falls, having committed suicide rather than going back to slavery.</p>
<p>The rebellion didn't end here, as other rebellions broke out all over Jamaica, which many were rightly or wrongly attributed to Tacky's cunning and strategy. It was months later until peace was restored. Over 60 white people had lost their lives as well as 400 or so Negro slaves, including two ring leaders who were burned alive and two others who were hung in iron cages at the Kingston Parade, until they starved to death.</p>
<p>You can visit the Tacky Monument in Claude Stuart Park in Port Maria. Tacky Falls is accessible by the sea but the overland route is considered by locals to be too tough to travel. The waterfalls have diminished over the years and mainly eroded rocks mark the course. The exact location of the cave where they found Tacky's men is not known</p>

<p>The NSCA Certification Commission, the certifying agency for the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA), offers two credentials for fitness professionals. The Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist® (CSCS®) and NSCA-Certified Personal Trainer® (NSCA-CPT®) certifications are considered the Credentials of Distinction in the strength training and conditioning and personal training professions. These certification exams focus on the “real-world” responsibilities of personal trainers and strength training and conditioning professionals.</p>
<p>The exams are considered to be the most difficult in the industry to earn, which is one of the reasons why they are highly respected and why those who have acquired these credentials display them with a great deal of pride. The CSCS and NSCA-CPT credentials have gained the reputation among employers and industry experts as being the most respected and preferred fitness-related credentials. The exams have been validated; this process signifies that individuals are tested over the knowledge, skills and abilities necessary to be competent in their respective professional career areas.</p>
<p>One factor that distinguishes the NSCA’s certifications from other certifications is the fact that the CSCS and the NSCA-CPT are the only fitness-related credentials to be nationally accredited since 1993 and 1996, respectively, through the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the credentialing branch of the National Organization for Competency Assurance (NOCA). Based in Washington, D.C., the NCCA measures the ability of certifying organizations in any industry to accurately discriminate between qualified and unqualified professionals. To earn the recognition of the NCCA, a credentialing body must demonstrate an ability to develop and administer psychometrically sound exams through a series of criteria. Additionally, since the NSCA’s inception in 1978, the organization has had a focus on strength training and conditioning. The acknowledged content experts that prepare the exams are responsible for the rigorous nature that truly discriminates between qualified and unqualified professionals. In fact, based on published data, the CSCS and NSCA-CPT exams are the most difficult fitness-related certification exams to pass and the most commonly sought after credentials in the field.</p>
<p>The CSCS certification was created in 1985 for professionals who apply scientific knowledge to train athletes for the primary goal of improving athletic performance. The credentialing program encourages a higher level of competence among practitioners and raises the quality of strength training and conditioning programs provided by those who are CSCS certified. CSCS credential holders conduct sport-specific testing sessions, design and implement safe and effective strength training and conditioning programs and provide guidance regarding nutrition and injury prevention. Recognizing that their area of expertise is separate and distinct, CSCSs consult with and refer athletes to other professionals when appropriate.</p>
<p>To earn the CSCS credential, candidates must pass an exam comprised of two sections, one of which is one and a half hours in length and another that is two and a half hours in length. The Scientific Foundations section consists of 80 multiple-choice questions and is designed to assess a candidate’s knowledge in the areas of exercise sciences and nutrition. The Practical/Applied section consists of 110 multiple-choice questions. Forty of these are in conjunction with a video, which assesses competencies in exercise techniques, functional anatomy and testing procedures. The remaining 70 questions pertain to program design, organization/administration and testing/evaluation.</p>
<p>To be eligible to sit for the CSCS examination, the candidate must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution, be a currently enrolled college senior or hold a degree in chiropractic medicine. The candidate must provide documentation of at least a BA/BS degree defined by the United States educational system. In addition, the individual must be currently certified in at least adult CPR. CPR certifications that are only awarded through the Internet are not accepted. CSCS examination fees range from $260 to $415. CSCS preparation materials range from $17 to $275. Today, more than 18,500 professionals from a variety of academic and professional backgrounds hold this prestigious credential. Not only is the CSCS the credential of choice for strength training and conditioning professionals, but thousands of athletic trainers, physical therapists, chiropractors, researchers, educators and sport coaches have earned the CSCS credential to highlight an additional or enhanced area of expertise.</p>
<p>The NSCA-CPT certification was developed in 1993 for professionals who work one-on-one with their clients in a variety of environments, including health/fitness clubs, wellness centers, schools and clients' homes. Personal trainers are health/fitness professionals who, using an individualized approach, assess, motivate, educate and train clients regarding their health and fitness needs. They design safe and effective exercise programs, provide the guidance to help clients achieve their personal health/fitness goals and respond appropriately in emergency situations. Recognizing their own area of expertise, personal trainers refer clients to other health care professionals when appropriate.</p>
<p>The NSCA-CPT exam thoroughly tests the knowledge and skills that are necessary to successfully train both active and sedentary physically healthy individuals, as well as individuals with special needs. Today, more than 7,500 fitness professionals hold this prestigious credential. The NSCA-CPT credential is highly valued and often required for employment at health and fitness facilities and corporate wellness centers throughout the country. Over the years, the NSCA-CPT has continued to set the standard for personal training as the most well respected personal trainer certification through national and international recognition.</p>
<p>To obtain the NSCA-CPT credential, candidates are required to pass an examination that focuses on client consultation/assessment, program planning, exercise techniques, safety/emergency procedures and legal issues. The three-hour exam consists of 140 multiple-choice questions, 35 of which correspond with video segments assessing knowledge primarily in the areas of exercise technique and client assessment. The remaining questions pertain to the exercise sciences, client assessment, program planning and safety-emergency issues.</p>
<p>To be eligible to sit for the NSCA-CPT examination, the candidate must be currently certified in CPR. CPR certifications that are only awarded through the Internet are not accepted. Although no formal post-secondary course work is required, candidates are expected to have a good knowledge of biomechanical concepts, training adaptations, anatomy, exercise physiology, program design guidelines and the content of current position papers pertaining to special populations. NSCA-CPT examination fees range from $260 to $415. NSCA-CPT preparation materials range from $17 to $275.</p>
<p>In order to develop the CSCS and NSCA-CPT exams, the NSCA Certification Commission and its independent testing service, Applied Measurement Professionals, Inc. (AMP), analyzed the job requirements of strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals. Through the efforts of the NSCA Certification Commission’s Job Analysis Committees and in conjunction with national surveys of people in these professions, the framework for determining the exams’ content and relative weighting of job-related content areas was established. People who work as personal trainers and strength and conditioning professionals were surveyed to determine what they actually do and what they have to know to perform their respective jobs. It is important that the CSCS and NSCA-CPT examinations assess competency in these areas, not the memorization of a textbook or other preparation materials.</p>
<p>Respected content experts, with the assistance of AMP, prepare the exams and are responsible for the rigorous nature that serves to discriminate between qualified and unqualified professionals. Each year, these individuals review every exam question and each answer option plus related statistics from every exam. All of the exam questions pass through multiple reviews by these content experts in strength training and conditioning (CSCS Examination Development Committee) and personal training (NSCA-CPT Examination Development Committee). Because of this level of scrutiny and “proofing,” the time required for any given question from the time it is first written until its first use on an exam is at least 18 months. Also, each exam question MUST have an academic and professional reference that identifies one certain answer as correct and defensible. Also, after each exam, the comments made about each question are reviewed before the score reports are mailed out.</p>
<p>The competition that fitness professionals face on a day-to-day basis requires that they are well informed regarding the latest fitness innovations, program design and exercise techniques. This is why continuing education in the fitness industry is very important. Fitness professionals should be required to stay up-to-date on the latest research findings and trends in order to design proper programs for their clients. In order to remain certified, the Executive Council of the NSCA Certification Commission requires that each CSCS and NSCA-CPT complete a specified number of continuing education units (CEUs).</p>
<p>Certification is designed to protect the public from individuals who do not have proper training or skills. A direct requirement of certification is recertification through continuing education. By requiring continuing education, certifying agencies document that those who once demonstrated a required level of competency by passing a certification exam maintain a higher level of knowledge, which makes continuing education a very integral part of a fitness professional’s career.</p>
<p>In an effort to validate its position in the fitness certification marketplace, the NSCA Certification Commission conducted a survey of 770 employers of CSCS and NSCA-CPT credential holders in 2004. When the employers were asked which organization’s certifications and/or licenses they preferred their employees to hold, more than 88% of the employers chose the CSCS and/or NSCA-CPT.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of information available regarding the many certification and licensing choices that exist and what the benefits of each may be. The NSCA Certification Commission conducted this survey to determine the perceptions and opinions of employers of CSCS and NSCA-CPT credential holders and what elements of the CSCS and NSCA-CPT certifications were most important to employers.</p>
<p>The survey revealed that those holding CSCS and/or NSCA-CPT credentials were deemed valuable to an organization based on the characteristics of quality of work, knowledge, ability to apply knowledge, earning potential and that they were less of a liability risk. CSCS and NSCA-CPT certificate holders demonstrate these characteristics because the CSCS and NSCA-CPT exams focus on the “real world” responsibilities of strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals.</p>
<p>Other key findings from the survey included: • When employers were asked if NSCA Certification Commission certifications increased the chances of a prospective employee being hired by their organization or facility, 86% of those employing CSCS certificate holders and 87% of NSCA-CPT employers agreed. Individuals who have passed these challenging exams have demonstrated a level of commitment that is beyond that of strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals who have earned a less challenging or less respected certification.</p>
<p>• When employers were asked if NSCA Certification Commission certified individuals were more likely to advance in their careers compared to individuals who are not NSCA certified, 88% of those employing CSCS certificate holders and 80% of NSCA-CPT employers agreed. The CSCS and NSCA-CPT credentials substantiate a professional’s competency level to employers and demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the tasks that are expected of them.</p>
<p>• CSCS certified professionals have demonstrated an understanding of the advanced applications of exercise program design as it relates to sport performance. Ninety-three percent of employers believed that CSCS certified individuals will improve athletic performance of athletes in their programs because their sport-specific knowledge allows them to work with any athlete regardless of sport or fitness level.</p>
<p>• One hundred percent of employers in a health club or gym setting consider NSCA-CPT certified individuals to be very knowledgeable fitness professionals. NSCA-CPT certified professionals have demonstrated the ability to assess, motivate, educate and train clients regarding their health and fitness needs. These skills include those needed to work with special needs populations, such as prepubescent youth, pregnant women, the elderly, athletes or persons with medical concerns.</p>
<p>• Employers believe the most important areas of competence for fitness professionals are in technique instruction, program design and a sound knowledge in the exercise sciences. The CSCS and NSCA-CPT exams focus on these competencies because the exams are scientifically based on the responsibilities of strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals. Industry experts and psychometricians who specialize in developing certification and licensure examinations oversaw the exam development process to ensure the exams are valid and reliable and demonstrate key characteristics of competency for strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals.</p>
<p>• Half of the employers surveyed believed the NSCA Certification Commission’s credentials reduced the risk of lawsuits. The NSCA Certification Commission conducted a thorough task analysis of both strength training and conditioning and personal training professionals to develop legally defensible certifications. The Scope of Practice for a CSCS or an NSCA-CPT is a legal and professional description of the knowledge, skills and abilities of a CSCS or an NSCA-CPT certificate holder. For this reason, the exam development process and exam administration for the CSCS and NSCA-CPT certifications are defensible in a court of law (i.e., the exams are valid and reliable and lack bias).</p>
<p>The results of the survey make it apparent that employers view the CSCS and NSCA-CPT credentials as the premiere certifications in the fitness profession. This is proof that those who hold one or both of these prestigious credentials can be proud to know they have obtained the most rigorous and challenging certifications available and these credentials will improve their chances of being hired and assist them in future career advancements.</p>

<p>Debeljača is a small place on the north of Republic Serbia, in the autonom province Vojvodina. Debeljača is mostly inhabited with serbs and hungarians (hungarian name for Debeljača is Torontálvásárhely) though it is more a historical name that is not in use today neither among serbs nor hungarians. Debeljača is more than 200 years old. The first family who settled this are was Dimitrić family. Soon after they built a pub and dormitory, the settlers who were moving from austro-hungarian borders towards Danube, often came by. That is how hungarians came and settled on the place of the nowdays Debeljača.</p>

<p>Davilex are a small games publisher and developer based in the Netherlands. Since 2000 they have been making games but prior to this they also made software for PC's such as virus checkers and still remain to do so today. They have released a variety of games and the list below is the full list of games that Davilex have relased in the UK. Each game is followed by a list of formats that the game was released on.</p>
<pre>
   London Racer (PS1, PC)
   London Racer II (PC, PS1, PS2)
   London Racer World Challenge (PC &amp; PS2)
   London Racer Police Madness (PS2)
   London Racer Destruction Madness (PS2)
   Europe Racer (PS1, PC)
   Thames Racer (PC)
   Holiday Racer (PC)
   USA Racer (PC, PS2, PS1 &amp; Gameboy Advance)
   Knight Rider The Game 1 &amp; 2 (PC &amp; PS2)
   Beach King Stunt Racer (PC &amp; PS2)
   Miami Vice (PC, XBOX, PS2)
   SAS Anti Terror Force (PS2)
   Red Baron (PS2)
</pre>
<p>The games are priced at a budget price, usally at around the £15 to £20 mark. Davilex managed to aquire the Miami Vice and Knight Rider rights from Universal in 2002, and since have released 2 Knight Rider games, both made and published by Davilex themselves and Miami Vice which was developed under Atomic Planet Entertainment who later developed SAS and Red Baron.</p>
<p>Most Davilex games are met with high critism from magazines and internet sites. The only exception has been London Racer World Challenge that although was similar to the dismal London Racer II had loads more tracks and cars. This particular game recieved the highest rating for any Davilex game given my PSM2 magazine, at 60%.</p>

<p>It is unknown as to whether Davilex still own the rights to Miami Vice, as the new Miami Vice game based on the new movie has been published and developed by other groups and is a full price game. It is believed they still own the Knight Rider rights and judging from the 'gaps' Davilex leave between releasing Knight Rider games, there should be a new game come the end of 2006. Davilex also strive to release a London Racer game pretty much on a yearly basis except 2004, so another London Racer game is possible.</p>

<p>The West Texan is a 1941 cabin cruiser built by Chris Craft. The beautiful 38-footer can be seen on the waters of Eagle Mountain Lake. The West Texan was presented to Amon G. Carter, Sr., then publisher of The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Mr. Carter used the boat to entertain family, friends and distinguished guests such as; Lyndon Johnson, Dwight Eisenhower, Sid Caesar and Victor Mature. After the death of Amon Carter, Jr., Amon's son, in 1984, control of the boat was turned over to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The newspaper still owns and operates this classic vessel today.</p>

<p>--207.179.167.210 21:34, 25 July 2006 (UTC) Harry Pulliam was the active National Baseball League President during the Fred Merkle incident known as the Merkle Boner. Pulliam ruled in favor of umpire Hank O'Day, and subsequently the 1908 Chicago Cubs, that the contested tie game be replayed. Pulliam committed suicide by gunshot (head) less than a year after rendering his decision. It was widely believed stress, caused by extensive criticism of his handling of the Merkle situation, coupled with inherent mental issues, drove Pulliam to end his own life.</p>

<p>Shane Minor was a former Mr. USA who posed nude for <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playgirl.html" title="Playgirl">Playgirl</a> and appeared as their cover model in July 1994. He was was born May 3, 1968 in Modesto, California. The outfit that Shane was wearing as Playgirl's cover model was by a company called "Body Body Wear" that still features pictures of Shane and Playgirl's July 1994 cover. Shane tried to use his Mr. USA title and Playgirl appearances to launch an acting career. He made a few inroads, but commercial success in acting has thus far eluded him (see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591589/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591589/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591589/</a>).</p>
