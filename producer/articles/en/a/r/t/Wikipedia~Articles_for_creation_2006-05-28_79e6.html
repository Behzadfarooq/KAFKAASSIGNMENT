<p>Lady Byng Memorial Trophy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Revision as of 22:10, 2 May 2006; view current revision ← Older revision | Newer revision → You have new messages (last change). Jump to: navigation, search</p>
<p>The Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, formerly known as the Lady Byng Trophy, is presented each year to the National Hockey League hockey player voted to have shown the best sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with performance in play. The winner tends to be favoured by peers for leadership and on-ice conduct. To choose a winner, the Professional Hockey Writers' Association conducts a poll at the end of the regular season.</p>
<p>The trophy is named in honour of Lady Byng, wife of Viscount Byng of Vimy, a Vimy Ridge war hero who was the Governor-General of Canada in 1925. Lord and Lady Byng were big sports fans, with a special interest in ice hockey. Lord Byng rarely missed an Ottawa Senators game and Lady Byng frequently accompanied him. Lady Byng presented the first Lady Byng Trophy in 1925.</p>
<p>After New York Rangers player Frank Boucher won the award seven times in eight years, he was given the trophy to keep. Lady Byng donated a second trophy in 1936.</p>
<p>When Lady Byng died in 1949, the NHL presented another trophy and changed the name to the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Commander John Wellham Served in WWII in the Fleet Air Arm of The Royal Navy. He died 9th May 2006 and is survived by his wife and two children <i><b>(note 1)</b></i>.</p>
<p>[[<b>BATTLE OF TARANTO</b>]] On the evening of 11 November 1940 21 Swordfish took off from HMS Illustrious to fly over 150 miles across the Mediterranean in the moonlight. They were in two waves, the first of twelve Swordfish the remainder would contain nine others including John Wellham author of two books "With Navel Wings" and "The Attack on Taranto – Blueprint for Pearl Harbour". The target was the Italian fleet in the well defended harbour at Taranto, Italy. The planners estimated a 50%casualty rate minimum for air crews.(see <a href="http://www.swordfishleeds.com/bismarck.htm#t" class="external free" title="http://www.swordfishleeds.com/bismarck.htm#t" rel="nofollow">http://www.swordfishleeds.com/bismarck.htm#t</a>)</p>
<p>John Wellham was flying Swordfish E5H in the second wave of the attack. Onboard maximum weight with an 18-in torpedo and a long-range tank.</p>
<p>In formation at 7,000 ft, from 30 miles away the fountains of tracer fire were seen over the Italian port of Taranto. The element of surprise had been lost to the second wave, aircraft dived towards the harbour without the possibility of a co-ordinated attack.</p>
<p>Wellham remembered meeting a barrage balloon at 4,000 ft and thinking that it must have broken off its moorings. As he manoeuvred violently around it he was hit by flak, and had the control stick wrested from his hands. Then, slamming it hard to right and left while opening and closing the throttle, he suddenly realised that he was heading vertically for the city's rooftops. see</p>
<p>Levelling out with difficulty 100 ft above the sea, he glimpsed a battleship on his right, and instinctively swung his tail from side to side to reduce speed and keep the aircraft at the correct dropping height.</p>
<p>Most of the tracer passed overhead, but, after dropping its torpedo, the Swordfish rose into the stream of fire. Zigzagging wildly at low level, it crossed the breakwater and began climbing into the night sky.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Pat Humphries, the observer, shouted at Wellham through their voice tube: "That was a bit exciting. I think that you've bent the plane somewhat. Do you think she'll get us home?" "It wasn't my fault," Wellham replied indignantly. "It was those bloody Eyeties!"</p>
<p>The first wave had started their attack at 22.56 hrs. Within ten minutes, the two waves were over the target, using 11 torpedoes and 48 250lb bombs they had sunk one battleship, left one sinking and a third so badly crippled that the repairs were not finished until after the war. Three cruisers were severely damaged and a seaplane base and oil refinery destroyed.</p>
<p>Only two aircraft were lost with two crew being taken prisoner. Sadly the other two crew were lost. <i><b>(note 9.)</b></i></p>
<p>John Wellham then flew 150 miles back to Illustrious without difficulty. But, as he throttled back to landing speed, his Swordfish was uncontrollable. He cut the engine early to thump on to the deck.</p>
<p>As the plane was taken down into the hangar, Wellham heard a sailor say "F***, mate, look at that!" Looking over the aircraft's side, he saw that the port aileron rods were broken into two jagged pieces and, through the broken fabric, he noted several bent wing ribs.</p>
<p>The attack by 21 Swordfish torpedo bombers left Taranto in chaos. The Italian battleships Conte di Cavour, Littorio and Caio Duilio had been sunk, the seaplane depot set ablaze and a cruiser damaged, all for the loss of two aircraft and their crews.</p>
<p>The battle at Taranto sounded the death knell not just for the Italian fleet but for all battleships. The Japanese studied the attack carefully before launching their attack on Pearl Harbor 11 months later.</p>
<p>Wellham appreciated the signal "Manoeuvre well executed" from Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, C-in-C Mediterranean. Though the miserly scale of awards to air and ground crew left a lasting sense of resentment. However, Wellham was to be mentioned in dispatches six months later for another attack.</p>
<p>John Walter George Wellham was born in 1919, January 2nd on the Isle of Bute, Scotland.His father was a retired petty officer. His mother died when he was six. He was educated at Rothesay Academy. Aged 17 he joined the RAF.</p>
<p>He transferred to the Royal Navy and was a lieutenant at 20. He joined 824 Naval Air Squadron in the carrier HMS Eagle.<i><b>(note 3.)</b></i></p>
<p>Through until May 1940 Wellham hunted German raiders in the Indian Ocean, when his ship HMS Eagle entered the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>During the battle of Calabria on 9th of July 1940, he was mentioned in dispatches when he made two torpedo attacks on the Italian fleet during which he also had an ideal view of the enemy fleeing as the battleship HMS Warspite's <i><b>(note 2.)</b></i> 15-inch shells rained among their ships sinking Italian Battleship 'Giulio Cesare' at a range of approximately 26,000 yards.( She (HMS Warsprite) was credited with achieving the longest range gunnery hit from a moving ship to a moving target in history. )</p>
<p>Six weeks later Wellham was one of three Swordfish pilots who attacked the Bay of Cyrenaica (Bomba), approaching at sea level after a flight of several hours. They caught the Italian submarine Iride <i><b>(note 4)</b></i> offshore and a depot ship, a submarine and a destroyer at anchor. Wellham's leader, Captain Ollie Patch, Royal Marines, sank Iride; while Wellham, with his observer, Petty Officer "Swampy" Marsh, and Lieutenant "Cheese" Cheesman attacked the others.</p>
<p>As Wellham flew close to the depot ship possibly the "CM MONTE GARGANO" which was a support ship for the submarine Iride <i><b>(note 5)</b></i> , it fired at him with all guns, one bullet smashed his main spar, punctured the fuel tank and hit him in the foot. As he climbed away he saw a huge pall of black smoke tinged with flame rising hundreds of feet in the air. The Swordfish had sunk four ships with three torpedoes, and, although they did not know it until much later, they had thwarted an attack by miniature submarines on Alexandria.</p>
<p>Low on fuel, Wellham returned to his desert base and was awarded the DSC.</p>
<p>In March 1941 he flew off the carrier Eagle, which was at anchor in Alexandria, and crossed the desert in several stages to attack Italian warships at Massawa on the Red Sea.</p>
<p>Two destroyers were sunk, and Wellham attacked Tigre, forcing her to beach; the Italian ship was then shelled by the destroyer Kingston, which presented Wellham with a captured Italian ensign.</p>
<p>Wellham next commanded the desert-based 815 Squadron <i><b>(note 6.)</b></i> , operating in support of the Army and the Royal Air Force. The squadron re-equipped in mid 1941 with 12 Albacores and 2 Swordfish with ASV radar and supported the 8th Army in the Western Desert. Attacked German-held aerodromes and armoured formations, and supported the Allied advance into Libya in 1942.</p>
<p>He ended the Second World War in the escort carrier (of the Avenger / Charger class) HMS Biter <i><b>(note 7.)</b></i> on convoy duties in the Atlantic, and in the carrier Empress <i><b>(note 8.)</b></i> in the Far East.</p>
<p>After leaving the Navy in 1954 Wellham sold wallpaper and paints for Brighter Home Stores, installed bowling alley equipment for the American Brunswick company and was a sales manager for Vaux Breweries.</p>
<p>In his latter years he lectured and raised funds for the Royal Navy Historic Flight.</p>
<p>In 1995 he published his wartime autobiography, With Naval Wings, and co-wrote The Attack on Taranto</p>

<p>'Whizzard of Ow' is a short cartoon which was shown in theatres before the 2003 film 'looney tunes back in action', starring the road runner and Wile E. coyote. When two magicians fight in a duel, they both are disintegrated, leaving only their book of speels which coyote finds. He then uses these spells to try and catch the roadrunner (but ultimately fails). Aside from this plot setting, the cartoon follows the normal roadrunner structure.</p>

<p>Wierdways are a method of travel in the House and seem to exist in many rooms and levels of the House. they are often disguised as something (according to Suzy Turquoise Blue, the most popular are mirrors) and are activated by touching the object they are disguised as, transforming the object itself into a "dark doorway" which leads directly into the Wierdway.</p>
<p>according to Suzy Blue, Wierdways are composed of Nothing and exploit the architecture of the House. Wierdways have corridors that have dark walls that are soft and jellylike (probably the reason they are called WIERDways) and may be short or long, depending upon the distance of the place they lead to. If a Wierdway closes while a traveller is still within it, it is assumed that they are either 'squashed' or cease to exist. Some places, such as the washroom in the Great Maze simply cease to exist once the Wierdway connecting it to another part of the house has shut, expelling all lifeforms to the place it connects to.</p>
<p>Wierdways, when disguised as something, are immovable and cannot be carried around the House as a portable 'teleporter' (eg. a Wierdway disguised as a coin on the floor cannot be picked up and carried, to open the Wierdway whenever it is convenient. It is simply stuck to the floor)</p>
<p>So far, the only way revealed to close a Wierdway is the blood of a trustee. any matter inside the Wierdway when both entrances shut is destroyed or expelled</p>

<p>The Stamp Duties Act of 1783 (23 Geo.III c.67) was passed by the British Houses of Parliament in order to raise money to pay for the American War of Independence. Under the provisions of this act, all baptism, marriage and burial entries in each parish register were subject to a tax of 3d (old pence). Church ministers were empowered to collect the duty, and were allowed to keep 10% of this fee as compensation for their trouble. Refusal to pay carried a fine of five pounds.</p>
<p>This was a deeply unpopular tax, and many clergymen were sympathetic to the plight of their parishioners, and as paupers were exempt from this tax, it is not uncommon for family history researchers and genealogists to find that the number of supposed poor people within a parish has increased many times above normal during these years until the act was finally repealed in 1794. Such entries in a parish register are annotated with either the letter "P." or "Pauper". If a family could not claim excemption then it was not unusual for them simply not to bother, and this would result in a number of adult 'late' baptisms during the following decades.</p>

<p>Bioventing is an in-situ remediation technology that uses indigenous microorganisms to biodegrade organic constituents adsorbed to soils in the unsaturated zone. Soils in the capillary fringe and the saturated zone are not affected. In bioventing, the activity of the indigenous bacteria is enhanced by inducing air (or oxygen) flow into the unsaturated zone (using extraction or injection wells) and, if necessary, by adding nutrients.</p>

<p>Mariano Robles and Edouard Rostand met the Summer of 2005 at Calvi on the Rocks ( Ed's festival ). Their infinite musical thirst and several bottles of Clos Landry Rose Gris helped them starting their first project together that same night: 2midiDJs. They went to Chez Tao's toilets and Ed played some Midi files with his mobile phone while Mariano sang random improvised melodies with his deep voice. The toilet disco was born and with it the right to music to people who are bored of the boring clubbing scene. Since then they have played in the most exclusive parties including the Europe Music Awards and the MTV at the movies party in Cannes.</p>

<p>River Mirna should be the rightfull solution for border dispuite between Slovenia and Croatia. Ljubljana (Emona, Laibach,...) was through whole history the capital (cultural, political, economical, trade,...) for not just Istra (Istria), but also for the rest of Dalmacija (Dalmatia). That historical facts wants neofasist croatian nationalists ignore and have teritorial apetites (they again need "lebensraum") towards Slovenia.</p>

<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>The Establishment of UTAR began with the story of Kolej Tunku Abdul Rahman (KTAR). In 1964 the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) mooted the idea of setting up a college which was subsequently named after the first Prime Minister of Malaysia. On 15 September 1972 , YAB Dato' Hussein Onn, the then Minister of Education handed over the Instrument of Government to the College, Kolej Tunku Abdul Rahman (Tunku Abdul Rahman College)was established. On 5 July 2001, the Minister of Education, invited the MCA to establish UTAR, or upgrade the college status to university status. But however MCA choose to remain the college status and established a wholly new university entity, both institutions are distinctly different entity today. UTAR is famously known to be setup by the fund and donations mostly by Chinese community living and some prominent Chinese philanthropists in Malaysia. UTAR is allegedly to be the first Chinese Community University in Malaysia, but it remains to adopt the open-door policy to all people from different ethnic background. There were allegations that UTAR was estabished after years and years of request and controversy of establishing a university, namely Universiti Merdeka, which is for the benefit of the Chinese community living in Malaysia because of limited higher educational opportunity and to cater the more than eligible young Chinese who has a voracious interest in education.</p>
<p><b>Formation of International Advisory Council</b></p>
<p>Set to be a premier university in the future, UTAR would have to achieve global standards. To serve as a platform for international affiliations, the International Advisory Council (IAC) consisting of eminent scholars and scientists was established. With this array of distinguished scholars and scientists, UTAR has since then been working towards building a strong international base for its research programmes and courses of studies.</p>
<p><b>Location</b></p>
<p>This first campus of UTAR is located in a convenient commercial centre surrounded by residential areas in Petaling Jaya, the satellite town of the capital city of Kuala Lumpur. Today the PJ Campus has expanded to include nearby buildings and it now comprises UTAR's administrative departments, Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, Faculty of Engineering and Science, Faculty of Arts and Social Science, Institute of Postgraduate Studies and Research and the Centre for Extension Education.</p>

<p>Farpoint is a progressive rock/folk rock band from South Carolina, USA. Formed in 1997 by Kevin Jarvis and Rick Walker, Farpoint has survived numerous lineup changes and a decade of live performing, in the meantime releasing three full-length albums of melodic and symphonic progressive rock.</p>
<p>Farpoint's first recorded output was a 2-song cd single entitled "Just Like You," released in 2000. This cd was created as a part of a fundraiser for the South Carolina chapter of the Special Olympics. Two pressings of the cd sold out immediately and it is now out of print.</p>
<p>The first full-length album, <i>First Light,</i> was released in 2002. Follow up albums include <i>Grace</i> (2003) and <i>From Dreaming to Dreaming</i> (2004). As of this writing in 2006, a fourth album is underway.</p>
<p>Farpoint has always stated their mission as one to create "melodic and powerful positive music." In addition, they have always striven to have a positive influence on those around them, and in between playing clubs and festivals have continued to perform at various fundraisers for the Special Olympics, Children's Miracle Network, and even sponsored a fundraiser for the New York Fire Department after 9/11.</p>
<p>Musically the band has been called anything from prog rock to folk, with wide ranging influences and a vast arsenal of instruments including classical guitars, flute, mandolin, dulcimer and varied percussion and sound effects. Comparisons have been made to the likes of Pink Floyd, the Moody Blues, Jethro Tull and Mike Oldfield, among others.</p>

<p>The Battle of Verdun was an attempt by the Germans to break the stalemate on the western front during the first world war, and a classic example of the horrid slaughter involved in WWI battles. In 1916, German forces launched a sizeable assault on the the French-defended fortress at Verdun. Standing firm under a cry of "they shall not pass," the French managed to repel the German troops, but at the loss of about 315,000 French lives. The defeated Germans had approximately 280,000 casualties. (Under 160,000 identifiable bodies--in total--were recovered after the battle.)</p>
<p>The Battle of Verdun was significant because it was an example of German failure to sweep through France as intended in the Schlieffen plan. Also, the results of the Battle of Verdun led indirectly to a battle at the Somme (the British attacked the Germans there to relieve the pressure on Verdun, though less casualties occurred at Verdun than the Somme).</p>

<p>Archbishop Dionysios - 1919-2005</p>
<p>His Beatitude was born on August 15th, 1919 in the town of Heraklion, on the Island of Crete, in the country of Greece. He is known in the world by the surname Makogambrakis, and attended the government seminary Pytagoraia Institute in Heraklion, Crete, from 1934 to 1937. In 1937 he was tonsured a monk at the Holy Monastery of Iviron on Mount Athos. In 1940 the Monk Dionysios was ordained to the Diaconate and in March 1943 he was ordained a Priest by Metropolitan Ierotheos of Militoupoleos, Greece, at the request of the Holy Monastery of Iviron. His Eminence has studied Patrology and Theology for over 14 years.</p>
<p>During the pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Monastery of Iviron, he was assigned by the Patriarch as Superior of Saint Peter Monastery and Holy Mother's Shrine in Nazareth, Israel. By 1945, Hieromonk Dionysios was appointed a member of the ecclesiastical court under Metropolitan Isidoros. Later during the same year, he was assigned as Superior of the Monastery of Cana in Galilee and he continued to serve the Lord there until 1960. In 1960, Patriarch Benedictos reassigned him as Superior of Saint Charalambos Monastery in Jerusalem and also assigned him to serve as a priest at the Cathedral of Saint Constantine and Saint Helen in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A year later in 1961, he was appointed Superior of Holy Cross Theological School in Jerusalem. At the same time Hieromonk Dionysios studied Greek, Hebrew, Russian and English at the Hebrew University. He continued to serve the Holy Cross until July 1963 when, with the permission of Patriarch Benedictos, he returned to the Holy Monastery of Iviron on Mount Athos in order to seek permission from his Brotherhood to journey to the United States of America.</p>
<p>After receiving the blessing of the Iviron Brotherhood, Hieromonk Dionysios left for America, arriving in the second half of 1963. For the remainder of 1963 and part of 1964, he served as a Priest at Saint Markela Orthodox Church is Astoria, New York, under the Greek Bishop Petros (Astifitheso) who was in turn functioning under the administration of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1964, after coming under the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Church in America, he was assigned by Archbishop Photios, the former Metropolitan of Phatos on the Island of Cyprus as Archimandrite at Saint George Greek Orthodox Church in Lowell, Massachusetts. In 1966, Archimandrite Dionysios was transferred to the Orthodox Church of resurrection in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. While serving the body of Christ a the Church of the resurrection, he also attended English classes at Brown University.</p>
<p>Five years later, in 1971, Archimandrite Dionysios was canonically elected Bishop by the Parishes of the Greek Orthodox Church in America. On March 7, 1971, he was consecrated to the Episcopate of the orthodox Church by Bishop Andreas and Anthony. The Church of the resurrection was then raised to the status of Cathedral. His Grace continued to serve there until 1980. After serving the Lord in Pawtucket, Rhode Island for nearly fourteen years at the Resurrection Orthodox Cathedral, Bishop Dionysios raised Saint George Orthodox Church in Memphis, Tennessee, to the status of Cathedral and transferred there.</p>
<p>On January 11, 1983, Bishop Dionysios was requested to serve as Exarch for the Exarchate of the Patriarchate of Alexandria in America known there as the Diocese of New England, and the Patriarch confirmed the canonical consecration of Bishop Dionysios. On May 26, 1986, His Holiness Patriarch Nicholas The 6th gave "Autocephaly" (which means "Auto-Self", or "Independence") to his Exarchate in America and Bishop Dionysios became the first Primate of the autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>Patriarch Nicholas VI left the U.S.A. with a little gift in that he granted autocephaly to Archbishop Dionysios (the last Exarchos) so that he could continue operating throughout the world as a Greek Orthodox Church and Former Exarchate of the Patriarchate of Alexandria.</p>
<p>By granting autocephaly to Archbishop Dionysios, this made it canonically possible for Archbishop Dionysios and his successors to operate without direct interference or influence by any Patriarchate in the future. It also established a clear canonical line of Apostolic succession via Patriarch Nicholas VI and the Patriarchate of Alexandria.</p>

<p>Derek Brimstone, famous English folk singer, grew up during the Blitz on London. His music has been recorded since the fifties, with his amazing trademark sound clearly distinguishable whether he's playing the guitar or the banjo.</p>
<p>His first album, Fire and Brimstone, was destroyed by the Fontana label after only one pressing, along with all their jazz and folk catalogue when the label merged with a more pop-focussed label. Luckily, the large body of folk fans from the Orient rescued it from oblivion; Tetsuya Nakatani approached Brimstone in the early 00's with a mint edition of the vinyl LP and asked if it could be rereleased on CD. So, in 2005, Fire and Brimstone rose from the ashes, featuring such tracks as Fairy Tale Lullaby, Back In Tobago and Little Tin Men. A well-respected man with an immense fan body and a larger family (six children, twelve grandchildren and four great-grandchildren), he still tours the circuit wearing his classic hat. His spots in clubs are well-noted for his sense of humour, a blend of good music and good jokes - with the anecdotes usually at his own expense!</p>

<p>A Chopine was a sort of platform shoe, popular from 1400 on till about 1600. It was an overshoe, meaning it was worn over a more fashionable shoe, to prevent it from becoming soiled by mud, dirt or even filth that could be found in the streets of those days. Filth like human waste, which was thrown on the streets. Streets in those days had no sewage, or an open sewage, with all the consequences. Chopines were popularly worn in Venice by both courtesans and patrician women from ca. 1400-1700. Besides the practical use, the height of the Chopine would eventually be a symbolic reference to the cultural and social standing of the wearer. The heigher they were, the more the status of the owner. Women also used them to appear taller. The height of the shoes often easily exceeded 20 inches. Chopines brought with them inevitably an instable and inelegant gait. Women wearing them generally were accompanied by a servant or attendant on whom they could help balance themselves. They were usually put on with the help of two servants. The height of the shoes often easily exceeded 20 inches. The platforms itself were fashioned out of wood or cork, and covered with leather or jewel-embroidered velvet. The type of fabric covering the shoe depended on the type of shoe worn in them. In the fifteenth century, Chopines were also the style in Spain. The popularity in the Spain of that time was so great that the larger part of the cork supplies of the nation went to the production of the shoe.</p>

<p>John McLoughlin (DOB unk.) was one of two noted Port Authority police survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, and is the subject of an Oliver Stone film due to be released in 2006.</p>
<p>The Paramount project will retell the story of John McLoughlin, who will be played by Nicolas Cage, and William Jimeno. The two Port Authority police officers were rescued after being trapped in the rubble at Ground Zero. Jimeno was pulled out after 12 hours; McLoughlin came out after 22 hours.</p>
<p>"I feel someone had to tell the story of the people who were in the Trade Center before and after it collapsed," McLoughlin said in a studio statement. "It needs to be told how this horrific tragedy brought Americans and the world together to help those in need. The people involved in putting this movie together are truly making an extraordinary attempt to tell those stories and the stories of those who are no longer with us."</p>
<p>"I have all the confidence in the world that having one of the world's greatest directors - Oliver Stone, who has served his country and knows the price of freedom - this film will be one that will live on for generations to come," Jimeno said.</p>
<p>McLoughlin led a team of four officers, including Jimeno, between the two towers on the main concourse when the second plane struck. The five ran toward a freight elevator, and were buried in the ensuing collapse of the concourse. Officers Antonio Rodrigues and Chris Amoroso were killed immediately. McLoughlin, Jimeno and a third officer, Dominick Pezzulo, were trapped but alive. The freight elevator withstood the devastation, creating breathing room that saved their lives. Pezzulo managed to free himself, but another tremor caused a collapse that crushed him to death.</p>
<p>McLoughlin and Jimeno eventually were rescued when a Marine noticed the glimmer of Jimeno's handcuffs. McLoughlin was not out of the woods yet; doctors kept him in a medically induced coma for six weeks. He underwent 30 surgeries and took months to recover.</p>
<p>Four months after their rescue, McLoughlin and Jimeno - who both have since retired - took part in a ceremony at Ground Zero to watch as the final column was removed. When all the uniformed officers walked out of The Pit, the last two to be rescued were the last to leave.</p>

<p>Amena Begum, a former MP of East Pakistan was a prominent figure in the independence movement of Bangladesh. She was instrumental in campaigning all over East Pakistan for the Six Point programme of regional autonomy drafted by the Awami League, and on June 7 1966 organised the general strike along with Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury. This strike was observed throughout the then East Pakistan and was the first major indication that an independent Bangladesh was imminent.</p>

<p>Conflicting sources have given D.J.'s place of birth as Nashville or Green Hills, Tennessee. Probably, Nashville since that seems to be the popular choice. He grew up in Manchester, a small place in the middle of Tennessee and about thirty miles from the Alabama border, with four siblings. Where he grew up was the deep South.</p>
<p>"I grew up in the South. It's not some sort of segregated area, at least where I grew up. Poverty is the great social lever. I grew up in a pretty poor area." (Plante)</p>
<p>"I had the experience of being picked on as a child and I would tell people, 'You're gonna be sorry when I'm famous!' [...] I learned after they kicked the stuffing out [of] me that you don't say that out loud." (Head)</p>
<p>When D.J. was fourteen he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, a malignant form of cancer. He was sick and he had major surgery and treatment for two years. He had his spleen removed, though, so he'd be prone to certain kinds of infections today because the spleen is a major organ in cleaning and filtering the blood. D.J. survived after multiple surgeries, as well as chemotherapy and radiation treatments.</p>
<p>"I know that it happened to me, but it's almost like it happened to someone else. Like I know all about it, but I don't really feel the residual effects of it. Except for the fact that I'm extremely thin. And that's something that I probably will always be because the chemotherapy sped up my metabolism like crazy." (Head)</p>
<p><br />
Once D.J. had survived he believed there was something bigger and better out there for him. When he was little D.J. went to Camp Hope, put on by the American Cancer Society for children with cancer. As an adult and a cancer research and awareness advocate D.J. volunteers there as a counselor.</p>
<p>In the town where D.J. was born the two main industries were casket making and pajama making. He worked in a factory for a summer. After graduating from Coffee County Central High School in 1995 D.J. was desperate to get out of Tennessee,</p>
<p>"I just wanted to get out of there so much because it couldn't offer me what I wanted out of life. There was so many things that I wanted for myself and I couldn't get it there," (Head).</p>
<p>D.J. took off for a foriegn country where he didn't have to learn a new language. He ended up at The University of London at King's College studying English language and literature. He eventually returned to Tennessee, after nearly three years. At first he worked as a paralegal in 1997 and began studying at Belmont University in Nashville. That's law school; Qualls is academically talented as well as artistically gifted. He was an extra in the HBO movie "Against the Wall" in 1994. He got the small role of Jason in the television miniseries Mama Flora's Family (1998), which he helped produce, while participating in Community Theater. Until his first feature film, D.J. was not paid. After auditioning for a one liner in Road Trip (2000) destiny took over, and he was asked to come from the Atlanta office to meet producer Ivan Reitman in Beverly Hills. He made his debut in that movie as a lead character, the shy virgin Kyle Edwards. While filming Road Trip D.J. found an abandoned little dog (sooo cuuute!) that's his now. After the movie was released D.J. was afraid people would think he was a dork, because he played a dork in the movie.</p>
<p>After that he started doing a lot of work. He modeled for Prada for a while. Photographers David LaChapelle and Steve Klein liked his look and meeting them soon had him doing print modeling work. He was in some of the top fashion and lifestyle magazines, which got him exposure and money to help with student loans. D.J. didn't like modeling, though,</p>
<p>"In the modeling world people will just say anything right to your face and what do you do? I hated it." (Tribute)</p>
<p>Cherry Falls (2000) came next, where he played another virgin named Wally. In 2001 he played Neil Lawrence in Chasing Holden.</p>
<p>In 2002 he appeared as Archie in Comic Book Villains (he co-produced this movie as well), Josh in the episode My Student of "Scrubs", he was Andrew in the movie Big Trouble, Junior in the Lone Star State of Mind movie, and he was the main character Dizzy Harrison (Gil Harris) in The New Guy where he got to kiss Eliza Dushku. The New Guy was actually written for him.</p>
<p>"[...] when you are in every scene, it means that you have to work every day," D.J. told Tribute’s Bonnie Laufer, "It means that you get four hours sleep every night for three months."</p>
<p>On a more personal note, when asked if he ever wants to have children D.J. has said that he doesn't want to pass on his genetics (because he had cancer once and he thinks he could possibly give a cancer causing gene to his children), but he wouldn't mind adopting.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-28_79e6.html" title="Edit section: [ [ Lindi St.Clair Miss Whiplash ] ]">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">[ [ Lindi St.Clair Miss Whiplash ] ]</span></h2>
<p>Lindi St.Clair was well known in the 1970's thru 1990's as a British madam, vice queen, prostitute and dominatrix.</p>
<p>Her real name is Marian June Akin. She was born at Hackney Hospital in East London on 12th August 1952. She is an eastender cockney from working class stock. Her father had various factory jobs, her mother was a seamstress. Her grandfathers were a publican and a milkman. As a small child she lived at 88 Mabley Street, Hackney, London E9, on the edge of the Hackney marshes (this house is now knocked down and re-built over). She spent holidays at her grandma's house at 19 Grosvenor Rise East, Walthamstow, London E17 (also now knocked down and re-built over).</p>
<p>Her parents left London in the mid 1950's and settled in Swindon, Wiltshire, at 275 Kingswood Avenue, Park North. This was a newly built three bedroom terraced house on a council estate. (It’s still there). She went to Walcot East Junior School, then Jennings Street Junior School, (now demolished), then Park Senior High School.</p>
<p>As a teenager she abandoned her real name and made up new, more glamorous names, and she ran away from home and hitch hiked to London where she ived in squats around the streets of Soho and Covent Garden. She was a beatnick, a mod, a rocker, a biker, then a hanger-on of Hell's Angels. She was never a drinker, smoker, drug user, gambler, or into cosmetics or fashion, so she was able to save most of the money she earned from selling sexual favours to kerb crawlers and truckers.</p>
<p>By the time she reached 23 (in 1974) she had saved enough money to buy her own freehold property for £17.500 in cash. This was a large end of terrace house at 58 Eardley Crescent, Earls court. London SW5 9JZ. (It's still there). She turned it into a lavish fully equipped fetish emporium and bordello and catered for all manner of sexual predilections, in particular, sado-masochism, spankings, bondage and cross-dressing.</p>
<p>She invented the name of Lindi St.Clair. She chose the name Lindi after a school friend whom she had a crush on, and she chose the surname, St.Clair, after the heroine in the novel 'Forever Amber'. Lindi ran her establishment from 1974 to 1992. It was frequented by MPs, lords, aristocrats and influential affluent business men. She was arrested three times for running a brothel. Twice she was convicted, once she was aquitted.</p>
<p>She took the trade name of 'Miss Whiplash' from a character in the movie 'The Killing of Sister George' staring Beryl Reid and Susannah York.</p>
<p>She invented a 'straight name' for herself, this being 'Carla Davis', to be used on official documents and to allow her to lead an ordinary persona away from her outrageous sexual services persona. She chose the christian name of 'Carla' from the character 'Carla Brown' played by her favourite actress at the time who was Nicolla Paggett (who played Miss Lizzie in the 1970's TV series Upstairs Downstairs). She chose the surname 'Davis' from a telephone directory because she wanted something plain and simple that was easy to spell.</p>
<p>Her political clients encouraged her to stand for parliament and call for legal brothels and the decriminalisation of prostitution. They were too scared to call for it themselves. In 1989, with help from political clients, she founded a fringe political party called The Corrective Party. As leader of the party, from 1989 to 1993 she stood for eleven elections (this was nine Parliamentary by-elections, one Euro election, and one council election).</p>
<p>Lindi's popularity at work made her very wealthy and enabled her to travel the world many times, buy a boat, a light aircraft, numerous luxury cars, diamonds, minks, and several houses. She appeared on TV chat shows and was often in the newspapers. One broadsheet described her as 'living like Hugh Heffner'. She came to the notice of the Inland Revenue and around 1989 they sent her a tax bill for £250,000. She could have easily paid this sum, but she chose to be deliberately awkward just to see if the British Government would actually bankrupt a prostitute for taxation on immoral earnings.</p>
<p>In 1990 the case went to the Court of Appeal and to the House of Lords. It set a legal precedent. Since then, many students of law and accountancy have used her case in their studies. In 1993 Lindi was declared bankrupt under the name of Marion Aken.(The authorities misspelt her name and Lindi decided not to correct them).</p>
<p>At the age of 41 Lindi was left pennyless which was a huge shock after having been so very wealthy. With the help of a kind friend who was a mortgage broker, she purchased a small freehold mid terraced house at 116 Eastcombe Avenue, Charlton, London, SE77LW, where she provided small scale prostitution and dominatrix services from 1993 to 2000.</p>
<p>As a bankrupt she was automatically barred from standing for Parliament, so she temporarily withdrew from politics and thereafter The Corrective Party laid dormant.</p>
<p>In 1992 her autobiography 'It's Only a Game' was published by Piatkus Books in London. At the time, due to her own silly fault, Lindi found herself on bad terms with the media which resulted in her book recieving bad press or no press at all which was a disappointment to her because she had hoped the book would be turned into a movie.</p>
<p>In January 1993 Lindi hit the headlines when her rented Jaguar car was found allegedly abandoned on the cliff tops at the notrious suicide spot 'Beachy Head' in Eastbourne, East Sussex. She was reportedly missing, possibly abduction or murder or suicide. There was a huge police hunt. Lindi was discovered one week later aboard the P&amp;O passenger liner SS Canberra where she was enjoying a luxury world cruise and travelling under her 'straight' name of Carla Davis.</p>
<p>In 1994 Lindi fell out with her next-door neighbours, one of which was her ex-lesbian lover. (Lindi is bisexual). Much bitter and twisted tit-for-tat sabotage occurred between the two houses culminating with Lindi being framed. On 30th October 1995 the neighbours told Greenwich police that Lindi had threatened them with a gun. At 1am that night armed police kicked down Lindi's front door and entered her bedroom and forced her out of bed and took her to Greenwich police station where she spent three days in a cell before being sent to Holloway Prison for another two days until she was able to find a bail address.</p>
<p>On November 5th 1999 Lindi asked one of her wealthy clients to help her. He was Marion Wells (formerly Maurice Brightwell) a 74 year old male-to-female transsexual. He gladly offered Lindi his detached seafront house as her bail address. This was at 9 Galveston Road, Sovereign Harbour, Eastbourne, East Sussex. BN23 5RH. A few weeks later, in December 1995, Lindi, aged 43, married Marion, aged 74, at Eastbourne's Registry Office. (Lindi married in her 'straight' name of Carla Davis). The Sunday People tabloid newspaper were tipped off by jelaous rivals and two reporters gate crashed the wedding. Lindi agreed to let them witness the ceremony and take exclusive pictures in return for them footing the bill for their celebration meal afterwards at a local Chineese restaurant. The newspaper reported "Miss Whiplash marries a woman".</p>
<p>In June 1995 Lindi stood trial (under her 'straight' name of Carla Davis) at Woolwich Crown Court in south east London for the alleged gun crime. She was found not guilty by a 10 to 2 majority verdict. She was awarded costs.</p>
<p>Lindi's husband, Marion Wells, went senile. Their marriage was annulled in February 1999. In April 2000 Greenwich social services put Marion into care and refused to let him and Lindi see each other. In January 2001, whilst in care, Marion died of a head injury.</p>
<p>In April 1999 Lindi married Dean Shelley who was two years younger than her. He was a notorious mercenary soldier, formerly with Special Forces, 44 Para Pathfinder Recce Troop, in the Rhodesian Army. He wanted to live near his friends at the SAS base in Hereford, so he persuaded Lindi to sell her seafront detached house in Eastbourne and buy a farm in Herefordshire. They moved to the village of Risbury, where Lindi unexpectedly became interested in ducks, geese,poultry and rabbits, much to her husband's bemusement. They divorced in 2001, but remain good friends.</p>
<p>From 2002 onwards Lindi's interest in avian husbandry increased. She registered herself as a poultry farmer and egg producer. At the time of writing (2006) she currently divides her time between poultry farming and sexual services.</p>
