<li>I do not know the proper place to put this:
<p>I thought that wikipedia was a good source for information. Unfortunatley it has come to my attention that it is only meant to benefit the rich and sucessful. The band The Frantix are a large part of the Long Island punk scene ask any local punker who they are and they will tell you!The punk scene is one which prides itself on an "Do It Yourself" mentality. By meeting with the wikipedia standards of a musician/band they are not punk anymore (major record labels or extreme sucess) because that independent factor is lost. If you are going to delete the wikipedia page about the frantix then you might as well delete any page that has the words punk rock or hardcore because in essence having them up goes against your "standards". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.45.255.135 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.45.255.135.html" title="User talk:24.45.255.135">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.45.255.135_e891.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.45.255.135">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>We have <a href="../../../p/u/n/Category%7EPunk_rock_groups_d6f1.html" title="Category:Punk rock groups">plenty of articles about punk bands</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Category%7EHardcore_punk_groups_15d9.html" title="Category:Hardcore punk groups">almost as many about hardcore</a>. The CDs don't have to be a major-label release; it can be on "...<i>one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)</i>." Obviously your mutually-exclusive standard of what constitutes a notable band on Wikipedia and what constitutes a punk band is not shared.<br />

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE!</b>"...a true punk couldn't care less about having Wikipedia article." A true punk stands up for what they believe in. A fan of ours created the page because he enjoys our music and feels we are just as important as bigger acts.Anybody with common sense knows that having an album released doesnt mean a thing the band leftover crack(who is on wikipedia)have amazing recordings but are the worst musicians i have ever seen live.Ashlee Simpson was caught lip synching on television yet she deserves to be called a musician? I reall could care less if you delete the thing but I'm not about to just say thanks but oh fucking well to someone who took their own time out to do something so generous for the members of my band and I.Besides all of you "wikipedians" have your own little waste of space when you click on your name and I have a feeling nobody even likes any of you. We HAVE fans and yet you will still deny this page. HAH. I remember when wikipedia wasnt a dictatorship! Believe me I know you arn't judging our music. But I believe as a long time wikipedia user that maybe I should be listened to. With out the people using this site you are nothing yet you will delete this and spend so much time doing so, when there is a bunch of meaningless garbage to delete.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.45.255.135 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.45.255.135.html" title="User talk:24.45.255.135">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.45.255.135_e891.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.45.255.135">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>"A true punk stands up for what they believe in" ... so true punks believe in shameless self-promotion? Seriously, what gets an act's article kept has <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">nothing to do with any judgement as to the quality of their music</a> — if it did, we'd not have <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_XIV_fb73.html" title="Napoleon XIV">Napoleon XIV</a> — and everything to do with whether a sufficient number of people have heard of them.

The best proxies for that are over at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.<br />
Now, if you are asserting that your band, despite not having any but self-released CDs, meets the requirements above, simply stating it does is not "end of discussion". <i>The article must have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a></i> for those claims.<br />

<li>If you would take the time to look it up and not be so close minded and full/sure of yourself you would come across it very easily. I bet you haven't even looked. They were on tri-state area Warped Tour which only lists major-record label bands. They are on the 2006 Bloody Solution tour. It's your job to look these things up so either take my word for it or get on it already. Reliable sources indicating prominant representitive status? Try looking on general TriState area alternitive music websites sites (punk/hardcore). Here's one to start with though: www.lipunx.com, that's all I'm going to help you with though. They are practically taking over the music scene while you're sitting here telling me I'm wrong. I've justified the reason for this band to be up here. If you are going to be bitter and make claims you aren't even looking into or won't further back up then Wikipedia is proven no different from a conservatie, stubborn, right-wing facist cult.

<li>The page you are talking about begins "User:".

<li>To clarify this a little bit, Po, our user pages here are not quite vanity pages or MySpaces.

The burden is on the authors/editors of the page to provide evidence/sources/citations. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 06:25, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not an administrator for this website. I signed up to create pages I felt should be here and that's why I made a page for this band for they have made a big imprint on the alternitive music scene of the tri-state area. I have also supplied proof in the previous posts that you so frequenlty ignore. I told you what major tours they were on (YES WITH NOTABLE BANDS). That should be enough. I gave you the name of the tours. It's your job to go look it up not mine. It's not my website.Shuz 01:36, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As said above, it <i>is</i> your job. If you know these things as you say you do you would have put them in the article to begin with. Would it be that hard to put the links here? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 02:13, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>You said they were on the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warped_Tour_b64d.html" title="Warped Tour">Warped Tour</a> ... which year? I decided to take your word for it and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+Frantix%22%2BWarped&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+Frantix%22%2BWarped&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">search</a>. I found some Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands Pages <a href="http://battle.ernieball.com/battlebak/bb9/bands/thefrantix/" class="external autonumber" title="http://battle.ernieball.com/battlebak/bb9/bands/thefrantix/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. But most of the links mentioning it were myspaces, which are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. And consider that the Warped Tour often has about 100 bands per show. Did the Frantix play each and every show of that year's Warped Tour? I note they're not on the list of 2006 Warped Tour bands at our own article, nor on the list of bands at <a href="http://www.warpedtour.net/bands.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.warpedtour.net/bands.asp" rel="nofollow">the unofficial Warped Tour page</a>.This is not auguring well for notability. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 02:55, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Now, as for Bloody Solution: I got all of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bloody+Solution%22%2Btour&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bloody+Solution%22%2Btour&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">three relevant Google hits</a>. One is a myspace for the 8/24 show.<a href="http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=music.showDetails&amp;Band_Show_ID=6653967&amp;friendid=43502522" class="external autonumber" title="http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=music.showDetails&amp;Band_Show_ID=6653967&amp;friendid=43502522" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Another is the main website for this tour. <a href="http://www.thescarred.com/tourdates.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thescarred.com/tourdates.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I don't see any mention of the Frantix as playing any shows other than the Amityville one we already know about. The other is one posted by the band themselves (or was it a fan, too?) at punx.org.<a href="http://punx.org/events/?action=view_event&amp;id=8" class="external autonumber" title="http://punx.org/events/?action=view_event&amp;id=8" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.<br />
I am having real trouble accepting this as a major tour, especially since headliners The Scarred do not appear to be notable, either.<br />
Oh, and I really like that <a href="http://punx.org/TheFrantix" class="external text" title="http://punx.org/TheFrantix" rel="nofollow">user profile</a> at punx. But I hope I read that age right. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 03:32, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
