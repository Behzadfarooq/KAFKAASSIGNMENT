<li><b>Comment</b>: I think it's notable, it gets 61,600 google hits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22british+racing+green%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22british+racing+green%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and it's associated with a period in racing history.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Expand</b>. British racing green was a notable colour used by British racing car drivers and teams. For example, Jaguar in last year's F1 season. It was used as far back as the 1950's by drivers such as <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stirling_Moss_6a3a.html" title="Stirling Moss">Stirling Moss</a>. Needs to be expanded. If time permits, I'll have a go at it myself.<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:11, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Now that it is expanded, I agree that there is sufficient for a Wikipedia article. Will delist from VFD unless there are any other strong objections. <a href="../../../j/c/s/User%7EJcsutton_5df4.html" title="User:Jcsutton">Jcsutton</a> 11:55, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> after the cleanup into a good stub indicating the color's origins and significance. BRG is the single most "historically significant" color in the history of motorsports. The only color that has similar power to inspire emotion in millions of fans is Petty blue. (But there are tens of thousands of fans of pavement modifieds on eastern USA ovals who feel the same way about Richie Evans orange. Evans orange matches the paint code used by the New York State DMV in the mid-1960s when he was getting started on a near-zero budget.) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:39, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, that page says, "© Copyright 2004, Departamento de Engenharia de Minas. Cópia literal e distribuição desta página na íntegra são permitidas em qualquer meio, desde que este aviso seja preservado," which I believe means that we could copy the page, as long as we preserve their copyright notice.

<li>As I said: the problem is, that it doesn't say anything about derived work, and once it's in Wikipedia, we have to be free to modify it. I think we should just delete it and if someone wants to do the topic they should start from an unencumbered text. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:54, Feb 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> that <b>redirect</b> is the right answer for this article. I reserve judgment on whether the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_LaFon_Gore_54f5.html" title="Pauline LaFon Gore">main article</a> is encyclopedic. So far, the closest to encyclopedic content even there is "wife of a Senator and mother of a VP" - but it is marked as a stub so we should give it the benefit of the doubt for now. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:09, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have added to the Pauline LaFon Gore article substantially.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article to which this is now redirected should be deleted also. Although now long and detailed, the article doesn't say anything different than that she was a political wife and mother, had some influence on husband and son, and was the managing partner of a Washington law firm that she founded with her husband when he was defeated in 1970.

<p><i>Pamela Rogers Turner (born 1977) is a teacher from Tennessee who was arrested, on 2005-02-08 and charged with fifteen counts of of sexual battery by an authoritive figure and thirteen counts of statutory rape. Rogers Turner had allegedly been having sex with a thirteen year old student....</i> At this point, just <i>allegedly</i> so; and, I hope, presumed innocent until proven guilty. "Wikipedia should not offer news reports on breaking stories.... Wikipedia does have many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news" (says <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_general_knowledge_base" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_general_knowledge_base</a>); even if these allegations were to be proven in court, statutory rape committed by somebody otherwise unknown would not be a topic of historical significance.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The local "Eyewitness News" (etc) shows think this sort of thing is notable, and will report something like this even if it occured in the next state. If nothing sensational happened locally, make that several states over. That doesn't make it notable, even if the woman is found guilty.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This story is making international headlines. It isn't a local story anymore and therefore it is notable.

<li><b>keep</b>: Appologies if This comment is uncalled for, or if I do not get to have a say in things (I'm new to wikipedia ... there is a fair amount to read; expect this comment to be deleted if I don't actually get a vote or something if I find time to read through it all), but Sean is hardly just "a DJ/commentator." Thereis the entire KULT chapter of his life(albeit over) to consider. This must be weighed in; this man had a good deal of very radical people following his every word. But hey, come to the right conclusion; There is no doubt that Sean made an impact in the world, and the lives of thousands if not tens of thousands of people. I don't have any doubt in my mind that Sean's activity in some ways have been notable (being _the_ inspiring force in a lot of musicians, performing at clubs, organizing group after group, whatever); the hard part is seperating what happened with KULT with what sean is directly responsible for. Is this enough to justify a wikipedia article? Hard to say; but If my say counts, I'd err on the side of yes. I agree with Ashley Pomeroy, he was a quasi-Moussolini-type and this article likely needs work. And is the picture really neccesary? Perhaps if the picture was removed, those who feel that he is not popular enough, or whatever, can feel more at ease that he's getting less of the spotlight.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemusicgod1_6866.html" title="User:Themusicgod1">themusicgod1</a> 1:57:21 21 Feb 2005 (???)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Rantradio is an internet radio site based in Langley British Columbia that has been online since 1999. It broadcasts three channels. They seem to have received a fair amount of publicity, judging from theGoogle hits. But according to Alexa, www,rantradio.com has a rank of 582,000, which isn't very impressive. How do you tell if an internet radio station or one of its DJ's is notable? There are a lot of them now. Arbitron does rankings of Internet radio stations, but Rantradio isn't ranked. Internet radio is a notable development, of course, and maybe a particular station is notable even with low traffic if it is a trailblazer, etc. But I'm not sure that would extend to one of its DJ's. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Klipper, this isn't a discussion about whether Sean or rantradio are entertaining; no doubt some people think they are. It is about whether the website or its talent are notable. I spent quite a long time last night trying to understand how one would determine whether an Internet radio channel, or its on-air talent, were notable, and it seems to be very hard. Arbitron and a couple of other similar services are doing ratings of audio streams on the internet, similar to their ratings of conventional radio stations. According to Arbitron, the Top 15 networks twelve months ago included AOLRadio Network, Yahoo!'s Launchcast,MSN Radio, Virgin Radio, and several regular radio stations that stream their content on the internet. Rankradio was not in the list; so who knows what its listenership is? Even the 15th on the Arbitron list had only 38,000 listener-hours during the measured week. Rantradio also didn't make it onto the list of the Top 20 stations that was released by Webcast Metrics. On the Webcast Metrics, the 20th ranked station, only had a daily CUME of 11,485, meaning that only 11,485 unique IP's were recorded as listening for at least 5 minutes during the measured day. Since being 20th on this list isn't too impressive in absolute terms, one has to wonder about the notability of a station that isn't even on the list. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:51, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry, I don't understand the point of your analogy. If you would like to suggest some other criterion according to which internet radio stations and their talent might be deemed notable, please go ahead. Are you trying to say that the station and its primary DJ are notable because they are notably inventive and innovative? That might be so, but it would have to be demonstrated that they were inventive and innovative and not just by the say-so of some Wikipedia editor. There would have to be citable sources that stated this, and I don't think I would accept if it was just their own bragging. Being innovative in secret wouldn't count either; for one thing, I would want to know if it is so secret, how do you know about it? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:09, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While some of the <i>Radio sites</i> you refere to here may have more listeners than RantRadio, I think you're forgetting that Mr. Kennedy is involved not only with RantRadio but also with Rantmedia as a whole. There is a community affixed to RantMedia, this includes not only the listeners, but also people who download the episodes and read the forum and books. Along with a couple of other personalities Mr. Kennedy is one of the kingpins. As stated above, the Rant* comunity has been there since 1999 and we are not talking about a couple of friends listening to a radio station someone they know started, we are talking about people from all over the world who are listening, reading, and viewing what Sean Kennedy has produced. And people are really inspired by Mr. Kennedy, if you do not believe me, then read the forum (e.g. the Patrolling Forum on RantRadio). I do not see why this entry should be deleted at all. It is obvious that stations like AOLRadio Network, Yahoo!'s Launchcast,MSN Radio and Virgin Radio are used by a greater audience than RantRadio, they have the money to do the advertising and people know they're there because of this. How could one prove that Sean Kennedy is a great inspiration to those who listen to him? Well, we could cite the mails he gets from people in NewsReal, we could qoute what the users of the forum says or even tjek the IRC-Channel, but would that be enough? If Wikipedia had been aroung while Edgar Allan Poe lived then the same arguments for deletion could have been applied if he had had an entry. I tjekked what the entry about Sean Kennedy said and it matched with what can be found on RantMedia, so if the entry isn't fake, why should it be removed? I thought the idea was to type in what you wanted to know something about and then you would get the entries for that search word. --FRUGT.O5 17:18, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, and if rantmedia is the many-tentacled empire behind rantradio.com, and it is actually the fount of notability for Sean Kennedy, how come its website www.rantmedia.com has an Alexa rank of 4 million and www.rantmedia.ca an Alexa rank of 2 million? My wife's website where we put up the artwork of our five-year old daughter and family pictures has an Alexa rank of 1,028,539, so these ranks are ultra-pathetic. I've never actually seen an Alexa rank that low before.

<li>it means the web site and its talent doesn't have any audience to speak of, which is rather consequential for a radio station or a talk show host. You have intimated that their might be some other basis for notability, and I asked you to explain your reasoning, but you haven't. Make your case, man.</li>

<li>Notability shouldn't be determined by what the editors of Wikipedia who vote in VfD think of the guy. It is determined by whether he has beome sufficiently notable that people are going to expect to find him the subject of an encyclopedia article. By the way, 1000 people on a forum site is not very impressive. And an Alexa rank of 582,000 suggests that it is not very busy. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:42, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It concerns me the number of people on here citing the lack of Alexa Rank. Have any of you actually seen how these ranks are generated? According to thier own site <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/exec/faqsidos/help/index.html?index=1" class="external text" title="http://pages.alexa.com/exec/faqsidos/help/index.html?index=1" rel="nofollow">www.alexa.com</a> "Alexa's traffic rankings are based on the usage patterns of Alexa Toolbar users over a rolling 3 month period" So to put that much fait in a bunch of Alexa Toolbar users choice in webpages is neglegent and irresponsable. A more (although arguable still not 100% accurate and notoriously out of date) way to judge popularity would be google's pagerank. However it does not rely on a toolbar to gather it's information. You "Could" sumply use the argument that an intelligent audience does not use toolbars. All in all Alexa rank is in no way a good measure of popularity let alone a measure of relevency --CMoZ 03:27, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Alexa is widely cited as a way of determining the notability of web sites; but it does have problems. The rankings are based on data gathered from the few million people who have installed the Alexa toolbar, and if a website's visitors for some reason were under- (or over-) represented among Alexa toolbar users, its rank could be mis-stated. That said, if you think Alexa data isn't accurate for rantradio.com, the burden is on you to cite some other evidence that the site has notable traffic. It is one thing to question quantitiative indicators like Alexa, but I don't see CMoZ providing any quantitative data. By the way, an Alexa of 580,000 is very low. The Alexa data would have to be wrong by an order of magnitude or even two orders of magnitude, just to get rantradio.com into the ballpark. Intimating that rantradio is underrepresented because its visitors are smart and Alexa toolbar users are stupid is not going to cut it. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:16, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: i agree that Alexa is an <i>extremely</i> poor way to judge a website's popularity! how many of the people on the internet use Alexa? i don't have the humble privilage of using Alexa due to my use of Linux and Firefox. as far as i know, only IE users are vulnerable to Alexa, and more and more people are switching over to the light side of the internet (using Firefox). if you're all so hell-bent on rating web sites' popularity, try google... i'd bet you a million that more people have heard of google than they have alexa! --<a href="../../../k/l/i/User%7EKlipper_5df6.html" title="User:Klipper">Klipper</a> 17:10, 2005 Feb 17 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: not only is Alexa an extremely poor way to judge a web personality's popularity, but it would be an even worse way to judge Sean Kennedy; the two groups "people who follow Sean Kennedy" and "people who use Alexa" are very likely mutually exclusive, if not violently so. The people effected by the people who follow Sean Kennedy may not be so mutually exclusive, but the point still stands.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemusicgod1_6866.html" title="User:Themusicgod1">themusicgod1</a> 8:32ish 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: here is what I can see the google hits. The first two hits are the rantradio website itself. The next hit looks like a blog created by someone involved with rantradio. The next hit is for a user on deviantart named "rantradio", who is probably also involved with rantradio. The next one is some place selling t-shirts for rantradio, i.e. an affiliate of rantradio. Then there are couple related to rantradio meetups. On the subsequent pages, one has wikipedia and its mirrors due to the article here for rantradio. A lot of them are just quick mentions of rant radio in articles about internet radio, where a lot of other stations are also mentioned, and generally other stations get more prominence. And so it goes: it looks to me like these google links are just the result of intense self-promotion since 1999. Google Groups, which is a more stable indicator for Internet topics has only 42 hits, by the way. I can see why you want to discount all other indicators of notability except for google, but do you actually have anything to establish notability aside from google-spamming? How many listeners does the station have? How many listener-hours per week? How big is the Sean Kennedy audience? I find it very telling that you either don't know these numbers, or refuse after repeated requests to provide them. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:01, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: Sean has just recently come back from an invitaion to speak at the Adirondack Community College in New York, he has spoken at a few DEFCONs and has been invited to the next one, he has had major media coverage, there is a growing community of support for Rant Media, the Alexia popularity contest argument has been overcome, it is not self-promotion as there are obviously others who would keep it (as well as he did not create the article), and the photo was used as it is the most recent. It should not matter how many pages a person has edited under the current username, as I thought from editing many articles that it could be done anonymously, and before it is posted, this is the first document I have edited under this username. I have only done so for this article as I want to be able to watch the page and recieve an email if I am replied to. As for Google Groups, unless they completely changed everything about it in version 2, I thought that it was a way for people to search newsgroups as a whole. So I would want to know how many people use usenet regularly, I would exclude of course *.bin.*, and company use of newsgroups (such as Microsoft), as these are there for specific reasons that would have nothing to do with popularity. I would be for another request for deletion if Rant Media became defunct, or if Sean Kennedy quit the show as then any relevance would not matter.Just my two cents on the issue.-- &lt;+=<a href="../../../j/i/j/User%7EJijinmachina_0104.html" title="User:Jijinmachina">Jijinmachina</a> 20:06, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: The general ettiquette is to show your desire to remove the nomination by striking through your comments above (using &lt;s&gt;text&lt;/s&gt;). Removing the VfD tag early is severely frowned upon. Too often, it is a tactic used by vandals to try to disrupt the process. At the end of the 5 day discussion period, the nomination will go through the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion process</a>. If the consensus is still an overwhelming "keep" at that point, anyone (including you) can follow the process to close the discussion and remove the tag. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 20:59, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Reddiar is clearly a caste or sub-caste (listed as caste on Caste Information, which links here-- sorry, should be <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">Caste</a>). As such it warrants an entry. Hopefully someone will eventual write a worthy article. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 16:33, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, Google mainly turns up that it's an oft-used last name (of the prime minster of <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madras.html" title="Madras">Madras</a>, among others).

<li><b>Keep</b>.

It's somewhat analogous to early English surnames that derived from professions, like Smith, Baker and Carpenter. (Caste is fundamentally just a record of what profession your ancestors indulged in). That aside, the article really needs to be rewritten by someone who knows <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil.html" title="Tamil">Tamil</a> <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">castes</a> well.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is perfectly legit, even if stubby (I have marked it as such). There are many French, German and other language sites on the web on the subject.

<li>Needs to be rewritten from scratch as there's really nothing here, which is a little more than just a "cleanup". Right now it defines Yeniche as "a group of German travellers". By that definition when <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraftwerk.html" title="Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a> go on tour they become "Yeniche", which I don't think is accurate. When nothing is better than what's currently in the article, to me that's a <b>delete</b> rather than a cleanup. Vote will change if it's improved to a keepable state before deletion. I'd try to fix it myself, but google only gets me hits that say its an obscure language in Germany. I think the Yeniche people are defined solely by the language, as far as I can tell. Maybe some linguist or something can write a real article here. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:41, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The Jenisch/Yeniche are the third largest group of "Gypsies" in Europe, ranging through Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and parts of France (hence German Travelers). They are linguistically and culturally distinct from other "Gypsy" groups, and one sometimes encounters statements that they are not "Gypsies". It is a notable group and merit an article. Their history in Switzerland is particularly interesting since there allegedly was a concerted effort up until the 1970's by groups funded by the Swiss government to put members of the Jenisch into mental institutions and to force the children into adoption, in an effort basically to destroy the group. The Swiss government eventually apologized for these actions. The article is sub-stubby at present, and I normally vote to delete sub-stubs. I wouldn't blame anyone for voting that way on this article, but if it is retained I commit to expanding it within the next few days. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:03, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I just remembered that I have a book on the Gypsies that I started reading a while back and never picked up again. It actually has a couple pages on the Yeniche, so I have some information I can add, once I do a bit more reading for context. I won't change my vote until improvements are actually made, though, by myself or BM or whomever. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 02:39, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Google is deceptive on this one. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Testmagic&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=e&amp;as_sitesearch=Testmagic.com&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Testmagic&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=e&amp;as_sitesearch=Testmagic.com&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">google search</a> on "testmagic" but excluding returns from their own domain reduces the number of hits from 50,000 to 8,360. Scanning the first few pages of hits, most are advertisements that redirect to their domain, link pages or blogs. Digging deeper - According to <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/testmagic.pdf" class="external text" title="https://www.google.com/adsense/testmagic.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a>, it is a for-profit company generating revenues by advertising. <a href="http://premium.hoovers.com/subscribe/ext/dnb/factsheet.xhtml?HD=830839432" class="external text" title="http://premium.hoovers.com/subscribe/ext/dnb/factsheet.xhtml?HD=830839432" rel="nofollow">Hoovers'</a> reports that they generated a mere $430,000 revenues and have only 15 employees. That size does not rise to the level normally expected for inclusion of other companies. Since size did not establish notability, I started looking for other indicators. None of the reviews I found described their offerings as particularly innovative or influential.

<p>Sent via: Via Electronic Delivery Re: Demand to Cease and Desist and Retract Libel</p>
<p>December 19, 2005</p>
<p><br />
Dear Wikimedia Foundation Inc:</p>
<p>This agency represents Nico Demonte and we have been asked to write this letter to you. Many of your statements about Nico Demonte in your web and e-mail postings are untrue and defamatory. You made them maliciously to injure Nico Demonte in his trade, office and profession. As such, they are defamatory per se. Under O.C.G.A. 51-5-11, this letter constitutes a demand for immediate retraction in writing of these false and libelous statements. In accordance with O.C.G.A 51-5-11(b)(1)(C), Nico Demonte demands that your retraction and correction be accompanied by an editorial in which you specifically repudiated your libelous statements.</p>
<p>As you neither asked for nor received permission to use his biography, as the basis for Nico Demonte’s trade, office, or profession, nor to make or distribute copies, including electronic copies, of same, I believe you have willfully infringed upon Nico Demonte's rights under 17 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. and could be liable for statutory damages as high as $150,000 as set forth in Section 504(c)(2) therein.</p>
<p>Your web postings and conduct also constitute tortuous interference with the business and contractual relations of Nico Demonte. As such, they are actionable and expose you to the imposition of compensatory as well as punitive damages.</p>
<p>Below, we have noted some of the more patent, malicious, and libelous comments made by you, Wikipedia’s members, editors, and your representatives in your e-mails; some of them also evidence your tortuous interference. If Nico Demonte is forced to file suit to stop your wrongful conduct, he will also seek an award of his attorney fees and litigation expenses.</p>
<p><br />
1. In your postings, – you and/or your editors have stated that Nico Demonte is a Non-notable artist. This is patently false.</p>
<p>2. In your postings, you consistently and falsely stated Nico Demonte "added a lot of his stuff there." Your comments about this are false and malicious.</p>
<p>3. On the subject of Nico Demonte's biography you stated that "I thought that, the way it looks like it could even be copyright violation." Your malicious attempt to interfere with Nico Demonte's business and contractual relations with Astley PR has damaged Nico Demonte for which you are liable in damages.</p>
<p>4. You incorrectly stated and inferred that Nico Demonte's is responsible for so-called "Vandalism" on Wikipedia's website. This is patently false.</p>
<p>5. In one of your postings, you referenced an article on Nico Demonte and claim with no basis in fact that it is similar to Nico Demonte’s biography on Discomusic.com. Your comments about this are false and malicious.</p>
<p>6. In a web posting you stated: "For Nico Demonte, however, he added a lot of his stuff there, without Wiki formatting or anything, just like we saw already. I thought that, the way it looks like it could even be copyright violation, and well, looks like it really is. That text comes straight from this page, and as you can see in the bottom, the content is indeed copyrighted. Now unless he is Bernard F. Lopez himself, it is a violation." Your contact with Nico Demonte constitutes tortuous interference in Nico Demonte relations and contract with Astley PR. There is no basis in fact for your malicious comments. This is patently false.</p>
<p>Many of these errors have been previously brought to your attention. Your failure to correct your erroneous and false statements and their reputation after notice of their falsehood constitutes further publication of libel.

<li>Libel. These Wikipedians below are creating a potential Libel against Nico Demonte. First, wikipedia has identified this entity using identifiable voices, likenesses, or descriptions of or concerning a person or a company. Wikipedia's comments by its users present the following potential libel case against the artist: 1) It would reflect badly on the character of the person or entity and 2) It could harm the reputation, diminish the esteem, respect or good will in which the person or entity's relevant community holds him, her or it. Insinuations made by Wikipedia's workers, drones, editors, and Users, might reflect badly on character and/or harm reputation of Nico Demonte based on insinuations (see below), insinuations, and statements that imply that there are unstated defamatory facts underlying such statements. Warning: Republication of a libel creates another libel and labeling such artist within said framework, including but not limited to "Vandalism" constitutes further libel.

<dd>If I was arguing to keep, then I would say that there's a difference between a family which is deliberately studied <i>as a family</i> and one which has several famous individuals. Since I'm arguing to delete, because the article doesn't say anything about that, I won't disagree.
