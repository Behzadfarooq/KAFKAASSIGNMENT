There is a lot of speculative info re: 2014 and 2018 Cups as well, yet nobody proposes to delete it. And lastly, why are you so obsessed with the deletion?

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Apples, oranges. There is speculative info for 2014, but the bidding process has already began, at least unofficially, and because of the continental rotation system, it's narrowed down to a few number of candidates. 2018 is far in the future but there is already debate over whether this will be part of the continental rotation. There's no such substantial discussion for 2022 and beyond. Also, the "if you don't like it, don't read it" doesn't work for me. If Wikipedia is filled with trivial and/or speculative information, it devalues the whole project as an encyclopedia.

<dd><b>Comment to the above Comment</b> Surely, there is no such SUBSTANTIAL discussion but THERE IS a discussion going on already. This aricle quotes such officials as the FFA President, for example, so you can't call it just a speculation if it comes from such a high-ranking official. And besides, there was a discussion to move the 2010 WC from South Africa to USA in case the South Arficans won't fix all problems on time, so you might as well delete "the 2010 FIFA World Cup" article until 2010. There is an alricle in Wikipedia called "the 2024 Summer Olympics", for example, and nobody has any problem with it whatsoever, so what's the problem with "the 2022 World Cup"? It clearly states that it "contains information about a future sporting event. It is likely to contain information of a speculative nature and the content may change dramatically as the event approaches and more information becomes available." Therefore, it doesn't devalue the project but gives the reader some insight about the future event, event which, unlike some national jump rope competition, billions of people around the world are obsessed with. So please, don't touch it but update as the time goes on.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 193.41.160.35 (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.41.160.35.html" title="User talk:193.41.160.35">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.41.160.35_d762.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.41.160.35">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd><b>Comment</b> You just made the case for keeping 2010 WC as opposed to 2022. There's enough happening for 2010 that FIFA has to make official announcements that it will stay in South Africa. As it is, the 2022 article is more about Australian soccer than the World Cup, and the opening sentence includes a "thinks" and two uses of "probably". There's no information about 2022 beyond "Wouldn't it be nice if..". What's wrong with waiting 4 more years until there's real information about it? <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 15:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> this page for crystal ball-gazing reasons. Perhaps <b>move</b> the information on the proposals for the Australian bid to an article connected to the FFA or the Socceros, although even then there'll be a fair amount of wild speculation to remove. As I see the "Future Sporting Event" warning, it relates more to an event the general details of which are known, but not the specifics (so we know that the 2008 Olympics will be in Beijing but not exactly how they're going to be run, we know that South Africa's scheduled to host the 2010 World Cup, but not who'll be competing apart from Bafana Bafana themselves). In this case, we know none of that. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 10:17, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's actually might be an excellent suggestion - to make one page for all future World Cups starting from 2022 and beyond. I'd recommend to keep a separate page for the 2018 WC, though, as there is a lot of info already re: this event. Name this page simply "Future FIFA World Cups". There is enough info already available on 2022-2030 WCs to make one web page. There is even a site promoting WC 2030 in Uruguay (in Spanish, <a href="http://uruguay2030.tripod.com/" class="external free" title="http://uruguay2030.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://uruguay2030.tripod.com/</a>), event that's still 24 years in future. Surely all this warrants the inclusion of all the available info to the Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 193.41.160.35 (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.41.160.35.html" title="User talk:193.41.160.35">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.41.160.35_d762.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.41.160.35">contribs</a>) 10:13, 19 July, 2006 (UTC)</small>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think it's an idea worth cosidering, though the information that's in the 2022 probably belogs in the 2018 page under the Australian bid. Still, I disagree that the line between keeping 2018 and 2022 is thin; there's a huge dropoff in the amount of actual information. As it is, we only have the FFA represetative talking about <i>if</i> the 2018 Aussie bid fails <i>assuming</i> 2018 is still part of the continetal rotation. Too many variables and not enough definite facts or official statements, I think. And the 2030 page looks like more wishful thinking than an actual bid committee, though that might be because I can't read Spanish. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 08:18, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The thing of it is, I seriously doubt that there are countries who will bid for 2022+ that will not bid for 2018. If any country is considering bidding for a future World Cup, logic would tell us that they would bid for the next opportunity (that is, 2018), rather than waiting four more years until 2022 or later (this is assuming the continental rotation will end after 2014). Do you see what I mean? <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">Ian Manka</a> <small><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">Talk to me!</a></small> 08:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> There is logic in that, but there always might be reasons to let one chance pass, for instance when there is another event already planned to be organised in that nation in that year (Olympics or a World Championship of another sport for instance), or maybe the nation wants to make a good first impression and first improves the infrastructure, stadiums etc... before submitting a bid. (Although I must admit the Australia case contradicts this.) Anyway, I wonder if this logic is really an important thing to consider: if an official source mentions a nation will be going for World Cup 2030, does it matter if we think they will probably also try for World Cups 2018, 2022 and 2026? --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelotas_8dc6.html" title="User:Pelotas"><font style="color:#4863A0;"><b>Pelotas</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/e/l/User_talk%7EPelotas_5294.html" title="User talk:Pelotas"><font style="color:#F88017;"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a> 09:42, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see the logic too, but for the purpose of Wikipedia, I find it irrelevant. You're making an assumption about the intention of the candidate nations, however logical it may be, and you're asking Wikipedia to be a crystal ball. No one will come out and say, <i>"We probably don't have a chance in 2018 but we're making a token bid in preparation for 2026"</i> and you'd be dealing with speculation, not facts. Again, what happens in 2022 depends too heavily on events that haven't taken place yet i.e. the fate of the continental rotation, whether an European or a non-European nation gets 2018, etc. Really, is it too much to wait, oh I don't know, another six years before creating this article?&#160;:) <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 09:55, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I worded that wrong. I meant, <b>even if</b> it is just a token bid before a country really makes a go at it, the information will not change, unless their bidding strategy makes a complete turn-around. Therefore, if Country X is making a token bid for 2018, and going for real in 2022, then their bid info would be the same. They'll still use Stadium A in City B. Future articles aren't needed past 2018. Period. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">Ian Manka</a> <small><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">Talk to me!</a></small> 17:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not trying to annoy anyone, but I don't completely buy that. The information WILL change, surely a nation will show to the FIFA Committee that it has improved a lot since four years earlier. Ofcourse since we're indeed looking into the future the difference is not immediately visible now, but surely you have to consider more than just the stadiums! Also quoting you twice: <i>Future articles aren't needed past 2018. Period'</i> I can indeed agree that that is seriously <i>worded wrong</i>. What possible motivation could you have to determine that 2018 is the limit for useful information? The page <a href="../../../2/0/2/2022_Winter_Olympics_2d67.html" title="2022 Winter Olympics">2022 Winter Olympics</a> exists and if you look at the information on that page well, there's no reference and three of the four mentioned cities are also on the <a href="../../../2/0/1/2018_Winter_Olympics_bd0d.html" title="2018 Winter Olympics">2018 Winter Olympics</a> page. However I still agree that a complete page on the 2022 FIFA World Cup is probably overdoing it, but I dont agree that the information should be neglected because it's further into the future than your 'allowed year' of 2018. --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelotas_8dc6.html" title="User:Pelotas"><font style="color:#4863A0;"><b>Pelotas</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/e/l/User_talk%7EPelotas_5294.html" title="User talk:Pelotas"><font style="color:#F88017;"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a> 22:34, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't word anything right. Sue me. What I meant by <i>Future articles aren't needed past 2018. Period</i>, is that, as of 2006 (and perhaps a few years later), there is no need for any article about hosting until either (a) the shortlist is announced for 2014, and prospective candidates who were using 2018 as a warm-up for 2022 are not on the shortlist or (b) it has been announced that the continental will continue until 2018, in which case, all relevant information will be merged into the 2022 article. Hopefully I worded it okay this time. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">Ian Manka</a> <small><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">Talk to me!</a></small> 09:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hehe, I have no more arguments I can think of right now that I haven't mentioned already. Looks like I'm also almost the only one thinking this way, am I so stubborn?

<ul>
<li><b>Do Not Delete (Even stronger!)</b> Ladies and gentlemen, let's draw the line under this discussion. Obviously there are people here who are in favor of keeping the article, like myself, Pelotas, and some others. So I believe our desire to see this article up and running must be respected. We produced all the arguments we could in its favor, and the final one is this: we want it, so please let us have it. Does this article offends or abuses anyone? Does it have racist, pornographic, or similar content? No, of course. So leave it for God's sake! To all the people who are obsessed with deletion here, go to articles "2022 Winter Olympics" and "2024 Summer Olympics" and vent your feelings there! Delete those two and leave us this one! Deal?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 193.41.160.35 (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.41.160.35.html" title="User talk:193.41.160.35">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.41.160.35_d762.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.41.160.35">contribs</a>) 13:55, 20 July 2006 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>...or no deal</b> Unfortunately I don't think you quite get how AfD works. It's not about how much someone wants an article, it's about whether it fulfills the standards of Wikipedia. The key thing in this case is that it needs to be verifiable (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). As all we have is speculation there's no way to verify whether it is or isn't true, so ultimately we can't have an article until there's some concrete facts (e.g. a statement of intent to bid by an FA). --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 19:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I just don't know how to get this message across you guys, so I used that last argument that we simply want this article up. 1. About the standards of WP. Surely it should apply to ALL articles, not just this one, right? Therefore, first check out "2022 Winter Olympics" and "2024 Summer Olympics" articles. They contain the same speculative info as this one, yet NOBODY wants to delete them. Is it a double-standard or what? Now to 2. Article needs to be verifiable. The info contained in it is backed up by newspaper publication. If this is not enough for you, you may contact the Australian FA and verify their intention to bid for WC2022 in case their 2018 bid will fail. What other kind of verification do you need? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 193.41.160.35 (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.41.160.35.html" title="User talk:193.41.160.35">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.41.160.35_d762.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.41.160.35">contribs</a>) 06:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li>As regards other articles, that's rarely an argument that works (unless the articles have gone through an AfD and been kept). Ultimately there's a lot of articles on here that probably could be deleted but haven't been challenged yet. If you feel that the 2022 Winter Olympics and 2024 Summer Olympics articles don't belong then you can list them for deletion separately. As for the verification issue, I didn't make myself clear; what needs to be verifieable is the fact that it's likely that Australia intends to bid for 2022. As things stand all that can be gained from the newspapers is one statement by the FA chief exec that they <i>could</i> bid. Which still leaves us with speculation, and Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a crystal ball</a>.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> On the contrary, I believe that those two "Olympic" articles should be on WP as well for as long as there is at least one piece of info re:them. As for verification, then using your logic you may as well delete 2014 and 2018 WC articles since all we have there is just statements from respective officials that they "could" bid without any documentary proof that they will actually bid. --~~~.</li>
