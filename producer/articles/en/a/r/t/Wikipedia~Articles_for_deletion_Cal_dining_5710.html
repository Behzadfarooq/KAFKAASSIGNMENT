<li>I reread it, and I don't think that changes my opinion on the matter. It's a well-written and informative article, don't get me wrong, I just don't think the subject matter is encyclopedic, unless this is something that university dining facilities are modeled after the world over or something. It's just where people eat. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscrimate collection of information</a>, and I don't think it meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, either. I realize that the housing facilities have their own article as well, but I'm thinking of AfD'ing that one, too, pretty much for the same reasons I AfD'd this one (although I think that a long-standing living arrangement that stretches back fifty years is inherently a little more notable than dining arrangements). -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:15, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

Cal Dining created the first <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_organic.html" title="Certified organic">certified organic</a> residential dining salad bar in the nation, paving the way for sustainability and setting the standard by which other campuses are soon to follow. How is that not as notable as something like an aritcle on a <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outlands.html" title="Outlands">fictional World of Warcraft zone</a> or something of the sort? Forgive me if I sound a bit annoyed at this judgment, but I have put effort into citing sources and writting the article within <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<dd>Campus cruft?

<li><b>Keep</b> I think that this can potentially be very helpful for new UC Berkeley students. First of all, it is a good introduction to what Cal Berkeley represents. For example, potential students can see that our dining facilities serve only organic food. This reflects not only our emphasis on personal health, but also of the well-being of the environment and farmers. There are also many places to eat on campus that many students don't know about. For example, students most commonly eat at the dining halls or the Golden Bear Cafe, but there are other on campus locations such as Ramona's or Pat Brown's Grill that provide food. I have met many students that have never been to these locations and didn't even know about them. All in all, I believe that this article can be very useful for not only new/enrolled students to see what Berkeley has to offer, but offer an unbiased (something not written by the University) opinion. Also, it can be linked to from the Berkeley main site in order to show, more in-depth, the great facilities that are offered at this university other than the best education in the world.

<li><b>Delete</b> Put it into an article about UC. User's comming to say 'keep' are probably all students. If it can't provide encyclopedia to anyone but new students, why would it be in an encyclopedia? It sounds like something that should go on fliers around campus.

<li><b>Keep</b> The overall arguments for deletion have been clearly addressed and refuted, and as a rule, I pay no attention to people that repeat their arguments. This article is of much importance, not only because it describes the possible dining situations at UC Berkeley, but also Cal Dining's contributions for the community.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Smaller locations are noted alongside the well-known dining halls, providing awareness of the possible eating options for this international school (information which I propose to be expanded). An incredibly high number of people (not just students) are on this campus a day, and knowledge of these restaurants will be helpful during their stay at Berkeley. Cal Dining's efforts towards organic foods and an environmentally friendly program are of particular significance at a time when people have finally begun to realize the importance of environmental-friendly practices. The article's inclusion of these efforts enlightens others on what can be done and serves as a model for any other similar facilities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incoming UC students will undoubtedly find this information helpful, as well as tourists, parents, professors, international dignitaries, and the like. Information about Cal Dining serves a world-wide audience and an article is very much needed to carry this information to readers.</dd>

<dd>The motivating factor for one disagreeing member is to mop "up after the dishonest, incompetent, and fanatical." This article is accurate, concise, and far from extreme.

<li><i>The overall arguments for deletion have been clearly addressed and refuted</i> Ah, that old stand-by, the unilateral declaration of victory. Uh, no.</li>
<li><i>An incredibly high number of people (not just students) are on this campus a day, and knowledge of these restaurants will be helpful during their stay at Berkeley.</i> That's what those nice maps around campus are for. That what this nice website -- <a href="http://caldining.berkeley.edu/" class="external free" title="http://caldining.berkeley.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://caldining.berkeley.edu/</a> -- is for. That's what turning to your hosts, fellow students, or someone walking by and saying, "Say, where can I get a bagel around here?" is for. Wikipedia? Not so much.</li>
<li><i>Cal Dining's efforts towards organic foods and an environmentally friendly program are of particular significance at a time when people have finally begun to realize the importance of environmental-friendly practices.</i> Dude, Cal Dining isn't unique in that regard. Cal Dining isn't unique in <i>Berkeley</i> in that regard. Cal Dining isn't unique among <i>schools in Berkeley</i> in that regard (just ask <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Waters_34d1.html" title="Alice Waters">Alice Waters</a>).</li>
<li><i>The motivating factor for one disagreeing member is to mop "up after the dishonest, incompetent, and fanatical."</i> More irrelevancies -- I haven't brought any of those things up. When it comes to dishonesty, for example, I tend to think of things like <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESockpuppet_ef0b.html" title="WP:Sockpuppet">sockpuppetry</a>, when one person creates multiple accounts to give the illusion of mass support -- accounts that invariably have only a few edits and identical prose/rhetorical styles. When it comes to fanaticism, I tend to think of editors tendentiously wikilawyering, pushing for views or opinions that extremely narrow or of interest only to a tiny minority. When it comes to incompetence, I think of those that try all of the above despite that fact it's been tried -- many times daily, it seems -- with limited success. But I didn't bring them up, and surely none of those things apply here?</li>
<li><i>This article is accurate, concise, and far from extreme.</i> Well, at least it's not obsequious, clairvoyant, or purple -- qualities just as applicable to the <b>actual</b> issue at hand; that is, <b>whether the article is suitable for Wikipedia in the first place</b>.</li>
<li><i>It is difficult to imagine why people would have a problem with such articles.</i> I'm not sure why you have difficulty imagining what people have <b>told you directly</b>, but we all have our crosses to bear, I guess.</li>

Kevin_b_er might help you as well. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApook_3190.html" title="User:Apook">Apook</a> 07:18, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hetar I think you missed the point of Apook's message entirely, his main point was not to attack your WoW articles, I myself play WoW. I beleive the point he was trying to make is to bring some sort of actual argument that refutes his notability statment, rather than just write everything off as cruft and dance around his argument by picking at things on the sidebar. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresidank_3a7d.html" title="User:Presidank">Presidank</a> 09:47, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that there is already stuff on Wikipedia that probably shouldn't be there is not an argument for adding more stuff that probably shouldn't be there. Whether there are ten or twenty or twenty thousand worthless WoW articles is immaterial and bringing it up in this discussion does not in any way establish notability for this article. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:22, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This debate isn't about the <i>accuracy</i> of the article -- even if it were inaccurate, the task at hand would be copyediting, not deletion. I do question, however, the <i>notability</i> of this subject -- it reads like a travel guide, something <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. This content might be more welcome at <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://wikitravel.org/en/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikitravel</a>, but for the time being, I'm not entirely convinced of its relevance to an encyclopedia. That said, I'm undecided as of yet. Is there a precedent, here, or is this new ground? <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 10:26, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The debate about cruft is clearly a subjective one. My questioning of your World of Warcraft articles brings to light what you think cruft is. If you feel WoW articles are not cruft but this Cal Dining one is, please argue why. This current discussion pertains to the Cal Dining article only, but I believe that if anyone's definition of cruft is biased, his or her crufty argument against the article should be disregarded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I followed your WP:CRUFT link, and it states that fancruft "can be a contributing factor in [an article's] deletion, but it is not the actual reason for deletion." This brings to me wonder why we are even debating this point. It also states that "Non-canon fanfiction, in whatever fictional realm, is rarely considered encyclopaedic." To me, articles for WoW are certainly fanfiction, and I feel that your arguments against this article are hypocritical. Again, this is not an attack against you but against your minimalist arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The question now is whether this article is an encyclopaedic subject. One previous post feels that this argument reads like a travel guide, but I disagree. Following the "Wikipedia is not" link provided in that post, it states that "An article on Paris should mention landmarks." Although a dining hall at Cal certainly does not compare to Paris' Eiffel Tower, the dining program is an intricate and important part of any post-secondary school. In a liberal sense, the article discusses some of the landmarks at Cal. There has been a precedent set by the article on <a href="../../../u/c/_/UC_Berkeley_student_housing_9711.html" title="UC Berkeley student housing">Cal student housing</a>, as well as the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Tech_campus_85cc.html" title="Virginia Tech campus">Virginia Tech article</a>, which includes information on its dining halls.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly disagree with the most recent post, which argues that the article is of no interest to anyone outside UC Berkeley. Please read the first post I made (06:56, 14 June 2006 UTC). If tourists, parents, company recruiters/representatives, and international dignitaries aren't considered people outside of UC Berkeley, then I truly don't know who are. Instead of assuming that this information is available to "them" elsewhere, find it. The information offered in the article is more comprehensive than it is anywhere else. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApook_3190.html" title="User:Apook">Apook</a> 17:57, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Frankly, I don't really care at all whether the information is available to people elsewhere. I'm also rather uninterested in precedents; Wikipedia has its share of bad or unnecessary or otherwise unfortunate articles, WoW themed and otherwise. None of them have any bearing here. Furthermore, Apook, I must respectfully point out that I am not convinced that you're not a sockpuppet. Even if you are not, I must also point out that with the exception of a single edit on <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monta_Vista_High_School_9d8f.html" title="Monta Vista High School">Monta Vista High School</a>, you have never contributed to Wikipedia except twice on your own user page, and on this discussion. This, particularly when combined with your comments, leads me to believe that you are not familiar with Wikipedia's goals or policies and as such I will take your arguments with a grain of salt. I realize that you feel that this article should stay, but this far your arguments for that have mostly ignored any arguments against its inclusion and have been based on inconsequential and irrelevant straw men, such as whether WoW articles are fan fiction or whether landmarks in capital cities are somehow comparable to landmarks in universities. And yes, I'm sure that WP:CRUFT says many things, but WP:CRUFT is an essay, not a policy or a guideline. In any case, consensus will settle this issue in the end, not armchair lawyering or arguments about the wording of specific rules. I think you can very clearly see where the consensus is heading right now. If you want to change that, I suggest that instead of arguing here, you work on the article to establish notability -- if you can -- because <i>that</i> will most likely sway us. Building straw men here will not. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 04:03, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
