<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. Although many/most people would class the events of 1948 to be akin to ethnic cleansing, others would not.

<dd>There are forums to rename articles. I guess my next question would be, which of those articles deals with the actual claims of ethnic cleansing, not just mentions it as part of a larger article. If one exists I would be more then happy to change to delete. However it seems by the number of articles you can cite, there doesnt exist to be a parent article focuing on the topic only. Any info you have is well appreciated. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 16:42, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. "The purpose of this article is to make the case for..." makes it clear that this article was intended to push a specific point of view - the very definiton of what's not allowed. We can mention this in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_exodus.html" title="Palestinian exodus">Palestinian exodus</a>, if we find some more references like those NuclearZer0 found, but it doesn't need its own article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 09:42, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually it says what it says because its a blatant "copy and paste" copyright violation (the links and external refs are a later addition from a different editor) from a <a href="http://www.palestine-studies.org/final/en/journals/abstract.php?aid=7175&amp;iid=&amp;jid=&amp;vid=" class="external text" title="http://www.palestine-studies.org/final/en/journals/abstract.php?aid=7175&amp;iid=&amp;jid=&amp;vid=" rel="nofollow">Palestinian website</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. All that aside, back to the article. If a few people have publicly referred to the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_exodus.html" title="Palestinian exodus">Palestinian exodus</a> as an "ethnic cleansing", that should be at least mentioned in that article. Some of the sources listed here could be used over there. But all <i>this</i> article is doing is attempting to establish an "ethnic cleansing" case by itself. Comments like "The Israeli occupation government uses a racist ID card system" are irrelevant. Does one of the sources listed actually say that this ID card is an ethnic cleansing tool? Or are you simply using this claim to build up your own argument? <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 11:00, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_exodus.html" title="Palestinian exodus">Palestinian exodus</a> has happened in the year 1948 and is not the same as the continuous “ethnic cleansing” , I have referenced many articles using the term “ethnic cleansing”.. What else do you call the “tactic” of a government using a special policy of <b>house demolishing</b>, <b>special ID card system</b>, <b>special planning permission and building laws</b>, <b>temporary residency ID</b> and <b>ID card revocation</b> against a sect of its own residents…. But <b>Ethnic Cleansing</b> tactic</li>

<dd>First off, what you're doing is attacking users for their identity and nationality. Stop it at once. My personal opinions have nothing to do with this (nor do you know anything about me, except that I'm an Israeli. Guess that makes me guilty of whatever it is you're claiming).</dd>
<dd>We can all read, and the name of that article is "The <b>1948</b> Ethnic Cleansing...". If you want to talk about other time periods, you're dealing with the wrong article. More so, what you want is a partisan article, advocating your own POV. You won't get it. If you have any meaningful, well referenced data, you can use it to enhance existing articles. Otherwise, go open up a blog for your rants. <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 18:35, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Although I do not endorse the existence of this article, the listing of this article for deletion was done in bad faith. No debate occured on talk page, no attempt was made to move to an appropriate name. No discussion of any sort was made to come to an agreement with a user who is apparently very new. Also, the POV argument doesn't hold in light of <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_genocide.html" title="Rwandan genocide">Rwandan genocide</a>. I suspect the intention behind deleting this article are just as POVish as the intention behind creating thsi article.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 22:08, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please don't accuse me of bad faith. The article was created, and then deleted as it was a copyright violation. Then it was recreated, only shorter. It was copied from some website, based on an <b>unpublished</b> book. Apart from the copyright violation, it's a POV fork of Palestinian Exodus, written to advocate a certain viewpoint. As such, it should be deleted. It still should, as no one can even make up their mind what this article is trying to talk about (even the user who uploaded it called it "1948...", and then claimed it's about today as well). For allegations about current issues, there's <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a>. This article looks like an opinion column, and has no place here. Also, the user has engaged in personal attacks, using ad hominem tactics, and attacking users (such as myself) for their nationality. <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 21:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
