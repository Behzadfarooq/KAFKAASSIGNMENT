<dd>I have to agree; any info that is there still belongs (in my humble opinion) on the tongue page. On the Wikipedia merge page, we read that not every topic requires a page; for instance, flammable and inflammable belong on flammability. I would think that licking belongs on tongue under that argument? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 02:28, 5 April 2006 (UTC) I should clarify - that means, as I have said above, <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tongue.html" title="Tongue">tongue</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 08:06, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> – Licking is a notable topic, with sexual and sociological implications for various species.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Encyclopaedias are or should be in part dictionaries with more detail.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, there is not a need to write a comprehensive article on every single kind of variation of a theme. e.g. there is no need to have a page on flammable, inflammable, and flammability. The <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tongue.html" title="Tongue">Tongue</a> is an integral part to licking. The use of the tongue in eating and drinking are already laid out in the Tongue article, having a page specifically for licking is redundant. If this survives the AfD, then all relevant information that is already included on the tongue page should be excised from <a href="../../../l/i/c/Licking.html" title="Licking">Licking</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 04:54, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is something of a straw-man argument: whereas "flammable" and "inflammable" are descriptions of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flammability.html" title="Flammability">flammability</a>, "licking" is a separate concept from <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tongue.html" title="Tongue">tongue</a>, just one of a number of actions it is used for. After all, we don't redirect <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running.html" title="Running">running</a> to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot.html" title="Foot">foot</a>, do we? Other uses of the tongue, such as <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating.html" title="Eating">eating</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking.html" title="Drinking">drinking</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talking.html" title="Talking">talking</a>, do have their own main articles, even if they're also described briefly in the tongue article.

<dd>I think Ilmari has it exactly right... There is more to licking than fits into the tongue article. In particular I think exploration of why the term is used (along with "hiding") to describe corporal punishment might be quite interesting.

<li><b>Delete</b> As someone attending the high school in which this "phenomenon" is "taking hold", I can say first-hand that this is by far not noteworthy enough to be on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> If one knows "Mike" one will know that he infact does attend this high school, but that the claims he makes are an attack to discredit and destroy an article that has not even had a chance to firmly plant its feet on the ground. Within 10 minutes of being created it was on the table for deletion, and while many in the wikipedia community may see that as a victory I see it as a shame - a shame that new ideas cannot be expressed or shared with the rest of the world. All I implore is that this article is allowed to remain active for more than five days so that those who have made this dialect so famous can voice their opinions and show that this article is "Notable" - <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack-nhn_f235.html" title="User:Smack-nhn">Smack-nhn</a> 02:49, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I will take that as a backhanded compliment. Look, it's nice to have something catch on and I don't doubt that your group has done that. But I had a History of the English Language professor who swore up and down that her family invented the word "crud" in 1955, and there is no way she would consider it inclusive as she admits there is no proof. That's from an person who knows language and dialect. Now, if I'm sitting down here in Tennessee and in six months to two years I hear this, then I will support. The point of the editors is that a few thousand teens (or adults) in New Hampshire are simply not notable. Myspace is a place to rally trends, not Wikipedia. By all means look over this place and the links pointed out, and become a serious editor. We take it seriously because there are several hundred <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">new pages</a> everyday that have to be filtered. I am here because I love history and English, but my job is not in the field so it's a nice way to relax for me.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Pennichuck Talk is not simply a local-Interest or a small scale dialect. It is a phenomenon that is starting to take hold throught the city of Nashua and the Region of Southern New Hampshire. Due to the increased networking of young adults in today's society - what may seem as insignificant or "un-notable" can very quickly become a national trend. By killing this article before it even starts, you are in effect killing the documentation of a dialect of the english language. Already, we here in Southern New Hampshire are seeing increased use of this "talk" among young adults from other schools through interaction in sports, clubs, and other extra-cirricular activity. The fact that it has spawned use by thousands of people after originally being born from a select few shows that this dialect Demands Notation - in a few short years it has firestormed and simply deleting it because it hasn't reached you yet is killing a part of our culture. A part of our culture that could reach you in a few years. If this site is all about spreading information and breaking borders, why is there censorship on what is percieved to be "Not-Notable" material.smack-nhn 30 March 2006</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've changed my mind. Whle I still think that this is verifiable I do not think it is in the spirit that we need it to be. I'm sure that most of it is accurate and anyone would not disagree with me that has watched /. for a while, but what if slashdot is not around in 10 years. How would we verifiy it then(for the purpose of this thought experiment forget about archive.org/google cache/whatever)? What about 100 years from now? It would be nice if our modern cultures were described somewhere, but I do not think something trying to be an encyclopedia(in the sense of a source of reliable information) is the proper place. kotepho 19:03, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>(Changed view of nominator) <b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth_Direct_Line_d4fa.html" title="Portsmouth Direct Line">Portsmouth Direct Line</a> and redirect - the story is notable but it does not really qualify for a ... railway station article. A very pleasing outcome, we can both say we were right! Unisouth has probably, correctly identified a place where people got on and off trains. But RHaworth can say: yes, but even the LSWR never gave it the exalted title of "station", if they called it anything it would have been "Denvilles halt" or just "Denvilles platform". So come on Unisouth, take a trip to Winchester and visit your county's local studies library, see if you can unearth some contemporary documents like the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bradshaw_6551.html#Bradshaw.27s_railway_timetables" title="George Bradshaw">Bradshaw</a> for 1859 with a note saying "passengers are conveyed by omnibus ...". -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 08:08, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hey, I'm not stopping you from expanding it, if that's what you think should be done with it. I just don't see how notable the idea is of wearing a rubberband around one's wrist to indicate that one is "master of one's domain." I think if it's not expanded after seven days of deletion debate, it's likely never to be expanded and should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<dd>By nominating this for AfD, you're pretty much saying you don't believe that it can or should be expanded. I disagree. I personally don't know enough about the movement to make any decent inroads, but a need for expansion isn't a reason for deletion.

<dd>I've spent time searching, but there is no more information avaialble with which to expand it. We've said all there is to say, until such time as someoene else writres an article about the topic.

<dd>Size is not an issue in AfD, just notability. What notability are you referring to? Aall I could find was one article a over a year ago, with a few bogs reacting in titillation. I can't imagine that the original proponents are still advocating for it, but if they have no one has reported on it. No manufacturer is known to be producing them. No church group is handing them out. It was a fad limited to three guys who managed to interest an editor enough to get mentioned in a short "man-bites-dog" piece in the Rolling Stone. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 06:07, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

If you could provide references to newspaper or gaming magazine articles claiming grand things for this project, then there would be no problems on keeping it.</dd>
<dd>And as for the "That piece of shit is on Wikipedia, <i>My</i> article is vastly superior to that piece of shit, therefore, <i>my</i> article should be kept"... it doesn't work that way. Until it is proven that this mod meets the criteria of the various policies and guidelines noted above by various users, it stands a very good chance of deletion. But I will say it again, <i><b>if there are other articles that you believe do not meet the abovementioned criteria, bring them forth, and we will consider those articles on their own merits (or lack thereof), just as we are considering this article on its own merits</b></i>. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 01:33, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Wendy Campell, the subject of this article is a peace activist and supporter of the Palestinian people. Peace activism aside, Campell has also aligned herself with white supremacist and white pride groups such as <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Vanguard_9439.html" title="National Vanguard">National Vanguard</a> and is a supporter <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Historical_Review_2b3e.html" title="Institute for Historical Review">Institute for Historical Review</a>, a Holocaust revisionist organization. Understandably, her support for such groups in addition to her frequent use of the term 'Jewish-Supremacist' has branded her with controversy.</p>
<p>Consequently, many people on the left, on the right, and on both sides of the Israel-Palestine dillema consider her to be racist and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semetic.html" title="Anti-semetic">anti-semetic</a>/anti-Jewish.</p>
<p>When the one-sided, <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soapbox.html" title="Soapbox">soapbox</a> article on the subject first appeared, many Wikipedia users have attempted to balance the article with mention of issues that have branded her with controversy. However, the user with IP address <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.102.67.133.html" title="User talk:71.102.67.133">71.102.67.133</a>/email <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-01,GGLG:en&amp;q=lioness4%40ix%2Enetcom%2Ecom" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-01,GGLG:en&amp;q=lioness4%40ix%2Enetcom%2Ecom" rel="nofollow">lioness4@ix.netcom.com</a> (possibly Ms. Campell herself. a google search of the email adress provides plausable evidence) has repeadedly deleted any additions that attempt to bring the article to a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>Campell, or one of her supporters have repeatedly prevented others from contributing to the article and has repeatedly censured the associated discussion page. Through her actions, the subject has insisted that Wikipedia serve as a <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soapbox.html" title="Soapbox">soapbox</a> and has refused to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>.</p>
<p>Consequently, the article has no place on Wikipedia as it is being used as a soapbox and there are questions concerning Cambells notableness. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimbojones_0037.html" title="User:Limbojones">Limbojones</a> 04:19, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have already asked that any future contributions of Lioness/Wendy Campbell be banned-NOT because she is a revolting racist/nazi activist as the links below demonstrate her to be-but because of her and her allies attempts to censor and silence all contributions to Wikipedia that draw attention to that fact. She and her pro-Hitler supporters seek to deny the very freedom of speech to others that they so hypocrtically demand for themselves. She has done this in repeated violation of Wikipedia rules for participation and has failed to contribute to this discussion in good faith, constantly removing all critical posts. I would be happy with either allowing the discussion to go on, with full participation of those who do not attempt to censor others, or simply removing this topic altogether. What is utterly unacceptable is for her and her allies/agents to be allowed to fascistically dictate the entire terms of discussion, especially in response to an original entry that was little more than a (deliberately) misleading sanitized puff piece, one quite possibly written by Wendy Campbell/Lioness herself.

<p>Wendy Campbell -or one of her delegated lackeys- has YET AGAIN removed critical comments on the discussion page, even after being expressely warned not to vandalize and NPOV this article and even after this discussion page had to be set up in response to her constant attempts at censorship. This is further proof that while the article itself should be kept, her failure to participate in good faith makes an irrefutable case for her own removal from the discussion.

It would be nice if the article could be cleaned up enough to work - it's <i>far</i> too unwieldy just now, and seems to be more of a list of "my favourite pranks" than anything of real value - but I can't see any way in which there could be a consensus as to what pranks were notable enough and what weren't, since local customs vary so hugely even within a few miles. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 12:37, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I remember more than half of these from school 20 years ago. They're not simply something "made up in school one day" but a part of our collective social history. While the article does need a significant cleanup and a lot of the dross cut from it, the problems that most people are citing are purely format based – not content. That is a reason to edit; NOT to destroy a potential resource.--Mr2mk1g 15:42, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Some orignal research, admittedly, but, a vast majority of this is common school pranks even I remember in school. I can see an article in the mess. A VfD isn't the way to solve this.

<p>I PRODded this with the argument that the article uses linguistic terminology to describe a sound (the "<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blowing_a_raspberry.html" title="Blowing a raspberry">raspberry</a>" or "Bronx cheer") not used linguistically in any language. The PROD was contested, so I'm bringing it here. The main problem with this article is that it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>: phonetics terminology does not actually provide a name for the "Bronx cheer", nor does the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a> does provide a separate symbol for it, so the author of the article invented them. Phonetically I'm not convinced "linguolabial trill" is even the most accurate description of the sound (which begins with a complete closure and ends with disorganized noise rather than the steadily repeating contact of a canonical <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trill_consonant.html" title="Trill consonant">trill</a>, so if anything it's a type of <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affricate_consonant.html" title="Affricate consonant">affricate</a>), but that's not the point, the point is, this <i>isn't</i> a linguistic sound, so it shouldn't be described as one, and it <i>hasn't</i> been described as one except in this Wikipedia article. I wish I could say "merge with <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blowing_a_raspberry.html" title="Blowing a raspberry">Blowing a raspberry</a>" (as in fact I did in the PROD), but in fact since everything here is OR, nothing can in good conscience be merged there. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 06:09, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article was created by a user with only six edits to wikipedia. It is apparently based on data from <a href="http://earthtrends.wri.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://earthtrends.wri.org/" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> but I havent found it after searching for it on their site. Anyway the problem is that there is no accurate way to "rank" countries by coastline as coastlines are different on different scales and whether you include islands etc. There are huge differences with the figures given here and those of other sites such as the <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2060.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2060.html" rel="nofollow">CIA</a>. - on this list the USA has 133,312km of coastline compared to ten times less - 19,924 km on the CIA site. Even the order of countries is different such as <a href="http://www.mapsofworld.com/world-top-ten/world-top-ten-longest-coastline-countries-map.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mapsofworld.com/world-top-ten/world-top-ten-longest-coastline-countries-map.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> where the top five are Canada, Indonesia, Russia, Phillipines, Japan rather than Canada, US, Russia, Indonesia, Chile. This list which tries to give coastline figures to <i>one decimal point</i> is a huge misrepresentation -- <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a><small>|<a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">talk</a></small> 09:49, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the limitations of the figures can be given instead. Another solution would be listing alphabetically and giving the figures from multiple sources (the article would need to be renamed, of course). They definitely should not be given down to the tenth of a mile, though. Unless the coastline is very small, I would round it to the nearest mile or even the nearest ten miles. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:00, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I suppose it would be alright listed alphabetically showing smallest and largest figures given - but it would still look pretty inaccurate, for instance Chile: smallest figure - 6,435km, largest - 78,563km -- <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a><small>|<a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">talk</a></small> 11:42, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm the author and I don't see the problem. I took an article that was over a year out of date and updated and improved it. If this article is a problem why was it not deleted when it was horrendously out of date. In this article, my aim was to gather useful information from a variety of sources, combine them into a single piece, and detail how recent innings affected the Test ratings. The LG ICC cricket ratings article is poor, and other than an external link offers no up-to-date information. I fail to see the harm that this article was doing. With regards the comment about just taking information from other sources, of course that's what i've been doing. You may as well shut Wikipedia down entirely if this is the source of your problem, because i'm sure just about everything on here can be found somewhere else on the web. I'm sorry if i've stepped on the toes of whatever club you have going on here, and am dissapointed that contributors to an online encyclopedia would want to erase information - especially as this information that can not be found in this combination anywhere else on the web. I enjoyed updating it, and my work affords me plenty of time to have done so. Please delete the article.</dd>

<dd>The article as it was before you updated probably would have been deleted if anybody had noticed. You did update it well, and made us notice it by linking to it on other pages. I agree that it contains interesting information, but it is not all the sort of information that you would expect to find in an encyclopaedia. Any information that is appropriate would probably be better added to <a href="../../../l/g/_/LG_ICC_cricket_ratings_17a4.html" title="LG ICC cricket ratings">LG ICC cricket ratings</a>, rather than in a completely separate article. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 04:55, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - POV fork of <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_protester.html" title="Tax protester">Tax protester</a>. The leaders of this movement are serving long prison terms for fraud, tax evasion, etc. (See <a href="../../../i/r/w/Irwin_Schiff_3f85.html" title="Irwin Schiff">Irwin Schiff</a>), and addressing the issue with this tone is the moral equivalent of saying that 'a growing number of people believe that the government has no power to punish murder'. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 14:00, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>ReWrite</b> as a personal way of thinking. If there are official wiki guidelines which this article violates and it cannot or nobody wants to rewrite an article on the behavior or propanganda then I guess there is no choice but to delete, because we would not want to mislead the gullible reader that the tax <i>honesty</i> stuff is either honest or in <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_faith.html" title="Good faith">good faith</a>. So my preference is for a first line to the article that states: "<i>The tax honesty movement is an ironically named and dishonest attempt to mislead... blah blah blah...</i>" <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_wesley_6b3b.html" title="User:John wesley">John wesley</a> 15:32, 30 March 2006 (UTC) That is if we can't rewrite or if it's against wiki policy then <b>delete</b> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_wesley_6b3b.html" title="User:John wesley">John wesley</a> 15:32, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All the arguments raised by the "tax honesty movement" are already addressed in <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_protester.html" title="Tax protester">Tax protester</a> - rewriting would only make this a duplicate of that article, so it is just as simple to delete, redirect, and add a line to the effect that recent tax protesters have used this name. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 15:38, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is there nothing different about this movement than standard tax protesters? If no, then <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_protestor.html" title="Tax protestor">Tax protestor</a> and include the term there if it is verifiable <i>and</i> notable. If there are some important differences, perhaps this topic deserves an article, and in that case, all the ridiculous POV just needs to be excised. Only delete if this term is not important or really used at all. I don't really have any familiarity with it, so provide some evidence if you can. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:43, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then incorporating or adding this new name for the current group of protestors and redirect would be just as good as rewrite. Go ahead and <b>delete</b> and add the name <i>tax honesty movement</i> to a list of names that these protestors call themselves. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_wesley_6b3b.html" title="User:John wesley">John wesley</a> 15:48, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well, for one thing, this article claims the phrase "Tax Honesty Movement" was coined in 2001, but refers to a 1948 tax protester as recognized as its founder, and recites arguments that were raised and dashed long before 2001. Some of these arguments (e.g. that the government refuses or is unable to point to where the power to tax originates) were previously added to the tax protester article,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tax_protester&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28040205" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tax_protester&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28040205" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tax_protester&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28041738" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tax_protester&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28041738" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, where they were debunked and revealed as nonsensical or having been rejected by courts in specific decisions. This is the very definition of a POV fork - material debunked as a fallacy in one article is used to set up another article that offers a competing version of the "truth". <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 16:22, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right, but that doesn't matter because all the unverified POV simply needs to go in any case. The only thing we need to decide is is this term an important one of it's own right?—if it is not at all important-&gt;delete; if it is a little important-&gt;redirect and mention in <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_protestor.html" title="Tax protestor">Tax protestor</a>; <a href="../../../i/f/f/Iff.html" title="Iff">iff</a> there is significant importance of the term <b>in its own right</b>-&gt;keep and rewrite it to be NPOV about the term. I'm thinking it is clearly one of the first two, I'd just like more information to decide. Do you have any sources for that? - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:57, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>&gt; "Personally, I've seen nothing that distinguishes this label from all others applied to or adopted by tax protesters." Well, you might consider that perhaps Tax Protesters have evolved into Tax Honesty Proponents, as more of the truth has been uncovered over the years. Perhaps it's the Tax Protester page that should be merged into the Tax Honesty page. --InteXX 01:54, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rewrite</b> - There is one very important distinction between "tax protestors" and the "tax honesty movement." Tax Protestors agree that they are subject to the tax laws, but they believe the laws are unfair and excessive and they don't want to pay. Whereas the belief held by the Tax Honesty Movement is that the laws, as written, are perfectly legal. However, the enforcement of the revenue laws are being grossly mis-applied and are not legal. They also agree that everyone should pay taxes that they are liable for, obviously because the government operates on tax money. And there are plenty of legal ways for the government to collect the necessary funds to operate. But taxing a person's money that they earn from domestic sources is not constitutional, nor is there anything in the internal revenue code that imposes such a tax. The tax laws are written clear enough to understand that they don't apply to most americans. There are a number of ex-IRS agents that have quit because they've come to the same conclusions. And they are part of a class action lawsuit against the government because the government refuses to answer their questions(givemeliberty.org). A good place to start learning about this movement and to learn about the revenue laws, is by going to originalintent.org/edu. You can also read the Internal Revenue Code at www.law.cornell.edu/uscode. It is Title 26 (pay close attention to the statutory definitions) --Tax Heretic <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 159.37.7.44 (<a href="../../../1/5/9/User_talk%7E159.37.7.44.html" title="User talk:159.37.7.44">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.37.7.44_5ac2.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.37.7.44">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>Actually, the distinction to which you point is the one between tax protesters and tax resisters. Tax protesters, as the term has been used by courts and government agencies, dispute that the tax laws are valid or constitutional. For example, the claim that "taxing a person's money that they earn from domestic sources is not constitutional" is a classic tax protester argument. Tax resisters (generally) do not dispute the legality of taxes but nonetheless refuse to pay them. The claim that "a number of ex-IRS agent... have quit because they've come to the same conclusions" is part of the scam language used to lure people into this nonsense. Also, "Tax Honesty Movement" is a POV title - kind of like naming a pedophile group the "Benefits of Sex With Children Honesty Movement". <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 18:52, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>&gt; "Actually, the distinction to which you point" Not at all. According to your own stated definition, Tax Honesty proponents are neither Tax Protestors nor Tax Resistors. Tax Honesty proponents aren't questioning the legality of any law, nor are we refusing to pay a tax with which we disagree. You seem to have completely misunderstood the entire concept. What we're saying is that the law is COMPLETELY proper and constitutional, and that it simply doesn't apply to us. IRS and DOJ are intentionally misrepresenting and misapplying the law as it's written. --InteXX 01:54, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

I did this with the hope that linking to additional information would stimulate input to the Wiki and help further clarify issues for Wiki users. My intent was to add information, and I never deleted anything that already existed. You, on the otherhand, chose to immediately delete my addition from the Tax Protestor article, added paragraph the the <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_Honesty_Movement_6794.html" title="Tax Honesty Movement">Tax Honesty Movement</a> article <i>without</i> giving citation of the court case from which you liberated text (out of context?), and initiated deletion proceedings against this one. Is your agenda here based upon finding and learning the truth or is is based on distortion and obfuscation? If it is the latter, sir, it resembles the actions of the best tyrants and autocrats. It appears that your objection(s) to the continued existence of this article are based mostly on your personal POV and smacks of censorship.</li>

<dd>The <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_Honesty_Movement_6794.html" title="Tax Honesty Movement">Tax Honesty Movement</a> is a name given to a growing number of individual Americans who desire honesty and accountability in the application of the tax laws of the United States. I'm sure that you will agree that having our tax laws applied honestly and fairly by our own government is in the best interest of all Americans, including yourself. I submit that blindly obeying orders from any taxing authority without knowing what the law actually requires and to whom it actually applies is servile, unpatriotic, and un-American. These people are gravely concerned by the fact that representatives of their own government refuse to sit down face-to-face and discuss questions that they have regarding proper application of tax law. In fact, in a recent press conference, a representative of the IRS stated that those who dare ask questions will be met with enforcement actions, rather than answers. Does this fit in with the IRS mission statement which says in part:</dd>
<dd><i>"Provide America's taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all."</i></dd>

<dd>The formal organization leading the effort to get substantive response from the government is called the <a href="http://www.givemeliberty.org" class="external text" title="http://www.givemeliberty.org" rel="nofollow">We The People Foundation</a>. According to your own Wiki bio, during your time in law school you state that you focused on the First Amendment. It should interest you that the <a href="http://www.givemeliberty.org" class="external text" title="http://www.givemeliberty.org" rel="nofollow">We The People Foundation</a> has a First Amendment lawsuit against the govenment currently in the courts. The question in this suit is in regard to the fifth Right enumerated in the First Amendment regarding the Right To Petition. Members of the <a href="http://www.givemeliberty.org" class="external text" title="http://www.givemeliberty.org" rel="nofollow">We The People Foundation</a> created an exceedingly polite petiton to the government which asked over 500 questions begging answers regarding proper application of tax law. To date, the government has refused to answer the petition. In fact, the government has actually argued in court that while the Peope do indeed have the Right to petiton, there is nothing in the Constitution that compels the government to answer. Anyone with a modicum of intelligence should see this as <i>insufferable arrogance</i> on the part of the government, as the Right To Petition with expection of answer has a long and rich history dating as far back as the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magna_Carta_56fc.html" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a>.

<dd>Mr. <i><b>BD2412</b></i>, I respectfully request your participation in a public discussion of federal income tax law with one of the most outspoken members of the <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_Honesty_Movement_6794.html" title="Tax Honesty Movement">Tax Honesty Movement</a>, Dave Champion, on his weekly radio show called <a href="http://www.americanradioshow.us" class="external text" title="http://www.americanradioshow.us" rel="nofollow">The American radio Show</a>.

<dd>The point of this AfD is not whether tax laws are constitutional or properly applied, but whether the <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_Honesty_Movement_6794.html" title="Tax Honesty Movement">Tax Honesty Movement</a> is a separate concept from anything covered in the <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_protester.html" title="Tax protester">Tax protester</a> article. Since the latter article exhaustively addresses the various arguments contending that the income tax is unconstitutional, illegal, or improper - including the belief that there simply is no law that requires taxes to be paid - the Tax Honesty Movement can snugly take up a paragraph of that article. (I note that reference to Vivian Kellems far precedes the coining of the term "Tax Honesty Movement", and should be in the tax protester article anyway, and the paragraph on the law prohibiting IRS reference to "illegal tax protesters" duplicates material in the tax protester article. As for the proferred debate, I am neither a tax lawyer nor a debater. No amount of rhetoric will stop the IRS from assessing taxes, or spring Schiff from the federal pen - if you really intend to avoid U.S. taxes and remain a free man, your choice will be to leave America, or ruin its government. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 03:00, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>LEAVE IT AS IS!</b>. Mr. 2412 states <i>Since the latter article exhaustively addresses the various arguments contending that the income tax is unconstitutional, illegal, or improper - including the belief that there simply is no law that requires taxes to be paid</i>. It seems Mr. 2412 wants to delete an article the contradicts his own POV article. Mr. 2412's article <b>IS</b> a POV article because the law supports the Tax Honesty Researchers. Quite simply, Mr. 2412, you are wrong. You are wrong for a very simple reason: You don't address the actual written words of law. If you don't address the WRITTEN WORDS of the STATUTES, REGULATIONS, and appropriate Supreme Court rulings, then anything you have to say about the "<b>INCOME</b>" tax is <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearsay.html" title="Hearsay">Hearsay</a>. Neither do you address the distinction between what constitutes a direct tax and an indirect tax. And neither do you address what definition of "<b>INCOME</b>" the Supreme Court limited Congress to using; Quote: "<i>there would seem to be no room to doubt that the word must be given the same meaning in all of the Income Tax Acts of Congress that was given to it in the Corporation Excise Tax Act</i>" Merchants’ Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Smietanka, 255 U.S. 509 (1921) Since you don't discuss the Consitutional meaning of "<b>INCOME</b>" as used in the 16th. Amendment, you can't be very clear on what is taxed with an "<b>INCOME</b>" tax. Just on this one issue, I have 6 plus pages dedicated to showing, what the definition of "<b>INCOME</b>" that is taxed by the "<b>INCOME</b>" tax is according to the Supreme Court. Because of the <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_dissonance.html" title="Cognitive dissonance">Cognitive_dissonance</a> that many have regarding this issue I have approximately 74 questions on numbered pages 4-10 on my website. The questions are in the manner of an open book reading comprehension quiz. You may access those questions here: <a href="http://www.synapticsparks.info/tax/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.synapticsparks.info/tax/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>.</p>
<p>Tax Honesty Researchers are a small, but not insignificant, and growing number of people who have actually taken the time to study what the WRITTEN WORDS of the STATUTES and REGULATIONS of the tax law actually say. And in reply to the insult about the use of the word honesty in the label: It's the government that refuses to answer questions. 1,200 people asked 6 questions of the government via Commissioner Everson and Secretary Snow. Those 6 questions and the government's non-responsive reply may be read here:<a href="http://www.synapticsparks.info/tax/6questions.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.synapticsparks.info/tax/6questions.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> Perhaps you could put together a Wiki page on government evasion and use the scan of that evasive, insulting, threatening letter that does not answer the questions asked.

<p>I do not know why these people want this page deleted. The free flow of information is what makes this country great. I remember something about the 1st ammendment but I'm not sure its allowed anymore judging on whats going on here. The same debate about creation or evolution could easily open the wrath of multitudes, but we don't delete the information simply because some nut job blows a gasket because he doesn't agree with it. Information about the tax honesty movement on both sides of the arguement should be kept free and open. Let the individual reader decide for themselves what they believe to be true or false. My take on the tax honesty movement is that it is simply a grass root movement by free thinking people who are seeking to find out for themselves what is true and what is not about the Income Tax. Those in the movement are in the process of networking, learning, and educating themselves, searching for the truth. Some in the movement may be more vocal than others. Some have even written books and devoted considerable resources on the subject, but there are no "leaders" of the movement. There are some who have used mistaken information and have paid a price for it, while others who have done more research have found where they went wrong and learned from it. Those who make claims about the tax honesty movement being "heresy" and crying out "you people are evil Tax Protestors" appear to me to be nothing less than the same ilk of book burners of histories past.</p>
<p>2412, the "tax honesty movement" is an adjective phrase. As opposed to the noun sentence "Tax protestor". The two are not synonymous. I sincerely suggest you look up the legal definition of the words you use before you go spouting off accusations.</p>

<dd>Ummm, at the expense of appearing to inject an off-topic response to off-topic comments above, I'd like to point out that under the rules of English grammar I don't think there is any such thing as a "noun sentence." Also, "Tax protestor" is not only not a "noun sentence," it's not a sentence at all. In English, sentences generally have to have both a subject (express or implied) and a verb. Maybe we need to set up another fun after school project on English grammar.

<li><b>Leave As Is</b>--The page accurately describes something that's really happening, and as such has merit. It's quite generic, not advancing any particular legal argument over another. Members of the Tax Honesty Movement aren't Tax Protesters at all. We're not protesting any tax, but rather we're saying that the law doesn't permit a tax in the first place. We're taking a stand against willful misapplication and misrepresentation of the written law by government agencies. The gentlemen who holds up trial convictions of prominent Tax Honesty figures is either ignorant of or is ignoring the fact that these convictions were gained through judges cooperating with and assisting prosecutors. A common theme in these trials is that defendants aren't allowed to use the written law in their defense. True justice is almost lost in America today. --InteXX 01:58, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Bob Schultz and the "We The People" movement politely and respectfully asked questions to those we have elected to serve us. There was no reply.</p>
<p>People have been jailed without having the chance to present their facts to the jury. Irwin Schiff's trial transcripts demonstrate the government's refusal to address the truth.</p>
<p>Larken Rose's trial, Tessa Rose's trial and Ward Dean's trial were all miscarraiges of justice and blantent hiding of the truth.</p>

<p>Finally the word is getting out, don't bury your heads in the sand any longer. This is TRUE! I have investigated it myself for years. Show us the Law!</p>
<p><b>Keep</b></p>
<p>The "Tax honesty movement" folks are not "Tax protesters." They believe Title 26 is legally correct and binding. There problem is not with the Tax Laws but with the misapplication of the law by the IRS. If those views are incorrect it should be a simple matter for the IRS to show statutes and regulations that support their position. As an aside, Mr. BD2412's POV is not supported by the findings of the Grace Commission. Further, Income taxes collected don't go to the U. S. Treasury. They go to the International Monetary Fund. I have a POV as to what the IMF does with our Tax Dollars but that is not appropriate here.</p>
<p><b>Last reply here.</b>Mr./Ms. Famspear correctly states: <i>I'd like to suggest that maybe we should reserve this page for comments about the substance of this discussion...</i> Mr./Ms. Famspear <b>in</b>correctly states: <i>Statements such as the "law supports the Tax Honesty Researchers" and "You don't address the actual written words of law" and "It's the government that refuses to answer questions" are not material to the question before us.</i> <b>That</b> is exactly <b>THE</b> material that drives the tax honesty movement. I submitted external links for the purpose of giving those that are going to be active in this decision process something to think about in regards to the tax honesty movement article. A <i>taste</i> if you will, of the thought process of at least one person who, after reading the written words of the statutes and regulations, has determined that the law does not apply to him.</p>
<p>Mr./Ms. Famspear further states: <i>By the way, for anyone who is interested, I just thought of a fun after-school project! I'm going to take the anonymous comments by the users at IP 4.158.201.8 and IP 63.157.175.198 above, and discuss them at Talk:Tax protester.

<p>KEEP&#160;!!!!! It's sad when undisputable, credible evidence is presented and backed up by resignations of their own officers, extensive research by folks such as Bill Benson, Irwin Schiff and others and folks (mostly corrupt judges&#160;!!)want to call that effort null and void&#160;!!! The largest exposure of the fraud shows when the government has been invited many many times to a press conference to "stake their claim" that they've been right/legal in what they've been doing all these years and miracuously "get the flu" every time about a week or so before it was supposed to happen. Come on people, doesn't the fact they've been "ducking the issue" all these years "throw up a flag" with even the most diehard of "still tax believers"&#160;? You're living in fantasy land if it doesn't&#160;!!!</p>
<p><b>KEEP</b></p>
<p>I'm amazed that there are those who claim this article (in its original form) to be POV. Is it not factual? If it isn't, then let's discuss those portions of the article that are not. Truth be told, the tax honesty movement does exist, irrespective of how one might feel about it. The facts are that there are a growing group of people associated with these ideas, as evidenced by Bob Schulz and the We The People lawsuit. The emergence of the internet has caused an increasing number of people to start reading the law on their own and questioning the government as to the proper enforcement of the U.S. code and Federal Regulations. These issues will not go away if the government does not answer. These are FACTS.</p>
<p>To ignore the fact of a growing movement as an appeal to opinionated diatribe is intellectually obscene at best, and moral bankruptcy at worst. How is it that in America a group of people who promote honest, level-headed and rational discussion of law are considered "dangerous"? In America the citizenry is entrusted with government oversight and that can only be achieved through honest, tough-minded discourse that makes use of all the facts. Wikipedia is an excellent resource in that it makes this exchange possible by providing ALL the factual evidence necessary. Burying one's head in the sand at the sound of a movement he disagrees with is inherently un-American and close-minded.</p>
<p>If this page is truly dangerous then we need to close down pages covering other topics that might "fool" honest people. Simply pick ideas you disagree with and request deletion. Absurd.</p>
<p>I see this page as prompting more dialouge covering the issue, which, of course, can be covered by Wikipedia. For example, anarcho-capitalism has its own page but with links to sites that are critical of the theory. Why not employ the same open-exchange with respect to the Tax Honesty Movement? Once again, the article is factual. Because it points to facts that some don't like is not grounds for a wild POV accusation.</p>
<p>And if you disagree with the FACT that this movement exists, then go to Bob Schulz's website and view the briefs being filed in federal court, the summaries of his victory over the IRS concerning a summons issue, or see Aaron Russo's film when it comes out.</p>

<p>Why on earth would anyone want this entire topic deleted!? Prior to the American Revolution many colonists 'went to jail' for opposing tyrannical government and oppression. One cannot justify the removal of a concept, a phrase, a reality simply because there have been penal consequences for a few brave souls that stand up for truthfulness; that stand up for clearly written rights known to many through the bible, others through 'common sense' and fewer still from our written constitution.

<p>There is a clear POV with this issue in the suggestion to delete Tax Honesty. To try to group everybody into a Tax protestor category is clearly a POV to degrade the message of people wanting honesty. Tax Protestor and Tax Honesty are clearly two different things. Tax protestor’s are just protesting something they owe. Tax Honesty is stating the law is misapplied.</p>
<p>The goal of those that are demanding the Tax honesty be grouped into Tax protestors are imposing a POV. For this reason alone Tax Honesty should be separate. The proper thing to do is to take anything in the tax protestor listing that would infer a Tax honesty position, that the law is misapplied, and move it to tax honesty. To do otherwise is clearly a POV contrary to the purpose of Wikipedia.

<li>This is simply incorrect. Tax resisters refuse to pay a tax that they owe. Tax protesters deny that they owe any tax, stating that the law is misapplied. The arguments that no taxes are owed because the Sixteenth Amendment was never ratified, or that the Sixteenth Amendment gives no power to tax, or that no law passed by Congress assesses an income tax, or that wages are not income, or that the IRS is not empowered to collect taxes, or that U.S. dollars are not money, or that the failure of the IRS to answer questions about its authority proves a lack of authority, or that no tax is owed because the United States ceased to operate under the Constitution during the Civil War, these are <i>all</i> arguments explicitly classified by U.S. courts and tax professionals alike as arguments of the tax protester movement. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 13:46, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

And the far-reaching effect of this erroneous assumption will be made clear by generalizing the many contentions advanced in argument to support it ... But it clearly results that the proposition and the contentions under it, if acceded to, WOULD CAUSE ONE PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION TO DESTROY ANOTHER; that is, they WOULD RESULT IN BRINGING THE PROVISIONS OF THE AMENDMENT exempting a direct tax from apportionment INTO IRRECONCILABLE CONFLICT WITH THE GENERAL REQUIREMENT that all direct taxes be apportioned. ... Moreover, the tax authorized by the Amendment, being direct, would not come under the rule of uniformity applicable under the Constitution to other than direct taxes, and thus it would come to pass that the result of the Amendment would be to authorize a particular direct tax not subject either to apportionment or to the rule of geographical uniformity, thus giving power to impose a different tax in one state or states than was levied in another state or states. ...

<p><b>KEEP</b></p>
<p>Mr. 2412's willingness to keep a category like <i>Tax Protestor</i> and delete one called <i>Tax Honesty</i> is itself a POV. It ignores the point he makes himself above. The term <i>Tax Protestor</i> is a POV label invented by beneficiaries of the fraud, if indeed there is a fraud, being perpetrated by missapplication of perfectly Constitutional but deliberately confusing tax laws.</p>
<p>The notion that lying and deception are the exclusive provence of those not in line for government pensions is optimistic at best. Most "tax protestors" risk far more than they stand to gain in saved taxes. At the same time tax collectors, accountants, attorneys and other "tax professionals" can protect comfortable incomes and benefits with no risk at all by defending a misapplied law.</p>
<p>If indeed it turned out that Title 26 were being misapplied and the income tax only applied to certain Federally privileged activities, a large portion of the current tax enforcement and compliance sector would have to seek honest work. For that reason alone tax professionals and tax enforcement agencies, including the federal courts, cannot be considered neutral parties to the discussion. It would surprise me if the chief advocate here of deleting the <i>Tax Honesty</i> heading, Mr. 2412, was not among those whose economic fortunes are in some part dependent on the current popular interpretation of Title 26.</p>
<p>The very persistence of a movement that questions the legitimacy of the U.S. income tax laws, in spite the possibility of heavy fines and long prison terms, is reason enough to include both <i>Tax Protestor</i> and <i>Tax Honesty</i> in Wikipedia. We do not have "protestors" or "truth seekers" involved with any of the hundreds of other taxes imposed by Congress. There are no protests or doubts of the legitimacy of excises on gasoline, liquor or air fares, for instance. Those laws are clearly written and easily understood. The mind numbing complexity of the tangle lawmakers have created in Title 26 implies a desire to deceive rather than enlighten.</p>
<p>It would not contribute to the search for truth to eliminate one heading or to incorporate it under the other. If they were to be merged, it should be under a truly neutral heading like "U.S. Income Tax History." Otherwise Wikipedia should not be bullied by strongly held opinion in favor of censoring one POV.

<li>Like it or not, this group is composed of persons long defined as tax protesters. I'm really baffled by those who think "Tax protester" is a POV term, as "protester" is not inherently negative. If the main article were instead called "Tax liars" or "Tax idiots" then I would also argue for movement to a neutral title - but many groups have proudly borne the label of protester - consider "Civil rights protesters", who also refused to abide by laws which they rightly believed were unconstitutional and illegally enforced. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 13:10, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I cannot fathom how others consider this POV. The article lays out the facts that define the term "Tax Honesty Movement" without injecting the opinion of the original author.

I could detect no attempt at swaying the reader to a particular POV.</p>

<li><b>KEEP!</b> Mr. <i><b>BD2412</b></i>, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia for everyone. Even those who refuse to share your personal views.</li>
<li>Show us the law. It seems that Wikipedia has a "law" called the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>.

Therefore, one must use the criteria found in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. I demand that you show us EXACTLY which item(s) from the table "Problems that MAY require deletion" (notice the use of the word "may" in the title) that you believe apply to this article. ALL OF THE ISSUES you have raised thus far have solutions in the table "Problems that DON'T require deletion." You might be shocked to find that deletion is not a solution listed in the second table. Also, I expect and demand that you will follow the guidelines and policies set forth at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators</a> which states in part:</li>

<li>While you're reviewing these Wikipedia guidelines, you may want to refer to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Sockpuppets_are_bad" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion#Sockpuppets are bad</a>, which states that "Because of our past problems, <i>opinions</i> offered by new or anonymous users are often met with suspicion and may be discounted during the closing process. This decision is made at the discretion of the closing admin after considering the contribution history and pattern of comments." As you can see, the question of deletion is out of my hands - it will be made by a closing administrator, who will likely discount the votes cast by anons and brand new users, particularly where most of those anons and new users appear to be part of the group that they are claiming should have an article. I have no control over whether you get notice or mediation, but I would point out to you that Wikipedia is not a government agency, but a private company, and has no obligation to provide due process. You have already had the opportunity to be heard in this forum, and our deletion process is pretty clear that once five days have passed, an admin may close this AfD and delete the article if that represents the consensus of established Wikipedians. Cheers! <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 13:10, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Mr. <i><b>BD2412</b></i>, Ouch! Please review <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers</a>! Is there any reason you left out the last two lines of the paragraph from <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Sockpuppets_are_bad" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion#Sockpuppets are bad</a>? The entire paragraph reads:
<ul>
<li>"Because of our past problems, opinions offered by new or anonymous users are often met with suspicion and may be discounted during the closing process. This decision is made at the discretion of the closing admin after considering the contribution history and pattern of comments. In practice, civil comments and logical arguments are often given the benefit of doubt while hostile comments are presumed to be bad-faith. Please note that verifiable facts and evidence are welcome from anybody and will be considered during the closing process."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I pray that the closing admin will consider "verifiable facts and evidence" in making a decision and post an opinion based on such. BTW: Any reason you have not shown this discussion, as I previously requested of you, which problem listed in the table "Problems that MAY require deletion" in the article <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a> that you believe apply to the <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_Honesty_Movement_6794.html" title="Tax Honesty Movement">Tax Honesty Movement</a> article. This "newbie" (I am not a sockpuppet!) is requesting clarification from you, the admin who initiated the deletion process. Please, show me the "law"!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, please clarify for me a statement you made in your previous post. Is the <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home" class="external text" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia Foundation</a> a private company, or is it a private or public non-profit foundation? There is no question as to your bias. False statements, however, diminish your credibility.--Dicktater 19:38, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I quoted the portion of the rule that is relevant to this discussion. Please show me the law that says that "a private or public non-profit foundation" can not also be a private company, and must instead be a government entity required to provide you with notice and an opportunity to mediate before material on its website can be changed. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 19:44, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>KEEP IT AS IS.</b> There is an enormous amount of misinformation about the Tax Honesty Movement. Members of the Tax Honesty Movement and those known as tax protestors are two groups that do not overlap by definition. The former advocates administration of the tax law as written by Congress and as adjudicated by the US Supreme Court, and the latter objects to the tax and/or the law as currently administered, regardless of how it is written or adjudicated by any court. When the day comes that the decision to keep an entry like "Tax Honesty Movement" turns on the effect of revealing the truth and uncovering a lie, then the integrity of Wikipedia will have vanished with its value. - Mark Yannone</p>

<li>The statement was more tongue-in-cheek. But regardless, I provided a link to New York documents that "verify" the existence of a Burshtin Dynasty. In fairness though, it seems sort of silly.

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> I refute Kalsermar's deletion proposal as follows:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>1. This is definitely not a POV (point of view) table - instead the table <i>overcomes</i> POV problems by objectively providing all data such that no particular POV is emphasized. To clarify this point, I made a list of frequent POVs regarding medal counts, and cited sources inside and outside of Wikipedia on the article talk page: Although the International Olympic Committee IOC rejects medal tallies and rankings of nations (e. g., <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2000/medal_tracker/news/2000/09/12/historic_methodology/" class="external text" title="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2000/medal_tracker/news/2000/09/12/historic_methodology/" rel="nofollow">Sports Illustrated</a>), the mass media and Wikipedia publish them anyway - compare the recent <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Winter_Olympics_medal_count_61d1.html" title="2006 Winter Olympics medal count">2006 Winter Olympics medal count</a>. Different sources follow wildly varying habits though. <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> and <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> and others rank nations by the total number of medals, <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> and others by gold. Some simply delete nations such as the USSR that do not exist any more; e. g., see <a href="http://www.tarik.com.au/olympicsallmedals.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tarik.com.au/olympicsallmedals.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Many omit the number of participations per country (the USSR participated rarely, but usually won the medal count whenever they did). Some demand tallies with an entry for the <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU">EU</a>, just like in GDP tables, e. g.: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_d03f.html" title="List of countries by GDP (nominal)">List of countries by GDP (nominal)</a>; compare the <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20040825-040320-8834r.htm" class="external text" title="http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20040825-040320-8834r.htm" rel="nofollow">Washington Times</a>. The medals of the various fragments of Germany are often but not always added together, e. g., <a href="http://www.halloolympia.de/winterspiele/historie/medaillenspiegel_aller_winterspiele.php" class="external text" title="http://www.halloolympia.de/winterspiele/historie/medaillenspiegel_aller_winterspiele.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> and also in the German Wikipedia. The medals of the USSR and its successor state CIS are frequently but not always added together. Often the medals of USSR and CIS are added to those of Russia, which is smaller but viewed as their political heir, e. g., <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympische_Winterspiele/Ewiger_Medaillenspiegel" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympische_Winterspiele/Ewiger_Medaillenspiegel" rel="nofollow">here</a> at Wikipedia. Many mention the medals per capita, e. g., the <a href="http://abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/57a31759b55dc970ca2568a1002477b6/be9f47591541e29eca256ef40004f25a!OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/57a31759b55dc970ca2568a1002477b6/be9f47591541e29eca256ef40004f25a!OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> and <a href="http://www.sport1.at/coremedia/generator/id=3311806.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sport1.at/coremedia/generator/id=3311806.html" rel="nofollow">Sport1.at</a>. So we observe that there are a lot of medal count POVs out there! What I did was to combine all the data such that nobody's POV is dominant - different countries rank first in different categories, but of course we must keep in mind that none of these rankings is endorsed by the IOC, the only authority. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 14:23, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>2. This is not original research - the table is based on data already available at Wikipedia. Unless the activity of adding and dividing numbers counts as original research? But by that reasoning one would have to delete many of the Wikipedia medal tables, such as the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Olympics_medal_count_2237.html" title="Total Olympics medal count">Total Olympics medal count</a>, which adds summer counts and winter counts. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 14:23, 31 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Choosing figures, labelling them, deciding what calculations to perform on them is indeed original research. For example, labelling a figure as the population of the Soviet Union, which differs by 23 million from the estimated 1991 population, doesn't do anything to overcome POV problems. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-03-31&#160;18:27&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<li><b>Response</b> No original research - see above! The table is purely based on data already available at Wikipedia. Or is the activity of adding numbers original research?

Of course you are right, the Wikipedia sources should be mentioned - but it's easy to do this - no reason to delete the article. In the talk page or the article page?

<li><b>Response</b> No original research - see above.

<p>To summarize, the objections either are not valid (no POV etc, no original research, many relevant sources cited) or can easily be addressed, by inserting statements about where the data came from (namely, Wikipedia) and how the numbers were computed (by adding and dividing Wikipedia data, just like in many other Wikipedia tables). Therefore I propose to keep this (in my humble opinion) very useful table, reminding everybody that Wikipedia is not a democracy. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 14:23, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> the author has an obvious POV <i>and</i> conducted original research here contrary to his transparant claims to the contrary. Could author explain how he got the EU's data and the USA's population figures for previous games for instance? (Using external, verifiable sources of course.) The ratios per capita can only really work for 1 edition of the Games at a time since these vary widely between 1896 and the present. I respectfully echo <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka">Grandmasterka</a>'s advise to the author.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 15:36, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Kalsermar claims the author has an obvious POV, without saying what that POV is. What is it? And please keep in mind what I said above about the population data (also in the article talk page), such that I do not have to repeat it again every time: "The latest available population data [readily available at Wikipedia] is used for the per capita entries - maybe one could instead average out the medal per capita data for all years when the nation participated". So please take note that I wouldn't mind the creation of per capita entries based on year by year population data. I suspect though this will yield rather similar results - as the populations grew, so did the number of disciplines and medals per Games. But yes, this would be an interesting task.

<li><b>Userfy</b>, per all the above. @Medalstats: "original research" in this case refers to the fact that you invented the methodology of comparison. Instead of deleting it, I suggest userfication, which means you'll be able to keep your own personal statistics in your userspace, but this is definitely not material for an encyclopædia. —<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_esperanza_7d46.html" title="User:Nightstallion/esperanza"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion"><i>(?)</i></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Elections_and_Referenda_04e7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Elections and Referenda"><i>Seen this already?</i></a></sup> 17:23, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Thanks for the comment. But which non-trivial methodology of comparison do you think I invented? In case of non-trivial comparisons I gave references. For example, I cited highly visible sources of medals per capita statistics, e. g., the <a href="http://abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/57a31759b55dc970ca2568a1002477b6/be9f47591541e29eca256ef40004f25a!OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/57a31759b55dc970ca2568a1002477b6/be9f47591541e29eca256ef40004f25a!OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>. I cited several sources that sum up medals of countries / organizations that had several National Olympic Committees (NOCs) in the past, e. g., <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympische_Winterspiele/Ewiger_Medaillenspiegel" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympische_Winterspiele/Ewiger_Medaillenspiegel" rel="nofollow">here</a> at Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Thanks for the comment. But I am afraid I have to disagree on all three counts:
<ul>
<li>Verifiability: Easy - just go to the Wikipedia medal counts for each year, and to the Wikipedia population data of any mentioned country - all the information is right there.</li>
<li>POV: Kalsermar also claimed there is some POV, but then failed to explain which POV. So which POV do you mean? I'd really like to know. As pointed out above, the table actually overcomes the problems of narrow POVs: there is no obvioulsy dominant POV; different countries (which may or may not have different POVs) rank first in different categories (but of course we must keep in mind that none of these rankings is endorsed by the IOC, the only authority, which rejects medal tallies and rankings of nations: see <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2000/medal_tracker/news/2000/09/12/historic_methodology/" class="external text" title="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2000/medal_tracker/news/2000/09/12/historic_methodology/" rel="nofollow">article</a>).</li>
<li>OR: None of the arguments above sufficiently explained why exactly this should be considered OR. I certainly did not invent a non-trivial methodology of comparison. I did cite highly visible sources of medals per capita statistics, e. g., the <a href="http://abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/57a31759b55dc970ca2568a1002477b6/be9f47591541e29eca256ef40004f25a!OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/57a31759b55dc970ca2568a1002477b6/be9f47591541e29eca256ef40004f25a!OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is quite clear that Wikipedia articles cannot "introduce an <i>analysis or synthesis of established facts</i>, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, <i>without attributing the analysis or synthesis to a reputable source</i>". That is the case here. Medal tables from individual games (e.g. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Summer_Olympics_medal_count_1f89.html" title="2004 Summer Olympics medal count">2004 Summer Olympics medal count</a>) have clear references (e.g <a href="http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/table_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=2004" class="external text" title="http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/table_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=2004" rel="nofollow">IOC website</a>).

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> But again, what exactly is this so-called "particular case favored by the editor"? What is it? Isn't this just an objective table compactly summarizing all the information you need to put medal counts in perspective? It serves all: those who care for absolute medal numbers, those who want to know how many Games some nation needed to collect how many medals, those who are interested in per capita data, etc. Obviously no particular case is favored by the editor, since different countries rank first in different categories (keeping in mind that none of these rankings is endorsed by the IOC, the only authority, which actually rejects medal tallies and rankings of nations: see <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2000/medal_tracker/news/2000/09/12/historic_methodology/" class="external text" title="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2000/medal_tracker/news/2000/09/12/historic_methodology/" rel="nofollow">article</a>). Generally speaking, you cannot simply claim that a particular case is favored by me as an editor, you must also say what it is. If you fail to do so then your whole argumentation breaks down. Finally, the reputable source of the data is cited: it's Wikipedia itself. You claim that <i>"cumulative tables can do no more than simply sum up the totals by each <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_IOC_country_codes_4c7d.html" title="List of IOC country codes">IOC country code</a>. Anything more is original research, as defined by Wikipedia."</i> Can you back up your claim? Please show me the Wikipedia guideline that says you can sum up data from Wikipedia tables, such as in the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Olympics_medal_count_2237.html" title="Total Olympics medal count">Total Olympics medal count</a>, but you cannot divide by, say, Wikipedia population data. Why should one of the tables be free of "introducing a new analysis or synthesis" but not the other? It seems clear that deletion of the present table due to OR would imply deletion of several other Wikipedia tables such as the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Olympics_medal_count_2237.html" title="Total Olympics medal count">Total Olympics medal count</a> which mixes Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics - I've never seen something like that table outside of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 13:54, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't have to identify exactly <i>what</i> your POV is -- it is sufficient to know that <i>some</i> POV exists. That is clearly obvious because of your desire to "put medal counts in perspective". That implies that you believe that there is currently <b>no perspective</b> in the medal table. That's good! That means that a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> has been achieved by only presenting a simple summation of counts.</dd>
<dd>Other editors have pointed out the inherent inaccuracy and subjectivity in making comparisons over 110 years using only the 2004 population. That should be obvious to you too. However, I <b>would support</b> a proposal that added the following data (only) to those total medal table: number of games competed and first &amp; last years competed. Those numbers are also completely objective.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps that would help you feel that there is some "perspective" in those tables. What do you think? Would that help?</dd>
<dd>However, I <b>cannot support</b> any proposal that combines counts from different NOCs. There was never an EU team at any Olympics; you cannot invent a medal count for this hypothetical team. You cannot add GER, FRG, GDR and EUA together because in some events, that "team" would have twice as many competitors (i.e. chances for a medal) as any other team. You cannot add BOH and TCH (or CZE) together because they represent nations with different geographic boundaries. Similar situations exist in many other places.</dd>
<dd>I agree that the notion of "total" medal counts that span multiple games may be problematic. I would prefer to see only medal table for each games individually. Those are unambiguous. However, if we <i>are</i> to combine totals from across games, it must be done as objectively as possible, and I think that summation by NOC is the most objective way possible. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 18:05, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Response</b> Thanks for your useful remarks! The text on my user page (<i>"put medal counts in perspective"</i>) was badly chosen; I removed it, because that's not really what I want. I want to overcome various existing POVs by providing data (a simple summation of counts is not really neutral as it represents just one of many possible POVs without IOC support). I agree also with what you said about inherent inaccuracy and subjectivity in making comparisons over 110 years! But of course this holds not only for population data which, as you said, has changed over the years, but also for other things that have changed, such as names of nations etc. All total medal counts (with or without per capita rankings) are problematic for such reasons; mine not more so than the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Olympics_medal_count_2237.html" title="Total Olympics medal count">Total Olympics medal count</a> which mixes Winter Games and Summer Games (btw, Summer Games involve many more disciplines, a fact that currently is brushed under the carpet). Regarding combined counts from different NOCs: the IOC charta rejects ALL medal counts, but Wikipedia publishes them anyway - then why should a count with separate NOCs be allowed, and another one forbidden? For example, summing up all the German medals is routine in Germany and other countries (typically an asterisk is used to indicate that East-Germany's medals are added), why not here? Similarly, EU counts don't have more or less IOC support than any other medal count. And obviously it's not the quantity but the quality of the athletes that counts - sending more athletes will help you only in sports dominated by luck (there are not many of this kind). I share your general scepticism towards total medal counts, and I am ready to discuss whether ALL total medal counts at Wikipedia should be deleted for the reasons you mentioned above, but such a discussion should not be limited to this particular article. If we <i>are</i> to combine totals from across games, it must be done as objectively as possible, and I think that my current table is much more informative and objective than a mere summation by NOC. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 14:52, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Saying Liechtenstein accumulated 9 medals in the history of the Olympics is <i>not</i> neautral you say? The IOC does not <i>reject</i> medal tables, they don't endorse rankings but provide them for informational purposes, as do we. The IOC site is full of medal tables. As for mixing winter and summer games... that is a non-issue as both are Olympic Games organized by the same IOC seperated only because of practical concerns such as the difficulty of bobsledding in Sydney in the middle of summer or sailing in Turin in February. In fact there have been two <b>summer</b> games that have in fact hosted sports that are now included in the <b>winter</b> edition. Finally, as Medalstats points out lower down, nobody used Hungary's 1908 population figures. Precisely why this table of his is flawed. If he did use it it would be OR.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 16:02, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Response</b> How can it be neutral if it does not say how often Liechtenstein participated? And the IOC charta does reject medal tables, as has been pointed out frequently, with sources. Please show me an IOC web site that endorses medal tables. But don't show me a non-IOC web site (e.g., the site of some local organizer)! I agree though on one count, Kalsermar: balanced per capita data may need work, at the risk of OR. What about removing the per capita data from the table, along the lines of what Andrwsc suggested? <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 09:22, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is English not your native language perhaps? I pointed out the exact opposite of what you state, namely that the IOC does <i>not</i> endorse rankings based on medal counts but they do provide them for informational purposes. In fact, '<i>all</i> medal count tables published on Wikipedia have been compiled by using IOC pages for verification! You might want to try a novel concept here and actually surf on over to the official IOC website where you will find medal tables for every edition of the Olympics. I'll even offer a helping hand.... go <a href="http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=2004" class="external text" title="http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=2004" rel="nofollow">here</a> and on the right somewhere you will see somewhere down the page a link to "Medals by country". Click on it and you will get the table for Athens 2004.

<dd>Medalstats, how can your table <i>possibly</i> be more objective than a simple count? Do you know the meaning of the word "objective"? On top of the inherent inaccuracy of population figures, the biggest problem with your analogy is that it assumes that all medals are equal (they are not), and that medal counts scale linearly to other variables. They don't! A medal count can only be just that -- a <i>count</i> -- and trying to include it in a mathematical formula introduces POV because it implies a direct relationship with the other factors in each equation you present. I think most people might agree that there is obviously <i>some</i> relationship between medal counts and population, but I would hope most rational people could plainly see that it is not a <i>direct</i> and <i>linear</i> relationship and therefore, that ratio does not make sense.</dd>
<dd>It is becoming clear that you are not willing to consider the arguments and other suggestions presented by other editors here. I offered to support a move to add the number of games competed by each NOC to <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Olympics_medal_count_2237.html" title="Total Olympics medal count">Total Olympics medal count</a> etc. if you thought it would be a sufficient compromise, but you did not respond to that. You continue to offer rebuttals to every other message here without adjusting your position.</dd>
<dd>My suggestion is that you continue your work, but take it off Wikipedia. It is not encyclopedic. Take a look at what Herman De Wael has done at <a href="http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/intro.html" class="external text" title="http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/intro.html" rel="nofollow">this website</a>. He has put together a system that assigns a score to each athlete. I have always thought that something similar could be done to "score" the Olympics, and would be more reasonable than medal counts. You could take this approach and present scores relative to population, GDP, etc. I think many people would find it interesting! However, it would not be encyclopedic, and therefore, <b>does not belong in Wikipedia</b>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 17:44, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Response</b> But a classic way of making data subjective is to simply omit some of the data! In general, more data is more objective than less data. That's why I am including numbers of Games etc. But I am sorry, Andrwsc, for failing to address your support of a move to add the number of games competed by each NOC to <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Olympics_medal_count_2237.html" title="Total Olympics medal count">Total Olympics medal count</a>. That would be a good idea, I think. The number of medal count victories should be listed as well, I think, at least for the medal count winners (this is part of what the current table is about). Finally, I actually agree that per capita data should be based on year by year population data - this may need work, at the risk of becoming OR. What about removing the per capita data from the table? The other data is not subject to similar criticism. Since this seems to be the only serious issue I am addressing it again further down in my summary of 5 April. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 09:22, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To summarize, none of the critics so far was able to identify a particular POV, or to back up the OR claim, or to show that the data is not verifiable, or that the source of the data is not cited.

<dd>Medalstats, I'll humor you. 1)POV, look at user's contributions, the raison d'etre of user is because he doesn't like the nation on top of the medal standings and thus to try everything to get that addressed. Personal attacks didn't work (I was called an ugly American patriot once, quite the compliment for a Dutchman living in Canada!), grouping nations together didn't work, going through the Olympic Conventions page (currently at the Olympics ortal) didn't work so now he tries this table. 2)Verifiability/OR (I'll group these two together). It is original research because author performed analysis on figures purely in an arbitrary manner. Author simply added up 110 years worth of data and divided it by current population values. That is trying to make a point in author's favour. Did author gather the population figures of historical Games. Could author then perhaps describe how he got say... Hungary's population figure for 1908? Bohemia 1920? What about the EU. Surely author discounted EU medals before EU existed and correctly calculated the EU's population for each year it did. If so, that would make it OR again imo. Author cited a Australian analysis based on population for 2004. A reputable source I'm sure. What are his reputable sources of like analysis for 1932?--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 15:54, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b> Ah, but the problem is that most of the delete votes here and the support votes there are from a clique of users that have a record of systematically trying to suppress certain information.

I'd also argue for making this article more widely known, such that those who are apparently eagerly tracking every move I make are not the only ones who present their views on this site. Finally, this is not about facts such as 1+1=2, but about the way such facts are used to make a certain impression on the reader.

<p><b>Comment</b> I agree that it is <i>slightly</i> improved, but I still have several major issues with this table, all of which would influence me to recommend deletion of the page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inclusion of the population data, even though you removed the derived statistics from those numbers, is still problematic. It is unclear at best, or intentionally misleading at worst, to show a "latest data" figure on a table that shows all-time (110 years) medal counts. The presence of this data makes an implied relationship which is then left undefined. It doesn't fit.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b> You have a point. The best way to include population data would be to use year by year data, but that would amount to OR. What a devil's circle! On the other hand, as the population grew, so did the number of Olympic disciplines - the latest population data is quite representative in terms of former population ratios. And isn't some sort of information about the population necessary to clarify certain facts such as: tiny Norway had nearly half as many medal count wins as the 60-fold bigger biggies? <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 09:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Medal count wins" and "Gold count wins" certainly implies that there is a competition between NOCs to win the most. I think the official position of the IOC must be followed on Wikipedia: no nation "wins" an Olympics, but medal counts are still presented (using their ranking method) for informational purposes.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b> I greatly sympathize with this view, but by this reasoning we'd have to delete all the medal counts of Wikipedia, since the official position of the IOC is: no medal counts! See this <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2000/medal_tracker/news/2000/09/12/historic_methodology/" class="external text" title="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2000/medal_tracker/news/2000/09/12/historic_methodology/" rel="nofollow">link</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 09:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The official position of the IOC is that medal counts are not used to compare nations in terms of "who beat who", but they <b>do</b> provide medal tables anyway. That's precisely what we do on Wikipedia. They certainly don't try to analyze the results any more than that, and neither should we. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 19:28, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Medals per Games" and "Gold per Games" are problematic because the number of events per games varies widely. Summer Games now have about 300 events; recent Winter Games around 90. Past Games were <b>much</b> smaller: Winter Games used to have 20-25 events, for example. Therefore, this kind of derived measurement would skew negatively towards NOCs that did not compete in the Winter Games, and would skew positively toward nations that competed only in recent games. Your placement of "CIS" (imprecise, should be EUN) as first in golds per games and medals per games bears this out. That team only competed in 1992. Any kind of "per games" data would have to be normalized across all games to have any meaning.</li>
</ul>

But by that reasoning we'd have to delete the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Olympics_medal_count_2237.html" title="Total Olympics medal count">Total Olympics medal count</a> as well - it skews positively towards nations that did better in the Summer Games than in the Winter Games, which have fewer disciplines! Moreover we'd have to delete ALL total medal counts as they skew positively towards nations that participated frequently. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 09:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The combination of different NOCs as "teams" to be compared is highly problematic. You are comparing apples to oranges. Look at a team sport like <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_polo_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_7ebd.html" title="Water polo at the 2004 Summer Olympics">water polo</a>. The "EU team" would have multiple entries and win multiple medals. No single nation has that opportunity. What does a "98%" value for "Medal count wins per Games" for the "EU team" mean? Who can tell?</li>
</ul>

<dd><b>Response</b> True. In water polo and ice hockey and relays etc the EU could not win gold and silver and bronze, but only one of them.

<p><b>Weak Delete</b>: Although contrary to Olympic spirit, people do like obsessing over medal totals and rankings, sometimes by very odd criteria. But I don't see this article as making a contribution. For example, the whole point of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_Team_f81a.html" title="Unified Team">Unified Team</a> was that they didn't want to be thought of as the Soviet Team. It's too diverse a topic for simple calculations to provide meaningful insights, and a more complex analysis would be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b> Thanks for your opinion. Given some of the comments above, I am already glad that the delete votes are getting weaker. I totally agree that medal counts are contrary to Olympic spirit. But if we are to use them, it must be done as objectively as possible, and I think that my current table is much more informative and therefore more objective than quite a few others here at Wikipedia. Re: your specific points: I think many Russians and ex-Soviets want to include the old USSR medals in the rankings. Similarly for Germany. It's also done frequently: many sum up USSR/CIS/Russian medals and those of the various fragments of Germany, e.g., here at the all time winter medal count of the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympische_Winterspiele/Ewiger_Medaillenspiegel" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympische_Winterspiele/Ewiger_Medaillenspiegel" rel="nofollow">foreign Wikipedia</a>. My table is objective in the sense that it provides variants: with and without CIS, with and without East Germany, etc. No particular POV can dominate. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 11:21, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is a Russian or German POV respectively. We are the English language WP. I will repeat once more, the IOC provides medal tables on their site. We use those. We also have them added up to compile a total count. No POV whatsoever, in line with the IOC and in line with the supermajority views of the contributors to the pages on WP that deal with the Olympic Games. The one-issue account of User Medalstats cannot change that fact.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 14:13, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Response</b> Russian or German POV, huh? Seems like a rather funny contradiction in itself. Traditionally the German and Russian POVs have been extreme opposites, haven't they? This is an international encyclopedia which should not endorse any POV. My table certainly does not - so far even Kalsermar himself has not been able to say what kind of POV there is. Instead he is still trying to claim that adding up the numbers for his <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Olympics_medal_count_2237.html" title="Total Olympics medal count">Total Olympics medal count</a> is somehow different from adding up the numbers for my Olympic Medal Statistics: Medal Count Winners. The IOC supports none of them, as explicitly stated on the IOC web site. Why is my table OR / POV but not his? One stands or falls with the other, right? <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedalstats_9ed4.html" title="User:Medalstats">Medalstats</a> 15:30, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wrong again.... <i>I</i> don't <i>have</i> a table. The total counts table is compiled by simply adding up the numbers using IOC provided data, how official can you be. They provide them for informational purposes and so does WP. For your information btw, the total medals count table has been through an AfD and survived with flying colours. I am heartened to see that you are beginning to finally see the light, namely that WP should not endorse a POV, so we finally agree that performing no analysis or manipulation of the data but simply keeping the raw numbers as noted on the total medals count table is the best way to go so that our readers may interpret the numbers as they see fit? BTW, I actually have stated what your POV is. One needs only to look at your contributions to see that you have a one-issue account created solely for the purpose of presenting the medals counts any way but straightforward because you don't like who's on top. If unsuccesfull, you'd rather see them deleted altogether. Now, may I respectfully ask we stop repeating our arguments ad nauseam and let the AfD process conclude?--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 17:55, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not exactly a typical NPOV problem, but the article give undue legitimacy to its calculations. The various Olympic games have had different participants, different events, different numbers of medals awarded. There isn't a meaningful way to put them together. The weird lists like medals won by Portuguese-speaking countries or Commonwealth countries or EU countries aren't really trying to be meaningful. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 21:22, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, to want to remove this because parts of it are of a speculative nature is a bad reason. The show is in progress and the information becomes more solid over time; if this kind of thing was not allowed on wikipedia, there wouldnt be an in-progress tvshow template. Also, Jtrost, you have no right to talk down to and discredit people that havent been here long, how would you like it if no one listened to your thoughts and opinions during your first week or two here? Everyone's opinion matters as long as it is presented logically and should not be disregarded merely because one side wants to win the argument. Back to the main point, based on the massive amount of information surrounding this map, I dont believe it is a good idea to shove it into DHARMA, it will grow too fast too quickly. If you're worried that every little thing in lost will have it's own article, then why not just give it a few weeks to see if the map is of actual importance (kind of like Drive Shaft is relevant enough to have an article), if it ends up being just another plot device thrown in by the writers, then we'll merge. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 11:24, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since you thought it was appropriate for your argument to put words in my mouth, I'll go ahead and explain. I did NOT say that if we have the template we are allowed to make the article speculative, what I DID say was that the show is in progress, and a few parts of the article will end up being of a speculative nature. If you actually spent the time to read the article, you'd see that most of it is a description of the map, if you're sole argument is that there are some lines that say things like "has been speculated that", then you have no real argument. It is easy to clean it up and make it contain only facts.<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 01:16, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While there are many reasons why this page should be merged with the <a href="../../../d/h/a/DHARMA_Initiative_53a3.html" title="DHARMA Initiative">DHARMA Initiative</a>, it seems that for now, from the perspective of a fan of the show, that this entry should be its own entity.

<li><b>Comment</b> "of what we do know, the map is 100% about DHARMA dealings", isn't that speculative in itself? You're assuming it is 100% DHARMA, but we don't know enough about the map to determine even that for sure. Just because it's in The Swan, doesn't mean it belongs in the DHARMA category. As a note to everyone who says info from the map is too speculative, you wont acknowledge even the existence of The Swan as a hatch on the map (because you keep removing those lines from our edits), so you logically shouldnt claim that it belongs in the Dharma category for any other reason than it being on the blast door (and I say that's not enough of a reason to merge with Dharma). Things are so vague at this point, that the map might even end up better fitting a merge with a character or The Hanso Foundation (if it doesn't get merged/deleted by then). <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 22:44, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wrote the original article based on only what was visible in the original image (first link in external links),which is from the show. The extra stuff like the formalae and the time line were written after the other image was found online, so look at the original image and compare with what I wrote originally, you'll see that there is at least a decent amount of info on it. A lot of it also has to do with where the map is, and how it was found in the episode. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 13:04, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm to understand that <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> magazine ran an article on the map, which can serve as one, limited source. HOWEVER: the map is clearly intended by the writing staff to provide water-cooler speculation, thus extreme care should be taken when including it, as much of its scribblings may merely be fan-entertainment, and not appropriate to Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Rename</b> - Although the article admittedly started out as much fancruft (which is when it'd been listed AfD), it has since grown significantly past that. The information contained in it now is from the show or from the citable source of the EW article (which analysed and translated much of the map). Also from previews, the map will figure prominantly in next week's episode so much of the information here will likely be verified by that, and it would be a pain to then recreate all of it after a deletion. However, the article should certainly be renamed as the current name is both non-distinct (what does "ultraviolet map" even mean?) and incorrect (it's blacklight, not ultraviolet). <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 13:08, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am one of the directors of MLOT and poster of the page and I take offense at being called spam. You have a list of [social networking websites] on Wikipedia which include sites with far small userbases and which are not comprehensive products, let alone have unique patented technology offering products that no other blogging platform does. Delete this if you like but you are using Wikipedia as an anti-competitive platform when you discriminate based on the opinions of a few people who have probably not taken the time to explore the site themselves. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Calanh (<a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalanh_8cf2.html" title="User talk:Calanh">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Calanh_2155.html" title="Special:Contributions/Calanh">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>As is, this reads as advertcruft.

<li>If you remove this page I would like clarity as to why there are 1940 social networking sites, many of which are poorly developed, unknown and contain no Google rank, listed on the Wiki site?

I am not a spammer and I am sure anyone researching the site will understand its popularity.

<p><strike>This page reads a lot like an ad for something that's not really defined well (ICT; the entry on the disambig page for that is two red links and a poorly-written description).

<p>After looking at the disambig page again, this seems to make a little more sense.

<li>It's just a heuristic I use. I don't know that it's verifiable, but things I hear a lot about, that aren't closely related to my own life or work, are often verifiable. For me, that's enough to keep the stub around for a few months, in case someone can verify it. I don't care much about this particular article, but since you commented I wanted to explain my thinking. (Also, I just noticed that the article <i>has</i> been around for six months already, which does make me feel less strongly about keeping it.) --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 04:21, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>User:Fame liver4ever I see you all are judging based on very little evidence. You haven't clearly stated your reasoning, and reports of her being false...I'd like you all to back that up. Show me firm evidence that this actress is a fake, which you have failed to do so far. The reason I have bent some rules is the fact that almost everyone on here is being inexplicitly rude to me in their consideration about this page. I have been almost cornered as if you were all a pack of dogs and I was an innocent newbie. Yes I've done bad deleting some comments, but it was because you all did not fairly consider my proposal. I wish you all could see how unfairly you have treated me, and at least consider my arguing case. (By the way only two of those are my puppets, not all) Also you saying she's played bit roles, doesn't mean she shouldn't be on here at all. Again with your lack of consideration. Try to be fair, please.</p>

<dd><b>Read the policies</b> Information for Wikipedia must be <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">VERIFIABLE</a></b>. It is not up to anyone to prove the entries false; you must be able to prove them true. You claim she's in the new Pirates of the Carribean movie. IMDB lists a dozen major cast members and 73 supporting actors. None of them is her. Every piece of information you have posted about her (about yourself?) has proven impossible to verify. Your actions in trying to pretend to be multiple people, and in repeatedly changing and vandalizing entries in this discussion, cast serious doubts about your honesty in general, so your unsupported word doesn't count for much.

Mr. Mathes started a Google bomb as a joke at the expense of a friend and graphic artist, Andy Pressman, managing to get Mr. Pressman's blog listed as the first result for the phrase "talentless hack."</i> New York Times, Jan 22, 2004, pg G2. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 22:12, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> User Kotepho has proven with his lexis/nexis search that Andy Pressman is clearly a graphic designer. It doesn't seem to me that User talentlesshack has purported anything else. As to the work on Michael Moriarty's Presidential run, it seems to me that this is inherently true solely based on the design example on the Andy Pressman Wikipedia page. This rush to judgement makes it all too difficult for new members to add pertinent and justified information to this encyclopedia. Give authors a reasonable amount of time to prove thier sources.

<dd>Cappy, you've got 2 Andy Pressmans confused. The architect has written many books and appears to be notable as an author. The graphic designer (subject of this page) was the subject of the googlebomb and is otherwise nn. The only one of the 11 unique hits on google <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22andy+pressman%22+%22graphic+designer%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22andy+pressman%22+%22graphic+designer%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> for "andy pressman" +"graphic designer" with direct relevance to the subject is to his personal blog. The nominated page is otherwise a hoax (have you seen the page? the artwork?) and the author has not only included nonsense about the death of the pizza delivery guy here, he put it on <a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizza_delivery.html" title="Pizza delivery">Pizza delivery</a> as well. He's been spreading other cruft as you'll see from the diffs above. On the Pizza deliver page, it says that Andy Pressman shot a pizza guy called Sanjay Maryani (he redlinked him for good measure) - guess how many googles for their combined names? <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22andy+pressman%22+%22Sanjay+Maryani%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22andy+pressman%22+%22Sanjay+Maryani%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> Kinu caught it and reverted. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></b></a> 00:55, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: As the creator of this article, I would point out that there <i>are</i> less notable articles than this on Wikipedia. The visit is significant for the region and is receving strong coverage in the British press. The article is also likely to expand as the visit progresses. The strongest reason to keep this article, however, is that the visit merits inclusion in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn.html" title="Blackburn">Blackburn</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and a brief mention in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condoleezza_Rice_57ca.html" title="Condoleezza Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a>.

<dd>neologism makes it original research Xander76 22:03, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think it should be deleted because it's not a word that is being used widely (or even narrowly) with that definition. According to the page on deletion, neologisms are candidates for deletion because they constitute original research, and the fact that there are no citations in the article arguably breaks verifiability. The incident with the photo that this definition refers to was publicized within the last 48 hours; I would argue that this article is an attempt to create a new word. That seems like reason enough to delete to me. I am, however, very new to this process, so please forgive me if I am mistaken/stepping on toes. Xander76 22:23, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. No reason to delete. IT's a new word, but certainly could enter the lexicon. yawanur</p>
<p>If wikipedia is to be <i>the</i> encyclopedia for the new century, it has to accommodate innovative and catchy slang as it is developing. We should keep the word. And honestly, since the congressman is a lying shmuck, who cares?</p>
<p>Personally, I don't see this word catching on, but whatever. Maybe include a NPOV note up top, but it's a bit early to delete it. - HG</p>
<p>Agreed -AS</p>
<p>There are a lot of words that could enter the lexicon and haven't. I could make up a few right now. Until it does enter the lexicon, though, why should Wikipedia cover it? Doesn't that amount to suggesting new words and conducting original research? Xander76 22:26, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's leave it -CBH</p>
<p>I agree that there should be an NPOV note--but this is clearly not original research. Blogs are already using this term, and a friend of mine referred to something as 'Kaloogian' today as well. Let's keep it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting; I would have thought this would be a pretty obvious delete, but as I say, I'm super new to this. Can anyone who wants to keep it explain to me why they think the article is not original research? The guidelines for deletion indicate that "Original research (including the coining of neologisms)" is a valid reason for deletion. Thanks. Xander76 22:33, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Funny, the only example of this usage I could find was in a blog referring to the Wikipedia entry, which raises the odd possibility that the Wikipedia article might actually create the word and thereby justify its entry in Wikipedia. Makes my head spin. An NPOV note might be a good route (especially given that the example sentence seems to me a little snide), but if the word is in use, there should also be some citations, yes?

<p><b>Delete</b>: per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - Wikipedia is not a slang and/or idiom guide. Also, if blogs are being considered as a valid source, its time to review <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:VERIFIABILITY</a> again. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 22:41, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Putting aside the slang/idiom debate for a bit, it's being used on blogs is kind of irrelevant. That has nothing to do with verifiability. The definite article is also used frequently on blogs, as is the past tense of verbs, and their credibility is not in question.</p>
<p>There are two problems I see right now: one, if it does exist around the blogs, it's unsourced. Two, how is this not a dictionary page? Why Wikipedia and Wiktionary? Notapipe 22:42, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I say keep it.--<a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickius_e0e2.html" title="User:Dickius">Dickius</a> 22:52, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The definition appears OK. This incident has been reported by the AP, not just by blogs. The word may or may catch on, but there is no reason to delete it. -JAR</p>
<p>I say preserve. Preserve with extreme prejudice. - WRD</p>
<p>This is not a discussion about whether the incident itself should be included in Wikipedia. It in fact already is in the article for <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Kaloogian_2c1c.html" title="Howard Kaloogian">Howard Kaloogian</a>. The question is whether an article about the very new slang term "Kaloogian" merits an article. I say no, for 3 reasons: (1) As Hetar says above, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> says that Wikipedia is not a dictionary and entries that just define a word do not belong. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> also specifically says articles defining slang terms are not appropriate. (2) There is no sourcing in the article, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:VERIFIABILITY</a> says that sourcing is considered to be the burden of those who include an entry in Wikipedia. (3) The article feels NPOV to me, especially given that the example sentence has a partisan tinge. Any of those reasons seem to me reason enough to delete. All that being said, if the word actually becomes widely used in the blogosphere, and we have good sources for that usage, I could agree that it might merit a sentence in the Baghdad Photo Incident section of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Kaloogian_2c1c.html" title="Howard Kaloogian">Howard Kaloogian</a>.

<b>Delete</b>. I am personally politically aligned with the left, and thus hope this word catches on and takes root. <i>However</i>, I support deleting this page, for the following reasons: 1) it belongs in Wiktionary, not Wikipedia. 2) it is a clear violation of the "neologisms" section of the Deletion Policy 3) the only arguments for keeping it are partisan.</p>
<p>If the word catches on and gets citable use, then this entry can be re-created in Wiktionary with appropriate references. But as it is, I'm not willing to tolerate left-wing political slander just because it aligns with my personal prejudices, just as I don't oppose right-wing political slander just because it conflicts with them. - <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowse_501a.html" title="User:Meowse">Meowse</a></p>
<p><b>Delete</b>. This bozo was at 7% in the polls and was not a serious contender to become his party frontrunner even before this particular episode. I disagree with the argument over blogs: TPM, Kos and Atrios all have much larger circulations than most regional newspapers. Medium should not be grounds for disqualification, notability of the source should. If this became an established term even if only on the left there would be an argument to be made. As it is the subject matter is simply not botable.

Wiktionary would be the appropriate place for a definition, but the background of how the word came to be would seem appropriate here. - sterno74</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. If the word comes into common usage, or even becomes persistent internet slang, then it might be appropriate to give it a definition. But it's been less than a week since it was coined, and odds are the guy'll be forgotten in another week. <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvan_40c1.html" title="User:Evan">Evan</a> 00:25, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b>. This word MIGHT eventually enter common usage, in which case it MIGHT be eligible. But the word has not entered common usage at this time, so it is not acceptable.</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> as unverifiable, unless, prior to the end of the AfD comment period, someone provides a good, verifiable source citation, from some source that isn't in Kaloogian's neighborhood, that shows that the term is in reasonably widespread use. And the source should not be the coiner of the term, because it is important to show that the word is being <i>adopted.</i> At the moment, as I write this, the article contains no source citations whatsoever and thus completely fails the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy which is linked at the bottom of every edit box. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:15, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My 2 cents- preserve it. The methods and degrees of lies/subreptions we're seeing from the Republican Party with regards to the Iraq War are nearly unprecedented in human history, so of course there are few words to adequately describe them.

<li><i>Reply from the creator of the article:</i> Of course. But it's a sweet little idea which is catching on in London. It's a very modest, pro-Wikipedia microproject which has people reading Wikipedia articles at all times of day. I have contributed to a range of Wikipedia articles about serious artists and philosophers, etc; this particular entry is less serious but is, as I say, a little project promoting Wikipedia in London. So I suggest we don't kill it now but at least let it live for six months, then the community can decide to get rid of it then, if necessary. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidgauntlett_83f5.html" title="User:Davidgauntlett">Davidgauntlett</a> 22:26, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Message boards are suitable for Wikipedia. Joe Kiser is insane.Stunnaman2k5</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> InsideCarolina's message boards are notably influential at the school and often are referenced elsewhere. In fact, a very high selling book (To Hate Like This is to be Happy Forever) spends a great deal of time talking about the goings-on at the IC forums, and it makes sense to have an entry for people to reference. 24.163.67.42 01:20, 31 March 2006 (UTC) Scott O</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Inside Carolina isn't a "normal" message board. I don't know of any other message boards that have been alluded to in such publications as Sports Illustrated, "To Hate Like This...", etc. IC is a great message board with a rich history. There is no reason for this entry to get deleted. It is merely a collection of articles from IC's beloved fanbase.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Goheelsduksux (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goheelsduksux_a63c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goheelsduksux">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> IC is probably beyond a message board, and is an online community. Members share a common interest in University of North Carolina and the virtual community provides unique experiences and connections. Beyond the avatars are real people, sharing their wit, wisdom, opinions, dumbness, humor, and emotions. IC has been referenced in books and in the media. Wikipedia entry could be very useful in explaining to newcomers and the rest of the world (1) what is in Roy's little finger, (2) who "I'm Stephanie, my name is Stephanie", (3) the legend of Manhattan Heel, (4) the correct spelling of dook, and (5) that Tar Heel must be two words (don't even ask). brewguru</li>
