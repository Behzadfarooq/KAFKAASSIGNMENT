<p>Ws been a while since sup bro posted on ebaums but sup bro has been busy bro. sup bro has been training hard and hitting the clubs hard bro. sup bro has been training hard so that one day sup bro will be back on the field again bro. sup bro was taken out by a knee injury in college bro, but nobody can hold sup bro back. sup bro is all about the character and image of someone who misses the action of being so talented on the defensive line in 95. sup bro collapsed the pocket and pressured the qb like no other. one time when sup bro’s team was losing, sup bro bull rammed through a guard and center and they fell and the quarterback couldn’t do a clean handoff and sup bro hit the running back and then jumped on the ball and it was our possession. we won the game and the crowd started screaming sup bro and it turned around our season and sup bro became the living legend that he is because sup bro never gives up bro.</p>
<p>and like a true 95 all county lineman sup bro excels off of the field as much as on the field. sup bro owns the clubs like he owned offensive lineman in 1995 bro. when sup bro goes to a club sup bro doesn’t have to wait in lines because sup bro can just walk up to the bouncers and they say sup bro and let sup bro in because they know that sup bro was all county in 95 and is a living legend. and sup bro doesn’t just own the clubs because he was all county in 95. sup bro is also a very good dancer. last week when sup bro was in a club he was dancing with 5 girls at a time because the women can’t resist guys who were all county in 95 and can dance. sup bro was flexing on the dance floor and all of the girls were fighting each other to have a turn touching sup bro’s huge biceps. sup bro ended up taking one of them home and [censored] them and then telling them to leave because sup bro needs his sleep so he can hit the gym hard the next day bro.</p>
<p>and what’s the big deal about this jennicide chick bro? girls like that are throwing themselves at sup bro all of the time because he collapsed the pocket like no other in 95 bro. jennicide, it’s a good thing that you aren’t going out with gavin griffin anymore because now you can be with sup bro and see what it is like to be with a real man. gavin may have a wsop bracelet, but he wasn’t all county in 95. when sup bro goes all-in, you’ll know it.</p>

<p><b>Isopora Hominus</b> is a very dangeruos disease that most people do not even have it until the syptons break out. If you feel pulled to farm animals, such as sheep, you have it. You must quickly call your best friend and ask if they have a cheeseburger. If they say yes, you are cured. If the say anything else, you will imiadiatly be thrown into the sun, where your bone will forever burn.</p>

To <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flare.html" title="Flare">Flare</a> is to 'fly' or skim above water on a pressure wave created under the vehicle, in a manner not unlike flying. The difference is that this pressure wave keeps the vehicle at a fairly constant altitude, a few feet above the water. Speeds of 80-120 m.p.h. are claimed for the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flaring.html" title="Flaring">flaring</a> stage of travel, attained after almost a half-mile take-off, where the vehicle accelerates to almost 60 m.p.h. before leaving the water.</p>

<p>Born to a highly religious family of north Indian Muslims, Rashid Shaz was brought up in a revivalist atmosphere. His uncle Muhammad Hasnain Syed was among the founding fathers of the Jama’at-e-Islami movement led by Syed Abul A’la Maududi in the pre-partitioned India. During the emergency era, in 1977, while the young Rashid was still in school he witnessed the imprisonment of virtually all the male members of his family as a consequence of their association with the Jama’at movement. Later when the political climate changed and the family had some sigh of relief, young Rashid was sent to Aligarh where he obtained his bachelors, masters, M.Phil and Ph.D. degrees in English literature. During his stay on the campus he also edited Tajdeed magazine as well as brought out a special issue of the Aligarh Magazine on the ‘Problems of Muslims in India’. Later, he proceeded to Sudan for his Arabic and Islamic education where he spent some good and most enjoyable moments of his life at the African Islamic Centre (now International African University) and Ma’had Taleem Al-Aali, Khartoum.</p>
<p>As young Rashid had a natural flavour for writing, his articles frequently appeared in respectable journals in English and Urdu while he was still a student. In 1985, he established, with the help of some of his friends on the campus, the Institute of Muslim Ummah Affairs that later organised in New Delhi, in 1991, a National Convention of Indian Muslims. In 1993, he founded the Milli Parliament that held its first grand session in Mawlankar Hall, New Delhi. Later the Milli Parliament held its sessions in different parts of the country; political session – Patna, 1996, Religious Session – Hubli, 1997, Special Session – Indore marking the birth of a new vision for India, 1998, Special Session – Bangalore, 1999. During this period of his intense involvement in the public arena Dr. Shaz also addressed a huge number of public gatherings from as remote areas as small townships in Bihar and Karnataka to major events in the Hague, London and New York. And to sharpen the vision of his friends and supporters he frequently held workshops and training camps at his facilities in Delhi and Aligarh.</p>
<p>In 1994 Rashid Shaz launched Milli Times International from New Delhi that soon became one of the most influential tabloids. For all seven years, as long as the newspaper was in operation, he oversaw its entire activities. In 2004, he launched a bimonthly multi-lingual journal www.futureislam.com to give the ummah a direction and a vision. In post-9/11 world, plagued by alarming confusion in the Muslim mind, futureislam has gradually emerged as one of the major forums where genuine debates within the House of Islam are underway.</p>
<p>Dr. Shaz has authored some twenty books in English, Urdu and Arabic published from New Delhi, London, Beirut and Riyadh. Some of his books have been groundbreaking on issues of Islamic import and a cause intellectual storm. From his revivalist childhood to providing a mesmerising leadership and spending the prime of his life in hectic public activities, Dr. Shaz has experienced various facets of the Muslim mind from close quarters, rather has lived with them. All this, he reflects back, has been crucial for his self-education and for developing his own insight into the nature of the Muslim malaise. Today, he advocates for a major shake-up of the Muslim mind, as he believes that the problem lies nowhere else but right inside the Muslim mind. ‘Those eager to make a new beginning must accept beforehand that the traditional mind will lead them to nowhere. A new Muslim mind is the minimum to start with. Without reactivating our brains we would even fall short of realising in full the nature and magnitude of our malaise,’ he argues in one of the editorials of FutureIslam.com.</p>
<p>Dr. Shaz has widely travelled across the globe, more than a million miles, and has won friends and enemies from among various faith communities. He has been upfront in the formation some international bodies and is associated with a number of leading international forums.</p>
<p>He lives in New Delhi with his two sons and a wife.</p>

Drafting tables are generally referred to by the size. Standard sizes are 23”x36” (610mm x 915mm) to 42” x 84” (1067mm x 2134mm). When buying a drafting table you should consider the size of the drawings you do the space you have for the board and the price you can afford. It’s important the board has a smooth surface but it should be strong too Materials range is soft and hardwoods to Masonite or participle board with a vinyl veneer. The board must be self healing material as compass holes may disturb your drawings in the future If you cannot invest in a drafting table a drafting board is a good alternative drafting board there sizes vary from as small as 9” x 12” to 48” x 72” drafting board re more portable then drafting tables so they can be taken everywhere its important you buy a board little larger then the papers you use to draw on</p>

<p>When trying to put forward an article into wikipedia, it is strict and hard to acheive if you are unfamiliar with public writing. However if done correctly it can spread great knowledge through out the world.</p>
<p>When writing an article, the writing space comes up with this:</p>
<pre>
!-- Follow these three steps to fill out this form:                         --
!-- STEP 1: Put the name of your proposed article in the box above (the one --
!--         labeled "Subject/headline").                                    --
!-- STEP 2: Write your article in the empty space below. USE YOUR OWN       --
!--         WORDS; do not copy content from another website.                --

!--         SPECIFIC source for the information, like a book, or a page on  --
!--         a reputable website. Other editors must be able to check the    --
!--         specific sources you used, so "personal knowledge" or "Google"  --
!--         is not enough.                                                  -- 
!--                                                                         --

<p>—</p>
<p>Walker Caine (born James Wright on Sept. 11, 1959) began in the heyday of Southern Rock which ushered in the era of 80's mainstream metal. He is noted for composing acoustic folk music and adding a hard driving rock sound with a varied vocal style. He is considered by some to be a country artist due to his yearly solo tours, but known to most as a rock'n'roll artist. This crossover fusion had kept Walker Caine out of the spotlight but supported as an underground artist until the surge of the Alternative musical genres.</p>
<p>Walker Caine retired from music in the late 1980's with 8 solo albums and several band projects to his credit and began a resurgence in 2002 after a comment from Cinderella guitarist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_LaBar" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_LaBar" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>Jeff LaBar inspired the new stage name of Walker Caine and released an acoustic effort in 2003 simply entitled "EP-1 Unplugged".</p>
<p>He has been influenced by a century of popular music which reflects in his varied songwriting style but states his major influences as Rare Earth, The Band, Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin.</p>

Nadia Abu El Haj is an Assistant Professor at Barnard College who became the center of a small controversy over archaeology in the land of Israel.</p>
<p>Her 2001 book (a version of her Duke University doctoral thesis,) Facts on the Ground: Archaeological Practice and Territorial Self-Fashioning in Israeli Society is a post-colonial analysis of Israeli society a settler-colonial community that has “invented” an ancient history in the region by the use of archaeology. Abu El Haj “Reject(s) a positivist commitment to scientific methods…” instead, the book is “rooted in… post structuralism, philosophical critiques of foundationalism, Marxism and critical theory… and developed in response to specific postcolonial political movements.” She attempts to demonstrate how "(social) science generates facts or phenomena, which refigure what counts as true or real. One news story summarized criticism of the book, “the book's aim is to undermine the historic connection between the Jewish people and Israel… the critique of Israeli archaeology is poorly researched and written, and … the author's anti-Israel bias undercuts her work.” <a href="http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/11/21/disputes" class="external free" title="http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/11/21/disputes" rel="nofollow">http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/11/21/disputes</a></p>
<p>A separate controversy arose when Abu El Haj charges a prominent archaeologist, David Ussishkin of the University of Tel Aviv with “bad science” on the grounds that “bulldozers are used in order to get down to earlier strata which are saturated with national significance, as quickly as possible” because of “nationalist politics guiding research agendas.” Abu El Haj based her charges on the word of anonymous “archaeologists and student volunteers” who “recounted (the incident) to me after the fact.” <a href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3031" class="external free" title="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3031" rel="nofollow">http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3031</a> <a href="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009599.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009599.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009599.shtml</a> David Ussishkin has denied the accusation. <a href="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009649.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009649.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009649.shtml</a> <a href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032" class="external free" title="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032" rel="nofollow">http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032</a></p>
<p>His denial is supported by the distinguished archaeologist Aren Maier of Bar Ilan University. “...by the way, despite what Abu el-Haj repeatedly states, Israeli archaeologists do not only excavate archaeological remains relating to "their heritage". In fact, as any one can see from the excavations at Tell es-Safi/Gath for example, we deal with, excavate, study, publish and relate to finds from various periods, including "Pre-Israelite", "Post-Israelite" etc.” <a href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032" class="external free" title="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032" rel="nofollow">http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032</a> <a href="http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/12/06/re-discussion-of-nadia-abu-el-hajs-book-on-israeli-archaeology/" class="external free" title="http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/12/06/re-discussion-of-nadia-abu-el-hajs-book-on-israeli-archaeology/" rel="nofollow">http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/12/06/re-discussion-of-nadia-abu-el-hajs-book-on-israeli-archaeology/</a></p>
<p>Reviews by anthropologists were mixed:</p>
<p>“Abu El-Haj provides an important and timely look at some of the politics of self-representation behind the Israeli government's public face, within a broader argument about science's capacity for political involvement and for maintaining and even advancing colonialist policies. However, I reiterate that her failure to present either official Palestinian or public Palestinian/Israeli opinions and attitudes within the context of Israel's (settler) nationalist-archaeological discipline means that answers to the excellent questions she raises are never made clear.” Kimbra L. Smith , University of Notre Dame American Ethnologist Volume 30 Number 2 May 2003 <a href="http://www.aaanet.org/aes/bkreviews/result_print.cfm?bk_id=592" class="external free" title="http://www.aaanet.org/aes/bkreviews/result_print.cfm?bk_id=592" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaanet.org/aes/bkreviews/result_print.cfm?bk_id=592</a></p>
<p>She moves a step forward and examines how the issue of the nation enters the arena of scientific practices. This is probably the primary contribution of the book in relation to other studies of nationalism and archaeology: the focus on archaeological practices as the main object of study…. Nadia Abu El-Haj highlights the continuities between the colonial and the national periods in terms of archaeological reasoning, and claims that there is a "dynamic relationship between empiricism and nationalism ... and the former gave credible form to the latter, not just in narrative, but, even more powerfully, in material cast”…Facts on the Ground offers a unique and pioneering approach to examine the politics of archaeological research. Apen Ruiz, The University of Texas, Austin H-Gender-MidEast (May, 2004) <a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=315181094215190" class="external free" title="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=315181094215190" rel="nofollow">http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=315181094215190</a></p>
<p><br />
Reviews by historians have been negative:</p>
<p>“El-Haj is not a practicing archaeologist. She hardly knows the Hebrew in which many Israeli archaeological debates are conducted. She has taken part in very few actual digs. Yet she confidently condemns Israeli archaeology as a tool of the Zionists. With only gossip to go on, she accuses one archaeologist of bulldozing non-Jewish strata to get to the levels that might offer details about ancient Israel. Bizarrely, she then concludes her book by reversing herself on such desecration, asking us to "understand" sympathetically the Palestinian mob that destroyed Joseph’s Tomb on October 8, 2000. I guess it all depends on whose narrative is being bulldozed.” Jonathan Burack, The Family Security Foundation, December 28, 2006 <a href="http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/homeland.php?id=537580" class="external free" title="http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/homeland.php?id=537580" rel="nofollow">http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/homeland.php?id=537580</a></p>
<p>“The huge amount of evidence and scholarship demonstrating that ‘an ancient Israelite social collectivity emerged,’ becomes in her hands ‘a tale best understood as the modern nation’s origin myth… transported into the realm of history.’ ” Diana Muir and Avigail Appelbaum, History News Network, May 31, 2006, <a href="http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/25976.html" class="external free" title="http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/25976.html" rel="nofollow">http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/25976.html</a></p>
<p><br />
Archaelogists have criticized the book harshly:</p>
<p>The reception by archaeologists was harsh. The dean of Middle Eastern archaeology, William Dever of the University of Arizona, “who has authored more than 20 books on Middle East History, said Ms. Abu El-Haj seems intent on writing Jews out of ancient Middle East history, and demonizing a generation of apolitical Israeli archaeologists in the process. Barnard should deny Ms. Abu El-Haj tenure, he said, ‘not because she's Palestinian or pro-Palestinian or a leftist, but because her scholarship is faulty, misleading and dangerous.’ ” <a href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2946" class="external free" title="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2946" rel="nofollow">http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2946</a></p>
<p>"At the heart of her critique is an undisguised political agenda that regards modern and ancient Israel, and perhaps Jews as a whole, as fictions… "Abu El Haj's anthropology is undone by her... ill-informed narrative, intrusive counter-politics, and by her unwillingness to either enter or observe Israeli society... "The effect is a representation of Israeli archaeology that is simply bizarre... Filling in what is missing from her text becomes fatiguing. In the end there is no reason to take her picture of Israeli archaeology seriously, since her selection bias is so glaring… "Abu El Haj has written a flimsy and supercilious book, which does no justice to either her putative subject or the political agenda she wishes to advance. It should be avoided." Alexander H. Joffe, Lecturer in Archaeology, Purchase College, SUNY Journal of Near Eastern Studies. Chicago: Oct 2005. Vol. 64, Iss. 4; p. 297 <a href="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/008510.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/008510.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/008510.shtml</a></p>
<p>"This book is a deceptively well-written, well researched monograph that superficially bears all the signs of a state-of-the-art contemporary social science study…"Alas, a detailed reading reveals that this book is a highly ideologically driven political manifesto, with a glaring lack of attention both to details and to the broader context... In this review, I will try to focus on several points that I believe point to three cardinal weaknesses of the book: the anti-Zionist/anti-Israeli agendas that taint its very foundations; a glaring misunderstanding and lack of intimate knowledge of details; and the exasperating "tunnel vision" that assumes that Zionism and the State of Israel exist in a vacuum... "Abu el-Haj's anti-Israeli ideology pervades the book. An outstanding example is her reference to "the indigenous Arab inhabitants (some of whom were Jews)" (p. 4). Such terminology simply denies the right of Jewish national self-determination. Coming from a "postcolonialist," this is surprising, but revealing. One cannot escape the conclusion that Abu el-Haj's problem is not the misuse of archaeology in the State of Israel but, rather, its very existence… "Perhaps the most astonishing part of the book is a discussion on the last page of the text (p. 281). Abu el-Haj describes and condones the attack, and subsequent ransacking, by a Palestinian mob on what is known as "Jacob's Tomb" in Nablus in 2001. Several people were killed as a result of this attack; the gleeful tone in which she describes this act of vandalism exemplifies how her political agenda completely overcame her duties as a social scientist… "This book is the result of faulty and ideologically motivated research. One can but wonder how the 1995 dissertation on which it is based was authorized at Duke University and how a respected publisher like the University of Chicago Press could have published such unsubstantiated work.” Maeir, Aren, Professor of Archaeology, Bar Ilan University, Isis, volume 95 (2004), pages 523–524, www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/006114.shtml</p>
<p>"Discussing Israeli archeology as a cultural phenomenon requires an in-depth understanding of Israeli society and, above all, a working knowledge of scholarly Hebrew. Abu el-Haj indicates she studied Hebrew in a desultory fashion, and although her bibliography and footnotes do contain references to Hebrew publications, she appears to have invested lightly in the multitude of Hebrew sources that could have informed her study and made it compelling… As it stands, Abu el-Haj's reading of Israeli academic culture and its relationship to the politics of statehood politicizes the work of Israel's scholarly establishment in a way that can be misleading. Even when granting certain Israeli archeologists their academic integrity, she tends to describe their findings as bent by the state for its own political purposes. This is inaccurate. In fact, Israeli archeology is characterized by lively discussion that values independent scientific inquiry and often undermines conventional wisdom, be it the previous wisdom of peers or that of the nation's foundational narratives. Both the print and electronic media give extensive coverage to archeological digs and displays. The broad outline of that lively debate is well known among those many Israelis who follow archeological developments… Given her interest in cultural studies, it is not surprising that Abu el-Haj casts an exceedingly wide net, and that leads to problems. Her discussion of archeological practice conflates the statements of tour guides, the claims of museum displays, the design of archeological parks in Jerusalem, and the assertions of Israeli political figures—particularly those politicians with strong links to the settler movement—with the research and writing of a highly demanding scholarly discipline... Abu el-Haj misrepresents the Israeli passion for archeology. Its purpose is not to legitimize the national ethos. To the contrary: archeology appeals to Israelis because it offers a visual dimension to a past otherwise firmly anchored in oral and literary traditions. For professionals and amateurs alike, the archeology of the land of Israel is not a vehicle to authenticate the nation's existence or its distinctively Jewish character or the passionate attachment of Israelis to the land they claim as their state. All that is taken for granted by Israel's Jewish citizens and by most of the world as well. Rather it is only those who deny Israel's right to exist or contest the legitimacy of its current borders who deny altogether or compromise Israel's links to the historic past." Jacob Lassner, Professor of History and Religion at Northwestern University, Middle East Quarterly, Summer 2003, <a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/560" class="external free" title="http://www.meforum.org/article/560" rel="nofollow">http://www.meforum.org/article/560</a></p>
<p>Methological criticisms: “Abu El-Haj speaks not with archaeologists who are excavating, but with archaeologists on tours given in conjunction with international archaeological congresses.

<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>This article seeks to find out that in present day loan transactions what measures can ensure the repayments; and how effective they are. The article looks at the customary way of protection: the security _ by way of mortgage and charge; the non-traditional and smart ways that have evolved with the passage of time: quasi-security _ retention of title, hire purchase and sale and lease back arrangements; and other safeguards like contractual covenants etc. Each of these measures of protection, except the covenants, has been discussed in proportion of their importance, particularly, for those who effectively fund companies. Thus the main focus remains on the banks.</p>
<p>CREDITORS’ PROTECTION:</p>
<p>Banks, individual or syndicates, are the entities that effectively fund companies and their operations. They receive deposits on one hand and advance these deposits as loans on the other; and thus make profits. However this process is very delicate, as if enough loans are not granted, little profit would be earned; and if too much loans are granted, ready cash may not suffice to satisfy the demands of the depositors. They have to keep a balance and focus equally on liquidity as well as profitability. (1) In such a situation, they cannot afford to lose huge amounts of money advanced as loans. As long as a business, funded by the banks, continues working smoothly, every one associated with that business is benefited in one way or the other. But when it is unable to work anymore or defaults in discharging its liabilities, it goes bankrupt. In the event of bankruptcy these liabilities are paid out of the proceeds of sale of its assets. Creditors’ claims normally are more in value than the assets of the bankrupt. In such a situation a creditor needs to be in an advantageous position to realize his claims ahead of others. This, typically, can be done by being a secured creditor: who holds some security and is paid off ahead of the other creditors who don’t hold any securities. Banks, usually, while granting loans, obtain security and personal guarantee in addition to the other precautions to safeguard themselves in the event of such unfortunate happenings.</p>
<p>Following are the ways to safeguard the position of the lending banks:</p>
<p>SECURITY (Collateral):</p>
<p>Security is an asset which a lender holds for money he has lent.</p>
<p>“Under the Insolvency Act 1986 (‘the Act’), security is defined by section 248 as ‘any mortgage, charge, lien or other security’. This definition is taken to mean that the rights the creditor have are proprietary in character. The proprietary interest in the debtor’s assets allows the creditor to realize the secured assets to discharge the debtor’s obligation to the creditor.”(2)</p>
<p>Generally, securities include stocks, shares, debentures, bonds, instruments creating or acknowledging indebtedness, warrants and options.(3) More typical term for a security against a debt is ‘collateral’. The document granting collateral or any other charge is called ‘debenture’.</p>
<p>“Under the terms of a debenture, the secured creditor will usually have the power, upon default by the company, either to enter into possession of the assets and sell them to pay off the secured debt or to appoint a receiver with the power to manage and sell the company’s business as a going concern to raise the money.”(4)</p>
<p>That is why the collateral is granted as a routine for obtaining loans throughout the world; and it is the most common feature of commerce in every country(5). However, for financially strong companies, particularly the public corporations, secured loan is not usually an attractive option.(6) That is why ‘large unsecured overdrafts are quite common for established companies.’(7) But in most of the cases security is a common feature, as the secured credit is the ‘principal means of financing’ for ongoing ventures as well as expansion purposes(8).</p>
<p>Security or Collateral, documented as debenture, is secured, usually, by way of mortgage or charge. Both these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, as every mortgage implies a charge, though every charge is not necessarily a mortgage.</p>
<p>MORTGAGE:</p>
<p>It is ‘an interest in property created as a form of security for a loan or payment of a debt and terminated on payment of the loan or debt.’(9) Mortgage is the most typical form of loan security. Through a mortgage, the title of the secured property is transferred in the name of the creditor (mortgagee), which is transferred back to the debtor (mortgager) when the loan is paid off. The most common fixed charge securities created by companies are legal mortgages over land.(10) In the event of default in payment by the debtor, the creditor is entitled to realize his money by sale of the mortgaged property. Thus, a mortgage ensures the repayment of loan of the creditor at the end of the mortgaged period or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>CHARGE:</p>
<p>A charge is also ‘an interest in company property created in favour of a creditor (e.g. as a debenture holder) to secure the amount owing.’(11) It is different from mortgage in the sense that it does not require transfer of title like a mortgage. ‘It merely gives the chargee the right to have the charged assets realized in order to pay off the debt.’(12) As a result, a charge is a security that gives rise to the priority of the holder over unsecured creditors.</p>
<p>A charge can either be a fixed charge or a floating charge. “Every charge, whether fixed or floating, derives from the contract.”(13) A fixed charged is associated with specific assets and limits the debtor’s free dealing with such assets. These can be intangible assets, like shares in other companies.(14) It, being a fixed security, is enforced prior to all other classes of creditors.(15) On the other hand, a floating charge floats over all the assets of the debtor. It usually is suitable in case of those assets the value of which fluctuates, like stocks, cash, shares, book debts etc. It allows the debtor to use the charged assets freely until the event of default or bankruptcy. The floating charge is desirable sometimes because the specific assets lose their value through market fluctuation or depreciation. In that case collateral may not continue to be of sufficient value equivalent to the amount of loan. That is why in certain cases floating charge is preferred by the creditors. However, in case of bankruptcy, not only the fixed charge holders, but the preferential creditors get priority over the floating charge holders in the order of payment.(16) Thus, a floating charge, though necessary in certain situations, does not make its holder a secured creditor in the true sense. But certainly his position is better than that of the unsecured creditors.</p>
<p>The Customary Safeguard:</p>
<p>“Secured creditors are, as a matter of policy, immune from the loss”. (17) While in liquidation the creditors could get only a small percentage of their claims, (18) 75 per cent creditors could get nothing, and only 2 per cent could recover their full amount; (19) banks’ rate of recovery remained as high as 77 per cent as compared to the 27 per cent of the preferential creditors.(20)</p>
<p>In globalized financial system, many companies’ assets and creditors are in ‘more than one jurisdiction.’(21) European Union, too, is to have an internal financial market “with open access to banks’ and financial institutions’ operation in member countries” (22). On the other hand, ‘The fragility of the financial system, built as it is on confidence, can mean that there is a real possibility of systemic risk spreading throughout the system’. (23) In such a situation, banks, like every creditor, get the best security (24) _ though, the security is merely a contingency measure, otherwise primarily, banks loan against feasibility and cash flow (25). Still in case of any unfortunate event like default or insolvency of the debtor, it is only the security that can be the best safeguard for a creditor.</p>
<p>Collaterals by way of mortgage or charge are the most reliable and customary safeguards available to the creditors. But there are certain other measures that can be taken by the creditors to ensure secure repayment of their loans.</p>
<p>QUASI SECURITIES:</p>
<p>Credit is granted on four major grounds: by getting a security, without any security (an unsecured loan), by having guarantee of a third party or by making use of a sale as a security arrangement. (26) These security-by-sales arrangements provide a reasonable level of security to the person who advances money, but in most cases he is not a typical creditor. These transactions, not being typical loans, cannot be described to be made on the basis of security; instead they are said to be made for quasi securities. Hereunder are the most common types of quasi-security:</p>
<p>RETENTION OF TITLE:</p>
<p>In case, a bank finances a company to purchase some machinery, raw material or any other item, it may require retaining of the title of such items with itself unless the full amount loaned for the purchase is paid off. ‘Retention of title clause’ in an agreement, normally, defends such items from any claims by other secured or preferential creditors (27), in case of insolvency of the debtor, as long as this item is recognizable (28). However if such an item is processed and loses its identity before the insolvency proceedings start, then the title cannot be retained.(29) In that case, the title holder will have to be among other unsecured creditors. This type of security is typical for trade creditors. However, a bank can benefit from this method in certain cases; although banks, in case of other creditors, have expressed disapproval of retention of title. (30)</p>
<p>‘Surveys suggest that majority of suppliers employ such clauses in their conditions of sales’(31) But they can only bear a fruit if the user of these clauses are not affected by the complex, time-consuming and expensive legal proceedings involving a number of other secured and unsecured creditors. Critics usually do not find the retention of title clause as useful as it seems on the face of it: ‘the device fails, at the end of long and legally uncertain day, to deliver real protection to the quasi-secured creditor.’(32) It, however, remains equally effective in liquidation, administrative receivership, administration and voluntary arrangement, in the event of insolvency of the debtor. (33)</p>
<p>HIRE PURCHASE:</p>
<p>This is another mode of securitization that is a sale arrangement of the face of it but in fact operates as a security device. It is a method of buying goods in which the buyer advances a small amount as deposit to the seller and takes the possession of the goods (and not the title), as a bailee. The balance price is paid in periodical installments over a longer period of time. When the price is fully paid off, the ownership is transferred to the buyer. During this period from taking possession till getting ownership, if the buyer defaults in payments, the seller can exercise his right to take the goods back being the real owner. This is something like ‘retention of title’. This method is generally used by the small and medium businesses and the trade creditors. But it can be used by the banks to advance loan in cash while converting it into kind _ by purchasing the required equipment or land etc for the debtor _ and retaining the title until the debt is paid off.</p>
<p>However, a property purchased mainly for credit purposes, _ which originally meant for some different use by the original owner _ sometimes, may not be one easily disposable. In such a case, the creditor may have to sell it at a lower price to save expense of resources on looking after it. Still it is a better option to safeguard the interests of the creditor. That is why there has been a rise in number in this type of arrangements in recent years. (34)</p>
<p>SALE AND LEASE BACK:</p>
<p>This is another way for a person or company to secure money by sale of an asset to a bank or lender. But the sale agreement includes the condition that the same asset would be leased back to the seller for certain period of time on agreed terms and condition. Thus the seller secures required amount without losing the right to use that asset, whereas the buyer gets the ownership in lieu of the amount paid; and thus gets secured.</p>
<p>This type of agreement despite not being a security offers more than sufficient security; and falls under the category of quasi security. This is said to be a lower-cost method by the creditors to achieve priority in insolvent regimes. (35) This can reasonably safeguard the position of the creditors.</p>
<p>Quasi Securities are quite an interest phenomenon. They are not securities in the true sense of the word; however they provide security to a creditor at the level of an original security. All of these arrangements _ of apparent sale for the purpose of security _ are well-liked by the lenders (buyers) and the debtors (sellers). But certain critics look at them from a different angle. To them, these seem to be tools of the so-called secured creditors and the debtors to grab the assets of companies leaving nothing for other classes of creditors in case of bankruptcy. Thus, this phenomenon looks like another aspect of ‘bankruptcy Darwinism (36)’. And if these types of arrangements continue, some critics predict more losses for the other classes of creditors:</p>
<p>“If, however, the debtor looks to quasi security and shifts its asset patterns so as rely more heavily on the use of assets that are leased or subject to hire purchase agreements, retention of title or other sale-based security devices, the protection offered to the secured creditor will be diminished. Fewer assets will enter the insolvent estate in the scenario involving heavy reliance on quasi-security and the holder of, say, a floating charge, will have a call on a slimmer body of assets.”(37)</p>
<p>Anyway, quasi securities are good safeguards for the creditors.</p>
<p>OTHER SAFEGUARDS:</p>
<p>Since the grant of a loan is a contract, it provides all those remedies to a creditor, in case of default by the debtor, which can be available to each party to a contract against the other party in the event of breach of contract. Thus the measures mentioned above or below are in fact the ones, in addition to those provided by a contract. In a loan agreement, the creditor is the primary stake holder. Therefore, he can get as many assurances as possible through the loan agreement itself. Some such most common safeguard measures, besides the security, are the following:</p>
<p>NEGATIVE PLEDGE:</p>
<p>The negative pledge clause is a “common feature of loan and security documentation”(38). It is an undertaking by the debtor not to allocate specific assets to another secured creditor.</p>
<p>“By executing a negative pledge clause, the borrower promises that he will not grant any further rights which will give another creditor priority ahead of the lender to its assets, or, depending on the wording of the clause, that the original lender will be granted equal or equivalent rights.” (39)</p>
<p>A negative pledge secures the interest of the creditor on one hand and put a ceiling on the borrower with regard to excessive liabilities on the other. It can also be included in case of a floating charge. However, practically, a negative pledge cannot restrict the grant of collateral by the debtor to another creditor absolutely. And if collateral is granted to a second creditor the first one can only seek remedy for breach of contract. However the collateral given to the second creditor would remain valid in the eyes of law. Even so, in secured loans negative pledge clause would prohibit second ranking security. (40)</p>
<p>But, briefly, with very few and quite lengthy in process remedies, and without any proprietary interest of the lender, negative pledge clause can shield only a floating charge holder, to some extent, and this protection is not comprehensive(41).</p>
<p>GUARANTEE:</p>
<p>It is a ‘second agreement’ (42), in addition to the primary loan agreement between the creditor and the debtor, by a third person who promises to perform the obligation of the borrower in case of his default. This third person, the guarantor, becomes responsible through the written guarantee to pay off the amount due as a loan if the borrower fails to do so. Though this is a contractual obligation, and needs a consideration for the guarantor, too, yet it strengthens the position of a creditor in case the debtor fails to pay the debt. Guarantee is also called quasi collateral. (43)</p>
<p>CONTRACTUAL COVENANTS:</p>
<p>The loan agreement contains terms of the transaction on one hand and divide up the risks between the parties on the other. It, however, depends which party is stronger. If the debtor is sound enough, he may not agree to offer heavy securities to the creditor. But in such a case, the creditor would otherwise see few chances of default owing to the financial position of the debtor. If the debtor is weak financially, then a creditor may insist on covering up the risk by demanding appropriate securities. In any case, prior to making a loan agreement, a creditor must consider the risk analysis and go through the exercise of ‘due diligence’ by obtaining and analyzing certain information about the credibility of the borrower and feasibility of the transaction. If the creditor is careful and vigilant enough, at the time of the making the agreement, he can protect his position by incorporating necessary clauses as safeguards. The terms accepted by the debtor in addition to the normal ones, are called ‘contractual covenants’ ‘undertakings’ or ‘restrictive covenants’ (44). Such covenants or undertakings by the debtor depend upon the mutual agreement of the parties. However, the main purpose of them is to secure the repayment of loan. Following are the common undertakings:</p>
<p>Prohibiting the change in nature of the business:</p>
<p>To ensure the proper utilization of the loan advanced, and avoid any adverse consequences of indulging into new kind of businesses by the debtor, a creditor may require him not to change the present nature of the business until the loan is paid off.</p>
<p>Restriction on disposal of certain assets:</p>
<p>A creditor apart from the negative pledge clause may require the debtor not to dispose off a particular assets in any manner whatsoever, until full repayment of the loan. This would minimize the risk of ending of the business without any assets to pay off the debtor, in the event of default or bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Confining or limiting the creation of new debts:</p>
<p>A business over-burdened by excessive debts is open to the risk of default or failure. A creditor would not like failure of any business funded by his loans. This would result into a loss of his money, as well. Thus, he may require a debtor while granting a loan to restrain from having new debts, or at least, restrict to a certain level of further borrowing.</p>
<p>Barring or limiting the grant of dividend:</p>
<p>Keeping in view the weaker financial position of the debtor, a creditor may insist on inclusion of a clause in loan agreement which would make the debtor not to pay dividends to the shareholders or to limit such a payment up to certain level. This, again, would be a measure to ensure that without attaining a certain level of strength, the business would not be subject to further burdens.</p>
<p>Requiring a minimum net worth of the business:</p>
<p>A creditor may demand in loan agreement that if the net worth of the business drops down a certain limit, he would be at liberty to demand the acceleration in repayment of the loan. This is to avoid the expected threat to the money of the lender in case of a total failure of the business.</p>
<p>Limitation on use of the funds loaned:</p>
<p>The creditor may require the debtor not to spend the money lent on anything except for the purpose it is advanced. This is because the lender advances money keeping in view the viability of the business or project. He may not be sure about the outcome of expenditure on other areas or projects. Thus, to ensure the appropriate use and regular repayment of the loan, he may not agree to allow the debtor to spend it for some different purpose.</p>
<p>Calling for certain information:</p>
<p>The creditor may require the debtor, either as a condition precedent to the agreement or after the loan is advanced, to provide certain information to the creditor so as to keep him informed of the affairs of the business relevant to the financial status of the debtor. This is again a safeguard on the part of the creditor to keep him vigilant about the fate of his money.</p>
<p>Monitoring:</p>
<p>In certain situations, a creditor may demand a permanent role of monitoring the affairs of the debtor. This, usually, happens where the position of the debtor is quite weaker or the problems being faced by the company are attributed to the poor management.(45) In case of any breach the creditor may stop further payments of loan installments, if any, and may demand acceleration of repayment to secure the debt.</p>
<p>“It will be necessary for the creditors to incur expenditure in gathering and analyzing information about the debtor’s actions and financial performance. This monitoring will ensure that defaults are detected as and when they occur” (46)</p>
<p>‘Monitoring’, ‘Contractual covenants’, ‘undertakings’ or ‘restrictive covenants’, being contractual in nature, creates only contractual obligations and thus do not provide, in themselves, an effective cover for the interests of the creditor. However, in addition to the security and other safeguard measures, they are capable of promising a reasonable protection to the creditor.</p>
<p>In addition to the above mentioned possible safeguards, following can be useful in peculiar circumstances.</p>
<p>SET OFF:</p>
<p>Set off is ‘the deduction of monies owed against sums due to be paid’ (47). Set off is a way to satisfy mutual claims by two parties, by deducting the smaller amount out of the bigger one. It may not be a usual case for a bank that in the event of insolvency a debtor would have a claim against the creditor as well. But if it is the case, then a creditor can reduce a claim against itself, by the debtor company (or the liquidator), by deducting its own claim.</p>
<p>However, for those who fund companies it is seldom the case. Thus, the option of set off can only be partially useful in certain circumstances; otherwise in case of lending banks it does not provide any protection.</p>
<p>FACTORING:</p>
<p>Factoring is an option for a creditor of selling out the receivables to other companies at a lower value. These companies, called factors, are specialized in debt recovery, and they make money from the differences of the amounts paid to the creditor and that recovered from the debtor.</p>
<p>Factoring is useful, particularly, for recovery from the trade debtors, to save the creditor from cash flow problem. It helps in getting something, not the full amount, from the dead debts. In case of big loans, however, this option can only be used as a last resort; which can bring only limited outcome for protection of the lenders.</p>
<p>INSURANCE:</p>
<p>A creditor, besides other safeguards, can opt for an insurance of the amount advanced through a loan agreement.</p>
<p>This is not a free cover, neither it brings interest, instead it demands payment; still if an insurance provides cover for a risk of loss of a huge amount of loan, in case of default of payment by the debtor, or in the event of insolvency. However, in case of availability of appropriate security, it would not add much to the safety of the money advanced. Nonetheless, a creditor may weigh the cost of insurance in comparison with the risk covered and decide accordingly.</p>
<p>PROTECTION _ That Creditors Need:</p>
<p>In the forgoing paragraphs we have had a look at different ways to safeguard the lenders. It can be observed that none of them is perfect. Some of them, like covenants, are only capable of creating contractual obligations, which are not sufficient to safeguard the position of the creditors. The others, particularly, the quasi-securities are suitable mostly for small and medium businesses. The lenders of big, sometimes syndicated, loans can not rely fully on these measures. However, in peculiar situations, creditors of the companies may like to blend their securities with these measures to enhance the level of protection. But, the most reliable safeguard for the creditors _ though not perfect _ remains a proper security. Only by putting themselves at the position of secured creditor, the lenders can have a maximum level of protection for their position.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the security, in spite of being the best, is not necessarily a perfect safeguard. Sometimes it may not provide cent per cent protection to the creditors. And this is inter alia because of the lack of information available to them about debtor companies’ indebtedness. There are suggestions to improve the systems more and more _ like maintenance of a new register of ‘security interests’ (48). All the same, a total protection seems to be something too ambitious, as a quest for perfection (49) always remains a fantasy.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:</p>
<p>Debt financing is a common feature of today’s commercial life. It works well for executing big projects with help of finances acquired as loans. But the problem of protection of the interests of the creditors could not be solved perfectly. Only by being a secured creditor, a lender can ensure the maximum level of protection, which in case of resourceful and well equipped lenders like banks goes up to 77 per cent: a reasonably high rate of recovery, but not completely successful. However, this level of protection attained through taking securities can be improved by adding certain other measures, where applicable, like quasi-securities: retention of title, hire purchase and sale and lease back agreement; contractual covenants and others. If the information about the details of indebtedness of all the debtors can be made available openly, then there is more chances to provide protection for the lenders. There is a suggestion of maintaining a new register of ‘security interest’ over the assets of the companies, which if put into practice can raise the level of protection to quite a high level</p>

<p>Guayaramerín is a city within the Beni department, to the left of Mamoré river, facing the Brazilian city of Guajará-Mirim. It is a port in which there is a permanent port of the Bolivian Navy. The city has a small airport, served by three local airlines: AeroCon (Aero Comercial Oriente Norte), TAM (Transporte Aéreo Militar) y Amaszonas.</p>
<p>Facing the city there is the small island of Suárez, or Guajará-Mirim as it is called by the Brazilian government. The island is disputed by both countries, and treaties in 1867, 1877 and 1958 have failed to clear the matter.</p>
<p>There is a Brazilian vice-consulate in the city.</p>

<p>Thunderhead was founded in 2001 by CEO Glen Manchester. Manchester previously founded Geneva Digital, his first foray into the document generation industry. After eight years, Geneva Digital was acquired by a Canada-based public company, Xenos Corporation. Glen subsequently served as CEO of Xenos prior to returning to the United Kingdom to establish Thunderhead. Funded privately, the company underwent a two-year R&amp;D period before launching its commercial product in 2003.</p>
<p>Thunderhead provides Java-based enterprise software in the category of document generation or composition. This technology pulls information from an organization's databases and assembles them in personalized documents or output according to pre-defined rules. Some of these outputs may include customer correspondence, insurance or financial statements, or XML data streams, such as those used in producing derivatives trade confirmations. Organizations use this technology to automate the creation and assembly of high-volume communications across multiple channels, such as print, email, Web, or SMS for mobile devices.</p>
<p>Applications include an Interactive Design Studio for template creation, a rules-based Composition Engine that provides content-based assembly, and a Correspondence Framework and Communications Review tool that facilitate ad-hoc document creation and external review and approval of documents.</p>
<p>Thunderhead was listed as a finalist in the CNET Networks UK Technology Awards for 2006 in the category of Enterprise Software Product of the Year. The company has technology partnerships with FileNet, IBM, EMC/Documentum and TIBCO.</p>

<p>Ritu graduated from Delhi University in 1987. She began her career in the fashion industry by enrolling herself in the newly-opened National Institute of Fashion Technology in 1988. Spending two years at the National Institute of Fashion Technology, she learnt many of the skills needed to pursue a professional career in fashion design.

Thus, she started her career in fashion industry when she created her first line of clothing in 1990, this line was called Lavanya.
