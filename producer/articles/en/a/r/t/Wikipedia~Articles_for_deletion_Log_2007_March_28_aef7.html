<li><b>delete / merge</b> - This article has little to no proof to the whereabouts of osama bin laden, if anyone had a clue where he was it would be the government. besides, with how easy it is to edit and defame and or deface an article these days, this page is just asking for vandalism or worse, propagandization. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.7.175.116_87a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.7.175.116">24.7.175.116</a> (talk) 08:14, 5 April 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you already know the answer to your own question, but I'll indulge you anyway. The Pentium III is notable because it's a far more complicated product with far more innovations. The development history is documented in books, its architecture is studied in textbooks, and there are a variety of interesting aspects of its history, performance, implementation, and application. (That's not true of all processors, by the way.) And it's true of very, very few mouses. On the contrary, should we have an article about every single product ever reviewed at a couple of websites or in a printed magazine or two? I hope not; that is, I hope the people using reviews and "references == notability" arguments understand that opens the door to hundreds of thousands of articles on all sorts of run-of-the-mill products, from stereo gear to knitting needles. That's pretty obviously not what Wikipedia needs, and I guess I mistakenly believed that everyone could see that. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 00:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

As far as I can tell, there aren't even over ten mice that would even be notable enough for anyone to think of puting them in Wikipedia, so this doesn't "open the door" to all kinds of junk.

<li><b>Reply to above</b> If it is true of very few mouses, this is one of them.

<li><b>Another reply</b> Maybe if this was some low rate 15 dollar mouse you would have an argument. However, this mouse has plenty of good sources, as already stated, has many cool features, and other stuff. I mean, there are plenty of other articles on mice, such as the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logitech_G5_8a74.html" title="Logitech G5">Logitech G5</a> and the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Mighty_Mouse_c253.html" title="Apple Mighty Mouse">Apple Mighty Mouse</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Its price doesn't make it notable. The "delete those too" argument is completely inappropriate; it should be obvious that I can read, evaluate, and edit only one article at a time. A such, there will always be some other article that should also be deleted.

<li><small><b>Comment</b>Personally, when I came to Wikipedia, I thought, "Cool, this has the potential to be an encyclopedia about every thing. People could be able to find everything from pencils to continents." But I guess I was wrong after I had found WP:N. Plus, like I have already said, if this was an article about a 15 dollar mouse, things would be different, but it is not about some 15 dollar mouse. Plus, I started this article because it stood out, to me, as a mouse that wasn't just "some other mouse." I guess that kind of sounds like I'm trying to get you to buy it, but that, honestly, is the truth. <a href="../../../k/j/t/User%7EKjtheDj_897a.html" title="User:KjtheDj">KjtheDj</a> 20:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><small>So a few of the sources are viable... but that's still not enough for you. That's my point... you have decided the kinds of articles that get written about computer mice are never going to be enough here. WP:N was actually written so Wikipedia could include a vast number of articles on topics like this... so long as they could be appropriately referenced. The point of WP:N was never to dramatically restrict what we could write articles on to topics with dozens of journal-quality articles as sources. So if that means we can have hundreds of articles on computer mice, that's what it means... maybe you want something more restrictive than WP:N. Such things have been proposed, but never went anywhere really. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li><small>I'm really amused at how you're happy to tell me what it is or isn't that I'm doing. Your oh-fer at it, so far--but keep trying! I think I'm not asking for something more restrictive than WP:N; I think I'm just interpreting it at face value. I haven't decided anything about the kinds of articles that get written. WP:N tells us that, and it says that the references need to be substantial and meaningful. There are plenty of mice products which are notable: the first mouse itself, the first optical mouse, the first wheel mouse, and so on. I think there's a history of doing deep stories on products that are truly revolutionary or notable--<i>stories</i>, not reviews. Look at all the stories on the Macintosh, or the Corvettes, or the Pentium, and so on. This mouse is not in that class of product; I'll be happy to consider it so if there are books like <i>Corvette: Fifty Years</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0760311803</a>), <i>The Pentium Chronicles: The People, Passion, and Politics Behind Intel's Landmark Chips</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0471736171</a>), or <i>Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer That Changed Everything</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0140291776</a>) about it; but right now there aren't. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 02:34, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<ul>
<li><small><b>Reply</b>. Most new product introductions do not receive the <i>depth of coverage</i> that this one has received. Anandtech, Cnet, and their print cousins typically give little more than a passing mention to new peripherals in a buyer's guide. Anandtech gives this particular peripheral a nearly ten thousand word article describing major competitors, the history of logitech mice, and closing with "We found the overall design, ergonomics, and quality of materials to be the best of any mouse we have used to date. While the Revolution has several new features from both a hardware and software viewpoint, we found the new scroll wheel to be the most important technology introduced on this mouse." Certainly not every mouse on the market needs a wikipedia article but the MX and its VX sibling represent a significant offering from a major company that has achieved a level of attention and depth of coverage far beyond the norm. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 02:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li><small><b>Question</b>. How would you go about substantiating your "depth of coverage" claim? If you can find a way to do so, maybe it would be a good addition to WP:N. Until then, these reviews are just that -- reviews. I've explained here (or in the VX AfD, maybe) about how essentially <i>all</i> products get reviewed--even crappy ones. We can't possibly consider reviews a sign of notability, as review subjects are chosen indiscriminately. Truly notable products have hundreds of thousands or millions of words written about them: textbooks about computer architecture cover the Pentium's internal design, while the manuals for the product alone are more than 5000 pages, plus the books about the team and the way they worked. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 02:53, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</small>

<li><small><b>Reply</b> By direct comparison with other comparable products. Most new mouse releases and other peripherals (game pads) don't garner ten thousand words from Anandtech - they usually don't even get their own article. A simple product refresh to the G7 series, for example, might get a passing mention in a weekly buyer's guide or - maybe - a three or four hundred word article. The same goes for coverage in other print magazines - not extensive in the way that a processor or new car release might be covered, but extensive compared to other comparable products.</small></li>

<dd><small><b>Reply</b>. I think I've made my position pretty clear, so I'm surprised to see you misinterpret and/or overstate it. I don't think <i>this</i> mouse is notable enough for an article. The article doesn't make the case for it, either. The mouse hasn't won any interesting awards; its development story wasn't notable; its feature set isn't notable. There are notable mouses--they do win awards, they do get coverage beyond just product reviews, and so on. Few mouses are notable -- and that only makes sense. If all or many was notable, how would they be notable? -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 18:51, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

<li><b>Support deletion</b> - While I believe in the notability of "Friday the 13th deaths", I don't think we need a list telling us every single death in the franchise.

<dd>The first step is not to create a page for minor characters, but see if they can be listed on the film's article itself. Seeing as no 1 film has a list of minor characters that is too long to be on the page, I don't see why they need their own page. Second, being fictional, when writing about fiction you don't just write the fictional part and leave it. This is an encyclopedia, and I see hardly any evidence of encyclopedic content in this article. The encyclopedic content of this article is something that this article symbolizes, not what this article literally shows. What I mean is, this article symbolizes what F13 is famous for, gory, graphic deaths. Some of the deaths are noted on certain "top scary moment"-esque shows. Kevin Bacon's death is a very recognized scene, the death of Brenda...not so much. As I said before, it's something that should be written in prose, with reliable sources, discussing the nature of the deaths, the reaction by critics and the MPAA by the graphicness of them, and that's it. A list of every stupid little death is not important. Part 5 had what, 3 people killed by their eyes cut out. This is encyclopedic how? It's redundant deaths. The one about the girl being killed because she got caught in the blast of the shotgun in <i>Jason Goes to Hell</i>? That's not even "related" to the main character of the series. We might as well have a "List of deaths in Die Hard" page.

<li>Regardless of whether one should or shouldn't create a list article for minor characters (and there is nothing that I can find that indicates one shouldn't; as noted, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> actively encourages creating them rather than stubby articles for each one), this list exists. It does not appear to violate any Wikipedia policy or guideline and frankly the attitude expressed toward it by some of the people in this AFD indicate a strong willingness to ignore policy and guidelines in favor of <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. Calling the content "stupd little deaths" is rather telling. As for making similar articles for Die Hard or Harry Potter, I have no problem with that. It's just one more way of organizing the information on the characters. Which remains the point, that this is a character list which happens to consist of characters who are killed. If the list were called List of Friday the 13th film characters I doubt anyone who's declaiming against it would care. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:28, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, WP:FICT states that it should only be its own page when it doesn't fit in the article. I don't know about you, but last time I checked not a single F13 film article was bordering on excessive length. Secondly, having a "list of deaths" is like have a "list of every scene in this film" page. It's one thing to have a list of characters page where you can talk about the character, give some actor insight into the character, etc. A list of deaths is nothing more than a list of plot points, a list of scenes from a film. Where is the notability in listing 189 deaths in detail? None. You'll vote to delete a "list of magazine covers" but not a list of deaths? Fictional deaths at that. Wikipedia is not a repository for Friday the 13th deaths. This list bypasses the "list of characters" information and just wants to include fancruft. Also, don't try and pass judgement. I love the series, I own them all, but I know pointless fancruft when I see it. Again, the notability behind the theme of death is one thing, listing every single death in a film is another. Remember, "Wikipedia is not a substitution for watching the film," and a list of deaths is providing that substitution. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 22:49, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The exact wording of WP:FICT is <i>Minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of characters." This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself, unless it becomes long, in which case a separate article for the list is good practice.</i> This article covers the entire film <i>series</i>. The article on the film <i>series</i>, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_the_13th_%28film_series%29.html" title="Friday the 13th (film series)">Friday the 13th (film series)</a> would be overwhelmed if this list were included in it. I did not suggest that you don't like the films. I suggest that you don't like the list and your dislike of the list is leading you to endorse deletion when no valid deletion criterion has been offered. "<a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">Fancruft</a>" is a lazy argument and it is not a valid deletion criterion. As to how I vote on any other article, that's irrelevant. Each article is supposed to be judged on its own merits and you've said nothing that demonstrates the need to delete this article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:23, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I say it's fancruft, then it is to me. That's my opinion, and I don't believe that my vote said anything about cruft in it. I dont't think calling any argument "lazy" follows that civility policy you were flashing around at RGTraynor. Regardless, the "list" is broken up by films, thus the "minor characters" would be on each respective films page. This list is nothing more than the cast from the film articles. Listing deaths is not notable, you might as well list every scene in a film. "Deaths" are nothing more than scenes, and thus this list is nothing more than an ill contrived substitution for watching the movies, which is something that Wikipedia is not. As for your "valid deletion criterion offered", I think what's really going on here is that 6 other people believe there is valid deletion criterion here, and 1 person doesn't. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 23:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are certainly free to believe that it's cruft, as long as you understand that "cruft" is not a criterion for deletion. Sorry if you think that calling an <i>argument</i> lazy is being uncivil.</dd>
<dd>Now, if your contention is now that the article is a "cast list," well, we have those too. See <a href="../../../a/c/t/Category%7EActors_by_film_series_9908.html" title="Category:Actors by film series">Category:Actors by film series</a>. In fact, cast lists are now the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Log_2007_January_25_33fd.html#Category:Actors_by_series" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 January 25"><i>preferred</i></a> manner of keeping that information on Wikipedia, in place of the categories we previously had and which are all in the process of being listified and deleted.</dd>
<dd>As for the idea that these are nothing but plot summaries, I'm sorry, but that's simply not true. All we know from the list is the name of the character and the implement of his or her death. We do not know any other details of the scenes nor do we know any details of the scenes in which a death did not occur. They are not substitutes for the plots of the films and people reading the article will not know the plots.</dd>
<dd>As for the numbers game, Wikipedia isn't a democracy and AFD is not a vote. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you are going to try and dismantle my discussion, at least try and quote me right. I said it's nothing but plot points, not a summary, that is completely different.

<dd>I don't think a "list of deaths" in the individual articles is appropriate as the information is nothing more than spoiler info, that has nothing to do with the article. I think the list should be turned into List of Friday the 13th characters, and real character informatio be added. I don't even think that needs its own page, because it isn't like each film is populated with tons of people. The films already have a cast section with all these characters. They should just be expanded upon to include character information. We have to remember that Wiki is an encyclopedia first, and death scenes are hardly notable as a whole. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 00:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>You're misinterpreting what I say. I don't want to keep this information, the information, as it's listed, is not notable, important, or hard to find (I already provided a link to the list on another site). I think a REAL character list should be created, one that follows other character lists. You keep citing the writing about fiction for minor characters, but that doesn't apply here, because this list isn't a list of minor characters it's a list of EVERY DEATH in the series, whether by a minor or major character. Not the same. A real list of characters would have information that is congruent to a "CAST" section in a film article, more specifically a film article that has reached FA status. It would look like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_III:_Revenge_of_the_Sith#Cast" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_III:_Revenge_of_the_Sith#Cast" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_%28film%29#Cast" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_%28film%29#Cast" rel="nofollow">this</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_%28film%29#Cast" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_%28film%29#Cast" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Haranguing" is a strong word. I've requested people who have voted both ways to substantiate their claims. The guide to discussing AfD says, "The debate is not a vote; please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments." It also says, "Do not base your recommendation solely on the information supplied by the nominator," which <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakgraf_ae03.html" title="User:Makgraf">Makgraf</a> did. The essay basically expands on what arguments are appropriate and are not appropriate. Even if we don't abide by it, the user is essentially making this a voting process by saying "Delete per nom." So yes, per the guideline, arguments should be made. It has nothing to do with personal preference and everything to do how an AfD should be carried out, to seek a consensus. Three words' worth of a recommendation does not meet the need for "arguments" to be presented by the editor. At the end of the section, it even says, "You don't have to make a recommendation on every nomination; consider <i>not</i> participating if you agree with the consensus that has already been formed." Otherwise, the person's recommendation is merely a throwaway, insubstantial vote. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 16:21, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There has been many attempts as far as deleting this page is, the reason it should stay is that it does keep to <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> as it keeps all details short and quick without too much fancrufty detail. Also it makes an easy and simple look up of deaths from one series into an easy to read and consise page. This is much simpler than having to trawl through 11 different pages to find out your infomation. As a third reason is that it contains simple details complete with cast listings that also apply with <a href="../../../f/i/l/WP%7EFILM_df1c.html" title="WP:FILM">WP:FILM</a> easily. I am aware of another site (fridaythe13thfilms.com) containing this infomation however unlike this page users must still look through about 11 different pages and another 11 for cast links.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Tell me, other than following the guidelines for "List" (which I could do by setting up a "List of movies where people pick their nose" (that would be concise and short)), exactly what is the importance, notability, or even reason for keep the list? Everyone on here that says "keep" is just saying "it fits these guidelines", and the guidelines being how it's formatted. But no one has come up with a reason that rebuts the reason everyone else say they are not notably important, or encyclopedic. 10:55, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> According to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Appropriate_topics_for_lists" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)#Appropriate topics for lists</a>, "Lists that are too specific are... a problem.

You seem to be saying that "<a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">It's useful</a>," which is an argument based on subjectivity, a judgment that should not apply to deletion debates. Maybe fridaythe13thfilms.com should be advised to reformat their lists so there's a singular list, but just because Wikipedia has that list available does not seem to be the most intact reasoning per the arguments that I've made in my own vote and this comment. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Erikster_0c87.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Erikster">review</a>) - 11:53, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes thats true but considering that the main site is for the singular films mainly I doubt that they will merge all the pages together, secondly there are also links to the actors that people could want but considering the legnth of the series it is easier placing them in various pages (ive had many occourances where somebody's been confused about which film they were actually in). In any case ill repeat what I said again, it IS notable due to the nature of the films and it fully keeps withing <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesbuc_acfe.html" title="User:Jamesbuc">Jamesbuc</a></li>

<dd>(Sorry for this being so long)...Every horror film deals with death. <i>Friday</i> is notable in the fact that its death are rather graphic and they are one of the reason it's panned by critics all the time. As I said before, the "theme" of death is notable, but not a list of every death that occured. You're only listing plot points from a movie, with no real world context in the entire list. Remember, this is an encyclopedia, and being so you have to have real world context. That is why film articles are not supposed to be just "plots" and why "plots" are not supposed to be overly long with minute details about every minor thing (e.g. like the death of a hitch hiker in <i>The Final Chapter</i>). This is a list someone created because they couldn't put every single death into the plot, it's a circumvent of plot guidelines. All the "featured lists" have real world context, that is why the are featured, and the point of every page should be to get to that status. I stated before, I think the "theme of deaths" should be noted (with reliable sources from crew and critics) on the "film series" page, but not a detailed list of every joe schmo in the film, that probably didn't even have any lines, who was killed. People have cited the "minor characters" guideline, but this isn't a list of minor characters, it's a list of deaths for EVERY character, even ones that were not major or minor in the films. To be accepted, you cannot simply say "it meets this requirement" if it fails several others. Would you vote to make the guideline for film plots any length the editor wants? Do you think that film articles should be based solely on the plots, and that we should tell the reader every little thing that happens? That is what this list does. It doesn't even attempt to turn a list into anything encyclopedic. A "theme of death" can be encyclopedic, because the series is well known for it's obligatory death scenes, but where is the value in listing every single death scene? Should we create a list of everyone that wore white after labor day? I'm sure someone wants to know that information, it's taboo. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 12:35, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

However, this particular series of horror films is seminal, very popular, spans over two decades, and has been the focus of scholarly works ("Games of Terror" by Vera Dika is one that comes to mind).

<dd>Wikipedia is not a substitution for watching the film. If they are going from article to article in search of who gets killed and how, then they are looking for a substitution for watching the film. This is why film articles contain more information than just plots and cast list. This is why they contain info about production, releases, critical reception, because articles are not based around the plot or plot points of a film. How many people died of the same death in Part V? I can think of 3 right now, without looking at the page, that died just from eyes being cut out. Gee, let's have an article that lists the same thing over again. This article is the equivalent to have a list of scores for every football game in 2006. The relevance being? Of course, football is about scoring, it's been around for decades, so that means we need a list that tells us how many points a team score in every game of ever season. It's called "prose". You are taking a plot and breaking it down into a scene by scene list, only excluding everything that doesn't involve a death. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><small><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></small></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><small>(Contact me)</small></a> 20:53, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Shira, you know as well as anyone does that this phenomenon is old and widespread (and is quite encyclopedic), especially among the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Orthodox_Judaism_5da7.html" title="Modern Orthodox Judaism">MO</a> youth who are not so eloquent and won't get it "published" in journals and at the same time their parents (and sadly even their teachers and rabbis) run in shame from these kind of discussions or deliberately ignore this topic with determined blinkers even though it's been been around for a veeeery long time (or perhaps because they did the same thing themselves when they were that age...?) The only reason it's not discussed more often in a "scholarly way" is that this is a very shameful and embarrassing subject. Thus, there is no reason to run to delete and <i>censor</i> it under the guise of all sorts of Wikipedia rules which cannot hide an important sociological phenomenon (actually it's a failing!) No use acting like pro-Chabad editors who swing into action to delete comments about the <i>Meshichistim</i> or the Rebbe when it's not to their liking.

<li>Actually, it's not an attack on anybody. This is just by way of observation: That editors are human and they have their obvious pet topics they not only protect but also promote (when they actually get down to some serious creative writing) so that we have some on the "cutting edge" of Modern Orthodoxy promoting neologisms such as the new-fangled <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partnership_minyan.html" title="Partnership minyan">Partnership minyan</a> or voting to keep derogatory articles about Haredi non-entities such as <a href="../../../s/h/l/Shlomo_Helbrans_b9a2.html" title="Shlomo Helbrans">Shlomo Helbrans</a>, but in this instance voting to delete a topic ("Tefillin Date") that casts Modern Orthodoxy in a negative light, which is much like some obviously pro-Chabad editors, I wasn't even thinking of anyone specific, who will try to eradicate or "chop down" topics that cast Chabad in a negative light such as the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Gurary_6217.html" title="Barry Gurary">Barry Gurary</a> or the <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> articles so that, unfortunately, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_whole_truth_and_nothing_but_the_truth.html" title="The whole truth and nothing but the truth">the whole truth and nothing but the truth</a> never gets to see the light of day.

<li>The first two sources are ones I cited above -- the Jerusalem post one is a one-sentence comment left by a reader (not from the newspaper itself), and the Los Angeles Jewish Journal has a single sentence in an article on a different topic that mentions the term once (as does the Luke Ford article). We're starting to get somewhere, but not sure this is enough coverage to support an article on the topic or establish that it's in common written use. Unfortunately the policies result in some perfectly good topics not being written enough about to support an article. This may be one.

Wikipedia is not an almanac and indiscriminate information is discouraged because it is NN. I don't know why people want ephemeris tables like these specifically from Wikipedia, but look at that list of calculators! You can get any data you want, very easily. The original author ignored the prod on the other articles. Could someone weigh in on how these articles are actually useful, or advantages over the calculators and tables linked from <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephemeris.html" title="Ephemeris">ephemeris</a>?
<ul>
<li>Before I post... I suppose lots of Google hits would defeat the NN argument. But also consider that many of those sites are also more informative on astrology as well, not to mention having much more data. What we need is more information in <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephemeris.html" title="Ephemeris">ephemeris</a> so interested people can learn... not an independent handbook for astrologers who happen to like Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotatoswatter_0aa8.html" title="User:Potatoswatter">Potatoswatter</a> 21:17, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree... almanac info is inherently NN and therefore rare on Wikipedia. Do you have examples? You are right on the copyright side, although I still don't like the idea that he just copied and pasted from his calculator to generate several articles. (He didn't contest the prods, either.) This looks authoritative because there are lots of numbers, but again, anyone with a use for them already knows where to look. This info is readily available in eg <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_and_Telescope_d91c.html" title="Sky and Telescope">Sky and Telescope</a> magazine.

<dd>Hi, and thank you, I agree that this is the criteria that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is the criteria we should be looking at - but I don't see it written that wikipedia is not an ephemeris on the WP:NOT page - so could you narrow it down to the specific part of WP:NOT that you think this page contravenes?

<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and especially the sections that might arguably be relevant, are very problematic right now for just this reason. There are those who would call this "indiscriminate" information, when it isn't really; however, it is essentially raw data, not really subject to editing, only to reformatting. Perhaps a <b>transwiki to Wikisource</b> might be the best solution to preserve ephemeris data. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I read the WP:NOT talk page and came to the same conclustion. It's as easy to edit this page as any other on wikipedia - I suspect that the main argument against this page is that it is numerical, and people just don't like numbers. Incidently there is a WP:NOT clause that argues in favour of the page, WP is not paper. I notice that on <a href="../../../e/p/h/Talk%7EEphemeris_d006.html" title="Talk:Ephemeris">talk:Ephemeris</a> there is someone complaining that ephemeris data is missing on wikisource, if the info is moved there who will safegaurd it from being deleted from there?

<dd>Yes, the point of transwikiing it to Wikisource would be to preserve the data; and the Wikisource page could be linked from the main Pluto page by a simple template. Besides, everybody knows that numbers higher than three are mythical, don't really mean anything, and were invented by city slickers only to confuse us. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:02, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikisource apparently does not want to include data tables, as is relevant to the LC Classification discussion also. there might well be a need for a WikiAlmanac, though I'm not about to propose it here and now. There are other articles that are mainly collections of data. I suggest that the article could be improved by a discussion of the intended use of the information. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:14, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> — An <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephemeris.html" title="Ephemeris">ephemeris</a> doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. If not wikisource, then a wikibook in an astrology and/or astronomy section might serve. I wouldn't think an astronomer would be using this information to plan an observing session. More likely [s]he'd want concurrent data, and there are online sites that provide such tables. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 21:12, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I am a little doubtful about basing decisions on what may be available elsewhere: For almost all non-historical subjects, there is material readily available elsewhere on the web. Where WP differs is selectivity and organization. Athletic results, for example, are available on the web, and in greater detail than shown here. Worldcat includes millions of books, but WP has a selection of the notable ones. etc. I thing convenient summaries like this are appropriate for WP. Possibly we can develop a more specialized location, but then it could be argued that election results should go there, while in fact they are included in articles about most politicians. there's immense amounts of data in W. This is not going to distort the balance. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 22:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, but this doesn't appear to be a particularly selectively interesting bit of information. <b>There is no claim to notability</b> or context. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotatoswatter_0aa8.html" title="User:Potatoswatter">Potatoswatter</a> 22:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete, do not transwiki</b> - "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information." These articles are comprised entirely of indiscriminate information; they merely lists some arbitrary statistics on various planets. It is not clear as to whether the information is relevant to either astronomers or astrologers (or even who the intended audience was). The information is unreferenced and presented in a confusing manner; for example, it is unclear as to whether the distances and diameters correspond to the dates on which the planets are stationary, the dates on which the planets are in conjunction, or the planets are in opposition. Hence, copying these data to wikisource or wikibook is not even worthwhile. I therefore recommend straightforward deletion. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 06:42, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Some of them have been kept, others have been deleted (both via AFD and CSD). I certainly have no intent of nominating "every biographical article that user is involved with", only the ones where notability is lacking or questionable. Hathorn does have skill as an editor and has applied that to articles that are obvious keeps, such as Lieutenant Governors or members of the state legislature. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 10:58, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, that was my point of directing to his talk page. He seems to create questionable bios, and so there has been an effort to delete them. What I'm saying is that this article got caught up in all of that, but it doesn't belong. Almost all the fifth circuit judges have bios. This one shouldn't be singled out simply because Billy Hathorn has edited it. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicken_Wing_fd6f.html" title="User:Chicken Wing">Chicken Wing</a> 11:08, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let me just say that it certainly wasn't any attempt to "single out" Judge Duhe. I simply didn't see any indication in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that notability is inherent, that's all. If there is such a strong consensus (and obviously, it is) that they are, I have no problem backing down on it and offering my apologies. I suspect I <i>did</i> err due to haste in the research though. I went to newslibrary.com yet now I see results where before I did not. I suspect now that I misspelled his name on my first attempt, and I just did not slow down enough to notice the error. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 20:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

It's not a FAQ, travel guide, memorial or any of the other entries described at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, but rather the actions of a major company, something that is the subject of regular coverage in the media. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:08, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That list in WP:NOT is not intended to be all encompassing. It is meant to provide examples of what is indiscriminate. The seven network does many many many things, much of which is reported on as they are a media company. You could easily make a referenced list of many other things at the network just due to this fact. A list like this clearly fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">the notability requirements</a> in that noone outside the seven network or associated companies cares enough to write substantially about it. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 21:38, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I did not say that the list at that location is all-encompassing, but the problem is lacking any connection to the criteria on that list, leaves the statement that any particular information qualifies as indiscriminate without substance. Thus I ask people to explain why they believe it is indiscriminate information, not to just declare it such. Without that articulation, it's not exactly much to go on. However, since you do mention outside people writing about it, well, guess what, they do. I already provided links which show that the namebranding/identity building of networks is something that is covered in the news. Not being an Australian, I don't know where to look for sources from that country which would be more likely to cover this company directly, but I accept that in principle such could exist for what seems to be one of the larger Australian broadcasting organizations. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:04, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b> at this stage. This list is an impressive collection of slogans used by a very notable company in Australia. I agree it wouldnt be considered encyclopedic if it was going to be printed on paper, but the lack of sources does not mean that the slogans are disputed, and the list format means it is not OR. <b>Give the contributors time to develop this interesting article that demonstrates branding in practise</b>. In the back of my mind is the fact that this is a prominent piece of a companies branding that is shoved down our throats daily (if we watch that is), and I cant help but think that there is an encyclopaedic piece on the brand that will come of this if we let it be. The outcome could be very similar to our articles on flags of each nation. Note that it would be very easy to add video evidence of these slogans, except that doing so it not as easy as jotting down the details of each slogan, hence the evidence being missing. In a way, the date range provided for each slogan is a citation. The article says go to an archive of the TV programs of this period and you will find that slogan. Also, these slogans are often mentioned in commentaries by other media networks in a derogatory way, and the more notable the slogan, the more often they appear in comedy and in satire. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 11:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> Crystal Balling at it's best. Film is not due out until <i>200<b>9</b></i>, according to IMDB. The only indications that the movie might possibly be made is the fact that New Line picked up the rights, which is not even close to an indication that the film might actually be made. There is quite literally no information about this film which is available. It could be summed up within the <a href="../../../g/e/a/Gears_of_War_aeea.html" title="Gears of War">Gears of War</a> article itself with one sentence, that New Line has optioned the rights to the game. Picking up the rights does not equal actually making a film, otherwise John Woo would have made a Metroid movie.

<p>This is a list a videogames with characters that use the technique Iaido. It's not really popular culture, and I think this technique is common in martial arts based videogames so it's not notable enough for its own article. Plasticbottle 04:37, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. you misunderstand, I didn't say they aren't <i>part</i> of popular culture, I meant the list doesn't represent popular culture, just a small aspect of it, which is videogames.

<li><b>Delete</b>:Guys, the only reason I created this article was because it was almost bigger than the main Iaido article itself. (Ok maybe that THAT big but it was big enough). And video-game fans kept adding more on that section rather than on the martial art itself. I wanted to delete the entire section from Iaido, but I didnt dare since I guess someone would have cried havoc so I moved it here.

<li><b>Keep both</b>. These are really difficult to source via the web, as all you get is trillions of blogs. Anyway, the Tories sourced as above (though one of those sources is YouTube); the Progressive has an inline source (the <a href="http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2005/06/star_power.html" class="external text" title="http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2005/06/star_power.html" rel="nofollow">Toronto Star</a>). Also, note that CBC gives both factions equal billing <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/analysiscommentary/blogreport.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/analysiscommentary/blogreport.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Even without this, I'd <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a> and say that deleting one without the other would be on very shaky ground; they're opposing factions of a Canadian political blog war. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 16:52, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I wouldn't exactly say IAR; I would say that the rules need careful and creative interpretation in relation to the subject matter of the articles. Where does one expect to find information on blogs? Shall we instead omit coverage of the blogosphere because we adopted our RS rules before they became important.?

<p>Subject is non-notable local politician with two failed runs for office and some local scandal to his name. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:23, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. OK, so for this one it seems like there <i>might</i> actually be multiple sources. But with the references not being in-line and with such references as "review or articles from 1973-1977", it's tough to evaluate their merit. For <i>this</i> one, I'd suggest giving <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Hathorn_ca3c.html" title="User:Billy Hathorn">Billy Hathorn</a> a chance to more clearly specifiy the references to allow for a more clear determination regarding notability. Given the track record, I am perhaps not optimistic that this will be done and actually establish notability, but just to be completely fair, I think the opportunity should be offered. If that doesn't happen, then <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 07:46, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> . '<s><i>Weak Keep</i></s>' there are technically enough sources. "Review of the ..." apparently means that it was examined for those dates, and an item or two actually found. Only the items found, of course are sources. This is like saying one searched Google. Google isn't a source, what one finds there are sources. I've edited the article accordingly. <i><b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:01, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Thanks for the info. I'm still troubled by what's actually listed for references, but if there was something there, then that adds to the case for notability. If the author is reading this, perhaps he can specify those for the reader? Of what's left, there are two sources seem definitely non-trivial: the link to his lawsuit against Oubre (that link wasn't working last night when I tried to check it, so I didn't know what that was), and the newspaper article about his pleading guilty. Not sure what might have been in that prison report (once again in-line citations would certainly be nice). Might have been non-trivial. A couple of other links listed don't seem to be working right now (not sure if that's a temporary situation or not), but maybe some non-trivial info there too if those links become operational. A lot of maybes, but when combined with the two definites already there, I guess that makes for "multiple" non-trivial sources. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 02:34, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very weak keep.</b> At least a personal interview with Billy wasn's used as an interview this time. He seems to have enough regional notability. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealkyhick_ef0f.html" title="User:Realkyhick">Realkyhick</a> 03:40, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> He lost the race for mayor &amp; legislature. I am an inclusionist about politicians, and think people losing races for national office are notable. Not state office. His crime also was nothing particularly dramatic.If kept, the article will of course be edited to an appropriate length and amount of detail. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Undecided</b> I see I have&#160;!voted three different ways with 5 hours. I consider this to indicate not my carelessness, but rather the truly borderline nature of this subject. In borderline situations I think the general way of going is considered to be keep. as the article develops, or fails to develop, we can always discuss the article again. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 22:12, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I would appeal to the Wikipedia editors to not delete this biography. As one who utilizes Wikipedia for research in the field of history and politics (especially localized), I find these biographies to be not only interesting, but invaluable. It is nearly impossible to find such comprehensive information anywhere else online, short of having to go to a library or newspapers in the locality to which the individual is from. Is it not Wikipedia's mission to provide such information&#160;? It would be highly shortsighted to remove these biographies.</li>

<dd>Actually, Billy, it is not WPs mission to produce articles about everybody interesting, or everything not covered by other online sources. A full encyclopedia of state politics might find a good home in Wikia. The standard is Notability to the reader. Some politicians are, some aren't. But you might find it easier to get articles or borderline figures like this guy accepted in WP if they were written more concisely. That isn't (at the moment) a specific guideline, but it's part of what is meant by being encyclopedic--an encyclopedia has articles whose length depends on the subjects' importance (and also of course of the amount of material, but this is never a problem with your articles). <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:22, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> These articles may be stubs, with minimal content as of yet, however, the potential to add content is there, the same for almost every other episode of a television show. Articles don't suddenly become full of content over night, they need time to improve. Deleting these articles now will only discourage folks from working on that. If you're somehow bothered by these being stubs, then make them all <b>redirects</b> until further information is added. If you just object to the idea of including the episodes of a television show as Wikipedia articles, well, in that case, I think you need to establish some sort of policy consensus first. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:11, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> per <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> I have removed 2 of the so-called references, which were trivial public notices of contracts awarded, and moved his company home page to an external link. But the real reason for deletion is that most of the article is a close paraphrase of the obituary notice. It would need complete rewriting, and would be about 1/3 the size if kept. Perhaps there should be a presumption that all bios which end by giving the time and place of the funeral are taken thoughtlessly from obituary notices, as that information certainly isn't encyclopedic. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:36, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> and warning. In looking at some recent bios, still being put in by the ed., and the rate of one every two minutes, the principal source seems to be the eds. unpublished master's thesis: "Billy Hathorn, <i>The Republican Party in Louisiana, 1920-1980,</i> Master's thesis (1980), Northwestern State University at Natchitoches," which probably does not count as a published RS, . It also raises the question of whether these articles in WP are being put in wholesale by downloading them indiscriminately. In any case I want to remind the ed. that the fact that someone has an obit. or a listing in a book is not proof of notability per se; if they have done notable things, then the source documents it, but if they have not done notable things, no amount of sources saying so make for notability. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> See my comment in the discussion immediately above this one; the same applies here. The Long family ties does make this a bit closer call, admittedly.

<dd>He certainly does a complete job of writing them; do we have formal guidelines for the amount of detail in an article? We may need some, since common sense cannot be counted on. But what I suggest, is that he be urged to turn his master's thesis into a book. People will always want another book about the Longs, who are endlessly fascinating even when not notable, and I'm not sure that any published source has the amount of information on the less important members of the family. (not satire, meant as praise) <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:44, 29 March 2007 (UTC)<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 22:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought that it would be good to show that not all Longs, indeed most Longs, went into politics. Floyd Long seemed to be the most notable of the non-politician Longs. I think he meets the notability requirements, or I would not have done this little article.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As above. I seriously doubt he would have a female surname. Artur Pashayev appears to be a vandal (see his talk history). I'm from Azerbaijan originally, I've never heard of Rustamova. Edit history does seem odd, perhaps not a hoax as such, but severely distorted - e.g. should not be categorized as politician, no indication of size of group - probably not notable.Humanproject 20:16, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Care to explain why the debut dates of characters in a major comic strip aren't encyclopedic in nature? Are you going to advocate the deletion of numerous similar articles?

<dd>Please see <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a>. Fancruft has become a regular term on Wikipedia, applying to any information that is relevant to fans, but not so much on its own. And, as is mentioned bellow, if the villains don't have their own articles, they probably don't need an entire article dedicated to their appearance dates. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoizashmo_803f.html" title="User:Joizashmo">Joiz</a> <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"><sup>A.</sup></a> <a href="../../../j/o/i/User_talk%7EJoizashmo_eb05.html" title="User talk:Joizashmo">Shmo</a> 15:54, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've seen that page. It's an essay, and I would prefer if the advise against using the term were written in much stronger language, and I wish that fewer people would slap that derogatory term around as if it were a convincing argument. And some of the villains do have their own articles. Should all of them? I don't know, that's another issue. Besides, there are many things which don't deserve their own article in the individual, but are more notable in the aggregate. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:16, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Of course the article isn't notable, it's a single article on Wikipedia. Very few of them are notable. But what's wrong with the subject of the article? Do you think <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Tracy_f905.html" title="Dick Tracy">Dick Tracy</a> isn't notable? Do you think that the villains of the strip aren't notable as a whole? Should the ones with individual articles be deleted? Should all dates of initial appearance be deleted from every article about comic characters? Sorry, but just saying "This isn't notable, it's fancruft" is not persuasive reasoning, it's just using a pejorative. Could you please try explaining in more detail exactly what you consider is not encyclopedic about this article's subject, without making use of that term? I would much appreciate it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Dick Tracy is very notable, some/many of the villains are notable as well, but what is the point of an article that lists the date of their first appearance? The question is not if these villains are notable, but if the dates of their first appearance on its own is notable. This list says nothing but "there are a lot of villains, they were all created by the creator of the comic (duh) except one, seventeen years later, and ... well, that's about it". This list is furthermore redundant with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recurring_characters_in_Dick_Tracy_f0a6.html" title="List of recurring characters in Dick Tracy">List of recurring characters in Dick Tracy</a>, which gives a lot more information (even though it needs a lot of work as well). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 11:25, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First, I would say that this list is incomplete, since obviously it stops relatively short of the modern era. Thus the various people who took over after Gould are unlisted. Incompleteness, note, is not a reason for deletion. If it were, we'd have to delete a lot more pages. It's just a reason for somebody to finish the article. I don't see how the dates of first appearance aren't notable though, since that information is included on pretty much every page about a comic book or strip character. So as a whole, I don't see that as a problem. And yes, I did notice that this page is somewhat redundant to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recurring_characters_in_Dick_Tracy_f0a6.html" title="List of recurring characters in Dick Tracy">List of recurring characters in Dick Tracy</a>, but the more I think about it, the more I think something else besides deletion needs to be done. That page has a section describing first appearances, but it's much more poorly formatted than even this page. I think it might be worth splitting off the villains from that page, merging it with the information from this one instead. Deletion, however, seems needless. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:42, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I wish this page was fancruft in a way, it would have more editors. Dick Tracy isn't a fan hotbed, it's a historically significant comic strip.

<p>–Please excuse the lack of Wiki protocol, but I am the person being discussed on this page. I have had several previous discussions with the person known as Hornplease because he wrote lies about me on another page. I wrote to him and then complained to others, but nothing became of it. Since I am Y.Rosser and being on Wikipedia subjects me to untruths and propaganda about what I have done and believe, I would just as soon not have a Wikipedia page because many of the things that are attributed to me on Wikipedia I have not done or written. It is a very public place where a person like me can be flayed and lied about without any recourse. It's a place where anti-Hindus like Hornplease can create his own hyperbol Wiki-reality about someone like me.—RRani 08:36, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Not an easy decision, but a review of the sources shows that several have little or nothing to do with John Machemehl. Much of the information can be sourced only to a genealogy, and most problematically, the claims of notability are not sourced or supported. The sources do provide evidence for the notability of relatives, such as Louis Machemehl, but this does not confer notability on John by association. While I dislike deletion of historical biographies, what's needed here is a reliable (preferably secondary) source backing up the claim that John was a leader in the migration or the subsequently-established community. If we were to remove the uncited claims, the claims not properly supported by their citations, and the material relating to descendants from the article, we would be left with a very sparse collection of family data, mainly consisting of dates of birth, marriage, and death.

<dd>The article was tagged for speedy deletion (db-bio) by user Evb-wiki on March 21, and deleted by me the same day. It was recreated by Bhaktivinode on the 23rd (as is his right), and tagged by me for db-bio on the 27th. This was removed by FloNight, with the mention on the talk page that it could go to AfD. This seemed reasonable, and so I did just that. The article was not "shown to be a notable article" expect by these statements on Talk:John Machemehl by the creator of the article, Bhaktivinode. As I indicate in my response to Bhaktivinode above, his one main source is not a reliable (nor an independent) source per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, and neither that one nor his other sources are indicating any notability for John Machemehl (I have e.g. no idea where Bhaktivinode gets the idea that John Machemehl is a "notable German"). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:54, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> I believe <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> is only refering to the old version of John Machemehl. The new version explicitly establishes his notability first as the forester for Annaberg, Saxony. Then for leading a group of Forty-Eighters to Central Texas from Saxony. Another issue is his involvement with the German Texan community during the Civil War era. User:Bhaktivinode March 28, 2007</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I'm referring to the current version. Besides, all the info was already in the article when I started this AfD notice, and even when I nominated it for speedy deletion<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Machemehl&amp;oldid=118191364" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Machemehl&amp;oldid=118191364" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. Being a forester etcetera is interesting, but does not mean he is notable. And I can't find anything in your sources that indicate that he was "Leading the Voyage to Texas"? The genealogy says that "Sometime between 1845 and 1850 John Machemehl, his father Michael and very young son Paul came to Texas from Germany. Their coming to the U.S. was part of the sizeable German migration". It seems like he was just one of the many migrants, and that only in the next generations did the family become somewhat notable locally. I would like to urge everyone judging this AfD to go through the sources provided in the article, to determine for themselves their value and the notability they give to John Machemehl, per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:14, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is issues such as these listed above - that makes the John Machemehl entry a notable one. in addition, sources such as The Eula and David Wintermann Library is a proper source. <a href="http://www.wintermannlibrary.org/struss.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wintermannlibrary.org/struss.htm" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.wintermannlibrary.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wintermannlibrary.org/" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> User:Bhaktivinode March 28, 2007</p>

<dd>Perhaps the Wintermannlibrary is a notable source (it is not directly clear), but it only gives some info on Paul Machemehl, none whatsoever on John Machemehl, so this source cannot be used to determine the notability of John Machemehl. And I don't agree that the "issues" listed above make him notable at all. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:23, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> That is not true.</p>
<p>The Wintermann Library says that around the time of the Civil War that, "John was discussing the hostility between the North and the South with Paul Machemehl of Bellville, Texas. Many Germans did not believe this was their fight and many joined <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Machemehl_da84.html" title="Paul Machemehl">Paul Machemehl</a> and rode south to Mexico to sit out the war before returning."</p>
<p>This is just one source. Thanks. User:Bhaktivinode March 28, 2007</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I would like to add that there are many points to consider in debating the notability of the John Machemehl article. Being the forester for the city of Annaberg, or the size of the migration are just a few of these points.</p>
<p>Aside from these points above is the context of John Machemehl in German-Texan history. Here, what is historically significant, aside from the points above, is that John Machemehl led a group of Forty-Eighters from Germany to Texas, not to any normal destination for German Forty-Eighters. This in itself is an important and notable event in the context of German-Texan history. There are many points to be considered. They should be treated one at a time. Please. Thank you.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In this situation that type of sourcing is adequate. We need not hold every type of subject content to identical standards. That is the reason that content is always decided on an individual basis, article by article, by groups of editors rather than rulings of the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee</a>. If you carefully read <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">our policies and guidelines related to content</a>, you will note that sources written by individuals or groups can be used for articles about the individual or group if there is good reason to think that they are true and are in fact a good source for the information. If we did not take this approach, we would not be able to fulfill our mission of collecting free, encyclopedic information on all possible topics. Many topics would not be covered adequately. Historically some groups were not covered by what we consider reliable sources today. Pioneers, historical women, U.S. slaves and other minority groups are examples of groups that are not adequately covered by traditional sources for varying reasons. Therefore documents such as letters, other historical documents, and well documented oral histories can be used if the information is not contentious. I hope this explanation helps explain why I support the inclusion of this article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree with the above. Also, I would like to add an additional point to those listed above. The fact remains that this is a new article and both minor and major events have yet to be filled in historical gaps. An example would be that I only recently came across the birth, death, and cemetary records for both John Machemehl and Henrietta Borel Machemehl found at <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~txaustin/Austin/CemeteryNames/Ma_Mc.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rootsweb.com/~txaustin/Austin/CemeteryNames/Ma_Mc.htm" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>.

<dd>Thanks for replying, FloNight, but, well, I have a completely different understanding of our <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> policy here, and I feel that this interpretation opens the door (or more precisley the floodgates) for almost every person willing to spend an hour writing something down to have an article on Wikipedia as long as they have a trustworthy looking source about themselves, no matter who writes or publishes it. The claim that we have no reliable sources for historical groups and figures and completely irrelevant and is plain wrong: we have no <i>contemporary</i> reliable sources, but there is no reason we can't have more recent reliable sources,and in fact we have such sources for every notable person (since that is exactly the definition of being notable of course. If those more recnt reliable sources are absent (as is the case here), then the person fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (which John Machemehl clearly does) and fails all but the most liberal interpretation of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>.Anyway, even accepting your interpretation of the use of self-published or questionable sources: this is the full extent of the sole source we have: <i>Sometime between 1845 and 1850 John Machemehl, his father Michael and very young son Paul came to Texas from Germany. Their coming to the U.S. was part of the sizeable German migration which resulted from the unrest in the various German principalities in the revolutionary period of the 1830’s and 1840’s. John’s wife, Henrietta Borel, brought with them on the 10 week sailing voyage a china set which now is in storage at the Mohle Drive home of Helen and Marlin Bownds where my son Jonathan lives. John had a university education, was forester for the city of Annaberg in Saxony. His wife Henrietta, born in Switzerland, was a French Huguenot who was a governess for the family of a Russian prince of Courland whose estate was on the Baltic. She met John Machemehl in Saxony while traveling with the Russian Family. Henrietta died in Texas in 1850. John married two more times, had four more children, and died in 1880.</i> Why would you want to have an article on this person, even if you would accept the source as good enough? What distinguishes him from thousands of other persons? The only thing that distinguishes him is that someone has put this info on his personal website... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:10, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

WP as a tool to connect with reliable sources is diminished by accepting article material on this basis.

<dd>I am not bringing it back to a debate on notability, notability is just one of the aspects in this deletion debate. And an article that is not speedyable is by no means exempt from deletion through AfD: the requirements to delete something through speedy are much stricter, and it is enough that one editor (apart from the creator) disagrees to make the speedy impossible. For speedy, you need an article that does not assert notability. To survive AfD, you need to show that notability with verifiable, reputable, independent sources. I think this article fails on both accounts, since all the claims made are not enough to make someone notable (interesting, perhaps, but not notable), and those claims are not supported by verifiable, reputable, independent sources: all we can verify is that he lived and where and when he died: I have no trouble accepting that he was the father of Paul either. But I have seen no evidence that he "provided leadership" or was a "central figure" beyond being the father of one barely notable person and the grandfather of one notable person: notability is not transferable. Information on his family is irrelevant for this discussion: it may be interesting to add to the article if it is kept, but it plays no part in the decision to keep or delete it. Please check out <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and see for yourself how John Machemehl thoroughly fails this. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:23, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You start out saying you are not taking the debate back to notability, but your article above is centered on this question of yours alone. John Machemehl was an early German Texan settler. That is enough. He does not have to part any seas as Moses did. I have shown above that there are many sources. I strongly disagree with you and am confident that this is the beginnings of a sound article. User:Bhaktivinode 29 March 2007</dd>

<p><b>comment</b> I have edited the article on John Machemehl, added soucrces and primarily - I have tried to place the disagrements over sources within context. If others are willing to assist, I would be more than appreciative. Thanks for review the above. User:Bhaktivinode 29 March 2007</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I think that being among the first European settlers in an area is potentially notable, depending on the historical circumstances, especially if the person is one of the leaders of the group. The problem is sources. The sources you are using are primary sources from which a biographical or genealogical account could be written. But if you were to do so--and it does look as if you are setting about it in a reasonable way--this would be the first time the material had ever been compiled, and would count as OR. I am not very restrictive about NOR--I think that assembling together obvious public sources into an article is legitimate. I believe that an article about a person based on a suitable secondary work but incorporating something from the primary public record is justifiable. But gathering a number of primary sources, checking the inscriptions of tombstones and on library collections of primary sources in unpublished genealogies and (in some other articles) prison records or social security records or deeds or immigration records, or the Sanford map series, --not here, but in other similar articles -- is OR, in the most basic sense. This is what local historians do. I'm not sure that there is yet as suitable wiki for the purpose, but there surely will be--and then we can discuss whether compilations there count as reliable secondary sources--I think it would depend on the standards of the Wiki. I might be prepared to accept such as site as the Wintermann library site as RS for the purpose if it gave sources (which it doesnt) --but not for this particular subject as he is only mentioned in a summary account of another family. So in conclusion, <i>weak delete as probable OR</i>. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:10, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - Editor <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a>, with all due respect, is incorrect. The <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallow.html" title="Hallow">Hallows</a> article, while possibly constituting a stub that is under construction, already constitutes (after only 2 days of existence) far more than a simple "dictionary definition of a word", although it certainly contains definition material (cited to dictionary). The article also links to the existing <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hallow" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hallow" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary entry</a> on the word, for a "more proper" definition and derivation reference. There are well cited definitions and usage examples, regarding <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallowmas.html" title="Hallowmas">Hallowmas</a>, and a well cited reference to Hallows literature (Tolkien's use of Hallows in <i>The Return of the King</i>). The "Immediate Deletion" recommendation appears to be connected to the ongoing debate at the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_7748.html" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a> article on the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Talk%7EHarry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_6608.html" title="Talk:Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Talk Page</a>. Admittedly, the article was also created in response to the same debate. The reason to keep is this: As the seventh <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._K._Rowling_604a.html" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> book comes closer to release, many many young people and adults will be looking for information on what <i>Hallows</i> might refer to, and it is the Wikipedia editors' duty to at the very least provide information on what the Hallows "currently are" (outside of the Potter books). That said, speculation about what Rowling's <i>Deathly Hallows</i> might be, should be at the very least restrained and controlled, if not banned. --<a href="../../../t/-/d/User%7ET-dot_4520.html" title="User:T-dot">T-dot</a> (<a href="../../../t/-/d/User_talk%7ET-dot_eb45.html" title="User talk:T-dot">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_T-dot_d7c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/T-dot">contribs</a>) 12:01, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Virtually all the material in the article was exported from the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_7748.html" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a> article, which is the sole reason for the creation of this article. All the material fits the definition of a dictionary entry as described in the relevant page from what wikipedia is not. The current wiktionary entry is a one line stub. This article as it stands is exactly what ought to be on the wiktionary page. Now, I have no objection to the material being reinserted into the page where it came from, where it served to explain the rather obscure title of the book. But by itself, it is only a definition, because the word has no other real-life usage. This article has become the centre of a debate on the 'Deathly Hallows' page. I would not have taken this to AfD so quickly if it was a simple stub, but the conclusion of the content debate on DH rather depends upon whether this is in itself a legitimate article. I contend that its sole reason for existing is to contain a definition of the word for the benefit of the parent article, and it would much better exist inside that parent. As a separate article it serves to confuse rather than inform readers, who would expect the information to be in 'Deathly Hallows'.

<dd><i>Articles are about the people, concepts, places, events, and things that their titles denote. The article octopus is about the animal: its physiology, its use as food, its scientific classification, and so forth.</i></dd>
<dd>Hallow fits this description. It is an article about the concept of "Hallows". It talks about what hallows are considered in many contexts. Compare this to the same line for the wikitionary:</dd>
<dd><i>Articles are about the actual words or idioms in their title. The article octopus is about the word "octopus": its part of speech, its pluralizations, its usage, its etymology, its translations into other languages, and so forth.</i></dd>
<dd>This article does not fit this criteria. It doesn't deal with it's part of speech, puralizations, usage, etc. It only deals with the concept of Hallows, which are mentioned in many works of fiction.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>: I think we all know that Sandpiper has initiated this just to prove a point and to try to push speculations back into the HP article. This reason is already enough to debunk this deletion request. But we can also see that this article is absolutely not a "dictionary" entry since it contains a history of the word in the literary context (moreover, the fact that the Grail is a hallow, increases the value of this article in the perspective of a "arthurian legends" category). You see, hallows are not mere objects, they are a the very center of many, many myths, both christian and celtic, and that's precisely the focus of the article, to replace hallows in their literary context. Thus this article is extremely relevant, and certainly won't be deleted just because of some petty rivalries over speculations about a fantasy novel that has not much to do with the real focus of the article. Sandpiper seems to have forgotten that the word Hallow has existed way before HP, and that such an article is just an essential part of a bigger work here in Wikipedia, on english traditions, and always leading the discussion back to his own petty disputes about an ultra-minor aspect of Hallows, shows Sandpiper's unability to have a general view on things. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel</a> 20:13, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. At first I was tempted to say keep, but I have to agree with the nominator in saying that the POV problems are pretty widespread and would require massive amounts of sourcing to counteract that. Even if someone were to do the footwork, compiling a list of nicknames that have effectively been used in some reputable publication is still an indiscriminate list. Besides, if I were interested in finding alternative nicknames for, say, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, I'd expect to find that information in the city's article rather than in a list. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:57, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; the sourcing problem can be easily remedied.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Nicknames for each individual city should go into the article for that city, not in a big huge list. This list (and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_city_nicknames_in_the_United_States_636d.html" title="List of city nicknames in the United States">List of city nicknames in the United States</a> in particular) is poorly sourced and vulnerable to people putting in their own definitions.

<li><b>comment</b> - Sourcing something of this size is a large task, but impossible? Hardly. In fact, there are several sources to draw on that could act as citations for many of the entries. Once the vast majority of it is sourced, the unsourced entries could be deleted, to be re-added if someone finds a citation. After that, it's easy to tell if any given edit is reasonable on the basis of its sources.

<li>What evidence would you like? Furthermore, what evidence do you have that it is untrue? It's not like theres video tapes of everything. What is it your wanting to allow this article to remain? The both links serve a purpose to prove that both player and competition actually exist. Secondly, the player link also allows the reader to acknowledge the player's background, showing the type of lifestyle he lives.

<li><b>Comment</b> Neither link proves anything relating to <i><b>this team</b></i>. The first one proves that a particular sports centre exists, it doesn't say anything about this team playing there. The second link proves that someone with a name matching one of the players was very impressed with the services of some bank, that doesn't prove anything about this team, which is the subject of the article. If you read the policy I directed you to above, you will see that an article needs to show evidence of <i><b>independent coverage</b></i> in <i><b>reliable sources</b></i> of <i><b>the actual subject of the article</b></i>. If this isn't possible then the article doesn't meet WP guidelines.

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. Of the seven Keep commentors, four are accounts registered after this AfD and which have few edits except here. The other three are <i>all three</i> registered <i>before</i> this AfD, but only a <i>short time</i> before, and which have a reasonable number of edits outside this AfD, considering that they are new accounts. The first four have little or no standing, the standing of the other three is somewhat questionable. That leaves the nominator and one other commentor in full standing. Both suggested Delete. This is not really a quorum. But looking at the links,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.direct-marketing-association-india.org/resources.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.direct-marketing-association-india.org/resources.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a> seems not to refer to eDesk onine.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.direct-marketing-association-india.org/resources.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.direct-marketing-association-india.org/resources.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a>, maxine.com, is an online magazine. How popular it is I don't know, but purely online sources have a low entry cost.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.direct-marketing-association-india.org/resources.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.direct-marketing-association-india.org/resources.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a>, reviewcentre.com, is just a sort of formum for users to post reviews of products. And there is just one such review.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.direct-marketing-association-india.org/resources.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.direct-marketing-association-india.org/resources.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a> is not a review, just a note that that (small) website is now using eDesk online.</li>
<li>The other four links are just sites that are <i>using</i> the software.</li>
</ul>
<p>So... <i>one</i> legitimate link, its legitimacy low because it is online. Because of the very low publishing cost, online magazines are often closer to being blogs than they are to being real print magazines, although that's not necessarily true of maxine.com.</p>
<p>Therefore the Keep argument falls apart. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 20:05, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm not sure if "South Tibet" is older than "Arunachal Pradesh"; in fact my impression is that "South Tibet" is just a name invented recently by Chinese activists. The PRC government would probably refer to it simply as "disputed territories along the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border", or "Indian-occupied territory south of the illegal McMahon Line", etc. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 17:28, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>The name of Arunachal Pradesh wont exist before 1960s,for this regions,there should be one name to describe it.Arunachal Pradesh is a very very new name and nothing to do with the its tibetan connection.And your claim south tibet was a chinese fabrication was totally ungrounded.At least South Tibet emphasised the historic connection for this regions while Arunachal Pradesh is tthoroughy an <b>alien imposed</b> name for its people who lived in these regions.--<a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsyrie_4e02.html" title="User:Ksyrie">Ksyrie</a> 21:41, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You think I'm being unfair? Change my mind. Make it into something that doesn't appear to have those qualities that I found in the article. I will be frank: if I wanted this kind of information in an encyclopedia, I'd locate it in the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Weekly_27b6.html" title="Seattle Weekly">Seattle Weekly</a> - which itself is everything <i>except</i> encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 18:27, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Epbr123 and Dennisthe2: originally you stated it reads like a how-to article. I said I did not believe it read like a how-to, but that I would make certain changes. I said it was unfair to characterize it as a how to article because the data was historical information and therefore even if some statements seemed like they were instructiions, those were merely defects in the phrasing and not in the entire article itself. The article has since been ammended and presently you've both come back and seem to have dropped or did not continue the "how-to" criticism.
<ul>
<li>putting aside the new issues, are you now satisfied that the ammendments made to the article addressed the "how-to" issue to your satisfaction?</li>

<li>Epbr2: you state that all I need to do is provide reliable independent sources which talk about the toronto goth scene. I have provided sources which are both reliable and independant. They are not all independant of the city of toronto itself. The only self published source in the article heads up a ghost research historical society (something distinct but not utterly unrelated to goth), was never a goth himself, and is regular content contributor to a licensed commercial Toronto area radio show on the paranormal, he would not just make up historical facts on the origins of the goth scene. The rest of the sources are taken from third party secondary sources, or toronto mainstream culture reporting. Its fully cited and their statements are verifiable. If their vernacular is informal its because the are culture media. Where claims of reactions from the "goth community" are made, these media sources are making such claims and have indicated who they were getting such reactions from. I'm not putting in rumours or my personal anecdotes. references are provided for everything. And if the reader may object to a specific one, that is not a defect in the ENTIRE article. The facts given are from these sources and the information is presented in chronological sequence as is appropriate for such an article. Even 'OR' sounding claims such as the Ann Rice preponderance in the scene are merely claims as reported in those media sources (and the ann rice connection is repeatedly stated by seperate media). The claim about "fashion victims" was from an interview published by the authors of a published printed book called the Goth Bible, as part of his or her own seperate secondary research. One of his or her interviewees was from toronto. And that is what the interviewee said and I quoted it exactly as said as to show its nature. These are not a self published statements, however but published by a independant researchers. in any event this article contains no original research, even if it may seem to. References are provided.</li>

<li>Dennisthe2: you said "Make it into something that doesn't appear to have those qualities that I found in the article. " The only issue you raised was that it seems like a "how to". and you talk about not wanting a certain "kind" of information in an encyclopedia. if you are saying the history of major subcultures in a city of 3 million is not worthy of an encyclopedia, then there is nothing I can do to convince you because that is the topic of this article. But this is not a current events article. Its 30 years of history. history doesn't change. It is encyclopedic. If an article on <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grunge_speak.html" title="Grunge speak">Grunge speak</a> """Grunge speak was a hoax created by Megan Jasper""" is appropriate for wiki, if there is an article on a commin book about the goth scene <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_the_Homicidal_Maniac_4fc1.html" title="Johnny the Homicidal Maniac">Johnny the Homicidal Maniac</a> in wiki or on a so called goth/punk clothing store <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Topic_73ec.html" title="Hot Topic">Hot Topic</a> on wiki, what makes an article documenting the history of the transformation of a "freak" subculture tranforming into a specific form of goth subculture which in turn became pop-culture, and finally imploding in the aftermath of columbine over a 30 years period in the 5th largest city in North America inappropriate for wiki? Wiki is not a paper encyclopedia. And I think its unfair to call this a how-to or prohibit this kind of information in this specific case but allow even more trifling information about a hoax of a fake gruge slang or a comic book in wiki. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDarknessVisible_adbc.html" title="User:TheDarknessVisible">TheDarknessVisible</a> 01:07, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But, there are a number of problems. First, the article still reads like...well, a <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_Voice_Media_e032.html" title="Village Voice Media">Village Voice Media</a> article about where to go to be part of the local goth culture and what to expect. Second, and much more importantly, the article doesn't tout why it's notable. What's so notable about the Toronto goths? Do they exclusively listen to Closed Caskets For The Living Impaired, right after listening to <a href="../../../a/_/p/A_Prairie_Home_Companion_8301.html" title="A Prairie Home Companion">A Prairie Home Companion</a>? Is there a larger concentration of $religion in this group? You get the idea - but of course, you'll also have to explain why those are significant! Every locality has its goth clubs/raves/cliques/whatever - you go to Los Angeles, Orange County, here in the greater Seattle area, you name it, you'll find it, and as near as I've seen, there is no more notability in each individual scene than in Toronto. So that's going to be the big one. If you can tell me why Toronto goths are more notable than goth at large, I'll compromise on the first pointer and change my&#160;!vote. But if you can't do that, then there's no way to hold it against WP's standards and make it stick.

<p>The article does not need to tout why it is notable.</p>

<p>I believe you have misinterpretted the wiki rules.

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you don't understand. What I am applying is a combination of rules and precedent. Each region in my explanation has its own goth scene, but each region has nothing particularly unique about it other than geographic center point that makes it notable, and even then, the geographic center point becomes little more than an identifier - a commonality for any subculture. That lack of notability keeps them off of here - and frankly, I have a few goth friends that dismiss claims of regional notability in general. Never said anything bad about Toronto, but that's an aside. (Just that it's a decent place.) Granted, too, that this is something more of a gauge, rather than a hard factor - but gauges can point to what is there. So now you're left with the fact that you now need to have the article tout its own notability - this is not only contrary to your claim above that it doesn't, but is in fact per the guideline found at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. A history of the area's goth culture is great, but again, <i>why is it notable</i>? Hell, <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a> is on here as notable - not because it has a history, but because of its pervasiveness on the 'net alone. I have a history, but I'm not notable. At any rate, until you can answer that question, my&#160;!vote stands. A suggestion: if you need more time, preserve and modify the article in your userspace, and bring it up in deletion review if you can get it up to snuff. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 17:44, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dennisthe2: I read the rules on notability (for the 20th time). I'll bring you attention to a few.</p>
<p>""""Notable is defined as "worthy of being noted" or "attracting notice"; it is <b>not</b> synonymous with "fame" or "importance".""""</p>
<p>Also: you've made a big deal of this particular view that you hold "as near as I've seen, there is <b>no more notability</b> in each individual scene than in Toronto. So that's going to be the big one." and also you say "<b>I have a few goth friends that dismiss claims of regional notability in general.</b>" and yet:</p>
<p>""""<b>Subjective evaluations are not relevant</b> for determining whether a topic warrants inclusion in Wikipedia. Notability criteria do not equate to personal or biased considerations, such as: "never heard of this", "an interesting article", "topic deserves attention", "not famous enough", "very important issue", "popular", "I like it", "only of interest to [some group]", etc.</p>
<p>General notability is <b>not judged by Wikipedia editors directly</b>. The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable. This is unrelated to whether a Wikipedia editor personally finds the subject remarkable or worthy.""""</p>
<p>You seemingly have conceded that Toronto Goth Scene is actually technically notable according to standard wiki rules. However now you've stated that you believe there is a wiki rule or "precedent" that is a standard wiki policy stating that subcultural topics must go BEYOND the standard wiki rules of notability, but actually must establish they are somehow MORE NOTABLE compared to other things that editors suspect fit in the same catagory.</p>
<p>The issue of a "history section" was merely to justify that this is NOT a "how-to" article, it has no bearing on the argument of notability which deals strictly and objectively with whether or not its been noted in independant publications.</p>
<p>can you please direct me to the wiki page describing this precedent you have referred to so that all the people who are voting are able to assess the comparative notability according to the wiki guidelines, if such a guideline actually exists.</p>
<p>the article actually does provide an independant music journal based out of Montreal (another city, and location of the later dawson college shooting) noting that toronto (which is the 5th most populous city in North America) had the highest concentration of goths anywhere in the WORLD and Toronto may as well be called "gotham city". no one EVER made such a claim for orange county.</p>
<p>But I am not going to argue that toronto is MORE notable than orange county or whatever your "baseline" is, unless there is an official wiki guideline.</p>
<p>on google if I search for "toronto goth" I get 15,900 hits, "orange county goth" gets 9,710 hits. "Seattle goth" gets 3,520 hits. "LA goth" gets 12,200 hits. "Los Angeles Goth" gets 599. "New York Goth" only gets 694. "New York City Goth" gets 3,460, "Chicago Goth" gets 821. "Mexico Goth" gets 670 hits. "San Fransisco Goth" gets 1,240. "Montreal Goth" 306</p>
<p>Perhaps you would like to see that in the actual wiki page, if you think the page is obligated to TOUT its notability.</p>
<p>It seems that more people talk about Toronto Goth than any other place in north america, that I can think of typing into google. of course this, like the opinion of you and your "goth" friends doesn't really matter unless there is in fact a rule about establishing something is MORE notable than another thing.</p>
<p>here is a reference specifically referring to "Vancouver's Goth Culture".. obviously someone distinguishes it from Toronto's goth subculture. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Here's a ref specifically saying "Toronto's Goth Culture" <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>there is a notable difference or people would not make note of it. and it is not for wiki editors to subjectively judge these things.</p>

<li>I only asked you to provide the wiki page which discusses the precedent you cited that Toronto Goth Scene must be *more notable* than other scenes. Why would you refuse to disclose that? You and some other 'delete', in fact MOST of you. seem to believe a topic must establish GREATER notability than others, and none will show the wiki policy page.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDarknessVisible_adbc.html" title="User:TheDarknessVisible">TheDarknessVisible</a> 23:13, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Distinction from goth subcultures elsewhere is gradually being backed up by reliable sources. The article is still not near where it should be but it will get there. Look at the diffs to previous versions over the past few days since creation and please acknowledge the genuine efforts made to comply with all policy. Toronto's goth culture may not be any more notable than ones elsewhere, but it is notable by being discussed in various sources (reliability of some is questionable, but I'm looking into it) and works in pop culture. It is not this article's fault that articles for other cities do not exist. At least some of this information is suitable for inclusion in the encyclopedia, but a merge into <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_in_Toronto_d133.html" title="Culture in Toronto">Culture in Toronto</a> would make it excessively long and too heavily focused on one subject, which means it should be split per <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a>. –<a href="../../../p/o/m/User_talk%7EPomte_8819.html" title="User talk:Pomte">Pomte</a> 04:16, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> there is no wiki rule requiring "compelling evidence to support the assertion that this is materially different from the goth scene elsewhere". (and the history of no other goth scene whatsoever is actually documented in any detail anywhere on wiki) DennisThe2 can not back up his claims that this is a "how-to article" and has abandonned them, hoary said delete because he found an earlier style of narration humerous.. this is no longer the case. The article is extensively referenced and is not OR (or none remains), but rather a neutral summary of many independant sources reporting on the topic. The article advances no position. Otherwise as per Pomte.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDarknessVisible_adbc.html" title="User:TheDarknessVisible">TheDarknessVisible</a> 23:13, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Goth Bible, Montreal Mirror, Mardust music and The Vampire Book were all written and published outside toronto. the first 2 from montreal, the next 2 from michigan. goth bible discusses at least 2 goth stores in toronto, how "gothic" fashion was brought from the UK to toronto by Groovella, and includes an interview with a St.Catherines (small city nearby toronto) DJ who discusses bands from toronto and how the lack of local bands has forced local goths to be more involved with what goes on overseas. Also the same author publishes some interview material with toronto goths. mardust has an article about toronto's goth scene called "Rennaisance City", and talks about how in 2003 the scene in Toronto was still hanging on unlike other cities. montreal mirror in 1998 talks about how there are so many goths in toronto and said toronto may as well be called "gotham city" and Mitch Kroll's opinion that toronto goths are shallow and pretentious and in fact are glam more than goth. vampire book talks about groovella and siren, the worlds oldest vampire/goth fashion store (closed since 2005). there are 4 non trivial publications talking specifically about the toronto goth scene, published and written outside of toronto. dont interpret this as me agreeing that newspapers inside Toronto can't be relied upon; they are independant of the goth scene. however you asked. there are also some other sources which talk about it, but their reliability in wiki terms is unknown right now so I am not mentioning them here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDarknessVisible_adbc.html" title="User:TheDarknessVisible">TheDarknessVisible</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDarknessVisible_014d.html" title="User talk:TheDarknessVisible">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDarknessVisible_dbfd.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDarknessVisible">contribs</a>) 18:23, 4 April 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If someone as academically insignificant as Tom Palmer has a Wiki, so should Kinsella, who (as the previous poster noted) has a huge CV with numerous impressive articles, referenced by various sources. Kinsella also has a well-acclaimed book on International Law that has been published, and is available on Amazon.com. Along with a 9-part treatise on the law of commerce. And a book on Online Contract Formation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.151.71.18_4e2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.151.71.18">128.151.71.18</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/8/User_talk%7E128.151.71.18.html" title="User talk:128.151.71.18">talk</a>) 15:34, 28 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems to have plenty of non-trivial references. It sets a bad precedent to start reevaluating selected articles simply because elements of Wikipedia policy have been modified.

<p>Anon-removed Prod. I can't find any sources (reliable or otherwise) for a gang of this name, which is perhaps not surprising when dealing with street gangs in general. Obviously there are notable street gangs, but there's nothing that seems to demonstrate that this particular one is. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:08, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now; if you look at the article <a href="../../../5/t/_/5T_410b.html" title="5T">5T</a>, there are some references there that mention the Black Dragons. This is a new article, we should perhaps wait until the authors have finished work on the article before deciding that it has insufficient notability and sources. I'm at least convinced that it isn't a hoax, and that it is a real gang that has attracted the attention of the police and the community. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 21:09, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That is to say that of the externally-linked websites (the only thing I can access right at the moment), there's a grand total of one Sydney Morning Herald article saying that "Police are aware of another gang calling itself 'Black Dragon'". Nothing much more about what this particular gang does, and I doubt that's even a non-trivial mention. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:31, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>speedy keep</b>, bad-faith nomination. AfD is not for solving content disputes, as long as everybody agrees there should be an article on this topic. Which is pretty obvious in this case. If the nominator wants a clean rewrite, he can write one any time (but he'll be well advised to get consensus for that beforehand, difficult as it may be.) <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 15:02, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The nominating editor has long tried to completely change the article. As anyone can see, the article has plenty of references. Currently there are 91 footnotes alone. No other article on an ethnic group, not even featured ones, have that many references. This user has accused contributors of hidden far-right agendas and repeatedly flooded the articles talkpage with supposed claims that were not even in the article. Because his version, or adaptations of the article were reverted by multiple users many times, this is just another attempt at disrupting the wikipedia process of writing a good article. To me personally this request for deletion just radiates the following thought: "<i>If I can't have it my way, nobody will have it his/her/their way</i>". I hope (but don't really doubt) others will follow and also oppose this request.<a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a> 13:05, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Where's the dividing line? The facts on this page are notable and verifiable - maybe not so highbrow by today's standards, but exactly the sort of information typically discarded as ephemera until it's nearly impossible for later generations of scholars to recover it. In the late twentieth century it took a <i>doctoral dissertation</i> to track down all occurrences of Joan of Arc in film. Many of the early prints no longer exist at all.

<li>"Electrons are cheap" is also not particularly compelling. We have policies and guidelines and articles that don't meet them are deleted regardless of how cheap electrons are.

<li>Sarcasm is not particularly compelling. Social historians read such data as evidence that this individual remains known to younger generations.

Those who disagree with this kind of articles have chance as anybody else to propose effective Wikipedia policy to deal with them (including 3RR &amp; blocks). It would be much better than to move even more burden on maintainers of the main article. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 09:25, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Basically you're arguing <a href="../../../b/h/t/WP%7EBHTT_103f.html" title="WP:BHTT">better in a separate article than in the main article</a> because it's more convenient for the people who monitor the main article. That is a terrible argument. If the information is garbage, then it's garbage no matter what article it's in.

<li>Agreed, but that is not an argument for notability. I noticed you have added an external reference to assert notability. Great - do you want to add that to the original article? And is that sufficient to assert notability (I'm not competent enough to judge this)? And may I politely request that people who state here that the band is notable back it up with a link (as <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> has done) rather than just state they are notable? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinson_weijman_cd79.html" title="User:Robinson weijman">Robinson weijman</a> 07:20, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Just because a band isn't hugely popular in the US doesn't mean it isn't notable. Ask any Icelander who is even a little in touch with the music scene and they'll have heard of Mínus. Maybe we aren't as large of a country as the US, but we have as much of a right to Wikipedia as Americans do, and plenty of us speak English. I agree that the article is in definite need of cleaning, but I always thought one of the beautiful parts of Wikipedia was that you could find obscure things on it that you can't find in normal encyclopedias. 207.75.39.11 02:49, 30 March 2007 (UTC)Sigurjón Leónarðsson 22:44, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Wikipedia is not about rights ("our right to Wikipedia"), and that was not why I highlighted this item for deletion. In this case, the subject is notability. You say it is notable in Iceland. Great - add the proof to the article, for the benefit of those of us not resident in Iceland. Then the article won't be deleted. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinson_weijman_cd79.html" title="User:Robinson weijman">Robinson weijman</a> 06:26, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Google may not be enough to rule out notability, given that his project is in a developing country where web presence may not indicate notability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, consider these sources. The ProjectHonduras website (admittedly not an independent source) <a href="http://www.projecthonduras.com/marco.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.projecthonduras.com/marco.htm" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> - but it does show that that the Marco A. Caceres, that John Carter links above, Marco A. Caceres, the satellite engineer, the one with quotables established on a quotes website etc., is in fact the same person.</p>
<p>There is independent verification that he was a finalist for the Petersburg Prize, now called the Development Gateway Award</p>
<p>From the Petersburg Prize website, detailing the reasons for his nomination:</p>
<p>Marco Cáceres, Projecthonduras.com, Honduras: For outstanding use of the web to connect potential sources of aid to those in need. Mr. Cáceres created Projecthonduras.com, a website that has been notably successful in using the web to bring together organizations and individuals to form strategic alliances, publicize needs, and better coordinate aid and relief resources for one of the poorest countries in Latin America. Source: <a href="http://home.developmentgateway.org/prize/home.do" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.developmentgateway.org/prize/home.do" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> - I will add this to the article.</p>
<p>I note that the 2006 winner of this prize is also a Nobel Prize winner, so it is probably a notable prize. <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScarykitty_2934.html" title="User:Scarykitty">Scarykitty</a> 20:18, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I will agree that this article is not written from an out-of-universe perspective, it is not original research. The Harry Potter Lexicon has <a href="http://hp-lexicon.org/timelines/timeline.php" class="external text" title="http://hp-lexicon.org/timelines/timeline.php" rel="nofollow">compiled this timeline</a>; the Lexicon is a site which the series' author J. K. Rowling <a href="http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/fansite_view.cfm?id=14" class="external text" title="http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/fansite_view.cfm?id=14" rel="nofollow">uses to fact-check information</a> while without her books and writing; the films' producers also <a href="http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/films/lex-op-set-teaser.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/films/lex-op-set-teaser.html" rel="nofollow">use the site</a> almost every day for reference. As for the significance of the timeline, perhaps it would be better to merge all this information into appropriate articles, but it is appropriate somewhere. I know that articles, meant to be written from an out-of-universe perspective, would not include this information, but to mention this as a "within the series" sidenote is something I feel is okay. I don't have a strong vote for keep, nor for delete, but <i>the information</i> is what is important here, and I feel it belongs somewhere on Wikipedia. --<b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">Fbv</a></b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">65</a><i><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_Esperanza_2f4a.html" title="User:Fbv65edel/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">del</a></i> / <a href="../../../f/b/v/User_talk%7EFbv65edel_60e2.html" title="User talk:Fbv65edel">☑t</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fbv65edel_f6f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fbv65edel">☛c</a> || 02:45, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>The information all comes from the books, and as such is all sourced, or in principle could be, to the relevant reference to a book/chapter.(or comments by Rowling) A similar list was compiled and published by HP-Lexicon on their website. This list was adopted by warner bros, and included in the DVDs of the films which they have issued, so again the timeline itself has also been largely published separately and is accessible by anyone with a copy of the film DVD and a computer. To be more precise on this claim of authorship, Warner have acknowledged privateley assistance from HP-Lexicon in creating their films, but have not publically acknowledged where they got the info. However, Lexicon maintain their claim, which is published on their website, and also comment that a mistake in their original posted timeline was reproduced precisely in the one published by Warner. The information collected in this way is useful to any reader wanting to better understand the events of the books. It is not a plot summary, as it does not summarise the plot. Rather, it analyses the information and presents in a more useful way than simply re-telling the story. It is not OR, firstly because it is merely a tabulation of dates extracted wherever they occur, but secondly because it has been published elsewhere. As to e.g. when broomsticks were first used for transpot, I fancy this comes from the book by Rowling 'Quidditch through the ages', so is sourced. A lot of trivia about HP has been released by Rowling either in these ancillary books, or in her continuing posts on her website, e.g. 'wizard of the month'. As far as I am aware, being in- or out- universe is no criterion for deleting anything. It might argue for rewriting, but I'm not exactly sure how you would propose rewriting a list of events. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandpiper_0787.html" title="User talk:Sandpiper">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sandpiper_bbed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sandpiper">contribs</a>) 15:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

And there is a difference between making wikipedia a phonebook and providing information about a <i>very</i> popular book, which a lot of readers want to read about. Remember, we are here to serve the readers, not the opinions of those editors who dislike 'low-brow' articles. And there are plenty of readers who want to be able to find out information which is important to the novel. And it is better that <i>we</i> provide that information - since we can ensure that it is trustworthy and reliable - than allow readers to slope off to a website that may have wrong information. Is that not the point of wikipedia? Otherwise, why bother? Let the readers go to Britannica or Encarta for information on science and history, let them google for information on their favourite soaps and pop-stars! What is the <i>point</i> of wikipedia, if we do not write about <i>everything</i> that we are interested in - provided, of course, that it is notable enough, and is sourced. This article is on an extraordinarily notable subject, is part of a phenomenon. It is not well sourced, or well written; that can be improved. But if there is any purpose at all in wikipedia, it is to ensure that we provide as thorough articles and subjects as possible. Which this article goes towards fulfilling. We all know that wikipedia's strengths lie not in its accuracy, or writing style - how could it? - but in the breadth and depth of the subject matter.

<li>Thanks. The original data, then, is copyrighted either by Warner Brothers or by the website that alleges that they copied its material; in either case, it's not public domain. If the page were attributed to the DVD, that would resolve OR problems, but, IMHO, raise copyright problems. Even with minor rewording, I don't think the page would avoid copyright issues.

<ul>
<li>Ugh. I'll give that some thought, but let me get this straight. (1) The dates on the Wikipedia page weren't calculated by Wikipedia editors, they were calculated by the authors of The Lexicon page. (2) Rowling has stated that she personally relies on The Lexicon. Is that right? Also, where has Rowling stated #2 and why isn't it sourced in the article? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 14:01, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1)I would say the majority of dates-events are simply extracted from the books or specific statements by Rowling. e.g, Minerva McGonagall is asked how long she has been teaching and says so. Therefore a trivial calcualtion says the date she started was that number of years before the year in which that book is set. The clues referred to in the introduction were used to determine the school year of one set of characters. From, this a number of other dates simply follow. Similarly, another set of clues defines the school years of a second set of characters and more dates therefore follow from the text. The assembly of these clues was originally done and first published as an argument for particular reference dates by Lexicon. The resulting dates were then effectively confirmed by their publication as official background information, by Warner bros. So while the Lexicon proposed one method of fixing dates, I am not sure precisely whether this is Warner confirming their method, or simply using authorial fiat to choose to make the official dates happen to agree with those suggested by Lexicon. No one has exactly confirmed that Lexicon's orignal arguments determining the reference dates were right or wrong, the dates have simply been adopted. In one sense, the reference dates may literally not have existed before lexicon's contribution. However, now they officially do exist as background information about the characters. So essentially the dates now exist on many websites simply as information extracted from the body of official information published in connection with the series. The dates on this page are a collection of such information, and a similar page (well, several and in more detail) exists on Lexicon. The now official dating therefore has many sources outside wiki or Lexicon. However, Lexicon lays claim to the method of dating and to an original contribution to the stories. This is, in its own right quite interesting. A website arguably altered the course of the books.</li>
<li>(2) is a bit easier. See <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_Lexicon_28eb.html" title="Harry Potter Lexicon">Harry Potter Lexicon</a>. Rowling stated that she is in the habit of working in cafes etc, and that she has been known to check a fact about her books on the Lexicon website, rather than go to a bookshop and buy a copy to check something. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 21:25, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article is plagued with constant Original Research and speculation. I can't see how sentences like "It is possible that Fudge could be referring to a more distant predecessor" is in any way relavant. There is not ONE singal source that states Rowlings world is meant to parrallel the real world. All other sources are fan sites trying to compare the Harry Potter universe to the real world and is completely original research, or where sourced, it is still unreliable sourcing (citing fan pages)... which don't have notibility. Thought of course this will end as no consesus because it is to popular... I gave up trying to remove OR from Harry Potter pages ages ago because the fandom is to strong. Even the timeline is a copy edit problem, stolen from the DVD, the rest of the article is just plain OR and fancruft.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 09:53, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - it all derives from the books, and from what Rowling has said. It matches the timeline from Lexicon and the DVD, yes, because they wrote it out from the same sources.

<dd>It comes from the books, Rowlings interviews and websites. And yes, it hasn't been sourced properly. But that can be done in time.

<dd>I voted <i>keep</i> (mainly because the claims that the dates in themselves are OR is false), but I might change my opinion...It's true that if we remove all the OR in the article, there only remains the list.</dd>
<dd>So, what we have to know is what would be the use of such a list&#160;? Knowing the age of the characters&#160;? This can easily be mentionned in a single sentence in the relevant articles. Knowing when the books are supposed to happen&#160;? Again, a mention in the relevant articles is enough.</dd>
<dd>Really, such list can only be interesting on fan websites, and since dates have never been of great importance within the story of HP (JKR didn't even bothered to mention precise years, except for one occasion, Nick's "deathday" -or whatever-) the notability on Wikipedia is probably close to zero...<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel</a> 22:17, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A description of the way the date references were originally derived by lexicon is not OR, in fact it is more by way of history now, since it is detailing how the relative dates in the originally published books became absolute dates confirmed by warner bros. But leaving aside why we might dismiss half the article from consideration, the dates are important. Firstly, the article serves to collect all the date information in one place where it can be referred to from all the articles rather than being repeated all over the place. Second, it helps to understand how events relate to each other, if there is a straightforward list which can be referred to. The article is one part of a rather large series. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 00:23, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

Then, WP is not a plot summary either, what's the point of summing up all the events in a chronological order, if it's already given in the books (with indications concerning the order)&#160;? We would have to add analyses and all to avoid being exclusively in-universe. What could we say more&#160;? POV statements that Warner stole lexicon's chronology, and OR to fill in the blanks between JKR's various inconsistencies (btw, would these exist if dates were so "important"? )&#160;?<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel</a> 00:43, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><del><b>Comment</b> Having heard of this before, I think it's possible to find verifiable sources. I know at one point Graal was called Zelda Online (as it started life as an online version of <a href="../../../a/_/l/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_A_Link_to_the_Past_75bb.html" title="The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a>), but was changed when Nintendo sent them a cease and desist letter. I'll take a look around and see if I can find anything.

<p>This article is absolutely unsuitable for an encyclopedia. It is a collection of <i>information</i> that is irrelevant to the article. There is no reason why anyone would want such information as provided (the views of philosophers) and the links are all spammy. Some of it cannot possibly be sourced and is POV.

<li><b>Do something with it</b> I'm not sure merging is the best solution but perhaps renaming and refocusing is not a bad idea. There's some decent info in there. There's also a bunch of junk and this should all be sorted out. In any case, the title is inappropriate: besides the capitalization and the obvious concerns about the "pros" of any kind of death, it's also not descriptive of the content which is centered about individuals and associations who have defended suicide as a valid option.

<li><b>Oppose</b> Well if it wants to be explained further and as detailed as this one; a new firefox 2 article with deep research can be started as well. Since the version 2 is quite new, (then a 7th version as an example) someone hasn't written yet. Then all Photoshop versions should be united as one, and all Windows versions and then all Godfather series, Star Wars series etc..

<p>I can find no credible references that this actually existed. What I can find is numerous propaganda tracts which are clearly designed to promote a political agenda and not to inform. The page previously contained many fabricated quotes (now moved to talk) from important Revolution-era Americans which the author seems to admit were fabricated. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebrane_d41b.html" title="User:Rebrane">Eliot</a> 16:30, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Certainly the colonies issued money, some which could be referred to as scrip. See <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_currency_8b39.html#History" title="United States currency">United States currency#History</a> and the articles on the individual colonies' currency linked from there. This should either be a redirect or kept but with better coordination with the other existing articles on related topics, none of which are currently linked. Of course I agree that "propaganda tracts" should not be used as a source. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:07, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Of course it existed. This is just an article needing expansion and sourcing. Encyclopedic topic. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article needs to stay and it can indeed. It just needs improvement. It is a historical fact that Dr. Franklin helped devise this currency in 1723 and he went to London in 1764 and explained to the British Board of Trade the benefits of the paper currency. When Parliament shut it down he represented the Colonies and urged Parliament to allow the Colonial Scrip.</li>
</ul>
<p>Franklin wrote in his autobiography “The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident as never afterwards to be much disputed.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, here is an actual quote from Adam Smith regarding the Pennsylvanlia Currency, the best of the Colonial Currency experiments and the one that Franklin helped create. Here is what Adam Smith, the "Father of modern economics" said:</p>
<p>“The government of Pennsylvania, without amassing any [gold or silver], invented a method of lending, not money indeed, but what is equivalent to money to its subjects. [It advanced] to private people at interest, upon [land as collateral], paper bills of credit…made transferable from hand to hand like bank notes, and declared by act of assembly to be legal tender in all payments...[the system] went a considerable way toward defraying the annual expense…of that…government [low taxes].” “[Pennsylvania’s] paper currency…is said never to have sunk below the value of gold and silver which was current in the colony before the…issue of paper money.” -Adam Smith, the “Father of modern economics” as we are taught today, in his famed 1776 work The Wealth of Nations (I have provided the source in the main article)</p>
<p>Here is what David Ricardo said about the notion of Government-issued money:</p>
<p>“It appears that the commerce of the country would not be in the least impeded by depriving the [central bank] of the power of issuing paper money, provided an amount of such money, equal to the Bank circulation, was issued by the Government: and that the sole effect of depriving the Bank this privilege, would be to transfer the profit which accrues from the interest on the money so issued from the Bank to the Government.” -David Ricardo, British economist, free trade supporter, and member of Parliament in his book Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank, published posthumously in 1824.</p>
<p>“After Franklin gave explanations on the true cause of the prosperity of the Colonies, the Parliament exacted laws forbidding the use of this money in the payment of taxes. This decision brought so many drawbacks and so much poverty to the people that it was the main cause of the Revolution. The suppression of the Colonial money was a much more important reason for the general uprising than the Tea and Stamp Act.” -Peter Cooper, inventor, writer, founder of Cooper Union College, and US Presidential Candidate in 1876, his 1883 book Ideas for a Science of Good Government</p>
<p>This article deserves to stay because Colonial Scrip is a very important part of the history of economics and it must be remembered.</p>
<p>I have now updated the article with credible quotes that demonstrates the significance of this article. It should not be deleted.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. First of all, <a href="../../../p/a/p/WP%7EPAPER_01fc.html" title="WP:PAPER">WP:PAPER</a> refers to the idea that we will <i>not</i> run out of webspace. In fact, it specifically says that "there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover, or the total amount of content" so on its own that's no reason to delete an article. People donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Wikimedia foundation every time we have a drive, to ensure that we have the hosting capacity we need to keep expanding. Secondly, I don't feel that this falls into "every fad or item conceived", at least any more than other dances mentioned in songs (like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Loco-Motion_4857.html" title="The Loco-Motion">the Loco-Motion</a> or <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twist_%28dance%29.html" title="Twist (dance)">the twist</a>). Jacking was a pretty common (if stereotypical) dance style in the late 80s. I know Google hits aren't dependable, but with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=jacking+dance&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=jacking+dance&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">almost half a million</a> it seems like there must be at least a couple of reliable sources out there.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If the gentle reader will look at the title of WP:PAPER it includes the word "not". I also included "not" in my preamble making this a double negative. Since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a> is taking hits on the talkpage, my intent was that even though Wikipedia is believed not to be unlimited in web content or storage, there will come a level when non-notable articles like this will not be included. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 06:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We can worry about that if (and that's a big "if") that time ever comes.</dd>
<dd>As far as your use of WP:PAPER, at this point I think you should really just say, "oops, sorry," and let it go. "Wikipedia is not Wikipedia is not paper" (the supposed double negative you created) doesn't make any sense as a sentence. Even if it was shortened to "Wikipedia is not not paper", that's <i>still</i> nonsense, because Wikipedia <b>is not</b> paper. No amount of doublespeak is going to change that. It simply does not apply here, and the semantic arguments don't help this discussion. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 16:10, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not speaking for you. I'm asking you to stop trying to rationalize your misguided use of WP:PAPER. I agree that the nomination was in good faith (well, mostly - if we discount your implication that my input is somehow invalidated by my removal of the prod tag), but the nomination is valid based on your doubts of <i>notability</i>, not WP:PAPER. You misused the policy, we called you on it, and there's no need for you to try to save face by acting like you meant something else. Everyone makes mistakes. At this point, it would be best just to admit your mistake and let it go.

<p>Reason - Article exists solely to disambiguate Les Balsiger, a non-notable university administrator at a Catholic university, from <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Balsiger_65cd.html" title="Les Balsiger">Les Balsiger</a>, a notable anti-Catholic activist. The article on Les Balsiger, the university administrator was deleted per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Les_Balsiger_6e50.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Les Balsiger">this AFD discussion</a>.</p>
<p>Per discussion on <a href="../../../l/e/s/Talk%7ELes_Balsiger_%28activist%29_2fe0.html" title="Talk:Les Balsiger (activist)">Talk:Les Balsiger (activist)</a>, Les Balsiger, the university administrator, objects to the possibility of people confusing him with Les Balsiger, the anti-Catholic activist.</p>
<p>I understand and sympathize with Les Balsiger, the administrator, but there really is little that we can do with the fact that people have the same name as other people. What if someone came along and objected to be confused with Charles Manson or another mass murderer or serial killer? Would we create disambig pages for them? Taken to an extreme, every biographical article would have to go through a disambig page. There might be people named George Bush who don't want to be confused with President George Bush or Prime Minister Tony Blair. And so on and so on.</p>

<li><b>Turn it into a redirect</b>. I'm not sure what the big fuss is all about. As a general rule, a disambiguation page that points to only one article should either be changed to a redirect, or else deleted under CSD G6. You can make that call; it does not require an AFD discussion. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 18:42, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

The "right" move, IMHO, would be to delete <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Balsiger_65cd.html" title="Les Balsiger">Les Balsiger</a> and move <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Balsiger_%28activist%29_ad6b.html" title="Les Balsiger (activist)">Les Balsiger (activist)</a> back to <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Balsiger_65cd.html" title="Les Balsiger">Les Balsiger</a> where it used to be.</dd>
<dd>The reason that this does not qualify as a G6 speedy delete is that the deletion would certainly be controversial since at least one user (BradPatrick) would probably object. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 18:52, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i><b>Object.</b></i> I do object. In my view, the distinction between someone of such notability as the President, Manson, etc., and this situation is one of proportion. Wikipedia gives no information at all to differentiate between two people with a fairly rare name, and near zero notability in the first place, except here, one is an anti-Catholic activist and the other is a guy who desperately wishes not to be confused with him, given his profession and beliefs. And, despite the "tough" attitude I see above, we should be humane in dealing with people who are being hurt by the project. There is insufficient data to distinguish the subject of the article as no other Les Balsiger. There exists a likelihood of confusion that is completely impossible for Bush, Blair, etc. Oh, yeah, and he would very much like to sue the Foundation if nothing is done about it. So, leave this page. Please.--<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradPatrick_8f2f.html" title="User:BradPatrick">Brad Patrick</a> 16:55, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Something should be done to distinguish.</b> I would have kept the two pages with a disambig. Now, I would add a note to the <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Balsiger_%28activist%29_ad6b.html" title="Les Balsiger (activist)">Les Balsiger (activist)</a> page that mentions the administrator. Particularly since "Les Balsiger" is not an exclusive trademark of either of them, &amp; the administrator is willing to harass us over it. Sometimes, whether we like it or not, the reporter can't help becoming part of the story. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVentifax_9bbd.html" title="User:Ventifax">Ventifax</a> 23:09, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Falls short of what, your subjective idea of what we can include? Inclusion isn't about what we like and don't like, or at least, we're trying to get away from that.

<li>The references fall short on establishing the notability criteria. The cited articles are reviews; they're not <i>substantial</i>. They're about the use of the product, and touch on the way a consumer perceives its design. They're not about its design, its history, its innovations, or any of the things that would make usable references for an interesting article. Some of the references have dubious editorial integrity, written by amateur journalists, using dubious testing methods and having little experience in the field. The review sites are hardly independent; they almost always receive sample goods from the manufacturer or from vendors in exchange for advertising or editorial promotion. Meanwhile, please refrain from personalizing the issue; this isn't about what I like and don't like. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 00:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>This is an extreme interpretation of WP:N, and not really shared by a lot of people. I personally would not have us only write about a piece of hardware when the New York Times profiles it, and frankly I'd care more about what Anandtech has to say since they specialize in this kind of stuff. You say the sources aren't enough, I say they are. Anyway that's all I feel like saying on this issue... I find your comments and edit summaries to be more frustration than I want to deal with at this point. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 01:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not clear that <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> has actually read the sources. The article at Anandtech most certainly does cover the design, history, and innovations of the new mouse in exhaustive detail. The consumer perception and editorializing is reserved for the last few hundred words. He is also apparently not familiar with Anandtech, an extremely well-regarded review site. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 03:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm very familiar with Anandtech -- enough to know that it's not universally well-regarded. There's no link to an Anandtech review of the VX in this AfD, or in the article in question. I can't find one; they review the MX, mentioning that the VX will be reviewed some time in the "near future", but I don't find such a review when searching their site. (As such, I baffled at how my familiarity with a site that is involved neither in this AfD nor in the article it discusses is relevant.) The MX review<a href="http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=2843&amp;p=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=2843&amp;p=1" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> includes what the reviewer thought of the design of the mouse, but that's editorial opinion, really. (Which is yet another reason why reviews aren't good primary sources.) What I'm thinking about are references about the design from the design team itself. Truly notable products will result in interest in the process that created them. The design team might write books, do a "making of" documentary, or be interviewed in magazines. That kind of material provides an authorotative reference about the design and development of the product. What Anandtech has written (again, for the MX, since I don't see the VX article) is about their observations of the physical product, and is quite shallow. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 17:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It meets notability requirements - at least in German-speaking regions. We can not expect that everything <i>Spiegel</i> article will be translated into English. The site has tried sprading outside of the German-speaking region, and is doing so, albeit slowly. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamwaltz_5483.html" title="User:Samwaltz">samwaltz</a> 17:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Another Comment</b>. As I've stated, I agree that this site may be notable, but the article doesn't support that well and needs to be massively expanded/fundamentally rewritten. If there are no english language sources, then so be it. But if this article is to remain, there need to be people willing to put some work into it to improve it. It has been sitting around as a stub that looks more like an advertisement/brochure than anything else for a year. Simply being notable is not enough. The article needs to properly assert this notability and provide encyclopedic content. -<b><a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/q/u/User_talk%7ECquan_6cf6.html" title="User talk:Cquan">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_Desk_4424.html" title="User:Cquan/Desk">AMA Desk</a>) 18:05, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Brian Masterson" AND Henry AND Stanley likewise comes up empty, although he's supposed to have taken the most regocnized portrait of the explorer;</li>
<li>"Robert Ishmael Masters" results in 0 Ghits;</li>
<li>No record of a Bolshevik War Memorial in Sebastopol;</li>

<p>A lot of your comments are definitely valid. Yes, this is my only edit/created page. You could also say that this is my FIRST edited or created page. Everybody has to start somewhere. As to Why I started here, well, you will notice that I have the same name as his mother. Coincidence? No, because I am a relation. A relation who is working on my thesis about Brian Masterson. So, excuse me if I have highlighted a person who I have an affinity to - I didn't know that wasn't allowed.</p>
<p>As for sources/links/documents etc - again very true, I haven't provided any. Even the photo that I have (or rather, the scan of the photo that I have) hasn't been included. Apologies again, but I was only going to update this as and when I had the time. I don't seriously believe that this article will be the most searched on Wikipedia. And yes, some of it is informed speculation - I can't prove that he is the same Marconi radio operator, but I made that quite clear in the article. I've left it up to the reader to make the final decision.</p>
<p>If I put my hand on my heart I will admit that he was a minor character, and that no doubt his work doesn't rank up there with the great early photographers. But that doesn't mean that it's okay to blank him. Why not include him? He may not have done the greatest of deeds, but he led a far more interesting life than mine and was close to great things.</p>
<p>And may I just say one final thing - we mightn't all be high and mighty Wikipedia editors, but maybe some of the critique-ing of this document should be done with somewhat less of a sneer. Thanks.</p>

<p>I think this article does not belong on Wikipedia. The article just talks about what the article name is, and does not talk about much else, so it should be considered a neologism.

<li>Actually, it is relevent. Homer Simpson has had a LOT more jobs than Peter Griffin, which is why it is too long for main article. Peter Griffin has only had a few, most of which were one-off jokes as opposed to being major plot points, which many (not all) of Homer's jobs have been. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 01:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, that doesn't matter at all, not even one little itty bit. Doesn't matter in the slightest how many jobs each of them has had or how many they've had in comparison to each other or whether Peter's jobs are one-off jokes or more important to the plot.

<li><b>Keep</b> As fashionable as it is to poo-poo <i>Family Guy</i> continuity, the fact is that the job Peter had for most of the first three seasons, and his lack of job stability in the post-cancellation seasons is an important and notable aspect to scholarly critique of the show, with implications and commentary on shifting American labor relations in real life. The "indiscriminate information" argument only barely begins to apply to the one section on "jobs in throwaway gags"; the other sections are on "long term jobs held" and "jobs held for a significant portion of a single episode." <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnton_Mravcek_8ffd.html" title="User:Anton Mravcek">Anton Mravcek</a> 17:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The anti-<i>Family Guy</i> conspiracy lobby hopes to win deletion debates at this level so then they can go after the articles on Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg, Stewie and Brian. If they get those deleted, they will next gun for the article on <i>Family Guy</i>. But it's a mathematical certainty that they wouldn't be able to get the article on Peter deleted. They would then have to settle for the next best thing, which is aggressive pruning. I do recognize the need to occasionally prune the article about Peter. The infobox could get very long in the "occupation" field, the main body also can get unwieldy when people add jobs that he only had for one episode, or worse, a throwaway gag not entered into continuity. If I remove it from the Peter article to move it to this list article (which btw is nicely paragraphy for the continuity-relevant jobs and not all "indiscriminate info") then I achieve the pruning without looking like a deletionist meanie bastard. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromulent_Kwyjibo_1af7.html" title="User:Cromulent Kwyjibo">Cromulent Kwyjibo</a> 22:13, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I say you should give sometime, maybe in a couple of months if it still has no new info...delete it. But do not just delete it because it has little to no info. In fact if it weren't for this article I wouldn't have even known about the place. I think you should give this article sometime. Some of these articles probably started out like this.</p>

Well I agree some what but I never said the person who made was going to come back. If you feel though that it is a bad thing then you go ahead and think that. But I believe that this should not be deleted....probably already has been....this article if completed could be a good thing. I am not a good editor so it would not be wise for me to do any of the editing. But I think that if other editors were to find out about this they would contribute to it. Give it time, why not remove the delete proposal and wait. If in a few months nothing happens...I will eat my words and propose the deletion myself.</p>

<p>The article is about a neologism and thus should not be included in Wikipedia. Please read <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. The article <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manscaping.html" title="Manscaping">Manscaping</a> is definitely a neologism, and admits to being so when it states in "Manscaping is a neologism that was brought into American homes in the early 2000's..." The article does not cite its sources, and merely attempts to "track the emergence and use of the term". <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 21:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 21:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately you did not address the main problem, which is: "The article is about a neologism". Do not you accept "Manscaping" is a neologism?

<dd>To respond to the links you provide, the first states "This new word 'manscaping' appears to date from Hollywood, 2006." Further proving the term is a neologism. The third USA Today link says "Or 'manscaping,' as Queer Eye for the Straight Guy's Fab Five call it." Which is more evidence of it being a neologism. There may be many news stories that use the term manscaping, but that does not mean there should be an article on it. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 00:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</dd>

<dd>I have read <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> thanks, I don't need to be condescendingly told to. As for your specific objections, I can only assume that while you were busy re-reading <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> you failed to actually read the articles themselves, which are, in order, about: 1) the international emergence of manscaping as a trend called "manscaping," along with a reference to an additional source; 2) the results of a search for the best manscaping in New York City; 3) the lowering of resistance to manscaping and other forms of hair removal among men; and 4) the health risks associated with manscaping. Here's another source from <a href="http://www.meghandaum.com/latimes_column/2006/040806_surveying_manscape.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.meghandaum.com/latimes_column/2006/040806_surveying_manscape.htm" rel="nofollow">Los Angeles</a>, possible the additional source mentioned in the Australia article.

Just because a word is new does not mean that it automatically runs afoul of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and the sources exist to support this article.

<dd>Unfortunately the so-called revised article did not have "sources and everything". In fact some of the new material that user Otto4711 added is OR.

<dd>Thank <i>god</i> you called attention to the so-called fact that there was an unsourced sentence! Good thing you just took it out instead of either asking for a so-called source or taking four seconds to find a source through so-called google yourself. Added back with source.

<li><b>Comment</b> From the first lines paragraph of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>: <i>All topics should meet a minimum threshold of notability for an article on that topic to be included in Wikipedia. Notable is defined as "worthy of being noted" or "attracting notice"; it is not synonymous with "fame" or "importance".</i>, there is no doubt that the party lacks fame or even widely known except for the very political interested and active people. Yet, it is <b>worthy of being noted</b> because it is an official party that did participate in the election of 2006. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordmetroid_b969.html" title="User:Lordmetroid">Lord Metroid</a> 14:38, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There seems to be enough information to write an article. I do not see how WP can fairly decide on the significance of political parties-- anymore than it can on religions an nationalist movements. The only practice free of POV is to give an article for any such organization possessing a verifiable identity and some source of information. It can generally be presumed that arguments about the N of the subject are o some extent arguments about the politics (or religion or whatever involved. We can't arbitrate that sort of question.The threshold in these cases has to be low. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:38, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, you're wrong. Including <i>every single movement or organisation</i> that claims to have an opinion, verifiable identity and some source of information, would require us to include every single political splinter group and joke party ever. That's crap. The "general notability criterion" of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> (as people apparently haven't read it themselves I must cite it) reads <i>"A notable topic has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works that are reliable and independent of the subject"</i> and is perfectly applicable to any organisation, political, religious, philosophical or whatever. It has nothing to do with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> again. Perhaps you're thinking of <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>, though that is hardly applicable to this case either. In the very unlikely case either of you (LordMetroid or DGG) would contest that the Libertarian Party does not meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, one might continue to <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> - yes, LordMetroid attempted to reference three sites; but in this case the own website is a self-published source (published by the subject of the article and as thus <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and POV), youtube is a self-published source (anyone can upload a video to <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>...) and val.se just lists election results and would hardly be used to legitimate an article on VIKINGAPARTIET-VALVARUHUSET 53 PARTIER.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't help to notice the lack of strong arguments for deletion. It is a small party yes, however it's a serious organisation and is the only party for that specific ideologi in Sweden. It is most noteworthy information for someone interested the libertarian movment around the world. Also I can't help to notice that the person arguing for deletion is himself/herself an anarchist who; I quote "contribute to a wide variety of articles, although primarily on articles related to the Swedish left". So it's not that surprising that he/she wants to delete an article about the Swedish right. Xincon 23:46, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article has no secondary sources, therefore the subject is not notable and therefore doesn't belong on Wikipedia. It doesn't matter whether its a serious organisation or interesting to libertarians. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 00:01, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although I was expecting LordMetroid to make that point, I was just waiting for it. Your argument is a logical fallacy: that I am anarchist that contributes to left-wing articles does not mean I am a left-wing anarchist. You have no idea whether I am from the socialist camp of anarchism, or from the capitalist. In any case that is just a userbox, compared to an image covering 1/4 of the userpage at first glance. Another point I however would like to raise is that Xincon has made exactly ONE edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Libertarian_Party_%28Sweden%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119845133" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Libertarian_Party_%28Sweden%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119845133" rel="nofollow">when he wrote the above</a>.<br />
But, leaving the editors and focusing on the article, that it is a serious organisation does not merit it's inclusion in Wikipedia. There is no article on Alternativa politikerveckan, although it's got press coverage in several nation-wide media several years in a row. As an encyclopedia, it is our duty to filter out information that is encyclopedic and noteworthy - because we care about the reader, we choose to leave parties that gain ~200 votes and never got any media attention out. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn"><font color="#FF8000">Jobjörn</font></a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 00:12, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"You have no idea whether I am from the socialist camp of anarchism, or from the capitalist." I quote from your userpage; "Furthermore. I am an anarchist. The primary reason behind me being a drug-free anarchist is not that I have the right to do what the fuck I want to and I want to stay clean, but rather that I believe drugs - including alcohol - are merely a capitalist method of passivisation. You are not participating in the struggle if you are home beating wife and kids. You are not participating in the struggle if you are lying on a sidewalk, puking after a night of heavy partying. You are not participating in the struggle if you are watching soccer and having a beer with your friends. It pacifies you. It turns you into a drone, a working drone - slave of the capital." Oh, I'm sorry. That was rude of me. No, I really don't have any idea at all if you are a left- or rightside anarchist. None. Really, it's a mystery. Xincon 17:32, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then again, that was in one of my talkpage archives, wasn't it? And you didn't read that until I pointed out the logical fallacy, did you? So, either you are some sort of wiki-stalker (reading my archives just because you're meeting me in an AfD discussion), or you made the claims first and checked the facts later. Either way, let's focus on the (perceived?) lack of notability instead, shall we? <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn"><font color="#FF8000">Jobjörn</font></a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 17:44, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I did read that before I made my first edit, otherwise my statement would be quite bold, but the reason I didn't include it is that I never thought you would deny something so easy to check. And I do belive that you still lead the stalker-league with your Alkanen-welcome. Xincon 19:59, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Haha! Good point there. But that was not out of stalking. Most Swedish bloggers are well aware of Wikipedia, and it would be foolish to assume that a founder of a new party wouldn't have a look at the Wikipedia article at least sometimes. If I started a party, I'd defend it in AfDs too. <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> is perfectly natural.

<li>Hi. Nice of you to think of me =) I hope you understood that my comment wasn't meant to imply that their page should be deleted, not matter how stupid I think that party is (and I do think it's stupid). Naturally Swedish media was all over their party, they had a pseudo celebrity bimbo as their party leader. Do you really think that such a thing is more noteworthy and a party with a completely unique – for Sweden that is – political platform? Will it help if I find the two news paper articles about our party? I don't know if there are any online versions of them (but I think there's a pdf of at least one), but I believe I have paper copies somewhere. /<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkanen_b790.html" title="User:Alkanen">Daniel Lindsäth</a> 16:01, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Don't assume that changing my mind is your goal here - I am not Wikipedia policy. However, I would consider the party notable according to Wikipedia guidelines and policies if you could cite two <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that deal with the party. While I <i>personally</i> would consider the Libertarian Party way more important and notable than the Unique Party, the views of individual editors are of no importance - we look to the world to see what it says. And the world, that is the media, whether one likes it or not.

But it is the massmedia who makes them famous and they will not write anything until the party is famous and even if and when a party is famous but not a a sitting parlimamentary party the media discriminate relentlessly. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordmetroid_b969.html" title="User:Lordmetroid">Lord Metroid</a> 20:38, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Those parties are quite special, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unique_Party_fac5.html" title="Unique Party">Unique Party</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junilistan.html" title="Junilistan">Junilistan</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist_Initiative_%28Sweden%29_a935.html" title="Feminist Initiative (Sweden)">Feminist Initiative (Sweden)</a> all have front figures celebrities, the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_Care_Party_e0be.html" title="Health Care Party">Health Care Party</a> have existed for a very long time and like the <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate_Party_b101.html" title="Pirate Party">Pirate Party</a> had the event of civil catastrophies behind their ideologies. The Health Care Party had the closing of hospitals in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norrland.html" title="Norrland">Norrland</a> which is somewhat catastrophic for the population up in Norrland and hence became popular and the Pirate Party had <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pirate_Bay_cefb.html" title="The Pirate Bay">The Pirate Bay</a> raid event which gave the Pirate Party an event of juridical catastrophy to associate their issue with and hence rode the wave on that. This party is against the society of Sweden in general from bottom to top and hence have a hard time becomming famous because the concept of libertarianism is so unkown almost no one Swede even grasps the possibility of such an ideology's existence. I sure didn't understand it before I thurally studied American history. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordmetroid_b969.html" title="User:Lordmetroid">Lord Metroid</a> 21:55, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps. What you are saying that circumstances beyond the control of these parties made them notable - which is true, and there is no problem with it. You are further saying that the party isn't notable in Sweden because noone grasps the concept - perhaps also true. In any case it isn't notable, and it isn't notable on an international scale either - it's really really REALLY small! Perhaps you (are you also a member of the party by the way?) should consider notifying some American scholar of your existence and perhaps s/he will write about "Libertarianism in Sweden" mentioning you. That would be one hell of a third party reliable source. Try it out. As of now, though, noone has written about the party and as thus it does not meet Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn"><font color="#FF8000">Jobjörn</font></a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 22:22, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>So you seriously believe that being ignored by the media is the same as not being notable? Curious idea... Anyways, regarding contacting american scholars and similar, we were mentioned on a Free Talk Live episode (viz. <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/ftl/FTL2006-05-11.mp3" class="external text" title="http://media.libsyn.com/media/ftl/FTL2006-05-11.mp3" rel="nofollow">2006-05-11</a>).

<li>On their website, they state that "Ma`avak Sotsyalisti is an organization of workers, unemployed, students, youth and pensioners. . . Ma`avak Sotsyalisti is part of the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI)", and in the leaflets and press statements on the site they regularly refer to themselves as Maavak Sozialisti, in a variety of transliterations. So this <b>IS</b> "the name provided by the organisation", and by which they usually refer to themselves. So it is clearly the name we should use. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 17:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Their logo in the upper left of all of their pages reads "Socialist Struggle", the same logo on the He version reads מאבק סוציאליסטי and in Ar اشتراكي.

<li>Well we now have the Walla source as well as the Haarezt interview. So this does qualify as multiple sources. And we can find more (for instance they were on Israeli TV news in February).

Following your link, there are 59. Most of these are probably not accepted as reliable sources -- their own website, various blogs, Hebrew Wikipedia (which has no other sources). There is a polemic between a supporter and an opponent of the group at the Israeli left discussion board HaGad HaSmalit (The Left Bank)<a href="http://www.hagada.org.il/hagada/html/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1302" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hagada.org.il/hagada/html/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1302" rel="nofollow">[89]</a>; but I don't really want to translate this. The group is also discussed briefly, alongside <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balad.html" title="Balad">Balad</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadash.html" title="Hadash">Hadash</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meretz.html" title="Meretz">Meretz</a> and others in the same site's listing of left parties in Israel <a href="http://www.hagada.org.il/hagada/html/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Web_Links&amp;file=index&amp;l_op=viewlink&amp;cid=21" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hagada.org.il/hagada/html/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Web_Links&amp;file=index&amp;l_op=viewlink&amp;cid=21" rel="nofollow">[90]</a>. MSN News mentions that they work together with Hadash, the Women's Coalition and others in the new Progressive Socialist Unity group within the Labour Party. <a href="http://business.msn.co.il/news/StatePoliticalMilitary/Political/200605/20060508212800.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://business.msn.co.il/news/StatePoliticalMilitary/Political/200605/20060508212800.htm" rel="nofollow">[91]</a> This seems a bit confused, since Hadash is obviously not inside the Labour Party; but that's what the site says. There is more about the PSU group on the Labour Party website at <a href="http://news.havoda.co.il/Front/NewsNet/reports.asp?reportId=156336" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.havoda.co.il/Front/NewsNet/reports.asp?reportId=156336" rel="nofollow">[92]</a>. This does not mention Maavak Sozialisti, though since they are probably operating as entrists within the party that is not really surprising. Most of the other references are listings, or contributions in the name of Maavak Sozialisti to online discussions and forums. There is also an article in Arabic on the site of the Eqraa Association <a href="http://www.eqraa.com/html/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=452" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eqraa.com/html/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=452" rel="nofollow">[93]</a>; you will have to read that and assess it for yourself.</dd>
<dd>Although not a huge amount of material, it seems to me enough to establish that the group exists, is active, and is known in Israel.

<dd>The University campus is at Mount Scopus; usual transcription into English Har Ha-Tzofim.

<li><b>Keep</b> There seems to be enough information to write an article. In addition to the ones listed, the illustration refers to an Israeli television broadcast, and it should be possible to give a more specific reference. If it is the subject of part of a national TV broadcast and also an unrelated newspaper, it meets the technical requirements I do not see how WP can fairly decide on the significance of political parties-- anymore than it can on religions an nationalist movements. The only practice free of POV is to give an article for any such organization possessing a verifiable identity and some source of information. It can generally be presumed that arguments about the N of the subject are o some extent arguments about the politics (or religion or whatever involved. We can't arbitrate that sort of question. if it meets the technical requirements for sourcing, that is sufficient. The number of ghits is irrelevant for these situations. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:35, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It depends on how many people take the line. If there are over a million trips per year on the line that would make it important to quite a few people. The article could be easily expanded to include a list of notable attractions along the route, with corresponding links back to No. 51 Line. One could therefore become a vitual passenger tourist.
