<li>Yes, television shows are legitimate sources. However, the <i>article</i> has no sources. Sources definitely exist, but they need to be cited in the article (see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.) Unfortunately an article requires multiple, non-trivial, reliable third-party sources to achieve notability. Star Trek episodes, books, and officially licensed products fail the "third-party" requirement. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 20:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Notability is not subjective. We have <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">objective criteria for notability</a> here, which this article does not meet. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 05:06, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree with your statement, notability is often very subjective (mostly because the criteria is so often variable, almost any elected politician will get an article, but are they truly notable? I doubt it). Butyour claim is meaningless anyway, as it's pretty clear Star Trek is notable. Nobody is going to argue that. This is an aspect of Star Trek. As such, some coverage of it is appropriate, even if it's just to say "The Agonizer is a pain-causing punishment device found in the following episodes/Novels/whatever of Star Trek". Not covering it would be silly. Wikipedia is not paper, this article is not silly, it's sourceable, and it doesn't violate NPOV. So while i can accept merging it, deleting it is just the wrong idea. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:14, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">notability is <i>not</i> subjective.</a> This is <b>consensus</b> on Wikipedia. Please familiarize yourself with the criteria for notability before you make cases for or against it. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 21:15, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am aware there are people on Wikipedia with that opinion. I believe they are mistaken, because nobody has an objective criteria for notability, believe it or not, it is ultimately based on subjective observation that "enough" other sources have covered the subject. And just throwing links to various pages around doesn't make your argument for you, not when those pages themselves lack substantive and convincing arguments to justify their position. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is just a guideline, nothing more. If you wish to persuade me, try offering arguments related to the subject at hand, not throwing page links around. This is supposed to be about the <b>Agonizer</b> isn't it? As something in Star Trek, which regardless of your opinion as to whether notability is subjective or not, is notable, it therefore becomes a question of how best to cover the subject. It's a discrete and independent device, and appears in more than one episode...but those episodes cover the same subject, which has its own article, so why not merge it there? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not trying to persuade you of anything. I'm trying to help you out, because (and I apologize if I'm wrong!) it doesn't seem like you have a clear understanding of what <a href="../../../p/g/_/WP%7EPG_70f0.html" title="WP:PG">guidelines on Wikipedia are</a>, nor do you seem to have an understanding of what <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">the idea of consensus on Wikipedia</a> is. In a nutshell: guidelines are to be followed unless there's a very good reason <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">not to</a>. I'm "throwing page links around" because I'm trying to refer you back to where I derive the reasoning for my arguments, and to illustrate that I derive them from guidelines and policies agreed on by Wikipedia consensus. I apologize if I've come across as harsh; I'm simply trying to be helpful. Remember: <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco_Bell_fcda.html" title="Taco Bell">Taco Bell</a> is notable, but not every item on the Taco Bell menu is notable. <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time (magazine)</a> is notable, but not every issue they've printed is notable. And, yes, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> is notable, but not every device, ship, and minor character that's appeared is notable. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 20:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And you seem to have no idea what I'm saying, or how you're coming across. I'm trying not to be offensive here, but you have not been persuasive, your methods are ineffective, and it's not going to change my mind or help me in any way. Sorry, but the net benefit to me is nil or less. Honestly, I'd rather you stuck to discussing the subject at hand, rather than addressing this other problem. And to try to get back to that, look at it this way, is there any question that it's appropriate to have an article on the episodes of the Trek series this device appears in? Describing those episodes without mentioning this device would be silly, don't you think? It's one thing to not mention every person in a group scene, but this device provided significant importance. Not mentioning it would leave a major hole in explaining how the Mirror universe was different from the "real" universe. Now does this mean an article on it? Maybe not, but a redirect is cheap. However, we have the problem that it's in more than one episode...of different series in the same universe. So that may lead to a different decision. It's not quite right for an article on Devices in Star Trek, but luckily in this case, with several episodes of Trek series (and a few books), there's enough content that the whole Alternate universe warrants an article. Thus <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agonizer.html" title="Agonizer">Agonizer</a> can be properly described and redirected there. If that's not satisfactory to you, please offer an explanation as to why. And no, an argument about how not every item on Taco Bell's menu should have an article will not serve. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:57, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
