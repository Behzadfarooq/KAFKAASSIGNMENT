<li><s><b>Speedy keep</b> This nom is in bad faith</s> <b>Comment</b> There has been over a year's worth of work done to keep this article NPOV. The points you argue have already been gone through in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChildlove_movement_Deletion_debate_archive_b564.html" title="Talk:Childlove movement/Deletion debate archive">the previous AfD</a> and you haven't brought up anything new. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 19:44, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You may disagree with the nomination but the accusation of "bad faith" is hot air. As for the previous nomination, I was unaware of it as there is no note about it at the top of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChildlove_movement_f78e.html" title="Talk:Childlove movement">Talk:Childlove movement</a> page as is required (why is the old page not in the AFD archives?). Homey 19:51, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, there is. I retract that it's in bad faith, since you didn't see it, but seriously-- what would you do with this article, merge it into <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a>? You might as well merge... well I won't stir up anything by drawing comparisons, but they are both very long articles and a merge would shorten both considerably. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 19:56, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>No there isn't. Look at Talk:Star Trek and pedophilia to see what the required tag looks like. It's clearly not at the top of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChildlove_movement_f78e.html" title="Talk:Childlove movement">Talk:Childlove movement</a>. Homey 19:58, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That thingy is a template to make it easier to see old AfD discussions, but back in the old days we didn't use templates for any old thing.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Okay, now that that's settled, I'm going to vote <b>keep</b>. The biggest problem with the article is the name, which I agree is a distasteful euphemism, but it's used by many pedophiles to refer to themselves, and it was already decided that the name should stay. Any other perceived problems can be cleaned up. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 20:15, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"it was already decided that the name should stay". Decisions can be revisited and reversed. That we "already" decided it doesn't strike me as sufficient grounds to keep the name if not the article. Homey 20:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Feel free to revisit the page's name on the talk page... but you're taking this to AfD instead, right? Generally the only reason to exclude something from Wikipedia is lack of verifiability or notability, so let's get cracking on those. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 21:24, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree, but this is not a normal "euphemism." It has established usage, and, at any rate, we are not describing this alleged euphemism, but what it refers to -- activism for the acceptance of pedophilia and ephebophilia, a very real and notable phenomenon. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 21:12, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "childlove movement" is not simply advocacy of pedophilia. The title <i>childlove movement</i> is inclusive and accurate, as that is what they refer to themselves as. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 21:17, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> What a ridiculous proposition. "Childlove" was not coined by Ashford, it is derivative of <i>boylove</i> and <i>girllove</i>, more specific terms designating a type of pedophilic or ephebophilic attraction. Even if you don't want to believe it, or the thought of pedophilia makes you squirm, that is not relevant here, so I would ask anyone to consider the notability of this subject carefully before kneejerking with delete. To say that this was "largely written by Ashford" is false in itself; it's been edited extensively to keep POV out since its last kneejerk nomination, which, as is apparent, resulted in a <i>keep</i>. Merging this with pedophilia is not a good idea, as the childlove movement is not at all completely composed of pedophiles, but also ephebophiles, and as jd420 tells me at least, normophilic people as well. The "childlove movement" article is already long enough. Moving on... if you're the type of person who judges notability by a quick tap into Google, please note that "childlove" is a rarely used term. "Boylove" and "girllove" are used much more often, so as to segregate the sexual attractions. <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=girllove+-encyclopedia+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=girllove+-encyclopedia+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">"Girllove" gets 18,700 hits</a>, if we exclude all pages containing the keywords "wikipedia" and "encyclopedia." "Boylove," seemingly more popular, receives 332,000 hits. These are only pages Google has spidered. There are thousands of websites dedicated to this crusade, several organizations (everyone's heard of NAMBLA or MARTIJN at least). The movement <i>is</i> notable: it has thousands of members, usually well-masked behind a shield of anonymity. Activism happens, whether the public likes it or not; ranging from <a href="http://www.glgarden.org/ppp/" class="external text" title="http://www.glgarden.org/ppp/" rel="nofollow">promoting what they see as the correct use of the word "pedophile,"</a> to <a href="http://216.220.97.17/" class="external text" title="http://216.220.97.17/" rel="nofollow">advocating the abolishment of age of consent laws</a>. To say that "childlove" is a euphemism is POV itself. It is a term invented by the movement to describe themselves (in fact, it's basically just using the root Greek meaning of "pedophilia"). We have articles on organizations within the movement itself. I find it almost obscene that someone would propose deleting this article and not <a href="../../../n/a/m/NAMBLA_7d55.html" title="NAMBLA">NAMBLA</a>. The FBI has even acknowledged the existence of a large movement working to "legalize child molestion" in a newspeice on Ashford I seen recently. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 21:05, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, by definition, the term <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephebophile.html" title="Ephebophile">ephebophile</a> (attraction to post-pubescent youth) excludes those we commonly refer to as "children" (ie pre-pubescents) so I don't accept your claim that "childlove" is not a synonym for pedophilia and that therefore "childlove movement" is not a euphemism for "pedophilia advocacy" as we don't generally refer to teenagers as "children". The primary definition of child is a prepubescent human hence ephebophiles are not attracted to children and the term "childlove" does not accurately describe their feelings or behaviour. I don't deny that there are those who wish to legalise pedophilia. My problem is in using a POV term to describe that movement. Homey 21:44, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - there's far too much good content here to simply trash all of it because of a few paragraphs or sections people don't like.

<li>The title is inherently POV (per Homey's comment below). The opening sentence is POV (you confuse claims with facts). Also, this is clearly a POV fork. It's a way you can put in stuff, that might not get as much attention elsewhere. This whole article is written with the basic, and false, assumption the groups seeks what it claims to seek. That of course is rubbish. I would also vote to delete an equally POV title Childhurter movement, even though it would be more accurate in its description than the current title. Be happy Wikipedia (unlike 99% of society) will let you freely and fully particpate and contribute to articles in an NPOV manner, but don't think for a second you'll be allowed your own little POV fork to promote a movement. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 21:49, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

If the name is wrong, now's your chance to get consensus to move it to <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia_advocacy.html" title="Pedophilia advocacy">Pedophilia advocacy</a>. But you can't delete something from Wikipedia and make it go away. If that were true I would nominate <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist_terrorism.html" title="Islamist terrorism">Islamist terrorism</a> for deletion, or merge it into <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a>, because its activist claims are questionable. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 22:05, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>A rename doesn't change the fact it's a POV fork. Many other POV forks have been made for various causes, but removed. <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> is the one NPOV word (as it's advocates and opponents use the same word). We don't have a pro-topicX and anti-topicX article. We have a topicX article. By forcing everybody to edit the TopicX, we ensure people from all sides will work together, counter-acting any one groups bias. The purpose of this article, is to advocate a particular cause. It will never do anything beyond that. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 22:53, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand you're saying that "boylove"/"girllove" is a useless excercise in euphemisms. Assuming that to be so, I think the fact that pedophiles campaign for political issues is a notable thing which deserves an article, and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> is very long-- the whole thing won't fit. The "childlove movement" (especially NAMBLA) has a long history tangled up with the gay rights movement etc. There needs to be a general article to describe this, so take this one, NPOV it, and move it to your favourite title. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 23:10, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There <i>is</i> press coverage on the childlove movement; it's just not referred to as the childlove movement in their reports because media can apparently not stand to use the word "love" when describing pedophilic or ephebophilic attractions.

<li>the kind of notability/verifiability of at least the name childlove is per wikipedia standards: <i>it is essential that any primary-source material, as well as any generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data has been published by a third-party reputable publication (that is, not self-published) that is available to readers either from a website (other than Wikipedia) or through a public library.</i> So if newspapers have articles but no third party publisher calls the movement what the movement calls itself, then we don't have some verifiable source calling it that, then wikipedia can't call it the childlove movement either, because we can't verify how widespread the term is, or it should be left to publishers of original thought to determine the occurance of the term "childlove" not original research on wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 07:00, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

There is little non-wiki serious usage of the term in the results, with much of it being the usual "scraper sights" (e.g. search for anything and you get something on their sight). This actually proves that Wikipedia itself is the biggest promoter of the term. Now, sadly, others will likely follow. This shows the movement had great success with Wikipedia, as we forget how influential we are. Other people doing similiar "Google tests" will now make similiar judgements, to accept this term. Also, I would note, in your first search "Childlove" by itself, obviously has meaningings unrelated to the perverted one being discussed here. Even combined with other words, I expect there are people who use the term in the more literal non-perverted sense it's been used in the old article name (e.g. as in "childlove" means "child love" not sexual abuse of innocent children by people who are mad that I called it abuse). Finally, in all Google tests, keep in mind shorter simpler words, that are easier to spell, always get bigger results, and that doesn't tell you which is the proper term. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 13:37, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As a patron of the online boylove community for almost ten years now, I had never heard the term "childlove" until Wikipedia renamed its "boylove" article into "Childlove movement" (if I remember correctly). I remember it as a conjured-up term to merge articles on "boylove" and "girllove". I have since noticed "childlove" being used quite often, when wanting to denote the collective boy- and girllove communities (and I've also noted many in the boylove community shunning the term "childlove"). So either I was ignorant of the term before the Wikipedia rename, or Wikipedia itself has contributed significantly to the usage of the term. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayboy_b087.html" title="User:Clayboy">Clayboy</a> 18:13, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am strongly swayed by the Lexis/Nexis result and the fact that no <i>reliable authoritative</i> sources seem to use the term 'childlove movement'.

If there were media coverage or academic discussion on this topic then I'd be saying Keep all the way (and be much less fussed about the name).

<li>You can make that allegation if you can demonstrate that somebody voted to keep an opposing POV fork, while voting to delete this POV fork. However, that's not the case. Also, you fail to address the serious lack of *reliable* verifiable information to back up this article. Also, we actually do try to "silence" any POV soap-box pusher on *any* side. If somebody wishes to push an agenda, they're free to do so elsewhere, but Wikipedia is not the place. You're partly right though. Their views are highly unpopular, and argueable "suppressed". Hence, they're rarely published. However, Wikipedia does not champion the rights of the unpublished. In fact, we're quite hostile to the unpublished. We don't (or shouldn't) write anything about anyone unless it's been published by reliable sources elsewhere. Is that fair? No. But that's the price of verifiability. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:25, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It clearly would amount to more than a stub. There <i>is</i> advocacy, and it's perfectly sourceable. I agree that it should be uniquely about activism, and responses to that activism, and should it survive this AfD, I'm going to work on making it <i>only</i> about that. As I noted on the talkpage, I hope you'll join me in doing so. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 05:50, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The dividing of the articles should be along <b>subject</b> lines, not along lines of POV. "Pedophilia" should be about the medical and scientific ends, with perhaps a mention of any alternate POVs. Childlove...I think "Ped. Advocacy" or something along those lines might work. But I'm not so convinced "Childlove" is so POV as people seem to make it out, or even <i>want</i> it to be. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 16:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think separate articles is a little much, although this article mixes those two issues and several others together rather badly. But I'm unaware of any sources that specifically call for helping people who have medically defined pedophilia in the strictest sense. There are articles proposing possible revisions to how to treat pedophiles in psychology, which is hardly the issue of pedophilia advocacy. I think what you're describing is "Debate over pedophilia treatment" and really there isn't that much of that in the article. Personally, I haven't got the strength. If it is created, I will do my best to read over the peer reviewed journal references and make things as informative as they can be, but it would be better if an article like that was started by someone with the professional expertise to begin with. I mean, it's acceptable to make an article from reliable sources without having the professional expertise, but it's exhausting too. Part of the reason people only read a fourth of most of these journal articles and then make up their own conclusions is because the things are so long. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 14:50, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The mixing of issues and definitions is exactly why I don't want it merged with pedophilia. Pedophilia is a condition identified by a process that is standardized by a group people with fancy degrees while the childlove movement as described is more of a political/social movement.--<a href="../../../g/b/l/User%7EGbleem_11fe.html" title="User:Gbleem">Gbleem</a> 22:48, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep.</b> I will give an example: In democtatic contries one can find Nazi and Communsit parties. The reasons for they existance are many, including the right of <b>political freedom</b> and the fact that these parties are indicators of the general political state in a given country (i.e. if their popularity start going up, it means that the mainstream politicians do something wrong). A similar argument can be put in the present case. First, if there are peple <b>paying attention</b> to the childlove movement, it is an indicator that it has a political basis, regardless how small it can be. Second, if the arguments of the "movement" are weak, then it will be easy for everyone to refute them again and again. -User:Nllsq (moved from talk page. first edit)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It never ceases to amaze me how people want to delete articles simply because the content it distasteful. I had a similar debate at the <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erik_Beckjord_11b0.html" title="Erik Beckjord">Erik Beckjord</a> article deletion; the man is an obnoxious ass, but that's no reason to delete the article. Perhaps it can use a bit of renaming/defining. To try and delete this as if it is not an issue in its own right...that is simply crass and POV to the point of absurdity. Even if it is deleted, it will just reappear, as the subject carries a great deal of importance to some people, no matter what their intentions are. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 16:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
