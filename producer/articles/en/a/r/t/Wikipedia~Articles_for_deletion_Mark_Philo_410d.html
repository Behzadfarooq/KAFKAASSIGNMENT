<p><b>Delete</b>. Post mortem article of a life and death both seemingly unremarkable. Newsmare 18:09, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Looks like this is a keeper then - which is strange as he wasn't important enough to warrant an article when he was alive. Would this have happened if he was an unremarkable scientist who, although he'd graduated and had recently been accepted into a small, unaccomplished team of researchers, died before achieving anything in his field? I doubt it. If he'd written an article on himself while he was alive it would have been vanity, and if it'd have been created after his death because he'd spent a few weeks in a lab and then crashed his car people would have scoffed. If a sportsman does it though, it's fucking legendary - put it down in the annals of time lest we forget that which we didn't think enough of to record at the time. What an absolute crock of shit... still, thanks for voting. Newsmare 21:40, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Why delete something from Wikipedia because it's "unremarkable" or "not notable enough"? There are many articles on professional footballers on the site and it's no worse off because of it. Surely it's good to have as many articles as possible, so long as the articles are factual, which this is. I don't think that there are valid grounds for this article to be deleted. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristophee_1fa5.html" title="User:Christophee">Christophee</a> 20:10, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
