<p>I believe this qualifies as a Completely Idiosyncratic Non-Topic, as referenced in the deletion policy, which stipulates such entries be deleted. Also, I believed that its presence is in violation of the combined spirit of two sections of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "Not a dictionary" and "Not a phone book". Both apply loosely, but the general idea that lists of individually unimportant topics or topics incapable of being the basis for an article do not become keepworthy articles by dint of collecting lots of unacceptable tidbits together. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 04:20, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Weak Delete</s></b> It isn't exactly a "completely idiosyncratic non-topic" but it doesn't add up to an article either. If it were an article about these Enochian angels as well as including this (distressingly lengthy) list, I'd be more in favor of it. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 04:41, 8 September 2005 (UTC) I should explain, if this were presented in a way that would make it more clear that it is a mythology-type entry, it's usefulness would be more obvious. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:23, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I admit that my nomination suggests the cruftiness is the big problem. And that does contribute to my desire to delete this. But what justifies deletion to me more is that the entry doesn't say anything substantial about that cruft. And if by dint of being 400 years old but still getting slipped in here it's notable, doesn't it still need to be deleted because as a list it belongs at Wikisource and not on Wikipedia? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:29, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd like a short explanation of what significance they supposedly held to Dee &amp; Kelley. Were these angels they spoke to? Angels other angels told them about? Did they publish a list like this or was it compiled by others from their work? Also, based on the Enochian article, it looks like this isn't exactly a "list of angels in Enochian" in the sense of the constructed language. That's probably why some folks think this is a dictionary entry. It might be better titled "Enochian Angels." <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:20, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Reserved</b></s>. I remember reading "Enochian Physics" sometime back, it is an intersting attempt to attribute archetypal (<i>sp?</i>) values to "Magick", not unlike <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>'s works on the "harmonisation" of the old Tarot. This list, however, needs checking.

<dd>Aha - my book is "Enochian Physics - The Structure of the Magical Universe" by Gerald J Schueler. He does mention the four hierachs of each Watchtower (Kings) which match the ones given in the list (minor spelling differences apart), but unfortunately doesn't list the angels. If it helps though, we could add: "Each Watchtower is divided into six subhierachies. The hierarch of each of these is called a Senior. Each of the four Watchtowers is also divided into four subquadrants whose hierarchies are called Archangels. These are further divided up into smaller hierarchies whose rulers are called Angels. In this way, the entire universe, visible and invisible, is teeming with beings in varying states of self-consciousness". We could also add the eleven rules of hierachies if that might improve it beyond being a mere list. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_alf_56f1.html" title="User talk:Wiki alf"><font color="green">melmac</font></a></sup> 19:15, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> this list presently reads as absolute nonsense, so if kept it must be provided with context. I'd say you should find a suitable article and merge this in, or if it is really an extended quotation then transwiki it as suggested above.</li>
<li>It looks clear to me that the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">cabal</a> will have none of this, and that voting is useless. First it's <i>crufty</i>; till someone points out that its probably more valuable than Pokemon(TM). Then the <i>title</i> of the article gets criticised; so someone changes it. But then it's the <i>context</i> -- so someone thoughtfully spends hours putting it in context, and still <b>they</b> aren't satisfied. Why don't the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">cabal</a> just own up to the fact that, once one of them has voted against an article, it <b>will</b> be deleted unless the rest of the cabal protest and protect it. --<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockpuppetSamuelson_cde2.html" title="User:SockpuppetSamuelson">SockpuppetSamuelson</a> 12:58, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Possibly. But when the count's taken, you'll find votes discounted for relating to "older versions of the page", which therefore can't be applied to the new version, or (where people repeat a vote, so that it relates to the new version, both get discounted because it's double-voting, and then, of course, there are the votes discounted because "everybody" knows that they're sockpuppets (which is my cue to sneak away silently). --<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockpuppetSamuelson_cde2.html" title="User:SockpuppetSamuelson">SockpuppetSamuelson</a> 07:09, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
