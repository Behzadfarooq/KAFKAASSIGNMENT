<p>The result of the nomination was <b>delete</b>. If we are just vote-coiunting, it's 60% delete (15 delets, 10 keeps). However, a number of those keeps are either 'No, it's not a list!', 'I think it's useful', or 'If you have THESE, this should be kept'. None of which are ever great arguments. Most of the deletes refer to either the article being superceded by categories, or it failing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. both of which are strong arguments (except two votes). Therefore, delete. If anyone would like a copy placed in their userspace, please let me know - I imagine this could be a useful reference for researching the history of the Sci-Fi channel. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/</i><b>/</b><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 13:21, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Really needs Wikification</b> and <b>Keep</b> for the most part. In relation to the very television channel, this would be rather pertinant information concerning the constant evolution of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sci_Fi_Channel_%28United_States%29_da7f.html" title="Sci Fi Channel (United States)">Sci Fi Channel</a>. Although it's definately a list right now, this duly needs to be <b>Wikified</b> in order to examine how SciFi Channel changed over the years, especially since 1998 wherein which much of the "<i>classic</i>" reruns, namely the now defunct second-run programming, seem'd to have disappeared and likewise prompted the start of more original series aside from <i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_Genesis_23cf.html" title="Mission Genesis">Mission Genesis</a></i> and movies produced by SciFi Pictures (however, they are usually rather horrid aside from their unintended[?] humour). <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorWho42_7447.html" title="User:DoctorWho42">DrWho42</a> 03:43, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>But surely that would be something that could be far better accomplished within the main <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sci_Fi_Channel_%28United_States%29_da7f.html" title="Sci Fi Channel (United States)">Sci Fi Channel</a> article instead? I mean, there really isn't even anything to merge, this is just a list. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 04:07, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some of it... But eventually it would overcrowd the rest of the article which is the reason why it was moved separately onto its own being.. Like I did for the marathon programming block called <a href="../../../s/2E/c/S.C.I.F.I._World_2212.html" title="S.C.I.F.I. World">S.C.I.F.I.

<ul>
<li>Well, wouldn't it make more sense to split something off the article when it grows to that point? I mean, is "List of Sci Fi Channel (United States) programs" <i>really</i> the most convenient, sensible and useful thing to split off the main article? I mean, especially considering the name of the article, I just don't see this ever becoming useful... -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 09:43, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think this is a useful guide and many of these films already have begun to be importance. Also, if we delete this we should vote to delete ALL of the above pages as well since it is absolutely NO different.--<a href="../../../r/x/d/User%7ERxdxt_ef39.html" title="User:Rxdxt">rxdxt</a> 21:28, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Those films that have importance rightly have (or can have) their own article. A list showing what has been shown on which channel is unencyclopaedic and I find it hard to see its use. I will be bringing the others forward (unless they have additional merit) in due course. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 21:37, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Categories have a tendancy to get screwed up. This type of list article is found throughout the site. Like others have said, it could be expanded with information, wikified.-<a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant89_f5bf.html" title="User:Giant89">Giant89</a> 22:15, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Information about what network a show is broadcast on is found in the article for each show as it is - the shows are not linked other than by virtue of being broadcast by a particular channel. Lists should really have a decent nexus, not just any particular common characteristic like who has aired them. There will be any number of these lists which repeat-mention popular shows, with only minor variations from list to list as you go from country to country. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 22:42, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Wikify</b>. As others have said above, this has the potential of becoming an important article on the history of Sci-Fi Channel. Even in this form, it is highly informative. It's easy to forget, when turning on Sci-Fi once a week for SG-1 or whatever, how large a role Sci-Fi has played in producing, airing or rerunning science fiction series over the last decade, and how much it has changed over the years. It's also obvious that the list is already too long to fit in the parent article, and categories don't really give the big picture here. To delete this article as listcruft would be shortsighted, a loss and a shame, IMO. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> 07:57, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
