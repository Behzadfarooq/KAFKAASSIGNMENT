<li><b>Comment</b> While it's obviously not a good idea to start messing with pages related to ones you've AfD'd, the nom was probably too kind with the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shannon_Knows_DEC_c8ed.html" title="Shannon Knows DEC">Shannon Knows DEC</a> page, which being simply a collection of links was a candidate for speedy deletion under A3 rather than redirection. This would all be a lot easier if someone could just source this article.

<li><b>Oppose</b>; After the Digital/Compaq merger into HP Terry Shannon actively reported on and tracked the developments in the expanded Hewlett-Packard Company. As an executive for HP I regularly interacted with Mr. Shannon on technology reviews and briefings on new product introductions. Though he was perceived often as a gadfly rather than a traditional, "buttoned up" journalist, his unfiltered commentary was useful in blowing the cobwebs out of big corporations. That was his significant contribution and Mr. Shannon's entry in Wikipedia should continue to exist as a key example of a non-traditional journalist working the IT trade press.<small>— 15.246.143.45 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_15.246.143.45_8bc8.html" title="Special:Contributions/15.246.143.45">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.

<li><b>Oppose</b> As per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, Shannon may not have been Bill Gates, but he was, at the time, a widely read, highly influential journalist and author. Granted, most of his contributions to technology journalism occurred when our over-zealous AfD experts were in diapers -- but his inclusion in Wikipedia is well within the established guidelines for notability. His publications are mostly pre-Web -- but the same could be said of Shakespeare. (Edited later to add): And just to give an idea of the perspective of Lefly, the main instigator of this deletion campaign, take a look at his own articles: numerous paeans to obscure rock bands no one's ever heard of, flop TV shows from 15 years ago, and totally inconsequential arts nonprofits.

To those who are new to the wikipedia deletion process, please be aware that a nomination for deletion is <i>not</i> a call to arms to delete an article but instaed is the beginning of a process intended to improve wikipedia's handling of a page of claims about a subject.
