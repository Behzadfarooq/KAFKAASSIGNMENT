<p><b>What is the point of deleting all these articles? What would that acheive? Absolutely nothing at all.</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b><s>Delete all</s>, Yikes.</b> Okay, I definitely think all this cruft needs to get removed from Wikipedia, I just want to make sure the editors are given fair warning, and I hope the closing admin will be willing to temporarily undelete these articles in order to assist transwiki'ing. Not that I think Gundam wiki is a project I want to help, it's just clear someone spent a lot of time on these. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 18:42, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>While I'm at it, let me point out that none of these articles have sources. However, the amount of specific detail on all of these robots makes me think a specific published source exists, which actually is WORSE: this might be massive copyright infringement. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 18:43, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep, process objection</b>. I've changed my mind. These articles are not sufficiently similar to warrant bundling them together in this group while others get bundled together in a different group. I still don't like all this Gundam cruft, but these small-group AfDs are a bad way to decide the question. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 19:36, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I knew somebody would accuse me of bad process, it was just a matter of time. I followed the precedent of the mass deletion of Polynesian mythology articles to avoid the problems that those faced.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Are you kidding? You collect a hefty bundle of related articles, and then divide the entries from said bundle through no resonably discernable criteria into multiple AfD projects. The thing is, the articles you've split up have no reason being split up, and if even one of these AfDs pulls through, we can readily await your attempting to delete still more material (rather, previously kept material...) while citing your one success as precedent. Would anyone realy be surprised?--KefkaTheClown 05:29, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>comment: as the person who brought those Polynesian myth articles here, I can tell you that it's a bad move. It was a lot of work, and they all had to later be re-submitted individually. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:40, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I strongly oppose Mr. Crawford's attempt at a one-man purge of everything Gundam. The fact that somebody's created their own Wiki for Gundam doesn't mean it shouldn't be on Wikipedia. If anything, that should be taken as <i>more</i> evidence of the notability of Gundam. And let me note, Mangojuice, that you need something more than "there's a lot of detail, I think it might be a copyvio!" before you can make credible accusations. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 18:51, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> At least you should have to wait and see result of other page's nomination. Keep made AfD to several page daily make it very nuisance. And you never put AfD template in any <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>'s or <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>'s machine article, yet them and Gundam are all from sci-fi fictions. Not that I want to see them all got delete, but at least there should be standard.

<li>The "If <i>X</i> is kept, unrelated <i>Y</i> must be kept, too" argument, being a false dichotomy, is not very convincing to me. The fact-free mindreading of "Nominator is singling out <i>X</i>", even less so. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:33, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I don't see any obvious reason why these should be deleted. If I had my way (I'm a deletionist), none of the articles would be around, but as the standards of wikipedia are, they should stay. — <i><a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottesini_7f4b.html" title="User:Bottesini"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkgreen; font-weight:bold">ßottesiηi</span></a></i> <sup><a href="../../../b/o/t/User_talk%7EBottesini_40af.html" title="User talk:Bottesini">Tell me what's up</a></sup> 19:01, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> articles to <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:c:Gundam" class="extiw" title="wikia:c:Gundam">wikia:c:Gundam</a> as it appears from comments above that the articles currently at <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:c:Gundam" class="extiw" title="wikia:c:Gundam">wikia:c:Gundam</a> are not complete (missing pics, etc). I'd also support a <b>Merge</b> to Weapons in Gundam universe if there is a strong interest level in keeping some mention of this in Wikipedia. A link to <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:c:Gundam" class="extiw" title="wikia:c:Gundam">wikia:c:Gundam</a> would be wholly appropriate there. No good, logical reason for keeping separate articles for all these things has been put forth. For the record, this would be my preferred treatment for Star Wars vehicle, weapon, et al articles; Pokemon; and virtually every other fictional world that spawns this level of minutae. Just a note... I cut &amp; paste my response from the earlier nom dealing with Gundam. Since it appears there are multiple noms for this material, solution should be globally consistant for all of these articles.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:26, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> even though there are already there. GFDL issues, they were copy/paste moved. I agree that Brian should probably hold off on more noms though, I don't really want to debate in 50 different places. Also, what is this "transwiki before it gets deleted or we just delete it" nonsense? If you want them gone so bad why don't <i>you</i> transwiki them? Kotepho 19:46, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Wikipedia is, in case you missed it, an encyclopdeia, which is "a comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field". It isn't simply a dictionary wherein one gives quick little definitions and moves on; it's MEANT to go into depth. All these accusations of cruft just seem like a cheap excuse to remove something that the Mr. Crawford here dislikes. If we're using his logic for deletion, then we ought to go and subsidize all movie and video game sequels onto a single page, and smash everything together into homogenous articles, because cruft is cruft, right? --<a href="../../../a/m/u/User%7EAmuroNT1_7f94.html" title="User:AmuroNT1">AmuroNT1</a> 02:21 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: Don't delete. This is part of Gundam SEED's mobile suits that appeared in the tv show. This needs some editing and proofreading.<a href="../../../o/m/i/User%7EOminae_b7ce.html" title="User:Ominae">Ominae</a> 03:27, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If anything, you're being too specific with your delete requests... By that logic, you'd have to delete every Gundam article on Wikipedia, along with most other Anime articles - in fact, there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first. And I'm not in favor of that - I enjoy having the information on this and other series all available in one place. Furthermore, varying amounts of data on the subject (Gundam) are found on the Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, and German Wikipedias shows, in my opinion, that at least the general subject deserves coverage here. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolux_Ex_Machina_fda5.html" title="User:Golux Ex Machina">Golux Ex Machina</a> 04:00, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Str<i>o</i>ng Keep</b> as previously stated, there is no policy on Wikipedia that forbids fancruft present in articles, it would be best not to insist that such a policy exists while linking to undeniable proof that it isn't... Gather up all the related articles that you want to see taken down, and present them as a whole, rather than dividing them up for no reason.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is fancruft not even about a major character. Wikipedia's Minor Character policy stipulates stuff like this is meant to be collected on one page. A Mech is not a character it is a vehicle used by character in an Anime. Please be objective here and read teh wikipedia policies. Tis essentially fancruft. People here argue that you'd have to delete every single anime character. WRONG. Read the policy. This isn't even a minor character.

<li><b>KEEP THEM</b> these articles are used by people, i use them, they dont have any effect on any of the other articles on Wikipedia. to those who want to put them on Gundam Wiki, its to hard to find that area, not to mention that that area is still incomplete and lacks most of the articles in the main area. Star Wars character articles, under your ideas, should be deleted as well. Not only that but to delete something because you dont like the subject is a taking the article personaly which Wikipedia's rules say not to do.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - for the reasons described above, as well as the fact that Wikipedia is a vertiable Hitchiker's Guide to Earth - 'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless. For example, in the early Middle Ages, no one in Western Europe could read, save those outside monestaries... and even then, reading was still a rarity. Said monestaries were full of old parchments and books - some dating back to when Aristotle and Socrates were philosophising about reality. The church could easily have tossed it all out - because all they needed was the Bible, and the rest was basically 'cruft' to them. Yet they kept the knowledge, because they knew it'd be important to someone some day. What is being done here may just be with pop culture - but it is still information to be noted, logged and provided for everyone in this Hitchiker's Guide to Earth. Aside from all this, the only reason the Gundamwiki exists is to hold these articles that are being nominated for deletion (in such a way that abuses Wikipedia's regulations, might I add) in case they actually are deleted - not because someone made their own Wiki.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- If you delete all this, you'll have to delete many (or perhaps even ALL) of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> articles, claiming they too should just get their own little Wiki like the rest of the, "FanCruft", I believe is the word? Furthermore, Wikipedia is meant to be a treasure trove of knowledge on almost ANY subject that anyone can add to and enhance, these Wikis are nothing more than the culmination of hard work from various fans. And finally, just because someone else made their own Wiki doesn't mean that any and all articles on the subject of the Fan-Wiki should be deleted from the real Wikipedia, this is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> arguement.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- To me, the idea of removing these articles seems absurd. Mobile Suit Gundam contains many, vast universes, and needs all of these pages, now, Wikipedia is meant to be the online encyclopedia, in which you can find just about anything, now, if you were to take out one of these things, then it is just one less thing that wiki is good for. Now, as another user mentioned, if this is deleted, then you will also have to delete almost everything from other TV shows. If you are going to delete MS Gundam, while letting so many other shows have their articles remain intact, then I am to assume that you are doing this out of simple hatred of a show that you know almost nothing about. If you are to delete everything, or even, anything, Gundam, then I would also suggest that you delete everything that is Star Trek, Star Wars, related to copyrighted video games, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Space Runaway Ideon, the Simpsons, Lost, 24, American Idol, and every other show that has ever aired on any TV on earth. Simply put, if having Mobile Suit Gundam on Wikipedia breaks any rules, then so do all of these shows.--AEUG16:14, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge with their drivers</b>. This is all fascinating stuff, but not worthy on its own.

I've done more than that previously... ah, fun times...&#160;:) Awesome stuff for a Gundam-specific wiki though. Does one exist we could transwiki these to?

<li><b>Comment</b> Some of the characters have piloted a lot of suits, so their pages would be huge and take up more room than their biographies. Unless there's huge bandwidth problems, it seems like it'd be simpler to leave things as they are, though having these pages seems to really bother people so whatever.

<dd>There's also the issue of machines which were only piloted by minor or nameless characters, such as the standard model GINN. While I think that merging the machines with the appropriate pilot would be a good alternative, there are some that just can't be done with such a play. <a href="../../../a/m/u/User%7EAmuroNT1_7f94.html" title="User:AmuroNT1">AmuroNT1</a> 21:14 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The bigger problem with such a solution is that we would then have multiple instances of repeating data... or rather, multiple identical articles describing a mobile suit on the page of anyone whose piloted one over the course of the series. What happens then when someone decides to edit said article? Correct something, is it then the user's responsibility to make the same change to every single article? Wasteful! If the articles continue to exist, they should remain in a singular form. A better method (if a mandate to do so becomes more convincing that the one presented here...) would be to create large articles labled 'Mobile weapons of the Earth Aliance,' and 'Mobile weapons of the ZAFT forces' that sport the article's contents in a more compact format, organized based on which faction produced the weapon in question...--KefkaTheClown 21:07, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
