<p>I believe this article's topic to be something that neither requires nor merits a Wikipedia article. I believe that the current low quality of the article (which seems to be not much more than a recitation of demographic statistics with the addition of a single paragraph of not-fully-relevant history) does not, as some might suggest, mean that the article should be improved. I believe, instead, that it demonstrates that a Wikipedia-quality article cannot be written on this topic. The poor article quality is, of course, just a symptom of the lack of encyclopedic nature of this topic. First, I believe that this article has been created to bolster a school of thought which believes that this identity exists. An article on that sort of racialized thinking might be valid, of course, but that's not the same thing as creating an article which should only exist if you buy into their belief system.</p>
<p>As an example of the sort of confused thinking that must have lead to the creation of this article, the "Ethnic group" infobox template has been used. However, this confounds the concept of a skin colour and an "ethnicity". Ethnicity, as reported by Statistics Canada (for example), includes most national identities that can be seriously considered. "Quebecois" (apologies for lack of accents) is included, as is "Canadian", "Irish", "Lebanese" and "Ethiopian". THOSE are ethnicities (or at least, they're worthy of Wikipedia articles, because they clearly encompass a set of people who understand themselves by the label. However, the set of people who understand their own ethnicity to be "White Canadian" is very different from the set of people described by the label.</p>
<p>Finally, I will head off the most obvious and useless argument - which has been used both in the article and on its talk page. In fact, the first sentence of the article is, I believe, nothing more than an attempt to justify the very existence of the article. Any article that must do that is on shaky ground.) The argument basically says that because StatsCan counts it, it must be a valid article. This is an irrelevant point, as StatsCan counts numerous things that are not worthy of articles - can you picture an article with the title "Single Family Dwellings in Kenora"&#160;??? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 16:56, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Certainly not by me. I don't believe that I'm someone who can comment on those groups' existence within the milieu of the countries in question. However, I would certainly have the immediate reaction that the concept of "White American" certainly is much more present in the mass media of that country than the concept of "White Canadian" is in Canadian mass media, making "White American" more article-worthy than "White Canadian". <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 17:23, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> In response to Ashley Morton, I agree that the term confounds color and ethnicity. I primarily consider the term to imply the physical description of light-colored people which would not be an ethnicity, but my sources I used for citation said it meant European ancestry. In the sense that white is being used as a synonym for European ancestry, white is in fact an ethnicity. I consider the "single family dwelings in Kenora" to be a poor analogy. Surely, not everything should be an article on Wikipedia, but Wikipedia considers ethnic groups to be noteworthy. User:AshleyMorton claim "Canadian" is noteworthy enough to warrant an article, but aren't recent Chinese Canadians culturally or if I may ethnically different from European descent Canadians with a long history in Canada? If your definition Ashley Morton of ethnicity revolves around history and culture, European Canadians have a separate culture from other Canadian groups like Aboriginal Canadians.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 10:52, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is true that anybody of any ancestral background could fill in the White Canadian category on the Canadian Census, but this is true of most censuses.

<li>Regardless of the eventual outcome, this argument doesn't hold. If an article were created called "White Newfoundlander", for instance, it would be even more tenuous than this one. How about "Iberian Canadian" (to lump together people from Portugal and Spain", or "North Asian Canadian" - my point is, simply because you can categorize a group of people and put them under a single label, does NOT mean that that categorization holds equal value to the encylopedia project as all other groups. "Chinese Canadian" - of course! That has to stay - it's a group with many elements of common history, identity, etc., etc., etc. Most relevantly, most members of the group see that as group to which they belong. I and many other white Canadians do not see "White Canadians" as a *group* to which we belong. Similarly, we clearly should not have an article for "Canadians who own umbrellas", because that group does not see itself as a group, and even though it has common elements (nationality, umbrella-owning-status). So, yes there IS logical justification for "singling out" White Canadian - it does not share the other common traits or historical identities that ethnic or cultural groups that have legitimate articles share. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 20:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, to be clear, I'm not using a categorization to disagree with the existence of white Canadian. I'm simply arguing that it, as a group, as an "identity", doesn't meet the sort of criteria to be in the same place as many of those other ones you list. I suspect that if I knew more about the circumstance, <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Australian_ec50.html" title="White Australian">White Australian</a> might also be something of which I'd support the deletion, but that's key - I don't know. I DO, on the other hand, know about the circumstances of fair-skinned people in Canada. I am one, and I know many. In short, they have nothing in common OTHER than their skin colour. At that point, it is either labelling for the sake of labelling (at which point my "umbrella" example is relevant) OR it is a strategy to foist this identity upon the world, as if it is an existent subject. That, I believe would be Wikipedia inventing the world, not Wikipedia describing the world. ...and that's not okay. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 23:36, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is absolutely nothing that makes the situation of white Canadians any different. For example, even in the UK, where it can be argued that whites are the indigeonous population (instead of immigrants), there are differences between English, Scottish, Scots-Irish (in Northern Ireland), Welsh and Cornish cultures. There are even differences in culture within those groups (such as south and north England), different economic classes, different subcultures and other differences that lead to a non-homogoneous culture. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 00:17, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that's true. From a quick look at the respective articles, it appears that "white British" and "white Australian" are both defined by a census question about ethnicity, and the British article specifically addresses the cultural groups. In contrast, the Canadian census does not mention "white" at all in the question about ethnic origin, only in a separate question about visible minority status—race and colour are separate variables. Although we're trying to clean it up, some editors are conflate the two concepts based on orthogonally-opposed data variables, to paint their own picture of a white "Canadian race", completely insupportable by the data.&#160;<i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-12-06&#160;00:37&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<li>Of course you can keep one and not the other. If one is an identifiable - well - identity, with common history, socialization, and a feeling of commonality, while the other one is a label and nothing but a label, then of course you can distinguish between them. That's like saying there needs to be an article on "Italians in Canada before 1400" because we could write an article on "aboriginal people in Canada before 1400" - Sure, it's equal, but the facts intervene and inform us that one doesn't exist. Of course, I'm not saying there are no white Canadians - I'm saying that you can't off-the-cuff generalize from one article of a certain type to another of the same type - you must actually consider the validity of each article seperately.<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 23:50, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The comparison to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Canadian_dd2a.html" title="Black Canadian">Black Canadian</a> is invalid; there <i>is</i> an objective and encyclopedic Black Canadian identity, history and social context that is shared across the various black ethnicities. Minority identities <i>are</i> encyclopedic, because they are bound together by circumstances unique to being a minority group; privileged majority groupings simply <i>do not have that kind of commonality</i>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:57, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Just because blacks are a minority in Canad doesn't mean they all have a common homogoneous culture or history, any more than whites have a common homogoneous culture and history.

<dd>For all the differences that exist among the various black <i>ethnicities</i>, there <i>is</i> a common experience and history defined by the state of being black: <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>, being on the losing end of <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_privilege.html" title="White privilege">white privilege</a>, police harassment, racial profiling, <a href="../../../d/r/i/Driving_While_Black_a7f1.html" title="Driving While Black">Driving While Black</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribana.html" title="Caribana">Caribana</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Elliott_Clarke_bf3d.html" title="George Elliott Clarke">George Elliott Clarke</a>'s Africadia. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micha%C3%ABlle_Jean_5dae.html" title="Michaëlle Jean">Michaëlle Jean</a>. And on, and so forth. For all the variety within it, an objective culture does exist which can be and is labelled "Black Canadian", whereas "White Canadian" culture is a meaningless abstraction that <i>doesn't</i> objectively exist, and can <i>only</i> be created by cobbling together bits of demographic data that have no connection to each other, no shared experience, no applicability to any cultural terminologies used in the real world, and no remotely encyclopedic reason to be lumped together as a single group. Wikipedia's job is to reflect <i>terms that are actually in use in the real world</i>, to write about and reflect topics that <i>other</i> sources have <i>already</i> deemed encyclopedically significant. "Black Canadian" fits that criterion; "White Canadian" does not. European Canadian is a <i>much</i> better approach to this — while I'm still not sure there's that <i>much</i> that can be written about the topic, and would therefore <i>still</i> have to think very carefully about whether it was keepable as written, the title comes <i>much</i> closer to reflecting the distinctions that actually exist in Canadian culture as defined by the external sources that determine the encyclopedic value of a WP article. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 01:43, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a group of people in Canada. People of European ancestry. It is a relevant article related to Canada, and is not "low quality", it is similar content in all other "ethnic group" articles. If you delete this, why not delete "Chinese Canadian" or "French American"? You don't have much of a reason why you would like it deleted rather then critisizing its quality. But it shows accurate facts and percentages etc., and seems pretty fine to me. Don't see any reason for it to be deleted. Are you a racist&#160;? A racist American could delete "African American" then. "Not relevant" what are you talking about, it is the majority ethnic group in Canada, how is that not relevant? I think maybe you are scared it is racist, or something like that, but either way your personal opinion does not matter 100% and you should focus on wether the article can benefit any reasercher, or wether it is relevant. It IS relevant. If they have an article on "African Canadians", who are around 4 % of the Canadian population I believe, why on earth can't there be an article for "White Canadians", the largest ethnic group in Canada? I fail to see an adequate reason for deletion, rather than some sort of personal grudge. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanRP_d875.html" title="User:RyanRP">RyanRP</a> 03:31, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, Michael Z., the point you just made would mean that all the ethnic group pages should be deleted, because that's basically what they all are. And the "Latin American not counted" part was always there, on the original version. Seriously, with your argument, that means we should delete EVERY ethnic group page for EVERY country on Wikipedia, because what you say is "wrong" with this article is what every ethnic group article is. Information about a certain group of ethnicity in a country, what percentages they are in population, and the like. 03:34, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And eron, if you say that, then lets have "African American", or "Indian British" deleted aswell. Seriously, "White", no matter what your personal opinion is, DOES exist. there are WHITE , PEOPLE. They are REAL they EXIST. every group of people "really exists" but white people"?? That certainly isn't true!

<dd>I don't think you understood what I was implying by my comment. I was not suggesting deletion of those pages; I was rather suggesting that if the concept of "White" is strong enough to support them, then there may be a case for a "White Canadians" article as well.

<p>well I just added something to the page that should clear up everyones concerns. Check it out, definitions of White Canadian I added it, hopefully that fixes your problems ``` RYAN RP</p>

<dd>No. "Black Canadian" <i>actually</i> exists in the real world as a term <i>actually</i> in use to define a cultural grouping. Whether you <i>agree</i> with the cultural value of that grouping is irrelevant; the term actually signifies a specific grouping recognized in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources as having a specific cultural context.
