And now this article. In fact, Iranian government never ever officially protested the name of Azerbaijan, only some Iranian nationalistic figures do. So there’s no reason for existence of such a POV article, especially considering that it lacks credible references. The veiwpoint of some Iranians can be briefly mentioned in the article about the country, but not in every article about Azerbaijan. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>stop blowing this out of proportion. only three articles contain a short section about the controversy, that is it, and they all link back here, where the reader can get more information. Why are you trying to hold back information? would you rather prefer that each of those small sections became as big as this? that wouldnt make any sense at all. that is why this has its own article, its too much information to just "summarize". <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 04:26, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This whole “controversy” deserves just a brief mention in the article about the country of Azerbaijan, but it does not need a whole section in every Azerbaijan related article, and it definitely does not need such a POV article. As a matter of fact, the country exists under that name since 1918, and it was recognized by Iran back then and now. I see no controversy at all. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 04:31, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No one said that the country called Azerbaijan does not exist today or it is not recognized by the whole world including Iran. But what does that have to do with the fact that the name change happened back in 1918? It is a historical fact and should be mentioned and it is detailed enough to require its own section if not its own page. If "controversy" is all you have problem with the call for a title change and not delete.<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGol_cff6.html" title="User:Gol">Gol</a> 03:54, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Stop trying to manipulate the users please. You have no real reason for wanting to delete this article other than trying to block information for the readers of Wikipedia. I dont know what you have been taught in Azerbaijan or what you want to believe, but this is the reality, something that apparently you didnt know about till i created this article. I have come to a compromise with you before regarding the Azerbaijani people article, and now I'm asking you to come to a compromise with me. Everything in this article is factual and necessary. The articles that link to it are linked to it for a reason, because the context is necessary. You have no real solid good reason for wanting to delete this article.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 04:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, my mistake, I left out two, but seriously, do only 5 articles make up all of the articles about Azerbaijan? Honestly, be realistic, 5 articles doesnt even make a dent, and thats as far as the "list" will grow. No other articles need the context. No where in the article does it suggest that this is an international dispute, although it is, and you know as well as I do that there are a lot of problems in the region today because of this name change. The article is in no way blown out of proportion, if you think it is, please provide the lines of text that you believe are "blowing it out of proportion".<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 04:38, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But why all those 5 need a special section dedicated to this "controversy" (which exists only in minds of some Iranian nationalists)? I think it is enough to mention the "controversy" in the article about Azerbaijan, that's the way it's been before and I never tried to remove it. If some folks in Iran have problems with the name, let's mention it, but no need to present it as some international confrontation. It should be put in correct perspective. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 04:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why shouldnt those 5 need attention? Two of them are about the state of Azerbaijan (the present and the one in 1918 and later), one is concerning the people (the name change affected the name of the people, which causes much confusion about the ethnic origin, because its really two different ethnic groups with the same name now), the other is about one of the names of the region before it was changed to something else, and the last one is about the history of Azerbaijan, and correct me if I'm wrong, but changing the name to Azerbaijan is a big part of AZERBAIJAN's history. Again, you are just repeating yourself, without getting to the actual problem, you just want this article gone, its that simple.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 04:47, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who are those 2 different ethnic groups with the same name? If you talk about Azerbaijanis, they are the same people both in Iran and Azerbaijan. Some nationalistic circles in Iran feel very insecure, because they afraid that one day the Azeri minority in Iran may wish to claim independence, following the suit of their ethnic brethren on the other side of Araks. That’s the real reason for the “controversy” that some Iranian nationalists try to present as something indeed real. But somehow you failed to mention this aspect in your article. I see no reason for spamming many articles about Azerbaijan with the same repetitive information. This issue should be merged into the article about Azerbaijan and presented in a neutral fashion. All other articles should be cleaned from the POV “controversy” sections, which consume the space that could be dedicated to indeed useful info. The only other exception could be the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Azerbaijan_7da2.html" title="History of Azerbaijan">History of Azerbaijan</a> article, where we can also mention this "controversy". <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 05:17, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now you are getting too emotional. No, "north" Azari's and "south" Azari's are not the same people. "North" Azari's are most likely a Caucasian people, while "South" Azari's are most likely an Iranic people. Infact, the name of the region, Arran, is a version of the name Albania, and the people were referred to as Arrani's by Iranians and Arabs, this alone shows that Azari's and Arrani's are not the same people. Our discussion here has just shown how controversial this topic really is, so now the title will stay the way it is hopefully.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 13:37, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There’s no reason for existence of a POV article like this. There’s no controversy to begin with. Iran never officially protested the name, neither back in 1918, nor in 1991. Even the case of a real controversy over the name of Macedonia was presented in a section of the article <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia_f62e.html" title="Foreign relations of the Republic of Macedonia">Foreign_relations_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia</a>. In our case, claims of some Iranian nationalists don’t warrant an article with such a POV title and content. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 08:51, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are not of the same ethnic group. Genetic testing has shown this. Genetic testing has put "north Azeri's" with Caucasians, and has put "south Azeri's" with Iranics. They are only linguistically Turkic, not ethnically. And for your information, Canada and the USA share a common language, but that doesn't mean that Canada can change its name to the USA and join America. Also, using the same example, the present-day Azeri langauge is also not that drastically different from Turkish (Turkey), so are you also going to say that Turks and Azeri's are the same people too, because ethnically, Turks from Turkey are descendents of Anatolians people (Greeks, Armenians, Romans, Iranics, other Indo-Europeans). This article is detailed, sourced, and necessary, and it seems as the majority of the consensus is for a keep. You are the one with the POV. And that Britannica article is a direct consequence of the unjustifiable name change of the Caucasus region to Azerbaijan, and currently, me and Ali are thinking about creating another detailed article about the consequences of that name change and the confusion it has caused the scholarly community.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 14:14, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Genetics don’t mean a thing. They only prove origins of people, but they don’t define who they are. Language does. Azeris speak the same language and share the same culture and are the same people. Open any authoritative encyclopedia and you’ll see that. Check the quote from Britannica above, for instance. It is one of the most authoritative sources, and is written by the best specialists. You are just promoting Iranian official propaganda here, which did not change much since the times of Iranian shah regime. In order to suppress ethnic identity of Azeri people in Iran and assimilate them with Persians the official propaganda tries to persuade Iranian Azeris that they are nothing but turkified Persians. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 06:28, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This issue is very important, and it is the root cause of many of the problems in the region today. The controversy over the name Azerbaijan is historical and reality. This article is necessary, especially to put the <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijani_people.html" title="Azerbaijani people">azerbaijani people</a> articles in context. Everyone has a right to know that the name Azerbaijan in regards to the region north of Iran is historical revisionism started by a Pan Turk party in 1918, and that historically, Azeri's, and Azerbaijan only have to do with Iran, not the Caucasus. This article should not be merged because it provides a lot of information. And to Abdulnr: This is the only article on this controversy, I dont know which other articles you are referring to.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 14:57, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No the reason for deletion is that the article tries to create a vision that the Azerbaijan Republic came to be called as such in an overnight political decision. It is not that way. Almost all the countries in the world cover an area that is different than the original core of the country. Russia or Canada for example. The word Canada originally applied to a settlement in mondern Quebec City. Today, Canada covers almost 10 million sq. km. area. The same thing here. Azerbaijan originally referred to the area that is only the <b>part of</b> todays Iranian Azerbaijan. Eventually, it spread to refer to the whole Azerbaijani speaking areas. The most important thing is that it did <b>not</b> happen overnight in 1918. What happened in 1918 is that the name Azerbaijan was used as a name of a country for the first time. Now, this so-called controversy is a modern attempt, especially by those encouraged by the Macedonia affair. But, unfortunately for them it's not the identical situation here. Here is ethnical, lingustic and cultural uniformity between the Republic and the Iranian Azerbaijan. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBits_9563.html" title="User:TimBits">TimBits</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 16:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>TimBits, you are completely mistake. Never did the term Azerbaijan grow to ecompass the regions north of Iran's Caucasus border. You will not be able to find one single map before the 1900's that shows the region called Azerbaijan. The only region ever called Azerbaijan is Iranian Azerbaijan. And yes, the name change did happen overnight. In 1918, the pan-Turkish Musavat Party met in Tiblisi and decided on the name change. It literally was an over night name change.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 17:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see no ground for coming to an understanding with you in this matter. I have explained the situatin and there is nothing I can do when someone plainly says 'no it's not that way'. If there is any use, then I too will repeat that the name Azerbaijan came to be applied to a larger area gradually. It never heppened overnight.

Also Shaykh Mahmud Khiyabani renamed Iranian Azerbaijan to Azadistan to protest this change. So the information is not definitely a POV.

We have sourced information from even sourced R. of Azerbaijani news papers of the 1940/50's. Have you even read the article, maybe you should, you'll learn something.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article touches upon major issues of Azerbaijani identity and should be kept, if possible expanded. Furthermore, although I cannot claim that it does not contain POV or incaccuracies, many facts stated are perfectly correct. e.g. use of the name of Azerbaijan to denote northern Iran. Some issues, however, such as failure to mention the naming of the territory in the Safavid empire or claims that the people of northern Iran (so called South Azerbaijan) and modern-day Azerbaijan are different ethnicities is clearly POV and should be removed. Thus, the article should be cleaned up a bit and supplied with more citations, but not deleted.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikakasumov_f7cc.html" title="User:Mikakasumov">mikakasumov</a> 16:58, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The different ethnicities of the "two" Azerbaijani people are sourced. They are from genetic testing, which show "north Azeri's" clustering more with Caucasian people, and Iranian Azeri's clustering more with other Iranics.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 17:02, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Khosrow, I definitely support the content of the article since it is factual and there is no greater name in the early 20th century when it comes to Turkic studies than Barthold. Historically Caucasian Albania and Atoorpaatekaan were two different entities and the name Azerbaijan and ethnic name Azerbaijani are both recent for the caucasian republic of Azerbaijan. But I think perhaps in order not to insult anyone we can get rid of the word <i>republic</i> and change it to <i>name of Azerbaijan for Azerbaijan republic controversy</i> or <i>Name of Azerbaijani republic controversy</i>. This way maybe others will be satisfied as well. Also other materials related to pan-turkist plagarism must be investigated (both in Turkey) and Azerbaijani republic and history books need to be read to make sure these are state historian policies and not normal revionists which are found in every country. Unfortunately I was disheartened by the following link:<a href="http://www.azembassy.it/browse.php?lang=eng&amp;page=0002" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azembassy.it/browse.php?lang=eng&amp;page=0002" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and I am wondering if this is the material thought as history in the textbooks of the Azerbaijani republic and what is the use in claiming that Zoroastrianism and Sumerians and Akkadians were Turkish?? BTW check out some more old maps: <a href="http://www.helmink.com/Antique_Map_Tallis_Persia/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.helmink.com/Antique_Map_Tallis_Persia/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://www.philographikon.com/imagesmiddleeast/persiaitalianmap.gif" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.philographikon.com/imagesmiddleeast/persiaitalianmap.gif" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 19:19, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Proof that the Iranian Azari's were infact Iranics before Turkified? Also Ali, the Azeri embassay website is proof that the Azeri government is committing historical revisionism, and supports it.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 20:44, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What does the Caspian have to do with anything? I think your trying to say that old maps are not very accurate, and you are right to an extent. Ajam aslo means Persian, in arabic.

<dd>Well even assuming he does find such a map with blurred boundaries (since old maps have made lots of errors as well) (so far I have not seen any old map not distinguishing Azerbaijan from Caucasia), it doesn't change the fact that virtually the majority of old maps clearly distinguish the historical Azerbaijan from Caucasian Albania.. Caucasian Albania though was often conquered. For example, to view Azerbaijan and Caucasian Albania as historically the same is as absurd as saying that since some of the maps we found show Caucasian Albania as part of Georgia(which you found quite a few and I found some too) or because some ancient historians consider Caucasian Albania as part of greater Armenia, then Caucasian Albania is part of Georgia/Armenia and should have the name Souther Georgia or Eastern Armenia (Ibn Wazih Ya'qubi and Baladhuri have mentioned this as part of Armenia, but this again does not correspond to majority of classical sources). Some sources have called all of caucus as Georgia or Armenia , but most have separated caucasian Albania from these two areas. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 01:17, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
