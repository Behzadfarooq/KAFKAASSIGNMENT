<li><b>Keep</b>. Objective morality is distinct from moral absolutism, yet the article lacks content and clarity. 3.22.2005 5:50 (EST)</li>
<li>This is getting confusing, because someone has renamed it "moral objectivism." There's no such thing in philosophy as "objective morality," but there <i>is</i> a position called "moral objectivism." But it's not what this article says it is. Moral objectivism is roughly the view that morality is a product of our natures as rational beings who can empathize with other sentient beings. Therefore, I vote to <b>delete</b> the title "objective morality" but to <b>keep</b> the title "moral objectivism" so long as there's content change. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 23:06, Mar 22, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And to clarify: "moral objectivism" is not the same position as "moral absolutism." <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 23:08, Mar 22, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>hmm ... i'm seeing that moral objectivism is the idea that at least some things are wrong according to some external standard, moral absolutism is the idea that some things are wrong regardless of context, and moral relativism is the idea that things are right and wrong according to one's culture, so that moral objectivism is opposed to moral relativism, but moral ABSOLUTISM can be either objective or relative? Is this getting closer? <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 23:49, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Roughly, <i>moral absolutism</i> is the view that certain acts are right or wrong regardless of context and regardless of consequences: an absolutist would not hold that the truth of moral judgments varies across cultures (relativism). <i>Moral relativism</i> takes a number of forms, but is more or less the view that whether acts are regarded as right or wrong varies across societies, time, and even individual circumstances, and that moral judgments are not capable of being true or false: the relativist argues that moral judgments are invented, not discovered. <i>Moral objectivism</i> is a subset of <i>moral realism</i>, which I now see has its own page: <i>moral realism</i> holds that moral judgments are capable of being true or false; that moral values are discovered, not invented; and that their truth is not affected by what anyone thinks about them. <i>Moral realism</i> and <i>moral absolutism</i> are related, but are not the same: a <i>moral realist</i> would say of a "good" act that, if its consequences were likely to be dreadful, then it would no longer be the right thing to do. A <i>moral absolutist</i>, however, would argue that certain moral judgments ought to be acted upon regardless of consequences. However, both the absolutist and the realist/objectivist share the view that moral judgments are discovered, not invented by human beings. To make it even more confusing, I should add that these terms are not used in the same way by all philosophers, so they're actually not very helpful. As <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_realism.html" title="Moral realism">moral realism</a> has its own page, it would make sense to delete the content of <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objective_morality.html" title="Objective morality">objective morality</a>, or <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_objectivism.html" title="Moral objectivism">moral objectivism</a> as it's now called, and redirect the title <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_objectivism.html" title="Moral objectivism">moral objectivism</a> to <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_realism.html" title="Moral realism">moral realism</a>, but delete the title <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objective_morality.html" title="Objective morality">objective morality</a>. And leave <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_absolutism.html" title="Moral absolutism">moral absolutism</a> as it is.

<li>Thanks for the explanation:). I had always used objectivism and absolutism interchangeably, but i see now that there's an important distinction between the two:).

<li><b>Delete content but Keep term and write new article</b> ... as the current article is a) factually wrong (see below) and b) in whole unsubstantiated by reference material (a definite requirement in this case I would suggest). However, the term is legitimate and its <i>correct</i> meaning a valid concept for Wikipedia; I don't think a redirect to <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophobia.html" title="Xenophobia">Xenophobia</a> is warranted as the concepts are not synonymous, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> being a more closely related term. I agree with Rossami that it appears to have become a legitimate term and it is used to describe the several conflicts that occur within national boudaries between disparate ethnic groups. Many of the uses of the term are in the context of the Chenya-Russia conflict. In my brief searching of uses of the term in context I did not run across a specific definition, but the examples explored in which the term occurs <i>contradict</i> the Ethnophobia author's definition. The author states: "Usually, it is used to denote a perceived irrational fear by minority groups ... towards their host society." This is simply untrue and implies that there is such a thing as a "host society" and a guest minority" (my term, not from the article) which in turn implies one group present by right and the other by the forbearance of the "host", which is in itself inherently POV. As a disclaimer, this is all based on at-the-moment webresearch. I think a sociology &amp;/or political science expert need to write the article. Oh, almost forgot, types of sources where the term is found include <a href="http://wwics.si.edu/ees/special/2001/msmirn.pdf" class="external free" title="http://wwics.si.edu/ees/special/2001/msmirn.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://wwics.si.edu/ees/special/2001/msmirn.pdf</a>, <a href="http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2001may/bernstein.html" class="external free" title="http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2001may/bernstein.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2001may/bernstein.html</a>, <a href="http://www.rand.org/publications/CF/CF130/CF130ch3.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.rand.org/publications/CF/CF130/CF130ch3.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rand.org/publications/CF/CF130/CF130ch3.pdf</a>, <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=4ngvvgqhxh05lu7pnqt1&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,10,11;journal,28,29;linkingpublicationresults,1:102902,1" class="external free" title="http://www.springerlink.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=4ngvvgqhxh05lu7pnqt1&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,10,11;journal,28,29;linkingpublicationresults,1:102902,1" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerlink.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=4ngvvgqhxh05lu7pnqt1&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,10,11;journal,28,29;linkingpublicationresults,1:102902,1</a> , and <a href="http://www.osce.org/documents/sg/2003/06/270_en.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.osce.org/documents/sg/2003/06/270_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.osce.org/documents/sg/2003/06/270_en.pdf</a> (I've tried to select things from non-fringe sources). <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 04:37, 2005 Mar 10 (UTC)

<li>I think you may be reading too much into the usage of the term "host society", especially since you put "guest minority" in quotes as if it occurred in the article, which it doesn't. (I've clarified this in the commentary above <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 18:33, 2005 Mar 10 (UTC)) There's nothing inherently POV about the suggestion that when friction exists between a minority within a society and the society at large, that some portion of that friction may originate in the attitudes of the minority towards the society, rather than just the attitudes of the society at large towards the minority. However, as you suggested, I think we need someone expert in the field to tell us whether there is a term that is consistently meant to indicate <i>this</i> concept -- "ethnophobia" is not that term, since uses of it to mean "xenophobia" seem to outnumber uses of it in the sense stated by the article. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:52, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Note to administrators</b>: After quite a bit or work, in has become clear that this page should be kept, and removed from VFD. Trying to make categories take the place of this list has been an exercise in futility. Even by abusing the category system, categories can't replace a good list:</p>
<ol>
<li>For the <i>Recent changes</i> function to work for a category as it does for a list, all the articles in the subcategories must also be categorized in the top category. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchangeslinked&amp;target=Category%3ASikhism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchangeslinked&amp;target=Category%3ASikhism" rel="nofollow">Recent changes for Sikhism category</a> does not return the same results as does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchangeslinked&amp;target=Sikh_pages" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchangeslinked&amp;target=Sikh_pages" rel="nofollow">recent changes for Sikh Pages</a>. Checking the category only is a lot less useful for those needing (or wanting) to check all the related articles contained on the list.</li>
<li>A list can contain those pages of topical interest which should not be categorized in it; for instance, <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjabi_language.html" title="Punjabi language">Punjabi language</a> is of interest to those studying Sikhism but would not normally fall in a Sikhism category (and needs to be removed).</li>
<li>As is always mentioned, lists can contain comments.</li>
<li>As is always mentioned, needed articles (red-links) can only be on lists.</li>
<li>Also, this list is as valid and useful as any of the others in Category:Topic lists.<br /></li>
</ol>
<p>Too, the argument that the user should be able to determine which tool to use for navigation and editing seems to fall on deaf ears, but it's no less valid. —<a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 21:45, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Either way, we have more than a million users in our community, Insomaniac was voted most popular moderator recently, hence she is an icon to us and deserves an entry at wikipedia.</p>
<p>I can see where the "vanity" assumption comes from, but considering the fact that she didn't write it herself, it doesn't make sense.</p>

<dd>Not only would you have to demonstrate that the "google test" has any merit when it comes to deleting wikipedia articles at all, but that it actually means something in this case.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This article contains much information that is not speculation. It spells out the process to be undertaken during the campaign and chronicles the activities of candidates who are currently undertaking active steps towards a candidacy in 2008. It also provides an NPOV list of potential candidates for President and Vice President on the major party tickets. Moreover, unlike the election for one State Senate district, the race for President of the United States begins in earnest the day after the previous election. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 18:49, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am usually loathe to see articles of a speculative nature but the point has been made that the campaign for the 2008 election is already under way.

<li><b>Keep</b>, There was a long and speculative list of potential candidates but that appears to have moved to the talk page. Now, the list of candidates is only of those persuing a 2008 candidacy. Also, if there are people who have formed opinions about the 2008 election, it is acceptable to report these opinions in an NPOV way (meaning reporting that there exist people who hold an opinion instead of stating the opinions as if the article was asserting them). There being speculative or POV information on the article means the article needs NPOV work, but not to be deleted entirely. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 05:03, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. And please, bring back the list of potential candidates who may make a run, albeit speculative, that list <i>was</i> informative.

But please DO NOT bring back the huge long list of possible people. That list included mostly eligible people, 90% of whom won't be running. Just include people who have expressed interest in running or those who have a strong citizen draft going for them. - 149.4.108.9 15:26, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. While I agree that the nomination was probably made in spite, this is still speculation about a future event. Yes, we had an article for the 2004 election before the event but if you look at what that did to the community, that should be considered as evidence in favor of deleting, not precedent for keeping.

<li>Thank you sjorford for your comments. Is it then fair to construe that Wikipedia is systematically biased towards internet memes? Could it be considered circular reasoning to refer back to Wikipedia as an encyclopaedia which includes content such as this?

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Anything created on usenet would have to be <i>very</i> famous to warrant its own article. The Google score is limp, which suggests that this never got much further than Usenet. Even a Google Groups usenet search brings a weak 66 results, mostly from the same small handful of people, which shows that even on usenet this didn't get particularly far.

<li>I recall this from rec.music.bluenote c. 1994. I'd argue that some Usenet memes did achivie notability, but I don't see don't see much evidence that references to Toejam Jawallaby ever spread much beyond one newsgroup and the posts and website of the person who concoted him.

"Against the Dictatorship of Allah" gets 23 hits, without the word "Wikipedia" gets 16, only 7 of which are displayed as unique. I'm open to being convinced some of these articles are about subjects more significant than the average garage band with a self-produced demo cd and occasional gigs at a neighborhood bar, but I've yet to see the evidence. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 05:51, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

Dan, both you and I can get a geocities website, or one like your friend Eric's, "Surrealcoconut" and build the site and then copy and paste anything that we find online from other, "surrealism" websites and then state that we are the voices of, "contemporary surrealism" etc., etc., etc., you know. Does the surrealism expert Mary Ann Caws recognize this, "group" as credible? Were did they exhibit their art and display their writings? Were did they met? Were did they get their publications published? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? What are their names? Can we verify who they are? What do they look like? Come on Dan! If I was a college student doing a paper on Surrealism after 1950 to now, you know, Surrealism today, I would have nothing on this group, really, expect a handful of websites, (around five to six) that say they exist, but that is it!<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 19:35, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Infrogmation, I was thinking about deleting this group, yet there is wide documetation on their work as Genepool mentions above. Their history, art and work are all documented in museums, galleries, and there was a TV Documentary on the Bravo Channel in Canada on their founding member Gregg Simpson that featured West Coast Surrealist Group's history as well as his work in surrealism.

<li><b>Keep</b>, as a major contributor to this article and small-time wikipedia contributor in general I'm shocked to see that it was deleted. I was responsible for jump starting it's existence and while the article has grown a bit out of control I think that it's an important article. While you may not see it on the surface, YTMND is really a major cultural phenomenon that extends way beyond the internet and the members of it's website. In and of itself it represents a new movement in ironic comedy and cultural attitudes. I seriously believe that it would be a disservice to the world to not include this article in the wikipedia body of information. <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelerityfm_dc3c.html" title="User:Celerityfm">Celerityfm</a> 14:57, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Just in case anybody ever wonders why I voted to keep her but usually vote delete on other Internet memes (often with more Google hits), it's because she's already notable (within the context of Japan) as a famous and successful national ad campaign. In other words, if Anabukin-chan had never met the Internet, she'd still be notable enough for an article anyway. The same cannot be said for (for example) <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahir_Cagri_dc9a.html" title="Mahir Cagri">Mahir Cagri</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a>, who are most chiefly noted for being joked about online. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:46, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Apparently he lived 120 years. (The first entry had him dying much earlier.) Presumably the Trent Observatory is at the Trent University in Ontario Canada. But that is only 40 years old.

<dd>The NASA ADS lists a Lisbeth F. Olsen (active 1999-2004), also listed as L. Olsen (1999-2000; same as L. F. Olsen, München and Copenhagen). The only other Olsen listed is a geophysicist L. R. Olsen (one paper, 2003).</dd>
<dd>The only Trent Observatory I find is now called the East Midlands [Public Health] Observatory. Trent University (<a href="http://www.trentu.ca/" class="external free" title="http://www.trentu.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.trentu.ca/</a>) does not seem to have an observatory.

<li>Interesting. This article has been around and largely unnoticed since 2002. The phrase generates only 68 unique <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Corporate+immune+response%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Corporate+immune+response%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">Google hits</a> and a high proportion of those are Wikipedia mirrors (some of this article and more of the two articles which link to it). The phrase is not in use among any of the communities that tend to specialize in corporate change management such as Harvard Business Review, Workforce Week, etc. The more general term would be "resistance to change" which does not have the same connotation of inevitability or purpose. As much as I hate to lose a business-related article, I have to be consistent and consider this a neologism.

Creation science is an ideologically and politically motivated propaganda tool and a neologism whose only purpose is to promote the creationist agenda in society.

Further more it is my believe that if wikipedians don't make a firm and clear stand against such use of propaganda in wikipedia, then the whole project looses credibility. The main asumption of wikipedia is thats its user will autoregulate the content.

<li><b>Keep and do not merge</b>. This is a very commonly used phrase and is precisely the sort of thing that people would come to wikipedia for. It is also very distinct from creationism, which makes no attempt to phrase its arguments in scientific sounding lingo. I have heard dinosaur bones explained away by creationists (but not creation scientists) as placed in the ground by the devil to tempt believers. The creation scientist will carefully refute the results of radioactive decay due to groundwater contamination, the stratigraphic layers as elevation-based community structure, the fossilization in sedimentary rock as occurring in the Noahic flood, and the mass extinction as a result of inbreeding depression and bottlenecks just following the flood (because two of every land animal got on the boat). The article makes an attempt at NPOV, but I still think it's a bit pro.

<li>Interesting point. I'd argue that the intention of the "test" section of speedy delete policy is to allow the deletion of an article that says "Does this really end up on the web site?" or "I'd like to know more about TOPIC X and don't know why there's no article here." -- that is, something that clearly isn't gibberish or vandalism, but also clearly isn't someone intending to write an article.

<li><b>Delete</b>, Ronald Lee Sharp, I am the author - delete the article and move on with your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was anexpiriment and not vanity as Megain suggests. To find my article you would have to enter the full name so it would not show up to anyone unless they were looking for it. I had wrongly assumed this was an open source of information since you offer no method to verify sources, which you should. I understand now it is a closed information source which "may" accept new information from open sources iff the "editors" feel it is appropriate. Thanks and please keep up the effort, I think it is a worthy project and may well evolve into something really great. RLS</p>
