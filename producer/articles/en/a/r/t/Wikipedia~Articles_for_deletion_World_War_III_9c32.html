<li><b>Delete</b> - the page history is rather bizarre but telling. This article has only ever been made up of original research, which various editors have diligently tried to remove or ameliorate. The answer, I think, is to delete the article unless someone comes up with actual sources that can move this article beyond simply stating "WWIII is the hypothetical next world war." -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 18:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Yes it needs improving but so do various other articles. The concept of WWIII is well known within popular culture and the public psyc. This is deserving of an article. It was also a previous featured article candiate and the entry on the discussion page shows only one point missing on the star.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This term has been used many times by writers and politicians to describe the war on terror and the Cold War, however the article delves in "what could have been".

<dd>None of the above comments has any relation to wikipedia policy. "I Like it" or "it's interesting" is not a valid reason to keep. "I hear this phrase a lot" is not a reason to keep. The article needs sources and assertions of verifiablity. Furthermore, I suspect the FA candidate note at the top is a hoax as there is no subpage. PLEASE try to restrict comments to how the article does/doesn't/might eventually meet wikipedia policy. -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 18:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK it's not a hoax, I found the very old subpage, but still not a reason to keep the article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Very common concept. Hundreds of books, movies and video games deal with it and call it by that name. Not to mention the fact that USSR and US both based their policies on the idea for 50 years.

<dd>Did you look at the page history? Your point is well-taken, but look at the way it has been applied. People just add whatever they feel like "might" constitute a reference to WWIII.

<dd>I agree the history contains a lot of vandalism and pure OR but Wikipedia needs an article on WWIII. If I had the time I would go ahead and find sources and all, but I am at work.

<p><b>Unsure</b> Ive actually read this article well before it was nominated as an AfD. If this is going then can someone remove <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_IV_b2af.html" title="World War IV">World War IV</a> as by the same nature this is crystal ball stuff.</p>
<p>Also the World War IV article mentions that world war IV as the War on Terrorism, and the World War 3 as the Cold War.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The concept is well-established and the term is in relatively wide use, but the article seems to have deteriorated over time (see versions about 400 edits ago).

<li>I would suggest as an additional possibility merging into <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_III_in_popular_culture_958c.html" title="World War III in popular culture">World War III in popular culture</a> or vice versa (merging the "popular culture" article into this one). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:47, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b>. Right now, the article deals with "close to World War III" events, which are an <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. I've noted nearly all information was indeed added by anonymous editors without a proper source, examples include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_III&amp;diff=68429560&amp;oldid=68357084" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_III&amp;diff=68429560&amp;oldid=68357084" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_III&amp;diff=68576029&amp;oldid=68471066" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_III&amp;diff=68576029&amp;oldid=68471066" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_III&amp;diff=32086475&amp;oldid=31801082" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_III&amp;diff=32086475&amp;oldid=31801082" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<p>Articles that present extrapolation, speculation, and "future history" are original research and therefore inappropriate. Of course, we do and should have articles about notable artistic works, essays, or credible research that embody predictions. An article on Star Trek is appropriate; an article on "Weapons to be used in World War III" is not.</p>

<dd>I consider that somewhat in error myself (in that future weapons development is possibly a topic of some encyclopedic value, for example the recent Air Force ray gun). However, and perhaps most importantly, the concept of World War III is established enough that it does exist, and as such should be described. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:24, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Takeel, we can read. The article you nominated is about the reality of WWIII as we know it (as opposed to the media hype, or potential weapons that may be used). Please remember that WWI and WWII were both this century, and each resulted in a new world administrative body being created to ensure another WW didnt occur. WWIII has hovered over our heads for decades, and most nations have (big) buildings worth of classified material on scenarios, and how do deal with those scenarios should it happen. It is a real subject; the references are provided in the linked article (maybe this should be converted to a list of close calls?), and Afd is not the appropriate spot for discuss editorial issues. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 05:08, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Good day. Would you mind adding information about the classified material you mentioned to the article? It could only help. Thank you. --<a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakeel_bd6a.html" title="User:Takeel">Takeel</a> 13:58, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I expect that some of these classified books and war scenario documents should be available under <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_information_legislation.html" title="Freedom of information legislation">FOI</a> by now, but the topics are politically sensitive (hence being classified in the first place) and reliable sources usually steer clear. For the Australian doctrines, we first of all need articles for Kamaria <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/westqld/news/200308/s923286.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/westqld/news/200308/s923286.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, Tarajara <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/27/1080330985511.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/27/1080330985511.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and Musoria <a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/media/1998/16798.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.defence.gov.au/media/1998/16798.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 20:44, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There appears to be a misunderstanding of what "crystal ball" means, because reporting things that have been said and written <i>in the past</i> about a possible future event is not prophecy. There is nothing speculative about reporting that somebody in the past said something; it is a fact that the person said it. The article should be understood as being about the concept, which has a <i>history</i>. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:41, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Well-established and wide used concept. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarioca_220d.html" title="User:Carioca">Carioca</a> 04:02, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Article could use some clean-up, but is not unprofessional or non-encyclopedic. It's a valid topic to make an article about, although some elaboration would be preferable. 76.168.46.83 05:50, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - this article simply cannot be deleted because it is informative, as a Wikipedia article should be. Such a common topic should have it's place in an encyclopedia. However, this article does need more than just a "historical close calls" section. --138.89.186.113 23:34, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - this is a common concept, and it is the right term. See <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_III_in_popular_culture_958c.html" title="World War III in popular culture">World War III in popular culture</a> for just some examples of the term's use in science fiction. Remember, an article needing cleanup calls for cleanup tags, not deletion. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 23:41, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
