<p>The 1988 season was a huge one for FK Avala as they gained promotion to the top league in NSW and with this the reputation of the Avala Boys grew.</p>
<p>Situated on the North Bank of the Bonnyrigg Sports Centre (then the Bonnyrigg Serbian Centre), the Avala Boys would create fantastic choreography and support for their beloved football club. On one instance, the match against the Belconnen Blue Devils in 2002 was delayed as the fans lit over 40 flares to celebrate the return of the "Champions".</p>
<p>In the early days of the Avala Boys, the North Bank of the Serbian Centre was a hill and the fans were reknowned for getting "upclose" with opposition players which made the Serbian Centre the toughest ground in the land to come to and grab a point.</p>
<p>After a few lean years with the NSW State League becoming stale, the Avala Boys resurfaced in 2000 as the standard of the league grew. This was a fantastic year for the team and one of the most memorable for the fans as every game was filled with choreography and tifo support.</p>
<p>That year, the Bonnyrigg White Eagles won the championship and the Avala Boys were thanked personally by all players for their fantastic support.</p>

<p>The Avala Boys are also known for their strong ties with the worlds most famous supporter group the Delije of Red Star Belgrade. The Avala Boys who are also referred to Delije Sydney have travelled on numerous occasions to Serbia to support Red Star Belgrade, and in 2001 their dreams came true when Red Star Belgrade travelled to the Serbian Centre to face their club the Bonnyrigg White Eagles.</p>
<p>The Serbian Centre was jam packed, with the Avala Boys situated in the North Bank with some great choreography mixed with flares and banners of support.</p>
<p>They then followed Red Star to the game against Marconi Fairfield which resulted in a number of the fans being ejected after tussles with the police and security.</p>

<p><b>Waypoint Pizza</b> is an authentic pizza shop located in downtown Tiburon, California. It is famous for having celebrities such as Johhny Mosley, Pam Healy, and other Olympians dine at its 15 large tables. It is also a hotspot for kid's birthdays parties in the Belvedere-Tiburon Region because of its kid-friendly menu and party room. It has been providing nourishment since "people began to love pizza." The restaurant is well-known for its Thai-Chicken Pizza and the daily special soup. The menu also includes the world famous cheese pizza, and has a selection of many other options. This restaurant has been profitable since its opening, due partly to the number of tourists who ride the ferries from San Francisco to down-town Tiburon.</p>

SOMA are a 3 piece political/alternative/metal band that formed in the northern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia in january 2006. Members of the band are Laurie Gollan: guitars and vocals, Clint Gatter: drums and Scott Paterson: Bass and Vocals. Laurie and Clint had played in bands together since 2001 but always had bass player issues and in june 2004 decided to go there seperate musical ways. Laurie met Scott in the summer of 2004/2005 and started writing material without a drummer meanwhile, Clint played with several bands but nothting ever became of them due to many reasons. In November 2005 Laurie and Clint re-united and Clint added drums to the music Laurie and Scott had writen earlier that year completing the line-up. After a rocky start due to Clint's commitment to other bands, Clint quit all other musical projects to focus on Soma full time. They recorded a short EP in april 2006 which they recorded live and all first take! Hoping to release there first album/EP in 2007, things are looking good for Soma. With such a strong politcal message and not a moment to soon, They want people to realise they are not slaves to this government. And now in a time where greed, vanity, poverty and blind obedience seem to rule this world, Now is the time people need to open there eyes and change it. Soma have.</p>

<p>Lally was born in South Boston in 1934 and received a degree in electrical engineering. He moved to California and worked with Krafft Ehricke at Convair Astronautice in San Diego. He published papers for the American Rocket Society related to manned spacecraft missions to planets. After having published technical papers related to space travel he was sought after by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of NASA's Caltech. He joined the laboratory and continued to publish. Lally was a member of the initial American Rocket Society Navigation and Guidance Committee along with C. Stark Draper of MIT and two Scientists from the Werner von Braun team of German scientists. In 1961 while at JPL he wrote "Mosaic Guidance for Intreplanetary Travel" in which he proposed a concept to provide all-optical onboard guidance for manned planetary missions in particulat to Mars. The concept used a mosaic of detectors that would continually photograph stars and planets while in the trajectory toward Mars. Rather than the typical inertial and radio tracking guidance, this concept used recorded information from a mosaic image optical sensor in camera form that converted the optical signals from analogue to the digital domain. This concept later was considered the first design of a digital still camera and the "mosaic detectors" were later refered to as "pixels" in 1965 by another JPL scientist. Lally later used this guidance and navigation concept in another American Rocket Society paper titled "To Spin or Not to Spin" in which two major portions of a manned planetary spacecraft on the 9 month trajectory to Mars would seperate and connected by cables be spun to create artificial gravity to protect astronauts from long term weightlessness.The mosaic guidance optical system was located at the center of rotation and provided the guidance and navigation information.</p>

<p><b>Pere Hospital</b> was born in <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girona.html" title="Girona">Girona</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_19.html" title="July 19">July 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/7/1670.html" title="1670">1670</a> and died there on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/5/1758.html" title="1758">1758</a>. He was an Catalan <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basso.html" title="Basso">bass</a> <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singer.html" title="Singer">singer</a> of the Spanish stage and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composer.html" title="Composer">composer</a> of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque_music.html" title="Baroque music">baroque music</a>, including many popular songs. He lived most of his life in England.</p>
<p>In 1695 he became the leading bass singer in the company with which <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Purcell_9056.html" title="Henry Purcell">Henry Purcell</a> worked, playing roles such as the magician Ismeron in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Indian_Queen_a81b.html" title="The Indian Queen">The Indian Queen</a></i>, where he sang the major aria "Ye twice ten hundred deities". After Purcell's death he continued to work for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composer.html" title="Composer">composers</a> <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Purcell_872f.html" title="Daniel Purcell">Daniel Purcell</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremiah_Clarke_69d4.html" title="Jeremiah Clarke">Jeremiah Clarke</a>. Leveridge also began to compose himself, and in February 1699 all three provided music for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Island_Princess_e8e3.html" title="The Island Princess">The Island Princess</a></i>, in which Leveridge's performance was widely acclaimed.</p>
<p>Two books of his songs were published in 1697 and 1699, and his popular theatre songs also appeared as single sheet music. After a spell in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> he returned to London in 1702 for a revival of <i>The Island Princess</i> and a new production of <i><a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth.html" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a></i> billed as "with music Vocal and Instrumental, all new Composed by Mr Leveridge". He sang the role of <a href="../../../h/e/c/Hecate.html" title="Hecate">Hecate</a> in this work for nearly 50 years, and the music remained popular for more than a century after his death.</p>
<p>Leveridge became involved in the new trend for operas in the Italian style from 1705. He then began a short association with <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handel.html" title="Handel">Handel</a> in 1713 to 1714, and acted in the first performances of <i><a href="../../../i/l/_/Il_pastor_fido.html" title="Il pastor fido">Il pastor fido</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/e/s/Teseo.html" title="Teseo">Teseo</a></i> and played Argantes in a revival of <i><a href="../../../r/i/n/Rinaldo_%28opera%29.html" title="Rinaldo (opera)">Rinaldo</a></i>. Later in his career, in 1731, he played the role of Polypheme in the first public performance of <i><a href="../../../a/c/i/Acis_and_Galatea_83e3.html" title="Acis and Galatea">Acis and Galatea</a></i>, and several of Handel's Italian <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aria.html" title="Aria">arias</a> were published with English translations by Leveridge.</p>
<p>In 1714 he moved to work at the new theatre at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln%27s_Inn_Fields_2a4f.html" title="Lincoln's Inn Fields">Lincoln's Inn Fields</a>, managed by entrepreneur <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Rich_acbe.html" title="John Rich">John Rich</a>. Remaining there for most of his career, he returned to his English repertoire and a new form, the musical afterpiece. These lightweight works were often comic, and in 1716 Leveridge produced his own afterpiece, <i><a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramus_and_Thisbe_f206.html" title="Pyramus and Thisbe">Pyramus and Thisbe</a></i>. For this comic parody of Italian opera, he wrote the music, adapting the words from <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream_9a69.html" title="A Midsummer Night's Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></i>, and sang the role of Pyramus.</p>
<p>From the 1720s he was the leading bass at Lincoln's Inn Fields and then at <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Opera_House_72a2.html" title="Royal Opera House">Covent Garden</a>. His repertory exploited his firm and powerful <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_instrumental_music.html" title="Voice instrumental music">voice</a>, and his tunes often became popular favourites. He composed over 150 songs, and is best known for the patriotic ballad "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Roast_Beef_of_Old_England_63f5.html" title="The Roast Beef of Old England">The Roast Beef of Old England</a>".</p>
<p>In between engagements Leveridge ran a coffee shop in Tavistock Street near Covent Garden, but enjoyed good health and reduced his performances only in the last few seasons before retiring in 1751.</p>

<p>He gave proof that made <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Collegiate_School_b8a2.html" title="The Collegiate School">The Collegiate School</a> the oldest operating secondary school in the country. It was once believed to be founded in 1938.</p>
<p>He conducted research into the accuracy of the founding date and found evidence that the school had in fact been founded ten years prior, in 1628, which would make <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Collegiate_School_b8a2.html" title="The Collegiate School">The Collegiate School</a> the oldest secondary school still operating in North America.

<p>History of Gaslight Square Saint Louis, Missouri 1953-1972</p>
<p>Gaslight Square was a compact thriving entertainment district that was far more notorious than Bourbon Street at the time. Original music was everywhere and the streets were lined with packed clubs and restaurants., and after hours coffeehouse discussion still remembered in the new millennium.</p>
<p>Founded by the beatniks of the early 1950's, it was a time before orbiting satellites, the Internet, cell phones and mass electronic media. This generation began questioning traditional majority values in art, literature, and political self expression. Like New York's Greenwich Village, a central hub of The Beat Generation, Gaslight Square in St. Louis supported and helped construct this important alternative American scene. Writers Jack Kerouac and Alan Ginsberg and others traveling coast to coast would make that delibrate stop in St. Louis to witness Gaslight Square.</p>
<p>Gaslight Square was one of the coolest and hippest neighborhoods on earth. Many top entertainers such as The Smothers Brothers, Lenny Bruce, Miles Davis, Barbra Streisand, Jackie Mason, Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Woody Allen, Dick Gregory, Jack E. Leonard, and Phyllis Diller, graced the stages of Gaslight Square early in their careers. The area boasted of live jazz, poetry, great food, Irish dancing, and street cars. It would take a half hour to go 2 blocks by car. Gaslight Square was truly a unique hot area of sophisticated entertainment.</p>
<p>Then Gaslight Square died. This focal point synthesized into a phenomenon that burned brightly for just a few years, was then allowed by lack of political will, police protection, and public apathy to fade, to dim, and to die.</p>
<p>Not a trace of Gaslight Square remains today, aside from the website: www.gaslightsquare.org</p>
<p>Two documentary were produced about Gaslight Square within the last several years. "Gaslight Square The Forgotten Landmark" (Bruce Marren/2002) explores the history by the people who developed the area. Includes interviews with the Smothers Brothers, Jay Landesman, Bob Kuban, and many others.</p>
<p>"Gaslight Square The Legend Lives On" (Bruce Marren/2005) looks at the influence it had on the city, uncovers relics, and what has happened to it today. Includes interviews with Phyllis Diller, Billy Peek, Jonnie King, and many others.</p>

<p>The Baltimore – Washington area is the birth place of a nuber of artist including Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Marvin Gaye, Dru Hill, Mya, and Little Mo’. It is also the home of a number of talened artist and musicians who have either sang background or have done a great deal of studio work. Carronne Jones Grant is such an artist.</p>
<p>Like others, Carronne was raised around family members who were musicians, producers, or National Gospel Recording artist. As a child Carronne fell in love with all of the musical creativity artound her and decided to join her family’s church choir. As she matured mentally and musically, Carronne started to think about pursuing a solo career.</p>
<p>Carronne said “As long as I can remember music has always been a part of my exisistence.”</p>
<p>However, Carronne’s musical career would take a decidedly different route. During and after college Carronne traveled through out the Mid-Atlantic and recorded background vocals or hooks for many of the top producers in the industry. It wasn’t until she competeted in the Rising Star competition sponsored by Vicki Winans that Carronne decided to explore a solo career.</p>
<p>“I had grown accustomed to supporting other artist and helping them tell their stories. However, I did not agressively pursue finding a medium for my story to be told. Although I came in second place in the (Rising Star) competition it reminded me that my story is just as exciting as anyone else’s”, stated Carronne</p>

<p>Ross Keane was born in 1992. He was an only child until his mother and his 2 sisters, paul and john, moved to Albania. He was left with his mother, Kathryn. Kathryn was a vicious man. He used to smash CD's at ross while ross would be talking to his friends. Kathryn also used to throw ross onto the ground and repeatedly jumped on his head. Ross would go into school the next day and his friends would say "What happened Ross?" and Ross would reply "I was playing with my cat". Ross used to get jocked by the teachers in school and the used to stick rulers and pens in him. Ross would then come home to Kathryn and he would beat him.</p>
<p>Ross grew up, with a strange obsession with touching little girls named Kathryn. He would stick rulers inside them and stab them with pens. He would sniff their hair when he was close enough...and then find himself with no teeth left in his mouth. He started reading an auto-biography about Albert Fish and took up his idea's about sticking needles and other things in himself. DJ Patzer made a contribution song to Ross about his troubles, but Ross threw a stereo at him and Ross was in jail for 5 months. Ross did not serve his full 5 years in Jail, but he recorded a song called "Litter tray" and asked DJ patzer to sing it with him. After DJ patzer got his mouth reconstructed, Ross totally forgot about his song about gay-love and moved on to studying the Penis.</p>
<p>Ross has not been heard from in 2 years. His last major stunt was beating a cat to death and strangeling a young girl with his head phones DJ patzer used while he was on tour. Ross is the best example of someone with ADHD. His father died of throat cancer, so Ross says, and Ross half buried his body in a the ground, 4 graves down from former I.R.A. leader Frank Aikon ( type Frank Aikon in search for more details ). Ross also wrote a cook book while he was in jail called "Mein Kochen".</p>
<p>Ross also received a letter from his mother, Ryan, 3 months after he escaped from jail. He complained of having back pains while he crawled under the barbed wire. They found his boxer shorts hanging on a stick in the french forest "Bastogne" (type Bastogne in search for more details).</p>
<p>Overall, his life was unsucessfull, a shit career, and a crapo lifestyle.</p>
<p><br />
The End.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-16_463a.html" title="Edit section: The Higher">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Higher</span></h2>
<p>few years can make a big difference—and no one knows that better than the Higher. Just one year ago the group were despondent: they were unsure about their line-up and didn't feel like the music they were playing fully represented their eclectic tastes. However, instead of calling it quits the band decided to take fate into their own hands and change all of that. "We've always been fans of R&amp;B and pop and I think as we got older we appreciate it more," says guitarist Tom about the band's motivation to incorporate more of those elements into their music. "We just can't wait for people to hear this album."</p>
<p>Originally formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2002, the band have undergone a massive reinvention since their debut full-length Histronics dropped in 2005. "I feel like this record definitely represents the Higher better than the last record," drummer Pat explains about On Fire, which was recorded earlier this year in Beverly Hills with Mike Green (Paramore, The Matches). "With this record we were really able to focus on writing the songs to the best of our ability," he continues. "We found our zone and just went from there, you know?"</p>
<p>Although On Fire's upbeat amalgam of emo, punk and R&amp;B may catch some listener's off guard, there's enough diversity on the album to please everyone from Jawbreaker to Justin Timberlake. The infectious opening single "Insurance?" is a bonafide dance-floor anthem; "Guts" is a guitar-driven rock song that explores the group's darker side; and with its glitchy beat and stuttering synths, Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy's remix of "Pace Yourself" is guaranteed to get even the most jaded hipster out on the floor.</p>
<p>"It really feels like we have a fresh start," says Tom, crediting the band's newfound positivity to last year's addition of guitarist Reggie and their new home on Epitaph. "When he joined, he made us realize that we had the freedom to do whatever we wanted with our music," he continues. "We're fresh as babies now. We're ready." While the songs on On Fire are familiar enough to appease dedicated fans of the Higher, in many ways the band have transcended their roots and created something wholly unique in a landscape dominated by mediocrity.</p>
<p>The Higher have already converted Epitaph founder Brett Gurewitz (who signed the band after seeing them perform just once) as well as fans all over the world—and now it's your turn to get turned onto the Higher. Oh, and if you don't dig it, well, that's cool, too. "There's definitely going to be kids who hate it and there's definitely going to be kids who love it—but I think even those kids who hate it are secretly going to fall asleep listening to it," Tom says about punk purists' potential reaction to On Fire's soul jams. "I just think people should have an open mind and be ready for something different."</p>

<p>"Hellp" follows an eclectic group of characters whose goal is to stabilize and rebuild a better city out of the rubble left by Hurricane Katrina. The residents interviewed tell story's of a violent police force, lack of outreach from Red Cross, gentrification, an apathetic government and a poorly organized FEMA. To overcome these hurdles, a group of collectives dubbed, "Common Ground" forms to provide immediate and free shelter, food, legal assistance and a medical clinic. This documentary challenges the viewer to see the social injustice and lack of government effectiveness in modern day America and offers an age-old example to remedy the problem.</p>

<p>well Callum Thomas Spencer started breathing on 26th September 1990. He looks through brown chestnut eyes and brushes dark brown locks. He loves Emma Bull and lives for the moments that take his breath away. Not for the moments he wishes to forget. His one true love is Bj even though for a significant part of his life she fell in love with another person. That man was Jose-Maria Olazabal. Callum never forgave him for that and placed a curse on his family ever since the day he found his wife in bed with him.</p>

&lt;The number one trillion is between 1000000000001 (one trillion and one) and 999999999999 (nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine). One trillion is a number that is one-thousand times larger than one billion and one million times more than one million. It is rarely used in math for its impractical size. An example of how impractical it is, if someone lived for one trillion seconds they would live for 31,476 years! As you can see 10000000000000 (one trillion) is a large number. This also gives a pretty good idea about how much the United States Government pays each year.&gt;
