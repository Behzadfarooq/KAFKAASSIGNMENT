A cole hole is a slang word for a type of face or a certain way that a person is acting. The face is when they are making "the cole hole face" they are holding back a smile trying to prove that they are too reserved to smile. The certain way that a person is acting depends on the name of that person, their name needs to be Coleman or Cole, and they have to be acting in an annoying manner.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-25_0f15.html" title="Edit section: Mark Prothero, Esq.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mark Prothero, Esq.</span></h2>
<p>Mark Prothero is an American attorney. He became famous after serving as the lead defense counsel for confessed Green River Killer Gary Ridway. In 2006, Prothero published a book entitled <i>Defending Gary</i>, which details his experience serving as Ridgway's lawyer.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Early Life</b></p>
<p>Mark Prothero was born in Seattle, Washington. He grew up in the Seattle area, where his family ran a world-famous boat building business. After an illustrious high school swimming career (in which he represented the United States at foreign competitions in Argentina, France, and Holland), he was awarded a scholarship to the University of Washington. He received his B.A. in History from U-Dub in 1978. After completing his undergraduate education, Prothero attended law school at the University of San Diego.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Legal Career</b></p>
<p>After earning his Juris Doctor from the University of San Diego, Prothero returned to Washington State. He initially handled civil and criminal cases in private practice. After discovering that his passion lay in criminal defense work, he joined the Associate Counsel for the Accused (ACA), which provides legal representation for indigent defendants in King County, Washington. In 1987, Prothero moved into the felony unit of ACA. He eventually became an expert in forensic DNA, offender sentencing, and the death penalty.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Green River Case</b></p>
<p>From 1982 through 1985, dozens of young women, most of whom were known prostitutes, turned up dead or missing in King County, Washington. These deaths and disappearances were attributed to the so-called "Green River Killer," because the first five victims were found in or around the Green River. For almost twenty years, law enforcement officials were unable to identify the person who was responsible for the Green River murders. Despite the formation of a task force and the allocation of tens of millions of dollars, neither lead-detective Dave Reichert nor any other law enforcement official was able to arrest the ellusive slayer.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2001, however, science was able to the job that law enforcement never could. DNA evidence which was found in or on four of the Green River murder victims was matched to a long-standing suspect in the case: Gary Leon Ridgway. Ridgway, a truck painter from Auburn, Washington with a measured I.Q. of 85, was charged with being the man who had thoroughly confouded Dave Reichert and a myriad of other law enforcement "authorities" for almost two decades. After Ridgway's arrest on November 30, 2001, Mark Prothero was appointed to serve as his lead defense attorney. Prothero first met Ridgway on the night of November 30, 2001, at the Regional Justice Center in Kent, Washington.</p>
<p>As he details in <i>Defending Gary</i>, Prothero was initially incredulous that the mild-mannered, self-effacing Ridgway could be the infamous Green River Killer. Over the course of the next two years though, Prothero would come to know a diametrically different side of Ridgway. After negotiating a plea bargain - whereby Ridgway would give authorities information about his crimes and lead them to his victims' bodies which had never been found - Prothero sat through months of interviews with Ridgway. During these interviews, which were conducted by detectives from the King County Sheriff's Department, special agents of the FBI, and psychiatists, Ridgway confessed to being the Green River Killer and gave a horrifying account of his homicial activities over the previous two decades. As a result of his confessions, the bodies of several Green River victims were found. Most of these victims had been missing for decades, and probably never would have been found without the plea agreement Prothero and his collegues brokered for Ridgway. This plea agreement spared Ridgway from the death penalty if he confessed to his crimes and give authorities details about them. The interviews with Ridgway streched well into the autumn of 2003.</p>
<p>On November 5, 2003, Mark Prothero stood at Gary Ridgway's side as he pleaded guilty to forty-eight counts of aggravated murder. In December 2003, Ridgway was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for his crimes. Without the tireless efforts of Prothero and his colleagues, Ridgway would almost certainlly have been sentenced to die for the Green River murders.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Current Life</b></p>
<p>After wrapping up Washington v. Ridgway, Prothero joined the Kent, Washington law firm of Hanis Greaney PLLC. When he's not defending clients, Prothero is the coach of the Kentwood High School girl's swim team. Just as when he was a swimmer himself, Prothero is a highly regarded, award winning swim coach.</p>
<p>Mark Prothero lives in King County, Washington with his wife, Kelly. They have two children</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-25_0f15.html" title="Edit section: milky spore (Bacillus popillae-Dutky)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">milky spore (Bacillus popillae-Dutky)</span></h2>
<p>The bacterial milky diseases (commonly called Milky Spore) is a naturally occurring host specific bacterium (Bacillus popillae-Dutky), of the white grubs of Japanese Beetles.</p>
<p>The adult Japanees beetles pupate in the July time frame (in the North East US) and feed on flowers and leaves of shrubs and garden plants. During this adult stage the beetles also mate and the females lay eggs in the soil in late July early August. The eggs hatch soon afterwards and in this larval or grub stage, they feed on the roots of grass and other plants. As the weather gets cooler and winter approaches the grubs go deeper in the soil and feeding declines as they over-winter.</p>
<p>In this August time frame when the grubs are close to the surface and actively feeding they are vulnerable to infestation by Milky Spore. This is also the optimal time frame for turf inoculation or applications with Milky Spore to increase Milky Spore in the soil environment (there are product specific guidlines that should be followed for Milky Spore application).</p>
<p>Resident spores in the soil are swallowed by grubs during their normal pattern of feeding on roots. This ingestion of the spore by the host activates reproduction of the bacteria inside the grub. Within 7-21 days the grub will eventually die and as the grub decomposes, billions of new spores are released into the soil.</p>
<p>Milky Spore in the soil is not harmful to beneficial insects, birds, bees, pets or man; and Milky Spore like other bacteria is highly survivable in cold and drought conditions.</p>

<p>VULCAN, who ranks among the earliest graffiti pioneers, doesn’t like to divulge many personal details – preferring to let his artwork speak for itself. For a long time -- and even today -- VULCAN tight-roped between a brand of genius that landed him in the lecture halls of Harvard and Columbia, and a prolific street art career that earned him police warrants for destruction of public property. Outside of a select few police precincts, photographs of VULCAN remain harder to come by than a bottomless spray can.</p>
<p>His mythology extends beyond the writing world and into the spheres of other artful outlaws. VULCAN has raced motorcycles professionally, produced music, and even sang in heavy metal bands. In fact, when he was singing for various New York metal bands in the early 80s, VULCAN is rumored to have had a vocal range broader than that of Queensryche’s Geoff Tate, whose voice has been described as “operatic.”</p>
<p>“VULCAN is one of the most interesting and talented artists I’ve ever met,” says John Doffing, founder of underground art gallery START SOMA. “He knows that he’s a legend to the new generation of kids. The best analogy I can offer is musical: VULCAN is the Robert Johnson of graffiti. His work offers raw emotion, edginess, and amazing technical prowess.”</p>
<p>“Many of the younger writers are like the Eddie Van Halens of the graffiti world: clean, palatable, white, and sometimes sponsored by corporations. I have seen countless street artists of truly global acclaim walk up to VULCAN at art shows and tell him ‘I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing if it weren’t for you.’ That’s the kind of impact he has had.”</p>

<p>The Leftwich Trophy, also known as the Leftwich Award, is a trophy given for outstanding leadership and is an award presented annually in memory of Lieutenant Colonel William Groom Leftwich, U.S. Marine Corps, who was killed in action in the Republic of Vietnam in November 1970.</p>
<p>Eligible nominees are Marine Captains in the Ground Combat Arms serving on active duty as a company or battery commander with the ground forces of the Fleet Marine Force at the time of nomination. Posthumous awards can be made of this award providing nomination complies with all the criteria for receiving the award.</p>
<p>Selection is done by a board of senior officers chaired by the Deputy Commandant of Plans, Policy and Operations (DC,PP&amp;O), who then after reviewing the applicants, makes recommendation to the Commandant of the Marine Corps for his final approval.</p>
<p>The trophy is provided to the Marine Corps through an endowment by the H. Ross Perot Foundation. LtCol Leftwich and Mr. Perot were classmates at the U.S. Naval Academy. The trophy itself was designed by Mr. Felix de Welden, designer of the Marine Corps War Memorial in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The Leftwich Trophy, a replica of the statue commemorating the service and leadership of Lieutenant Colonel William G. Leftwich, was first presented in June 1979 at the commissioning ceremony for the USS Leftwich.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong><br />
The brainchild of brothers Ian and Andrew, PTS was born during the summer of 2005. The brothers began writing upon Ian's return from Europe, united by divine blood and a strong belief in cookies. The backbone was then put in place through the recruitment and long courting process of Mike Cochrane (he's a dainty one...), a good friend of Ian's and perhaps the finest bassist in the KW region. Initially unknown to the three, the central nucleus of the band would travel a distance of many Zerlongs to join the band. From a far off galaxy (St. Catherines is another galaxy, right?) Michael Janzen stepped up to provide rhythmic solitude. For most bands, two Michaels would be difficult to handle, but PTS is up to the task. Together, they shall fight the good fight for mankind.<br />
<br />
<strong>Current Lineup:</strong><br />
Andrew Leipurts (vocals, guitar, programming)<br />
Ian Leipurts (vocals, guitar, keys)<br />
Mike Cochrane (vocals, bass)<br />
Mike Janzen (drums, percussion)<br />
<br />
<strong>Discography:</strong><br />
Pace The Stairs is currently working on their upcoming full length album.</p>

Eventually the experimental soldiers were relegated to stasis fields and work was begun on a new type of warrior: the clone commando. Fixer is part of the Delta squad. From the Republic Commando game. Fixer is the Mechanic/fighter.</p>

<p>Bravely bold Sir Hakker rode forth from Camelot. He was not afraid to die, oh brave Sir Hakker. He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways, brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Hakker. He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp, or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken. To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away, and his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Hakker. His head smashed in and heart cut out, and his liver removed, and his bowels unplugged, and his nostrils ripped and his bottom burned off and his penis...</p>
<p>Well that's enough music for now chaps.</p>

<p>Faffing (in the UK) is timewasting done inadvertently. Leaving the house can cause faffing - returning for keys, phone, wallet, checking the garage door is locked, checking the door is locked, coming back into the house for a CD to listen to in the car, etc etc. It is usually seen to cause irritation in others, eg "stop faffing! we've got to get to the airport!"</p>

<p>Karl Jarres was a German Presidential candidate in the 1925 Presidential election, standing as a joint candidate for the German People's Party and the German National People's Party, these both centre-right parties. Although a good politician, he was deemed as too dull a character to be an effective President, and was beaten by both Wilhelm Marx and the eventuall president Paul von Hindenburg.</p>

The young MONCKTON, has the advantage to have the help of his sister (Rosa) and brother in law (Dominic Lawson). Rosa LAWSON-MONCKTON had an important mission to keep an eye on Lady DI. (See Euro-Business 5 June 1999) Dominic Lawson, now editor of the Sunday-Telegraph, had an important role in furnishing journalistic credentials for serving MI6 Intelligence Officers. It's not clear whether the MI6 officers had only a need for cover in English society or whether they were pretending to be journalists in hot spots like Yougoslavia.]</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-25_0f15.html" title="Edit section: Pit of Horror">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pit of Horror</span></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.pitofhorror.com" class="external text" title="http://www.pitofhorror.com" rel="nofollow">Pit of Horror</a>was originally founded by Rich Carlin. After establishing a friendship with Petch Lucas and realising his talent for writing, Petch was onboard within a week as a full partner. As the website grew it was evident that we required another webmaster and full partner to help us push the website forward: in comes, John Gray. Long term friend of us both and movie buff extraordinaire; from Dallas, Texas. The three amigos have ensembled (Enjoy the party)...</p>
<p>The actual site (and forum sister site) is predominantly maintained by myself on a technical basis, however, John Gray is responsible for all promotional activity whether it be contests for the readers of the site or official movie screenings in the Texas area. Petch on the other hand, has contributed a wealth of reviews (some interviews and other written content) to the site, since 1998. That said, we all contribute written reviews and interviews to the website as and when we can. It really is a joint effort and alot of hard work on all our parts to keep this site running and interesting and in that latter respect we hope we have achieved something.</p>
<p>The PIT has really, truly become a huge part of our lives and there probably should really be ten people working on the site, not three, but currently we are striving to give our readers regular updates and opportunities to win some great DVD releases, soundtracks and other merchandise pertaining to our beloved horror genre!</p>
<p>In 2004 we decided it was time to begin expanding our online forum community. We have been known, since establishing the Pit, as having a great forum with intellectual and engaging discussion. And although it was, at first, a very tight knit group of regulars, as the Pit's popularity grew, so naturally did the number of members. It was time for a change and we decided it was best to seperate the forum from the website entirely, so as to allow more potential for both. And <a href="http://www.gutsandgory.com" class="external text" title="http://www.gutsandgory.com" rel="nofollow">Guts and Gory</a> was born. However, there was a twist. Since Fangoria WOH 2004 in NJ, we really took everything up a gear with the PIT. We even helped arrange for Ari Lehman (Little Jason) to appear as a guest at the convention. And after meeting up with Andrew Bryniarski I took on development of his official website. And the concept was born. "Why not host all their forums in the same place?".</p>
<p>As time went on we added more and more official celebrity forums, making G&amp;G like a kind of all year round online convention, where fans can pose questions or even in some cases heavily interact with some of their heroes. All from the comfort of their own homes. Now we have many forums set up and the site has become a huge wealth of information where you can learn information you can't find anywhere else on the web about the actors, stuntmen, directors and writers we have as honoured members of G&amp;G. The traffic on the forums is currently through the roof as we struggle to attain enough disk space to keep everything running smoothly. Hundreds of thousands of posts have been made since May 2004 with new members joining everyday. And that all said, we have more forums in the pipeline that will simply blow your mind!</p>
<p>In closing, it is a special time for the site and it's fan base. And we thank you for supporting the site from the bottom of our hearts. We'd also like to thank Royce Freeman, Sam Austin, Eric E. Scott, Cody Hamman and James Majure who have helped contribute material to the website at some time or another over the years, since November 1998. Thank you.</p>

<p>The Winter Knights is the 2nd story about Quint in the Edge Chronicles.</p>

<p><b>== Synopsis ==</b> Soon after repelling the Gloamglozer, Linius Pallitax, finally dies. Quint and Maris are struck by this. Quint was Linius' apprentice, thus allowing him to join the Knight's Academy. Just after Linius' funeral, snow starts to fall upon Sanctaphrax (this becomes more relevant in the book). Soon after Linius' funeral, Wind Jackel (Quint's father), takes Quint to see the Supreme Most High Academes. He is then confronted with another boy, Vilnix Pompolnius (Vil Spatweed), and soon learns that the Professors of Light and Darkness, (Supreme Most High Academes) are sponsoring both Quint and Vilnix to join the Knights Academy. Soon after they join Quint makes good progress and makes a few friends, while Vilnix does not, causing much friction between the 2. After some time, it seems the Leader of the Knights Academy (Hax Vollix), "senses" that a great storm is approaching. The snow has grown heavier, and he suspects Stormphrax from the great storm will end this. Fearing that Earth Scholars have something to do with it, he purges 3 of the high masters in the academy. Then later, he sends many Stormchasers to get Stormphrax, many perish, and soon everyone is uncertain of Hax's decision. Quint, Phin, Raffix and Stope (Quint's 3 friends), soon discover that Hax is qrong, and the only way to stop the Winter is to "give back to the sky" with Stormphrax. After quite a long time in the Knights Academy, Vilnix gets a hold of a letter to Quint from Maris (Linius' only daughter). He then fores Quint's writing and gets Maris to come to Sanctaphrax. Posing as Quint's friend, he tells Quint to meet Maris. Quint's 3 friends save him and Maris in time, and they go together and give Stormphrax into a "Cloudeater". They return, and everything is as it was; eventually Wind Jackel returns, and Quint leaves Sanctaphrax with Maris.</p>

<p>WSOD (White Screen Of Death) is the most annoying thing to happen on the forum of Football 365. It involves pages not loading and being replaced with White Screens (Of Death). The original time for the WSOD was 11:08pm but lately this have moved to 11:16pm. It is very annoying.</p>

<p><br />
Banana-48 (2006-2006) was a great band of it's time with a punk pop sound. According to the members, the band's sound was unmatched and greatly superior to any other band in the year of 2006. Founded by lead guitarist, Crosby (1986-2013), whose first name is unknown, the band's name is highly regarded by many as the most original name for a band of any rock band to ever come out of Baton Rouge, LA. Other members of the band were Bonner, on drums, and Hartmann, on bass. It is also speculated that Crosby was the only member of the band to ever own his respective instrument, but could possibly be only speculation.</p>
<p>The band was formed in the early part of 2006 and has the same sound as their inspiration, Blink-182. The name 'Banana-48' refers to a joke made by Crosby to a girl in a bowling alley in his home town of Baton Rouge. Crosby talks of the name of the band on rare occasions, but he once said, "I didn't really know what to call my new band. I wanted people to really wonder 'what the hell does that mean?' when first hearing about our band name. Well, all three of us band members were bowling with our friends and no one was saying anything. So I looked over at the girl sitting next to me who I will refer to as 'S' for what was shown on the bowling screen representing the first letter of her name. I looked over and said 'Hey, uhhh, you have a vagina right?' and she replied, 'What do you think?'. I proceeded to ask her if she had ever peeled a banana and put it in her vagina and then eaten it. I was going to call our band 'Banana' but I thought that was a pussy name so I did what every great band with a shitty name does. I put a number behind it and it became a great name." There are many different speculations as to why the number 48 was put behind the name 'Banana'. Some people think it is how many seconds one of their friends went to class before she stopped going all together. Others think it is how many times Bassit, Hartmann will wear his LSU t-shirt in a two month period. There have been rumors that it is how many hours that drummer, Bonner works in a two day period. However in a rare outing at a restaraunt before the viewing a movie involving an aircraft, a terrible plot, and a nipple/penis sucking snake, Crosby was overheard by a deaf person that the 48 represented nothing more than numbers on a phone that were chosen for the letters 'I and V', thought to represent 'In Vagina'. This would make an alternate name for the band 'Banana In Vagina'.</p>
<p>The band's jam sessions were infamous among those who knew the members. Through the long hours of the night, Crosby could be found hooked up to his amp and trying out new songs, Bonner could be found sleeping, and Hartmann could be found masturbating at his house. Crosby once said of the sessions, "You can't teach this kind of dedication. All three of us put in a lot of hard work and practice in our late night sessions."</p>
<p>Banana-48 was thought to be a well thought out band. The members of the band were said to have thought out every part of their career before recording their first song. Crosby scouted out everything from their first single to their much anticipated breakup that no one else seemed to see coming. Their first album was untitled in every aspect. In fact if you did not know already that this was a Banana-48 album, you would not have known it at all. The album cover consisted of no words at all. The album title and the band name were conspicuously left off of the album all together. All that was on the album was an animated sheep with a screw in its anus. This is humorous to the band members. While on first look at the album cover, you might think that the album says 'Screw Sheep'. The band has officially annouced that they have nothing against sheep at all and the they support sheep in their fight against those trying to sheer them. To further show their point, the members of Banana-48 banned themselves from ever wearing anything with wool. Drummer, Bonner also stated that he would "take a gun to anyone wearing wool, take of their clothes, and paste it on the nearest sheep." This might have been taken out of context though. The title of the album being was misunderstood by many people. The album was meant to be 'Screw Ewe'. A female sheep can also be called a ewe. This is a play on words, meaning that 'Ewe' would be substituted with 'You'. The album title would then be 'Screw You'. The members of the band also found this humorous. The band members thought it best and most humorous to just leave the album cover as the picture. Crosby said that they thought about just leaving the album title with the words, 'Screw Ewe'. This was thrown out the window however because the term Ewe can be used to describe both female sheep and a member of a people of Togo and Ghana, in western Africa. While the band members think that it is funny concept to screw a sheep, no member of the band wants to have relations with a memeber of a tribe in western Africa. Not even in a humorous way. When asked about the subject, Hartmann says, "Look I've seen porn from tribes in Togo and Ghana, and trust me, you don't want to screw with them."</p>
<p>The band's first album 'Screw Ewe' had many singles. The first single off of the album was entitled 'Drum Solo'. The ironic thing however is that this song did not have one drum in it. There were many different instruments (over 35) but no drum could be found. It is said that the harp solo in this song is the greatest harp solo in the history of punk rock. There were many different bonus tracks, each with there own sound. When looking at the track listing of the album, it looks as if there are only 12 tracks on the album. However, when including the bonus tracks, the album spans to 70 tracks total. The last track on the album is the song entitled 'We could have made this CD 69 tracks and thought that it was funny but we are tired of all of the shitty 69 and sex jokes out there'. This quite possibly one of the longest song titles ever, competing with Fall Out Boy. Track 70 on the album consists of the band members speaking the title to a single note. Ironically, track 69 only consists of the band members laughing uncontrollably and speaking "Track 69...like sex". One of the most popular of the bonus tracks is the song 'Poop In Vagina'. Fans often wonder why this song was left out of being one of the main tracks. When playing track 14, 'Polo shirts for pricks', backwards on the record, a secret message of which the band has denied doing on purpose exists, stating "Myspace is fucking stupid". The band states that they had nothing to do with this, but they do not have a myspace of their own and their is no myspace for the band.</p>
<p>The second album was almost finished when the band decided to call it quits. The second album was speculated to be absolutely blank. They would market the CD as if it were a simple CD-R. Lead member, Crosby claims, "Even if people didn't like our music, which is pretty unbelievable, they would buy the CD-R and be stuck with it." The band's internet website, which is now down, had different CD art that could be printed by fans.</p>
<p>Banana-48 was known to be very innovative. They had many plans for what lied in the future. They was talk that on their tour, they would start each show by coming down from the ceiling, upside down, playing their intruments for their opening song. Crosby said on the matter, "Yeah the drum set and the amps would be mounted to the ceiling and we would be strapped in and would come down for one song, most likely playing 'In The Out Hole'. We practiced it a couple of times, but by the sixth guitar solo in the song our noses started bleeding." The band members all managed to stay conscious during the practices. The band also decided to take a page out of Blink-182 and their music video for 'What's My Age Again?'. On the topic of the video, Bonner said, "Yeah, think 'What's My Age Again?', only the uncensored version available online somewhere." There were thoughts that the internet might be overloaded by girls of all ages trying to download this video as soon as it came out.</p>
<p>The band is now on permanent hiatus. The band's downfall came as a result of one of the members not wanting to play his instrument, stating that "it is too boring. All you do is pick 4 strings and it all just sounds the same." The band refuses to state which of the members this statement came from however. It is however the same member who once suggested that instead of placing the screw in the sheep's anus on the first album cover, they should just place screws all over the sheep. This however was shot down by the other members of the band and everyone else around. Producer, Andrew Davis states, "It really is a shame, those guys had a great sound." Since their breakup, the band refuses to talk about the band in any detail, only stating "We all had a great time with this thing and we wish that it could have gone longer." The members of the band do however still have their all night jam sessions, each perfecting the skill stated earlier in this article. It is a rumor that someone has offered each member of the band one dollar to get back together for one last show, but the members have denied any statement and have said, "We would not do it even for two dollars. We're done. Like The Beatles. Only we're all alive. Except for Crosby who is dead in 2013."</p>
<p>Life after the band has been good to all members. It is understood that all three members still talk occasionally and all attend the same college. Producer, Andrew Davis was so broken up over the loss however that he has decided to leave his home. He once said, "Look, I don't want to talk about the band anymore. They were my life and now they are broken up. It's like a piece of me has just died. I have played 'Poop In Vagina' 680 times on my iPod, but now I'm going to erase it. I don't want anything to do with this band again. That's why I'm leaving. At least in Canada no one has ever heard of Banana-48."</p>

<p><b>type A</b> magazine is a quarterly magazine published in Toledo, Ohio, that focuses on issues relevent to the Toledo anarchist community. It publishes local, regional, and national news, as well as commentary, stories, reviews, and interviews of interest to the anarchist community.</p>
<p>type A has been in publication since August, 2004.</p>
<p>The magazines name seems to suggest both what "type" of magazine it is, with the letter "A" being a traditional anarchist symbol, and also seems to be a play on the word "type" as referring to the fact that it is a typed, print publication.</p>
<p>The type A collective, which publishes the magazine, is an anonymous anarchist collective. The group's politics lean toward a sort of post-left, green, insurrectionary, anarchism but also show some situationist influence at times. The group created headlines when it issued what seemed to be an ultimatum to Toledo Mayor Jack Ford regarding a visit by a neo-Nazi group in December, 2005. type A was named in a subsequent injunction and their letter to the mayor used as justification for the suspension of most civil liberties in the city of Toledo, similar to a martial law situation, for a period of two weeks following the Nazi visit. The type A collective continues to work as a voice for much of the anarchist community in the Toledo area and is a frequent contributor to independent news sites, such as Infoshop and Indymedia.</p>

<p>A kid named Kenny and his pet chimp, Chimpy, ring someone's doorbell. They are answered by mad scientist Professor Triple-Extra Large, who has a mutated lobster claw replacing his arm. He thinks Kenny can's clean and Chimpy can, and that the two of them are brothers. He orders Chimpy to clean his labratory while he goes to "defeat" the PTA, which he hates. Chimpy is spilling all his experiments and Kenny tries to stop him but makes more of a mess. He spills something on him and his head turns into a pig's head, and he calls a hospital for help, but then realizes Prof. Triple-Extra Large has an antidote hanging up on the wall. He is better, but then he spills something else on him and his head turns into a famous jazz singer's head, who can's stop singing jazz music, and he calls for help at the same hospital. He is cured, then ends up messing up the lab and is naked when Prof. Triple-Extra Large comes back, mad at the PTA for stealing his claw. Then a pizza Kenny ordered arrived and everyone chases after him.</p>

<p><b>Frances "Fanny" Fulbright</b>, known by he codename <b>Numbuh 86</b>, is a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional character</a> and Head of Decommissioning of the Kids Next Door. This is a pun, as when some is 86'ed, they are put out of commission. She often wears a green uniform and helmet made from a colander, connotating the appearance of a drill instructor. She first appeared in Op F.U.G.I.T.I.V.E., as a girl who speaks with a Scottish highland accent, generally berates ineffective operatives with the notable exception of any females (she is a sexist against boys), and she seems to take an almost sadistic pleasure in her job. She has been known to take the credit for certain operations even where her involvement was minimal (Op F.U.G.I.T.I.V.E.). She seems not to be well liked within the organization (after turning into an Irish Setter in Op G.R.A.D.U.A.T.E.S. one of the Numbuh 44's remarked "that figures"), and has admitted to not having any friends (with the exception of Numbuh Three and formerly the traitorous Numbuh 12). Her favored weapon (as seen in Op END) is the M.U.S.K.E.T., while her preferred mode of transport is the D.O.H.D.O.H.. Her mother's nickname for her, as revealed in Op S.L.U.M.B.E.R., is 'my little fannykin'. Another of her parents' nicknames for her are their little Fannypants. It has also been revealed she thinks Numbuh 4 is cute in Op E.N.D. and has a brief romantic relationship with Numbuh 19th Century in C.A.K.E.D-F.I.V.E., she even kissed him (neither boy remembers since they were both decommissioned shortly afterward). It is possible she buries herself in her thankless occupation to make up for her lack of companionship. She went to kindergarten with Numbuh One. It has been revealed in Op D.A.D.D.Y. that her father is Mr. Boss, and that she has two brothers named Paddy {a.k.a. Numbuh 85} and Shaunie, although her brothers' names went unrevealed until Op. D.A.D.D.Y. She refers to her brothers as idiots. Until Op D.A.D.Y. she didn't know Mr. Boss was a villain and Mr. Boss didn't know she was a KND operative. In Op Z.E.R.O. Numbuh 362 gives her the position of Tactical Operative instead of Numbuh 1. Voiced by <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Hale_eb05.html" title="Jennifer Hale">Jennifer Hale</a>.</p>

<p>Prusten is a sound made by the tiger, also known as chuffing. It is a low-frequency equivalent to the purring found in domesticated cats. The tiger's mouth is closed and it blows through the nostrils, producing a breathy snort. This sound is non-threatening and often used when two tigers encounter each other on neutral territory, or between courting pairs. Mother tigers use it to their cubs as a form of reassurance. It has been known for tigers held in captivity to use this sound to keepers. Prusten is a German word. It means to sneeze or snort.</p>

<p>Flory Van Donck was born on 23 June 1912 in Tervueren, Belgium. Until the advent of Severiano Ballesteros and Bernhard Langer in the late 1970's, Van Donck was considered the greatest golf player ever produced by Continental Europe. Van Donck's fame rested on his great putting ability, though his style was unorthodox as he kept the toe of his putter in the air, similar to Isao Aoki.</p>
<p><br />
Van Donck won his own national title 16 times between 1935 and 1968, and held most of the national titles in Europe at one time or another, including the Dutch Open (1936, 1937, 1951, 1953), the French Open (1954, 1957, 1958), The German Open (1953, 1956) and the Swiss Open (1953, 1955). He was second in the British Open in 1956 and 1959.</p>

<p>intimacy to me means a sharing between two people of individual feelings and being accepted by the opppisite partner. intimacy is the communication of beliefs that an individual holds and when expressed to another may be rejected or dismissed. intimacy is the expression of inner dialogue that a person has but has yet to share with others. intimacy also occurs at a broader level as within groups. intimacy can only develope with acceptance from the receiving partner, intimacy dies with unacceptance from the other partner wheter it be an individual or group</p>
