<p>Defence Scheme No.1 was a plan created by Canadian Director of Military Operations and Intelligence James "Buster" Brown, for a counter-invasion of the United States. Defence Scheme No.1 was created in 1921 and details a surprise attack on the northern U.S. at the first sign of an American invasion of Canada. According to the plan, Canadian troops would immediately be sent to blitz Seattle, Washington; Great Falls, Montana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Albany, New York. Sould the attack be driven back, the Canadians would retreat to their own borders, destroying bridges and railroads to hinder any retailiation by the Americans. The sole purpose of the counter-invasion would be to buy time for Canada to prepare her war effort and to recieve aid from her British allies. Reportedly, Brown himself did reconaissance for the plan. Defence scheme No.1 serves as a counter part to The American's War Plan Red, a plan to invade Canada, drawn up in 1930.</p>

<p>The Cultural Center of the Philippines is the premiere institution for culture and the arts in the country. It embodies the highest standards of excellence and has services, which are responsive to the Filipino and the world.</p>
<p><br />
The inauguration of the Cultural Center of the Philippines in 1969 gave the arts a home. The CCP was created in 1966 through Executive Order No. 30 with the purpose of promoting and preserving Filipino arts and culture. It was formally inaugurated on September 8, 1969. Since its establishment, the CCP has sought to embody its logo of katotohanan (truth), kagandahan (beauty) and kabutihan (goodness).</p>
<p>The CCP is presently attached to the Office of the President and is under the umbrella of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as stipulated in Executive Order No. 80</p>
<p>The CCP showcases Filipino artistic achievements, encourages the creation of original works inspired by Filipino themes and tradition and helps makes the arts accessible to all sectors of Philippine society.</p>
<p>It initiates and supports the establishment of regional or local cultural centers in cooperation with local groups and brings together its own resident artists and other artists from the various regions through the CCP Outreach Program.</p>
<p>Several companies representing the different arts reside within the CCP. There are four resident dance companies: Ballet Philippines, Philippine Ballet Theater, the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company and the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group. The Tanghalang Pilipino is the CCP's resident theater company. The CCP's resident music companies are the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra, also the Philippines' national orchestra, the UST Symphony Orchestra, the Philippine Madrigal Singers and the Music Competitions for Young Artists Foundation (NAMCYA).</p>
<p>The CCP also covers film and broadcast arts, as well as the literary and visual arts, encouraging the growth of aspiring artists in these fields through numerous workshops, seminars, anthologies, exhibits, symposia as well as competition and awards.</p>
<p>Through the Cultural Exchange Program, the CCP supports the growth and development of arts councils all over the country through relevant workshops and seminars. In addition, the CCP also established ties with various international organizations. Through exchange programs with these groups, Filipinos have been able to glimpse the beauty and diversity of cultures around the world.</p>
<p>Today, the CCP envisions itself to the home of people-centered arts, than embodies artistic excellence, promotes Filipino aesthetics and nurtures cultural values, social responsibilities and national identity.</p>

<p>Fructosuria is the deficiency of fructokinase. Which means that ingested fructose is unable to enter glycolysis the quick and normal route. instead it is metabolised by the hexokinase pathway, leading to a high concentration of fructose in the blood and fructose accumulation in the urine. tends to be common in Jews.</p>

<p>The world's oldest operating transportation monorail operates in the Ruhr district of Germany. A special preview run was held for the Kaiser on October 24, 1900. The "Schwebebahn" opened to the public on March 1st, 1901. During the 19th century, the towns of Barmen, Elberfeld and Vohwinkel were growing rapidly and some sort of transit system was needed. Since a good portion of the line would be above the Wupper River, conventional elevated rail was not the ideal choice. Eugen Langen, an engineer of nearby Cologne, had successfully tested a double-track monorail system. The leaders of the towns were impressed with the technology and selected it. Construction began in 1898, 100 years before our website debuted. The original monorail cars were revolutionary in rail design in that they were the first all-steel transit vehicles. The trains actually swing freely beneath the track. Still, the trains never bank more than a comfortable 15 degrees. The name "Schwebebahn" translates to Suspended Railway. Top speed for the vehicles is 56 kph. Cars operate at an approximate two and a half minute headway and have a carrying capacity of 3,500 passengers per hour. In April of 1999, a derailment of a morning commuter train caused four deaths, the only fatal mass transit monorail accident in the 20th century.</p>

<p>Frank H. Peterson is an all magnet High School located on Jacksonville's westside. Before becoming an actual High School it was known as the Westside Skill Center. The Westside Skill Center was an alternative school. It was deisigned for kids that were missbehaiving or failing in a Duval County High School. The Westside Skill Center offered programs like the ones now days. Before The Northside Skill Center, known as present day A. Philip Randolph, had control of all the academies like: Information Technology, Construction, Cosmetology, Health Care, Law Enforcement, Automotive, Culinary Arts, and Child Care. These programs were for the kids who needed a future. As the fialing kids increased, there needed to be another Skilol Center. Thus the westside one was born. The Duval County School board saw the Northside and the Westide Skill Center too strict, almost like prison. Thus idea of becoming all magnet high schools was brought into place. Peterson , now, has an enrollment of about 1200. The majority, 55%, are Caucasians. 35% African American and 10% other. In the 2004-2005 School year Peterson raised from a low "D" school to a high "C" school, this was the second biggetst gain in Duval County. The highest was from J.E.B. Stuart middle Shool, located on the westside as well. Peterson doesn't have a sports program. They used to have boys Basketball but had to cancel it becoase lack of intrest. However, a football feild and stadium is being constructed now and they hope to have a football team by the 2006-2007 School year. Even though they dont have a sports they have many clubs like a guitar club wich was formed, sponsered, and even taught to students by the school's principle. Other clubs include: an Anime Club, Bible Club, Cheerleading, Choral Club, Computer/Radio Club, Cosmetology Club, Diversity Club, Drama Club, National Beta Club, National Honor Society, NTHS and Skills USA, Rocketry Club, Spanish Club, Yearbook, Martial Arts Club, and even a Water Sports Club hosted by one of the schools administrators.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Being an all magnet school, Peterson offers many programs like: 1. Cosmetology, were you can actually go get your hair and nails done. You can also get skin care there. 2. Culinary Arts, were stundents cook food in their very own kitchen, under the teachers guidance. You can also go eat in their resturant. 3. Aviation, were students learn about aircrafts and other things of that nature. 4. Comminications, were students learn about media and produce their very own news show. Students also desiegn websites in certain classes. 5. Automotive, were students work on cars, repair the dents cuased by an accident, change the pant job of a vehicle. Students also Work on deisel trucks too. 6. Child Care, were students learn how to teach young kids. They also actually teach kids too. They have their very own playground and daycare.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Unlike most high schools Frank H. Peterson is one of two schools, the other being A. Phillip Randolph Academies of Technology, to offer their graduates a diploma and 2 years college credits in their academy of choice. When you leave Peterson you can enter the world in employment anywhere as long as it pretains to your academy choice.</p>

<p>In 1958, US vice-president Richard Nixon was spitted by a multitude in Caracas, Venezuela, while visiting the city as part of a goodwill tour through South America. Such a spectacular event prompted the US Congress to create a special committee to investigate the reasons behind it. Many people were invited to speak before it, including the distinguished former President of Costa Rica, don José Figueres, who allowed himself the following speech on June 9, 1958:</p>
<p>"As a citizen of the hemisphere, as a man who has dedicated his public life to promote inter-American comprehension, as an educated man who knows and appreciates the United States and who has never tried to hide that appreciation to anyone, no matter how hostile he was, I deplore that the people of the Latin America, represented by a fistful of overexcited Venezuelans, has spitted a worthy public officer who represents the greatest nation of our time. But I must speak frankly and even rudely, because I am convinced that the situation demands it: the people cannot spit a foreign policy, which was what it tried to do. But when they have exhausted all other means of trying to make themselves understood, the only thing left to do is spitting.</p>
<p>With all due respect to vice-president Nixon, and with all my admiration towards his conduct, which was, during the events, heroic and later noble, I have no choice but to say that the act of spitting, however vulgar it is, lacks a substitute in our language to express certain emotions …</p>
<p>If you’re going to speak of human dignity in Russia, ¿why is it so hard to speak of human dignity in the Dominican Republic? ¿Where is intervention and where is non-intervention? ¿Is it that a simple threat, a potential one, to your liberties, is, essentially, more serious that the kidnapping of our liberties?</p>
<p>Of course you have made certain investments in the (Latin) American dictatorships. The aluminum companies extract bauxite almost for free. Your generals, your admirals, your public officers and your businessmen are treated there like royalty. Like your Senate verified yesterday, there are people who bribe the reigning dynasties with millions, to enjoy the privilege of hunting in their lands. They deduct the money from the taxes they pay in the US, but it returns to the country and, when it arrives to Hollywood, becomes extravagant furs and cars that bring down the fragile virtue of female stars.</p>
<p>And, meanwhile, our women are kidnapped by gangsters, our men are castrated in the torture chambers and our illustrious professors disappear, lugubriously, from the halls of the University of Columbia, in New York. When one of your lawmakers calls this “collaboration to fight communism,” 180 millions of Latin Americans feel the need to spit.</p>
<p>Spitting is a despicable custom, if done physically. ¿But what about moral spits? When your government invited Pedro Estrada, the Himmler of the Western Hemisphere, to be honored in Washington, ¿didn’t you spit upon the face of all democrats in (Latin) America?</p>
<p>… I can assure you that, when it comes to international economic policy, the United States seems to be willing to repeat certain errors of domestic policy that inflicted much damage in the past, including, of course, the ones that led to the great crisis of 1929.</p>
<p>We, the Latin Americans, are tired of pointing at these mistakes; especially, the lack of interest in the prices of our products. Every time we suggest a plan to stabilize prices at a fair level you answer with economy slogans, like “the law of supply and demand” or “the free market system,” or with insults like “¿Aren’t we paying you enough money now?”</p>
<p>We don’t beg, except in emergencies. We’re not people who will spit for money. We’ve inherited all the flaws of the Spanish character, but also some its virtues. Our poverty does not diminish our pride. We have our dignity.</p>
<p>What we want is to be paid a fair price for the sweat of our people, for the impoverishment of our land, when we provide a product needed by another country. That would be enough to live, to raise our own capital and to carry on with our own development."</p>

<p>XVCD stands for eXtendedVCD. XVCD has same features as VCD but it is possible to use higher bitrates and higher resolution to get higher video quality. XVCD is basicly everything that uses MPEG1 video, is not within the VCD standard and burnt in "VCD"-Mode.</p>
<p>XSVCD stands for eXtendedSVCD. XSVCD has same features as SVCD but it is possible to use higher bitrates and higher resolution to get higher video quality. XSVCD is basicly everything that uses MPEG2 video, is not within the SVCD standard and burnt in "SVCD"-Mode.</p>
<p>A X(S)VCD can be played on</p>
<p>- XVCD on some standalone VCD Players but not XSVCD at all. - Some standalone DVD Players check here for a compatibility list. The main problem why many players won't play X(S)VCD is that it may require faster CD-R/W reading speed in the Player. - And of course on all computers with a CD-ROMs/DVD-ROMs with a software VCD/MPG Player.</p>
<p>Technical Info</p>
<p>Remember that these are no STANDARDS as VCD and SVCD.</p>
<p>X(S)VCDs are in two format, NTSC and PAL (and a third one also, NTSC Film but that is almost never used).</p>

<p>The Black Dragons are an underground gang that "grabs" it's members from affiliate gangs. It is primarly run from the east coast. The person I spoke with said each member is given two titles. His titles are "Mysry" and "Anarkyst". He claims to be the founding member of the "FOLK" associated gang and says it is more of a grouping of common people with the same feelings than a gang. The typical wear for a "Dragon" is a black bandanna or "flag" and dark blue or black clothing. They are a "right sided gang" meaning they focus things to the right (leaning hats to the right or tying their "flag" on their right side). They use the "FOLK" signs and a hand gesture of the first three fingers on their right hand extended and slightly curved (to look like a "E") and placed over their heart as their gang signs.</p>
<p>The Dragons feelings toward "CRIPs" - "Man, we been down with the blue since we started. We always got their back." The Dragons feelings toward "BLOODs" - "Them fools ain't nothing but p***ies. They all need to be dealt with."</p>

<p>Matrixism is an internet-based new religious movement (NRM) inspired by the motion picture trilogy "The Matrix". Conceived by an annonymous group in the summer of 2004 it has grown to attract a following of over six-hundred people to date.</p>
<p>Matrixism carries with it four main beliefs that are described as "The Four Tenets". Briefly these are; belief in a messianic prophecy, use of psychedelic drugs as sacrament, reality is multi-layered and semi-subjective and followers must adhere to the principles of at least one of the world's major religions. The sacred texts of Matrixism are the motion picture trilogy "The Matrix". The adopted symbol for Matrixism is the Kanji symbol for "red".</p>
<p>Matrixism is a syncretic or ecumenical religion. It uses references to "the matrix" from an obscure text of the Baha'i religion, called "The Promulgation of Universal Peace", to make a connection with broader world religious history.</p>
<p>Notably one of the two holy days observed by Matrixists is the anniversary of the deaths of Aldous Huxley, John F. Kennedy and C.S. Lewis. All three of these famous persons passed away on the 22nd of November 1963.</p>

<p><b>Andy Classen</b> is a German <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician.html" title="Musician">musician</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_engineer.html" title="Sound engineer">sound engineer</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_producer.html" title="Record producer">record producer</a>.</p>
<p>He began his career in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> as a <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitarist.html" title="Guitarist">guitarist</a> for the German <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a> band <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Moses_46ae.html" title="Holy Moses">Holy Moses</a>, fronted by his later wife Sabina Classen. In 1989 the band bought a house in the village of Bühne in the vicinity of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warburg.html" title="Warburg">Warburg</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Rhine-Westphalia_29ea.html" title="North Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>. In 1990 they founded a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_label.html" title="Record label">record label</a> named 'West Virginia Records' and opened the Stage-One-Studio in their new house (so named because "Bühne" is German for "stage")</p>
<p>Andy Classen became producer and engineer in Stage-One-Studio. Among his first productions were the albums 'When War begins...' by the German <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrashcore.html" title="Thrashcore">thrashcore</a> band Warpath and 'Mc Gillroy the Housefly' by the German psychedelic <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_metal.html" title="Death metal">death metal</a> band Incubator, both of which where critically acclaimed, and the latter still has a cult following in the death metal underground. He also became influencial in the German <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore punk</a> scene, being the producer for bands like Ryker's and Brightside.</p>
<p>He remained lead guitarist in Holy Moses till 1994.

Ultimately he and Sabina divorced, and West Virgina Records was dissolved.</p>
<p>Holy Moses was inactive till 2001 when it was revived by Sabina Classen, with Andy Classen acting as occasional songwriter and producer. In 2005 Holy Moses has recorded the Album 'Strength, Power, Will, Passion'.</p>
<p>During the nineties Andy Classen has established himself as one of the premier producers for Hardcore, Thrashmetal and Deathmetal music in Europe. His sound aesthetics usually are described as aggressive and powerful yet transparent. Among others he produced records for the bands 'Dew Scented', <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tankard.html" title="Tankard">Tankard</a> 'Disbelief', 'Die Apokalyptischen Reiter' (all Germany), <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyx.html" title="Asphyx">Asphyx</a> (Netherlands), <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belphegor.html" title="Belphegor">Belphegor</a> (Austria), <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_dead_tree.html" title="Old dead tree">Old_dead_tree</a> (France), <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graveworm.html" title="Graveworm">Graveworm</a> (Italy) and 'Deafness by Noise' (Croatia).</p>

<p>Turkish LeveL, having been founded in 1997 (back then, M. Berker Güngör a.k.a. "maddog" prepared the whole editorial stuff nearly on his own.), is today the leading computer games magazine in Turkey selling over 25.000 units. It endured tough times of rivalry when magazines like Gameshow and PCgamer existed contemporarily with LeveL. Due to financial problems, they had to shut down their offices and as a consequence, LeveL was left with no real opponents in the market. These events made LeveL stronger in general, because many authors from rival but yet closed magazines strenghtened the editorial staff of LeveL and brought new blood to reviews and other articles.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-04_87bb.html" title="Edit section: Hermann Weller">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_Weller_7545.html" title="Hermann Weller">Hermann Weller</a></span></h2>
<p>Hermann Weller (born 4 February 1878 in Schwäbisch Gmünd; died 1956 in Tübingen) was an Indiologist and neo-Latin poet. He is considered the Horatio of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>After his studies in Tübingen and Berlin, the classical philologist taught as a schoolteacher in the Ellwangen Gymnasium between 1913 and 1931. He also held a position at the Ehingen Gymnasium. In 1930 he qualified as a university teacher in Tübingen.</p>
<p>The acknowledged neo-Latin poet was already so famous by 1931 that in that year the Ellwanger town council decided to name a street after him – the Hermann Weller Street.</p>
<p>The Y Elegy</p>
<p>Weller wrote the neo-Latin Y Elegy, which describes how in a poet’s dream the letters of the alphabet from a volume of Horace’s poetry become alive, and how A calls in a demagogic speech for the extermination of the foreign letter Y. Y escapes and tries through words, myths, mysticism, rhythm, and physics to prove its right to exist – but the other letters do not allow themselves to be convinced, and are in the process of excluding Y. The poet asks for release and awakes from this nightmare.</p>
<p>Weller, a private senior lecturer, at Tübingen University, submitted the Y Elegy at the end of 1937, though the Certamen Hoefufftianumin, for a competition of neo-Latin poetry to the Royal Dutch Academy of Wetenschappen (KNAW) held annually in Amsterdam. In 1938 Weller was awarded the Gold Medal for this text. The fact that Weller could be promoted to the position of Special Professor in the same year (despite certain doubts on account of his Catholicism) shows that knowledge of Latin among Nazi officials was not wide.</p>
<p>The Latin scholar, Uwe Dubielzig, recognised in 2001 that around the text was a playfully disguised accusation against the ever more apparent anti-Semitism of the Nazis, the effects of which Weller could observe in his immediate surroundings of Tübingen University. Additionally, if the text cannot be read as a document of anti-fascist resistance, it is still a spirited but camouflaged document turning away from the Nazis racist politics, the full brutality of which, before the pogrom of the so-called Reichskristallnacht, Weller would have underestimated, (as did Charlie Chaplin even in 1940 in his film The Great Dictator). In that sense the Y Elegy can be assessed as a remarkable testimony for ‘internal immigration’.</p>

<p>Kurtulmak (KUR-tul-mak) is the spite-filled Power of the kobolds. He resents his low ranking among the humanoid Powers, and seeks the eventual enslavement and destruction of the other humanoid races. However, given the weak and ignoble status of the kobold race, he is biding his time. Kurtulmak has a particular loathing for the dwarvish Powers, and his clerics will kill (or torture) dwarves whenever possible.Hateful, gloating, and humorless, Kurtulmak is the chief patron of the kobolds. He governs war and mining, and is depicted as a large kobold with a sinuous stingered tail, large horns, black and green scales, and a wickedly-tipped spear.</p>
<p>Kurtulmak holds power over the other Demi Powers in the kobold pantheon, although all of them seek to supplant him one day. The infighting tends to be fairly minor, as kobolds are well aware of the need to support each other against their common enemies.</p>
<p>Kurtulmak’s clerics are expected to be leaders and examples of their Power’s virtues. As such, they help plan out new construction in their lairs, attacks against their hated enemies, and personally lead ambushes whenever possible.</p>

<p>Born June 1, 1920, Mikhail Fikhtengolz was a pupil of the famous teacher Pyotr Stolyarsky in Odessa, Russia, also teacher of David Oistrakh, Elizaveta Gilels and others. Fikhtengoltz's won in the national competition for young performers in Leningrad (St.Petersourg) at the age of 15. In 1937 he won in the Izai international competition in Brussels with Elizaveta Gilels and other joung soviet violonists. Married the daughter of a high-placed government official, who after a while was executed as "enemy of the people", refused to divorce her and immediately had all prestigious concerts canceled. The nervous strain was heavy and one of his hands failed (after a few minutes of playing, a pain forced him to stop). Mikhail started making arrangements of popular piano and orchestral pieces and working in the studio where he could always take a break and endure the pain. He was also increasingly getting into teaching and soon after he was already teaching at Moscow’s Music Institute founded by the Gnessin sisters. During the mid-Sixties a leading psychotherapist ventured to get Mikhail playing again. Much to his colleagues’ surprise, the man quickly restored mobility in Mikhail’s failing hand. Mikhail was rehearsing day and night and after 23 years away from the stage, he begun playing again. The strain to win the lost time was great and died of heart attack at the age of 65. Picking up where her father left off, Natalya Fikhtengoltz, a violinist and a very good teacher too, is bringing up her students in the grand traditions bequeathed by the late Pyotr Stolyarsky. She has also released a series of CDs with recordings once made by her late father.</p>

<p>There are seven principles or criteria of the Just War doctrine. The first five principles apply as a nation is "on the way to war" (jus ad bellum) and the final two apply to military forces "in the midst of war" (jus in bello). They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just cause - All aggression is condemned in just war theory. Participation in the war in question must be prompted by a just cause or defensive cause. No war of unprovoked aggression can ever be justified. Only defensive war is legitimate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Just intention (right intention) - The war in question must have a just intention, that is, its intent must be to secure a fair peace for all parties involved. Therefore, revenge, conquest, economic gain, and ideological supremacy are not legitimate motives for going to war. There must be a belief that ultimately greater good than harm will result from the war.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Last resort - The war in question must be engaged in only as a last resort. Other means of resolution such as diplomacy and economic pressure must have been exhausted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Formal declaration - The war in question must be initiated with a formal declaration by properly constituted authorities. Only governments can declare war, not individuals, terrorist organizations, mercenaries, or militias.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Limited objectives - The war in question must be characterized by limited objectives. This means that securing peace is the goal and purpose of going to war. The war must be waged in such a way that once peace is attainable, hostilities cease. Complete destruction of a nation's political institutions or economic institutions is an improper objective.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Proportionate means - Combatant forces of the opposition forces may not be subjected to greater harm than is necessary to secure victory and peace. The types of weapons and amount of force used must be limited to only what is needed to repel the aggression, deter future attacks, and secure a just peace. Therefore, total or unlimited warfare is inappropriate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Noncombatant immunity - Military forces must respect individuals and groups not participating in the conflict and must abstain from attacking them. Since only governments can declare war, only governmental forces or agents are legitimate targets. This means that prisoners of war, civilians, and casualties are immune from intentional attacks.</li>

<p>This information was taken from the UK Companies Database in April 2005, re-ordered to show the relationships between holding companies and subsidiaries more clearly and updated to reflect the spin-off of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_Nation_effd.html" title="Live Nation">Live Nation</a> from <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clear_Channel_Communications_80cb.html" title="Clear Channel Communications">Clear Channel Communications</a>.

<ul>
<li>Number of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holding_companies.html" title="Holding companies">holding companies</a>.

The 2 main holding companies (shown in red) were held by 2 'parent' companies - ClearChannel International Holdings BV, registered in the Netherlands, and Clear Channel Communications Inc. Their subsidiaries (in dark grey) have 3 holding (parent) companies. Their subsidiaries (light grey) have 4 holding companies, and so forth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Number of subsidiary companies. This table only shows the main subsidiary companies. Some of the light grey companies have many subsidiaries which are listed in the table below. This layout is intended to make the table clearer.</li>

<li>the information given in the Companies Database is not fully up to date - companies normally have a time window in which to file documents, and even when filed, the documents may take some time to become available on the database.

<li>Both tables only include active companies. Companies officially designated as 'dormant' or 'wound up' are not shown in the table, but are counted as 'subsidiaries' in the table above.

<p><b>Chrisco</b> is a mail-order company that was launched in 1978, and now operates in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The company's operations revolve around a strategy to sell groups of products in "hampers", have people pay for them in advance, in small amounts throughout the course of a year, and then have them delivered to the customer before Christmas.</p>
<p><a name="How_It_Works" id="How_It_Works"></a></p>

<p>While Chrisco sells its products at a slightly higher cost than the off-the-shelf price at supermarkets <a href="http://www.chriscohampers.ca/Shop/Help.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chriscohampers.ca/Shop/Help.aspx" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, hamper prices include packing, shipping fees and all taxes. Chrisco markets its products to people for reasons of budgeting and convenience. The turkey hamper, for instance, runs at a cost of C$344,which people can pay in weekly, biweekly or monthly installments, or all at once. Hampers are delivered to the buyer's door before Christmas.</p>
<p>By referring friends to the company and having them place hamper orders, customers can receive 10% to 20% of the value of hamper sales. Their sales strategy is not a pyramid scheme.</p>

<p>Non-Linear Quantization, or Companding is a method by which a signal is compressed before transmission and expanded back to its original state at the reciever end.</p>
<p>There are 2 main reasons for Non-Linear Quantisation 1. To reduce quantisation noise 2. To reduce the bit-rate requirement for transmission of a signal</p>
<p>Companding helps the system deal with the dynamic range of a signal. A voice signal for example has a very wide dynamic range, which is compressed, and following compression the system only has to deal with a signal with a narrow dynamic range which requires a much lower bit rate to transmit.</p>
<p>There are two well known uses of Non-Linear Quantisation 1. The A-Law Algorithm for European Telephony 2. The Mu-Law Algorithm, which is used in North America and Japan 68.232.23.61 15:13, 3 January 2006 (UTC)John Owens</p>

<p>Frank Rudolph Crosswaith was a longtime socialist and labor leader in New York City. He was the founder and chairman of the Negro Labor Committee, which was established on July 20, 1935 by the Negro Labor Conference. The NLC emerged out of the Harlem Labor Committee, formed in 1934, as well as Crosswaith's earlier work to establish a committee to organize black workers begun in 1925 but suspended the following year when Crosswaith became a full-time organizer for A. Philip Randolph's Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Randolph and Crosswaith maintained a long association and Randolph served as an officer with the Negro Labor Committee in the 1930s and 40s.</p>
<p>Crosswaith was born on July 16, 1892 in Fredericksted, St. Croix, Danish West Indies (the island was sold to the United States in 1916 and became part of the U.S. Virgin Islands), and emigrated to the United States in his teens. While finishing high school, he worked as an elevator operator, porter and garment worker. He joined the elevator operators' union and when he finished high school, he won a scholarship from the socialist Jewish Daily Forward to attend the Rand School of Social Science. After graduating, he became a lecturer at the Rand School and also a soapbox orator on the streets of Harlem. After working as an organizer for the fledgling Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porter, he was hired in the early 1930s as an organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which became one of the major supporters of the Negro Labor Committee.</p>
<p>Frank Crosswaith ran for Congress twice and he ran for New York City Council in 1939 on the American Labor Party ticket. He was an anti-communist and believed that the best hope for black workers in the United States was to join bona fide labor unions just as the best hope for the American labor movement was to welcome black workers into unions in order to promote solidarity and elimate the use of black workers as strike breakers. He believed strongly that "separation of workers by race would only work to undermine the strength of the entire labor movement." Crosswaith spent much of his energy in the late 1930s and early 1940s battling a rival labor orgization called the Harlem Labor Union, Inc., which was run by Ira Kemp and had a black nationalist philosophy. He accused Kemp of undermining the interests of black workers by signing agreements with employers that offered them labor at wages below union rates.</p>
<p>Crosswaith also worked with A. Philip Randolph during World War II in organizing the March on Washington Movement, which was called off when President Roosevelt agreed to sign Executive Order 8802, which prohibited racial discrimination in defense industries.</p>

<p>Unlike most mainstream shooters, Hellfire tried an interesting gimmick; With the second button, the player can change which direction their ship fires in. The ship starts out aiming to the right, as per usual. Press the second button once and it aims to the left instead. Press again and it aims up and down. With a third press it aims in all four diagonal directions. Pressing the second button one last time aims to the right again. The gameplay in Hellfire could be considered somewhat similar to the way four guns at 90-degree angles are used in the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taito_Corporation_3055.html" title="Taito Corporation">Taito</a> game Mega Blast</p>
<p>Thing get difficult fairly quickly, as enemies begin approaching from multiple different directions at the same time. With this in mind, the aiming mechanism adds an element of strategy to the game, since all four aiming modes have times when they are needed. Obviously the left-firing mode should be used when enemies come from behind. Ground- and ceiling-based foes should be dealt with using the vertical guns. If squadrons of fighters come at the player from every which way, it might be best to switch to the diagonal guns. In situations besides these, the default right-firing mode is a safe choice.</p>
<p>Of course, there are <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power-ups.html" title="Power-ups">power-ups</a> to find, which can make things easier. Picking up gun power-ups makes the player's shots more powerful, and at a certain point the ship shoots long lasers instead of bullets (the firing sound effect changes as well). There are also power-ups to increase the ship's speed.</p>

<p>The history of Ben Katz begins in a small hospital in Manhattan. Life began regularly as a half jewish half black boy. He will graduate in the spring of 2006 as one of the original Red Roomers. The Red Room consists of a select group of juniors and senior each year that christen a hallway as their own. Filled with apple laptops, hacky sacks and constant laughter. Whether its Gen Swain's corner spot, the junior takeover of our sacred room or the smell of Ross Procaccio's frequent farts, the Red Room is a special place for all students.</p>

<p>Bilingualism in an International Context</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>While many governments are trying to adapt their educational language polices to the needs of their growing multi-cultural school population, paradoxically, the majority of the so called international schools continue to have their curriculum based on academic western models, with English as the sole language of instruction.</p>
<p>Many questions are beginning to arise about the effects (academic and psychological) for the non-English speaking children in this environment, especially in the early years of their development.</p>
<p>Being a teacher in international schools for over 13 years and a parent of two international school students, I experience at home and at work the everyday consequences of this choice. Before settling in Belgium 9 years ago, we lived in 4 countries.</p>
<p>This article aims to elicit the importance of including mother tongue teaching in the mainstream curriculum of international schools, taking into consideration the following issues:</p>
<p>1) Defining international schools. 2) International education and the language curriculum in international schools. 3) The importance of the inclusion of mother tongue teaching in the mainstream curriculum of international schools. 4) Promoting and implementing bilingualism in international schools.</p>
<p>Defining international schools</p>
<p>The growing number of international schools around the world is a sound reality. In 1964, Knight and Leach mention a number of approximately 50 and in 1984, Pearce states the existence of over 2000 so called international schools. However, international schools differ among themselves to great extends regarding their philosophy, educational practices, student body composition and ideological purposes.</p>
<p>“Thus, it may be argued that there is no single definable entity which can be identified as ‘an international school’ because a single universal definition of what constitutes international schools cannot be defended.” (Cambridge and Thompson, 2004 p1) From this standing point, researchers have mostly proposed categorizations of international schools rather than a global definition. Leach (1969), for example, identified 4 different groups of international schools namely: national international schools which are actually national institutions located in another country; overseas schools which are private schools in another nation serving mostly the expatriate community; schools founded by two or more governments such as the European schools, and schools which belong to the International Schools Association (ISA), even though, as Leach himself admitted, the criteria for membership of the ISA are too broad and schools within this category may still be very different from each other. By 1981 Sanderson had identified 7 different types and in 1987 Pönish wrote about 11 types. So, as Hayden and Thompson came to conclude, “The body of international schools is a conglomeration of individual institutions which may or may not share an underlying education philosophy.” (1995, p10)</p>
<p>As the definition question remains unanswered, researchers began to concentrate more on the education philosophy or the school ethos of each institution. Concepts such as international education, international curriculum and international-mindedness began to suffice. Jan Hill (1994) proposed that an international ethos would prepare students for global citizenship by building on the principles of tolerance, international cooperation, justice and peace. As Deputy Director-General of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO), he suggested differentiating schools, which are internationally-minded from the ones which are not, regardless of the names they give themselves. Such a school would have a curriculum emphasizing studies of world history, literature and cultures (Hill, 2000) and also the interdependence of nations and peoples in world economy, de-emphasizing the perspective of only one country, region or selected group. (Gellar, 2002) Of course this differentiation approach is applicable to all schools whether national or international.</p>
<p>The mention of the IBO is not merely referential. The IBO and its programs are becoming quite pertinent as characteristic of international schools. Established in 1968 as a non-profit organization, the IBO was created to fulfill the need for a more homogeneous curriculum, which would accommodate the international mobility of students and which would lead to an internationally recognized diploma for university entrance around the world. Based on the ideological concept of international education, the IB diploma program targets the two last years of the secondary school and it aims to promote critical thinking skills within its content and the development of international understanding. As stated in its mission, it prepares the students to be “ critical and compassionate thinkers, life long learners and informed participants in local and world affairs, conscious of the shared humanity that binds all people together while respecting the variety of cultures and attitudes that makes for the richness of life.” (IBO Council of Foundation, 1996) With the same educational goals in mind, the organization created in 1994 a Middle Years Program (MYP) for children aged 12 to 16 and in 1997 a Primary Years Program (PYP) for children aged 3 to 12. At present 1454 schools in 117 countries are associated with the IBO and its programs.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this assignment, as I refer to international schools, I will be referring to the ones which more or less have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>· An ethos inclined to promote international understanding and the preparation of global citizenship. (Hill, 1994) · A significant variety of nationalities within the student body and the faculty. · Accreditation awarded by an international education association such as the already mentioned ISA or the ECIS (European Council of International Schools, now CIS) · International curriculum and assessment services such as the IBO. · Essentially monolingual with English as the only academic language of instruction.</p>
<p>International education and the language curriculum in international schools</p>
<p>George Walker (1999 p.52) proposed five objectives for an international education: “to celebrate diversity as desirable for improving the human condition, to promote understanding and respect for one’s own and for the other cultures, to encourage a knowledge of issues of global concern, to recognize the limitations of a humanist education and to share with others an understanding of the human condition.”</p>
<p>As International Schools move towards the ideals of international education, many declare in their mission statements the aim to transform youngsters into citizens of the world. The International School of Brussels, for example, demonstrates this mission by a picture of the world being embraced by the phrases: “independent learner” and “international citizen”. The International School of Antwerp, where I have been teaching for the last 8 years, states the goal of educating students to be: “responsible, caring and productive members of a democratic society in the global community”. The International School of Amsterdam “educates to prepare students to become enlightened world citizens” and “ exists to provide Education for International Understanding.”</p>
<p>World citizenship education should start as early as possible, as soon as a child’s language skills enables her/him to engage in story telling, normally by the age of 3, when officially, in most international schools, a child is due to start pre-school. However, it is not really the acquiring of an international education with its promotion of world justice, peace and understanding that influences parents to choose an international school for their offspring. (see appendix A)</p>
<p>According to my experience as a teacher and a parent in international schools, I can say that most non-native English speaker parents from Asia, South America and other parts of the world, who choose an international school, do believe that the acquisition of the English language will be extremely beneficial for the future of their children. When I enrolled my 3 year old in the British School of Benghazi in 1986, I was thinking of his future as a bilingual person in Brazil in the first place. On the other hand, as parents, we certainly wish and even naturally expect our children to continue developing their mother tongue skills and, of course, the love for their home culture and identity. Alas the implications of the process to achieve such bilingualism, in the mobile life style of most international school students, are quite beyond their parents’ good will and efforts.</p>
<p>With English as the sole language of instruction and, in most cases, not even an explicit recognition of bilingual students or encouragement for their mother tongue learning, international schools contribute more than they are aware of to the creation of the so-called Third Culture Kids. These kids may have impressive communication skills but superficial proficiency in several languages and may have experience in several cultures but no defined identity or place they may call home. (Walker,1999)</p>
<p>The effects of this atrophy of mother tongue and culture are soon felt by the parents but are also felt by the students at different times of their lives, though the full realization of what they miss usually comes in their first years of adulthood. (see appendix B)</p>
<p>International schools must keep in mind, as they reflect and write their curriculum, that “ The development of international-mindedness does not mean the abandonment of national-mindedness; if it means anything it demands an informed consciousness of the place of one’s nation in the world society and the contributions it can make to a world society whose survival depends on the maintenance of peace and relief from the fear of war.” (Kandel, 1952 p 31)</p>
<p>Every individual needs, for his/her own self-assurance, a set of references to fall back on. Those references are rooted in the cultural input a child receives from his/her parents and from their environment. During the process of maturation and the development of critical thinking, one begins to analyze and understand one’s own behavior and believes through the comparison and the analysis of the behavior and the beliefs of others. The absence of such a reference set may cause insecurity, lack of self-esteem and in many cases apathy and fear of attachment. The concept of international can only flourish if planted on a fertile national ground. To understand the international, one must understand the national fully, and not just accept it as what one is used to.</p>
<p>Cultural identity is, therefore, a pre-requisite for the understanding of our similarities and of our differences. The development of cultural identity begins at home, along with the acquisition of the mother tongue and should be supported and continued in the school. An internationally-minded curriculum will build on the cultural-linguistic luggage every child brings to school. It will add and not subtract.</p>
<p>The importance of the inclusion of mother tongue teaching in the mainstream curriculum of international schools</p>
<p>“Learning is an active process in which learners construct new ideas or concepts on current/past knowledge.” Jerome Bruner</p>
<p>Mother tongue(s) can be defined through different criteria: origin, identification, competence and function. (Skutnabb-Kangas, 1984) The definition, which best fits the purpose of this assignment is the most obvious one: the language or languages one learns first and with which one identifies himself/herself as native speaker. The competence and function criteria will depend on the opportunity the native speaker will have to develop his/her mother tongue(s) knowledge and skills academically and on his/her future linguistic environment. What many parents do not realize is the fact that being educated in a second language isn’t the same as learning a second language. (Sears 1998) Although the home language and culture, in the case of most of these families, are not under pressure from a dominant foreign language and culture, as is often the case with immigrants, the lack of formal instruction in the mother tongue and the absence of their cultural environment outside their home, may trigger an effect known as subtractive bilingualism. (Sears, 1998) The children begin to loose competence in their mother tongue and in many cases, especially among teenagers, an aversion to their own cultural identity. The need for peer identification and social connection may conflict with their home culture and provoke damage to their self-esteem and family relationship. The continual process of acculturation on the frequent mobile child encompasses the stress of the never ending effort to cope with the losses of moving: the loss of security from what is familiar, the loss of possessions (toys, house, furniture) and the loss of relationships (friends and relatives). In addition to the emotional toll, the lack of language proficiency can be a worry for many families and students who, according to their cultures, cannot accept a decline in the academic school level, (Walker, 2000) and who will not be able to attend universities in English.</p>
<p>Naturally, language plays a central role to the thinking process, which takes place in all the other academic and pastoral areas. Three year olds’ language skills, within a typical language development, include a vocabulary of 900 to 1000 words and an intelligibility of 90% of what the child says. An ESL child entering pre-school in an international school will start from a point of disadvantage, as far as language skills are concerned. “Continuing literacy in the mother tongue is clearly vital for ESL students: since they initially have poor English skills, they must keep up the development of their cognitive and academic skills in their mother tongue. As their English improves they will become increasingly bilingual, with all the benefits accrue therefrom.” (Carder, 2202 p2)</p>
<p>The mother tongue is also an essential tool in the learning process of other languages. As with any learning, language learning finds support from what is already known to the learner. Second language students, whether consciously or subconsciously, use the mother language as a back up natural resource for all learning activities. Comparison with the mother tongue ensures that the correct meaning is learned. Being a bilingual person myself, in spite of having spent more than half of my life in an English environment, and of having used English as the everyday tool of communication even at home, I do revert to Portuguese thinking in the back of my mind. This happens particularly if I cannot find the right expression in English on the tip of my tongue, or if I am trying to understand a new concept, even if the text I am reading is in English. I can cite a very recent example. My 15 year old son was trying to convince me the other day to allow him to go to ‘an out of the blue’ party, on a normal Wednesday evening, with a group of new friends. We were both arguing in English from the beginning, as we usually do. Wanting to put a definitive ending to the discussion I said: Do take your horse out of the rain! My son looked at me puzzled and said: “What horse?!!!” I then realized I had literally translated a Portuguese saying which means: No point in wasting your saliva, the answer is no. According to Cummins (1985), it may take 2 to 3 years for a child to acquire basic interpersonal communication skills or BICS. That is, to be socially competent in a language. However, academic language proficiency skills or CALPS (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency) demands a 4 to 7 year period to be attained. Many children in international schools do not have the time to reach such a level, neither in their home language nor in their second language. In most cases, the expatriate children only stay for a period of 2 to 3 years before they are moved back home or to another country for a similar length of time. Also the reentry in their home country demands again and again an adjustment and an academic language catch up. Such adjustment usually encounters much less support from the family, who assume from a grown-up point of view, that home is a familiar place and not a challenge at all. Maintaining their mother tongue ability would ease the process of re-entry. Besides, children who develop bilingual proficiency in their primary years are more able to understand how language works and how languages organize reality. Bilingualism becomes then a two-way avenue, where concepts and thinking skills travel from one language to another. (Cummins, 2000)</p>
<p>Recent research in the U.S. (Colier and Thomas, 2002) about bilingual education includes the finding that “only students with at least four years of first-language schooling reach grade level performance in a second language, and only after at least four years of ESL.” (Murphy, 2003 p31) Not only academic proficiency is at stake in the life of the frequently mobile child, but also his/her personality development. Since a child’s personality is shaped by the input of his/her cultural luggage, the mother tongue development cannot be separated from this process. Therefore, the achievement of self-esteem and of a fulfilling understanding of one’s own culture demands the cultivation of the child’s mother tongue.</p>
<p><br />
Promoting and implementing bilingualism in international schools</p>
<p>Bilingualism is a term rarely used within international schools. Children, whose mother tongue isn’t English, are referred to as ESL (English as a Second Language), EFL (English as a Foreign Language), EAL (English as an Additional Language) children or another similar term. These denominations strongly suggest that children in international schools are evaluated mostly for their performance in the English language. Coreen Sears (1988 p 44) points out that, “The widespread use of the term, bilingual, to describe these children, would bring benefits to students and teachers. Teachers would be reminded that second language students enter the school with a wealth of experience and skill in language. They would be more inclined to build on children’s existing knowledge and experience in teaching them in English. English speaking students might understand more fully the challenges of learning a second language and offer further support and encouragement.”</p>
<p>Coreen Sears (1998) also elicits that the role of the parents in maintaining the home language is fundamental. However, it is not always easy for parents to fulfill this expectation on their own. As a parent, what should you do with a child who refuses to answer you in his/her mother tongue? What do you say to your teenage son, who has asked you not to cheer for him in your mother tongue at the basketball game? How do you react when your child doesn’t want to participate in the traditional family celebrations and dismisses them as ridiculous and unimportant? The amount of distress that such situations can cause, within many families, can be very damaging. In addition, there is the fact that quite a few families, among those who send their children to international schools, are composed of marriages between people of different nationalities and languages, and that does not make matters any easier.</p>
<p>Since English is the school’s constant language and the language in which these children mostly communicate with friends, their choice and sometimes rebellion, is quite understandable. Many international schools do try to provide emotional support to those families through PTO meetings or through the school-counseling department. (Sears, 1998) Indeed, parents too need to be supported and oriented during these transition periods of their children. Keeping emotions at bay and accepting their children’s reaction, as part of their bilingual maturation process, is the first important step. In the case of home bilingualism it is also very important to decide which mother tongue should be the common language for family discussions and communication involving both parents.</p>
<p>However, bilingualism will only become truly effective if the mother tongue extrapolates the home environment.</p>
<p>Classes arranged by parents after school, private lessons organized by embassies and even part-time national schools on weekends such as the Japanese schools are alternatives, which provide some support for the maintenance of the mother tongue, but which quite often fall short in achieving academic proficiency for several reasons. To begin with, it is difficult to motivate most of the children (teenagers almost impossible) to attend after school or weekend formal classes in their mother tongue while many of their friends are at home sleeping, or playing computer games, or chatting through chat-rooms, or practicing some sport, or going to the movies. Classes eventually also conflict with other family social events and outings, especially on weekends. Distance and traffic problems may add to the difficulties and the fact that many children are forced to take these classes raises their affective filter towards the mother tongue and may do more harm than good.</p>
<p>I remember my 9-year-old son shouting at me in English, that he didn’t want to study “this stupid language” (Portuguese) anymore. None of his friends had to learn another language outside school, so he said, and there was nobody around he could speak Portuguese with, except myself. To make matters worse, I was supposed to be his mother, not his teacher. We were then living in Libya and he was attending the British School of Benghazi at the time. He had Portuguese lessons one hour a week, so we had agreed, and even that was just too much. My arguments for his future need of the Portuguese language, in case we went back to live in Brazil, made no sense to him. Soon after that I stopped the lessons. Besides agreeing with him that the student-teacher relationship in our case was not ideal, I realized he was not going to learn anything against his will and I didn’t want him to develop a complete aversion to the language and even stop speaking it altogether.</p>
<p>Although parents indeed play a very important and supportive role regarding the maintenance of their children’s mother tongue and culture, international schools must begin to take the responsibility to foster bilingualism under the school curriculum umbrella. The fact that mother tongue and own culture deprivation can have long lasting negative effects, both psychological and academic, cannot be ignored any longer. If mother tongue learning is included, at least as a core subject of the school curriculum, much of the negative peer pressure and resistance will be broken down. If the school fully supports a mother tongue program, it is supporting the child’s self-esteem, his/her home, family and heritage. (Baker, 1996)</p>
<p>There are some international schools, which operate bilingual programs. These bilingual schools offer two pre-selected languages for all students. English and Japanese for example, form the dual language curriculum of the Nishmachi International School. English, French and German are the languages of instruction in the International School of Bern, and so forth. They do not have what could be called a mother tongue police. Other international schools move a step further offering a trilingual or a multilingual program such as the International School of Bern in Switzerland, the European Schools and the United Nations International School in New York. The European Schools were originally created to cater for the children of the European Union workers and their structure is more embracing. They aim to educate children to be bilingual and biliterate in at least 2 languages of the European Union. The children learn the curriculum through their mother tongue and another language. A third language of instruction is also possible. The United Nations International School in New York has a student population from over a 100 nationalities. It has “the maintenance of the students’ mother tongue fluency” as one of the aims written in its mission statement. Although all students study French or Spanish from the elementary onwards, the main language of instruction is English. Arabic, Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese and Russian are offered beginning 7th grade and other mother tongue classes can be arranged after school hours.</p>
<p>By bilingualism within the above mentioned international schools’ concept, I mean the inclusion of mother tongue classes in the mainstream curriculum, not necessarily the delivering of the curriculum in more than one languages. This inclusion of course requires an enormous commitment and, depending on the language diversity of the student body, it may prove to be a very complex one. The International School of Antwerp, for example, is responsible for the education of 582 students from 42 different nationalities. 17% of them are Americans, 10% British, 13% Indians and 60% from elsewhere in the world. For our school, changing the curriculum to accommodate mother tongue classes would require difficult schedule adjustments, addition of specialist staff and most challenging of all: financial support.</p>
<p>However, there are some internationals schools and also some countries with high nationality diversity, which have already started bilingual mother tongue programs with success. The International School of London is one of the pioneers. With a school population composed by more than 50 nationalities, it highly supports mother tongue learning and offers about 20 languages as part of the mainstream curriculum, from kindergarten to grade 13. Its mother tongue program offers lessons twice a week to children aged 3 to 4 years (2 hours and 20 minutes), three times a week to children aged 4 to 11 years (3 hours 30 minutes) twice a week to children aged 11 to 16 years (2 hours and 20 minutes) and three times a week to children aged 17 to 18 years (4 hours and 5 minutes). Its mother tongue teachers are native speakers of their languages and most have experience in teaching.</p>
<p>At a public community level, the best example I came across is the municipality of Lund in Sweden. This community of 100.470 inhabitants is a melting pot of 130 nationalities. The Department of Mother Tongue Instruction in Lund organizes mother tongue classes in all elementary and secondary schools as a core subject of the curriculum with objectives, assessment criteria and grading. About 50% of the mother tongue instruction takes place during the normal school day and through the lessons students also learn about the cultural background of their parents. Mother tongue teachers take an active part in the school planning and organization. They also participate in teacher-parent conferences and pupil-teacher conference as translators if necessary. “To nurture a language _ not to lose a language.” Is the motto of the Department of Mother Tongue Instruction of Lund. This should be also the motto of every institution devoted to education in an internationally-minded context.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Considering all the discussed evidence in the above sections of this assignment, I believe international schools need to add to their mission statements the goal to educate international students not only to be open-minded responsible citizens of the world, but also conscious citizens of their own countries. International schools should strive to avoid the production of “ Third Culture Kids” and make sure the non native English speaking children are prepared for re-entry into their own culture, as well as entry into different cultures. (Walker, 2002) The maintenance and the academic development of the mother tongue is an essential pre-requisite for the achievement of the above educational goals and also for the successful academic acquisition of a second language.</p>
<p>International schools need, therefore, not only to encourage, but also to validate and reward bilingual students. They need to begin adding mother tongue classes to their mainstream curriculum. A mother tongue program could count on financial support from parents and embassies. It could be introduced slowly, for example, with a bilingual early childhood program, which if successful, would be continued throughout the school year by year. (Murphy, 2003)</p>
<p>At whatever pace, there must be addition and not subtraction, so that one day, every child and adult in this world can fully understand the apparent simple words in Mem Fox’s picture book Whoever You Are: “…remember this: Joys are the same, and love is the same. Pain is the same and blood is the same. Smiles are the same and hearts are just the same_ wherever they are, wherever you are, wherever we are, all over the world.”</p>
