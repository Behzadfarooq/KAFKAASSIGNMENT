<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
This debate was evenly divided between people in favour of deleting the list, those in favour of keeping the list, and those in favour of merging and redirecting the list somewhere else. The main argument in favour of keeping the list was that the centralised list was useful. The main argument both for deleting and for merging was that the list largely duplicated content found elsewhere.</p>
<p>While this discussion reached no consensus, it was trending away from keeping the article in its present form. The option now most compatible with this debate would be to <b>discuss a strategy for merging this article</b>. Consideration should be given to the significant minority who find a centralised list useful.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, consider <b>Merge</b> This is far more complex than a content fork. <i>Table of books of Judeo-Christian Scripture</i> is a far larger article than <i>Books of the Bible</i> in terms of the headings and the books. We have to keep religion out of the discussion though the topic is to do with religion, and view the article on its merits as an article. I see substantial merit in this article with information that is simply not present in the older one. I would like to see more description in addition to the table, however. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 20:51, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> non-overlapping content into <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a> then <b>Delete</b>. As it stands it is OR and unsourced. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 22:11, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> obviously - this is a very useful list for writing about Christian and pseudo-Christian documents. I would, however, suggest renaming it to "List of ..." and removing the Mormon books. This isn't for theological reasons - it's just that if we put a column for every new Christian and pseudo-Christian religion and their holy books, it would really be gigantic. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:33, 1 July 2006 (UTC)&lt;/a&gt;</s></li>

<dd>The distinction between <i>Books of the Bible</i> and <i>Table of books of Judeo-Christian Scripture</i> is that the latter includes apocryphal writings. We already have an article on <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>, and sub-articles on all stripes of apocryphal writings, such as <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_apocrypha.html" title="Jewish apocrypha">Jewish apocrypha</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_apocrypha.html" title="Biblical apocrypha">Biblical apocrypha</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html" title="New Testament apocrypha">New Testament apocrypha</a>. I'm not convinced of the need of an extra list duplicating articles that already exist. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 23:54, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok ... I have re-examined the list and I accept your reasoning. The only difference between this table and the one in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a> is the inclusion of the Mormon books and the inclusion of the apocrypha. Both of those efforts are duplicated elsewhere. As it is, this list is extremely large, apparantly for POV purposes, and the functionality is covered elsewhere. Thus, <b>delete</b>.<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 01:21, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Although this might have some use the stuff is already tabulated and listed elsewhere under morespecific categories, per the above. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 00:11, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The distinction Dr. Zak makes is inaccurate. Not only does the table include apocryphal books; it also includes pseudpigrapha, lost books, oral Torah, and Restorationist books. Books of the Bible covers only a fragment of what this article covers. This much more comprehensive page is the obvious keep. As to removing "Mormon" books (??), use of the term "pseudo-Christian" demonstrates bigotry, not theology. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">The Editrix</a> 00:32, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you are reading into what I said that Mormons fall into the "pseudo-Christian" category rather than the "Christian" category, then you're reading something I never said. Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, Christian Science, Way International, Swedenborgianism, and plenty of other modern Christian or pseudo-Christian groups have their own scriptures. Listing every single one of them on a table of what different denominations believe would get very big very fast. The list is already big. It's a useful list as I said above, but if the only purpose in having it is so that you can equate modern scriptures with ancient ones, there's a problem somewhere. This isn't a question of theology - it's a question of usefulness. Among ancient scriptures, Mormons use the same books Protestants do as far as I know, so the only possible use in having a separate column would be for POV issues. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 01:09, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I try always to assume good faith, I find myself asking why this deletion nomination has now assumed such large proportions that you have looked for this? Is there something that we do not know about here that should be brought to our attention in order that we may be better informed about the page you feel should be deleted? I unerstand completely the wikipedia distaste for internal spamming. Equally I have the strong opinion that it is the article that will survive AfD or will fail to survive, and that great tranches of "delete" vs "keep" tend to alert the closing admin to the fact that there is an underlying issue far wider than an article itself. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 07:30, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would agree to this rationale - for one thing, it would ensure the current article does not constitute a mere POV fork. But, aside from that small concern, and assuming good faith, the tabular form of this article is simply a mess - the section heading "Apocrypha recognized, but not canonized" appears in the middle of the Restorationist column for absolutely no logical reason, also the table appears to show books demarcated as they are used by various churches in its first five columns but, due to the flawed layout, makes no such indication for the contents of the Apocrypha/Pseudepigrapha column. They are simply "there". If the reason for this is "it would be too difficult to squeeze in all the details", then this merely reinforces the need for a separate table for Apocrypha/Pseudepigrapha, ideally as part of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a> article. The new table could then follow the same "as used by..." columnar format as the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a> main table, and IMO might then become actually useful. Trying to "do it all" in one table obviously isn't working. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 14:33, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
