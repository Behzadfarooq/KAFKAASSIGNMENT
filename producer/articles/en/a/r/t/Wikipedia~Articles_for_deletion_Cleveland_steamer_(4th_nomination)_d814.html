<p>This is exactly the kind of article that <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a> cautions against. After a lot of good effort to improve and source the article, we are left with a bare dictionary definition, plus a rather short list of cultural references to the term (some of which don't refer to the term, but to the act only). The article includes references, but all the references are examples of use of the term, rather than <i>about</i> the term (as is specifically required for reliable sources about neologisms in <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. See my vote for specific criticism of the FCC document, which is the best source). The article was nominated for deletion before, three times, however, each of those nominations had a problem. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cleveland_steamer_9c10.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cleveland steamer">first</a> was based on an ill-advised attempt to censor WP. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cleveland_steamer_%28second_nomination%29_a4c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cleveland steamer (second nomination)">second</a> (no consensus) was perhaps the best, but several of the keep votes are based on the idea that the article could be expanded and sourced properly, and it's now 3 months later but this hasn't happened; the keeping of the article in the previous round was also a factor. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cleveland_steamer_%28third_nomination%29_6f2a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cleveland steamer (third nomination)">third</a> AfD was largely decided because of the outcome of the previous two, plus allegations of a bad faith nomination that led to a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Brian_G._Crawford_c88b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Brian G. Crawford">user conduct RFC</a>. The most recent nomination is now two months ago, so I feel it's time the community can give the issue a fresh look. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:53, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as nominator. Let me point out that the FCC source is not a reliable one. In it, a "cleveland steamer" is defined by a radio jockey in a transcript that the FCC includes in a document. The FCC document is not about cleveland steamers, but rather, includes the transcript to demonstrate the portion of the show the FCC objected to in fining the radio station for broadcasting it. The article uses this source to back up the definition of a Cleveland steamer.. however, the definition in this source is just given off-the-cuff by a DJ (with apparently very little certainty). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:53, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Although it is gross, and dubious in ever having actually occured, it is a widely known and used term. If references are needed ... oh God, I don't want to have to look any up ... eww. Nonetheless, it passes <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> with flying colours, and any other standard I could require it to uphold. If you don't buy the citations, that's one thing, but I'm sure it'll be easy enough to dig up ones everyone can agree on. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I would guess that it should pass <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> under the assumption that it's not a neologism - I don't believe it is, anyhow. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> may be a better argument, but the pop culture references may save it as <i>stub needing expansion instead</i>. It already has <i>4</i> references - while they may not be the highest quality, the do speak against it being a neologism and should get it past <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - given the current content. Is <i>Pop culture references</i> enough to make it fail <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a collection of indiscriminate information</a>?

<li><b>Comment</b>; whilst I do not wish to vote either way on the issue at present, this is the fourth AfD in just over 7 months. The last was two months ago, and was for "keep". Have things changed significantly since then? If not, I don't believe this AfD is justified.

<li>Yes, things have changed, namely, we've done the best we can to find sources and we still haven't. Also, two of those nominations were badly tainted debates.

It appears that <i>cleveland steamer</i> is exactly such a term: there is demonstrable use of the term, but it has not yet been the subject of any writing that Wikipedia can actually use as a source.

The current entry may be small in its encyclopaedic content (i.e. just appearences in pop culture) but it's not a straight dicdef. Plus, Urban dictionary is basically just for things that are made up, not for real, ordinary, widely used terms like <i>Cleveland Steamer</i>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 12:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Cleveland Steamer</i> is neither new, nor fringe. Of course it loses a google fight to <i>blowjob</i> - the porn content of the internet combined with the mainstream vs icky gives that an obvious edge.

<li><b>Keep</b> per WilyD and badlydrawnjeff, the term is real, it is notable, and is frequently used in pop culture, namely Tenacious D, Family Guy, and the article provides sources.

<li><b>Comment</b>: in case anyone needs <i>more</i> references, I was able to dig up two more, both of them nonfiction books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0312310846/ref=sib_aps_pg/104-2846206-1127130?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=%22cleveland%20steamer%22&amp;p=S07W&amp;checkSum=EkEwg85uyu%252BU1fBlEKJ4NVu9sk%252FCZx0IoYwTmQnDlIQ%253D" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0312310846/ref=sib_aps_pg/104-2846206-1127130?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=%22cleveland%20steamer%22&amp;p=S07W&amp;checkSum=EkEwg85uyu%252BU1fBlEKJ4NVu9sk%252FCZx0IoYwTmQnDlIQ%253D" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0922915997/ref=sib_aps_pg/104-2846206-1127130?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=%22cleveland%20steamer%22&amp;p=S02P&amp;checkSum=EkEwg85uyu9odKR%252BQtCKNLZRMgc1dxW1e%252FL84MT9zj8%253D" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0922915997/ref=sib_aps_pg/104-2846206-1127130?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=%22cleveland%20steamer%22&amp;p=S02P&amp;checkSum=EkEwg85uyu9odKR%252BQtCKNLZRMgc1dxW1e%252FL84MT9zj8%253D" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:09, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have to admit, you're good at what you do! Those are much better... at least we have reliable sources defining it now... whether that rises to the level of discussing the term, I'm not sure; they're pretty much straight definitions. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 03:11, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Let me be clear, though, I still think this should be deleted, because <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. WilyD says that the "cultural references" brings it past dicdef... but I could add a cultural references section to ANY dicdef. There are a lot more terms <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a> uses in the show, and they don't (and shouldn't) all have entries. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:53, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Silensor and newly found sources from badlydrawnjeff (although having never purchased from Amazon, I can't read them, it appears at least Mangojuice can.) <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenocidal_8f22.html" title="User:Genocidal">Genocidal</a> 05:19, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
