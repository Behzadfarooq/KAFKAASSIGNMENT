<p>The result was <b>keep</b>. Discounting the single-purpose account comments, and those based on <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a> arguments, there seems to be a consensus to keep. As noted, many lists have cut-off points for inclusion that are fairly arbitrary (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_major_opera_composers.html" title="List of major opera composers">this</a> featured list, for instance), and in itself this is not a reason for deletion (although the cut-off point will preferably have been chosen by consensus). It is verified and, as PeregrineFisher explains below, compiling a sourced list is not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Finally, as argued by Josiah Rowe, external sources have seen fit to compile lists, which indicates a level of notability. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 18:51, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> - this article has been nominated for deletion several times previously. All the previous AFDs are linked on the article's <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_films_that_most_frequently_use_the_word__fuck__2f4d.html" title="Talk:List of films that most frequently use the word &quot;fuck&quot;">talk page</a>. Having looked over the previous AFDs, many of the "keep"s strike me as variations of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. First, the article uses an arbitrary standard of inclusion, that being 100 or more uses of the term. There is nothing inherently more notable about films that use the word 100 times than one with 50 or 75 or 99 uses. There is no context or sourced analysis offered in the article explaining why 100 or more uses of the word "fuck" in a film is significant either within the works of fiction or in the real world. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Agree with the nom. Further, it's not clear why we should have a list for "fuck" and not "shit" or any of a number of one's 'favorite' racial, religious, or ethnic slurs.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I don't think the criteria is arbitary ("fuck" is commonly accepted as the strongest English curse), and unlike the other plethora of film lists up for deletion, this list is totally objective and maintainable. However, merely stating that a film uses "fuck" a lot is not enough; you need sources to back that up. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 07:05, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am torn - I don't think the article should be kept on the basis of "I like it." However, it is sourced, factual, well put-together, and in good shape as an article. The question then becomes, is it notable? Certainly many people treat this word as a sort of totem and make a big deal out of its use in pop culture, and the Family Media Guide cares enough to actually document its usage in great detail. I lean toward keeping. -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 17:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Hmm. It's far better sourced and more strictly defined than most of these "List of movies" articles showing up, so it has that in its favor. However I have to question the usefuless of such an article in an encyclopedia. In spite of the sourcing and rigorous definition it still smacks of arbitrary inclusion rules as well as being nothing more than a list of loosely related topics - those movies really have little in common other than prolific use of the word. Perhaps the top few could warrant a section on the <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a> article (if it isn't already, I've not looked). But I have to concur with Otto4711 and agree with deletion. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 18:28, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article on the word fuck discusses its significance quite well. The article on movies that make use of the word fuck... well, the link speaks for itself. GassyGuy 19:42, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I see the objections, but the page is well referenced and non-arbitrary (as JuJube indicates). Put it this way: if a cultural phenomenon is notable enough to have been satirized as far back as 1982 (see our article on <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Life%2C_the_Universe_and_Everything_6067.html" title="Life, the Universe and Everything">Life, the Universe and Everything</a></i>), it's notable enough to have a Wikipedia article. In other words: <b>Keep</b>, per <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Adams_4bdd.html" title="Douglas Adams">Douglas Adams</a>. â€”<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 19:58, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is arbitrary, because it sets a standard for inclusion with no explanation. Only films with 100 or more uses may be included and the article makes no case for why 100 uses of the word "fuck" is notable enough for inclusion while a film with even one less usage is not. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:34, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, that particular criterion is arbitrary â€” but that's not an argument for deletion, it's an argument for reconsidering the criterion within the article. The main issue is whether "films that use the word 'fuck' a lot" are noteworthy as a category, and the answer â€” as indicated by the cited sources in the article â€” is yes. It's true that 100 uses is an arbitrary line â€” you could just as easily list the "100 films that use the word 'fuck' most frequently" or something â€” but the core concept is one that's not arbitrary and even, dare I say it, encyclopedic. â€”<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 04:53, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While I disagree with your conclusion, even if the arbitrariness of inclusion based on the number of uses were not an issue, the article still lacks sourced analysis explaining why the use of the word a great many times is significant and it still amounts to a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRdirectory" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRdirectory</a> tying together films which have no thematic similarity and have nothing in common other than having the word "fuck" in them a lot.

Do they have any commonality at all other than the word? This list is no different than List of films with the word The in the title or List of films that have blue things in them. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:19, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it's substantially different â€” because reliable external sources have categorized films by the frequency of their use of the word "fuck". If the article were not sourced, or if the sources were not reliable, your argument might hold water. But the fact that the Family Media Guide and Screen It! Entertainment Reviews have chosen to record this data indicates that it is a meaningful criterion. If there were a noteworthy and reliable index of films with the word "The" in the title, there would be an argument for having Wikipedia articles on those topics as well. â€”<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 05:22, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If it is arbitrary, it isn't very arbitrary, and limiting it to 100 uses within a film is probably based on what can be verified (that is, when it is enough times to make <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> sources count and document the number of uses). I'd rather think that NOT having any lower limit would be FAR more likely to run afoul of Wikipedia policy (because then it could be argued that the list could keep growing forever and could potentially hold thousands of films with little in common). <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 04:33, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think it's a bit hypocritical for the Wikipedia community to keep a list of movies that use the F-word, while deleting other movie lists (movies that involve guessing a password, movies that feature an amputee, and so on) If this article is somehow worthy because it's well organized, then triviality has nothing to do with it, and the other articles should stay. I don't personally see how the F-word as the basis for maintaining a movie list is any less arbitrary than the others.

<li>Who says that the subjects of lists need to have <b>two</b> thing in common? What these films have in common is that they use the word fuck a very large number of times.

<li>Who says? Wikipedia policy says that Wikipedia is not for lists of loosely associated topics. If the only point of commonality between the items on this list are that they have people saying "fuck" a lot, the items on the list are too loosely associated. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:43, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me summarize your argument: (1) "a high frequency of 'fuck' is a loose association" (assumption); (2) WP excludes loosely-associated lists (policy); (3) therefore a list of films with a high frequency of 'fuck' should be excluded (conclusion). That's a very nice argument <i>iff</i> you can support the first assumption, which I'm pretty sure WP policy says nothing about. That assumption is you personal opinion and it does no good to keep repeating it <i>over and over</i> again without providing an explanation that justifies the claim that that is indeed a loose association. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:59, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>How exactly else would "loose association" be defined if not as a grouping of things with little or nothing in common? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:49, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is the exact definition of "loose association". But what I'm disputing is your assumption that having a high frequency of a certain word use is equivalent to having "little or nothing in common". That's still an assumption, which you have not justified. Also note please that there is a lot more similarity between the top 10 films on thist list than between the top 10 on this list and <i><a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinderella.html" title="Cinderella">Cinderella</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Little_Mermaid_cead.html" title="The Little Mermaid">The Little Mermaid</a></i>. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Where is your rebuttal of the presumption? "No it isn't" is not an argument anywhere outside a Monty Python sketch. As for the top ten films having more in common with each other than with Disney flicks, that's a nonsense argument. The question is not whether the films more closely resemble each other than they do other films. The question is whether they are closely associated enough amongst themselves. And the top ten films are a documentary about the word "fuck," a mockumentary about two beer-drinking headbangers, a drama about an abusive husband, a Mafia crime drama, a fictionalized account of a drug-dealing kidnapper, an adaptation of an Iraqi marine's memoir, a comedy about a pair of hooligan twins, the story of the Son of Sam killings, a Martin Lawrence concert film and the true story of a mob informer. Of those films, exactly two of them share any commonality of theme or plot with each other. Where exactly is the vast reach of commonality that connects these films outside the word "fuck"? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My rebuttal is this: Why do they need to share anything else? There's plenty of published sources on <i>that alone</i>. We should, as WP editors, <i>try</i> to avoid (I realize that sometimes it's inevitable and/or necessary) setting our own (subjective) standards on such things as the strength of association or notability. There are articles about the usage of the word 'fuck' in film (<a href="http://www.erenkrantz.com/Humor/SevenDirtyWords.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.erenkrantz.com/Humor/SevenDirtyWords.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), sources whose sole purpose is to document the frequency of usage of various "profane" words (<a href="http://www.familymediaguide.com/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.familymediaguide.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) or who otherwise gather/present such information (<a href="http://www.screenit.com/movies/1998/nil_by_mouth.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.screenit.com/movies/1998/nil_by_mouth.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>)--although why "God", "Jesus", and "Christ" are included as profane words by "<a href="http://www.familymediaguide.com" class="external free" title="http://www.familymediaguide.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.familymediaguide.com</a>" is beyond me. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why do they need to share anything else? Because things that are not in loose association with each other tend to have more than one point of commonality. As for avoiding subjective standards, I agree that's a good thing. Which is why the entirely arbitrary and subjective standard set by this article (100 or more "fuck"s for inclusion) are yet one more insurmountable problem with the article. As for there existing websites and organizations that bean-count dirty words, I have not disputed that such sites exist. The <i>still unanswered</i> point is that within the article there is no <i>sourced analysis</i>. Counting up the number of a specific word in a movie is not <i>sourced analysis</i>. I've asked any number of times for the <i>sourced analysis</i> of the multiple use of the word "fuck" in a movie and you have yet to provide any. Are you conceding that there isn't any? Are you ignoring this repeated request? Is there something else going on? Where is the <i>sourced analysis</i>? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Otto, if reliable sources external to Wikipedia indicate that a single criterion is noteworthy, then it's sufficiently noteworthy for our purposes. Just because there is no sourced analysis of that criterion's significance does not mean that the criterion is arbitrary. If sourced analysis of <i>why</i> a statistic is important were a requirement for all Wikipedia lists, we'd have to delete every page in <a href="../../../s/p/o/Category%7ESports-related_lists_86b3.html" title="Category:Sports-related lists">Category:Sports-related lists</a>. There's no sourced analysis of why the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_National_Football_League_quarterbacks_who_have_thrown_at_least_100_career_touchdowns_f2c6.html" title="List of National Football League quarterbacks who have thrown at least 100 career touchdowns">List of National Football League quarterbacks who have thrown at least 100 career touchdowns</a> is a noteworthy criterion for quarterbacks, but that page provides a link to an almanac site that categorizes quarterbacks in that manner. Similarly, this page has links to organizations that categorize films by the frequency of use of the word "fuck". It may seem arbitrary to <i>you</i>, but the existence of the reliable external sources proves that it's not arbitrary by the standards set by Wikipedia. It might be <i>nice</i> if we had some analysis of <i>why</i> a particular criterion is noteworthy, but the absence of that analysis is not a sufficient justification for deletion. â€”<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 05:17, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sports-related lists are not about works of fiction, therefore fall under different guidelines, therefore are not germane to this discussion. And I dispute the notion that because a bean-counting website or two tots up the raw number of f-bombs in a film that makes it notable for our purposes. If a website totaled up the number of ceiling tiles that appeared in a bunch of films, would that confer notability? If it totaled up the number of paper clips in a chain in a bunch of films, would that conver notability? If it totalled up the number of times the word "blue" or "sailboat" or "President Bush" appeared in a film, would that confer notability? No. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:23, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said elsewhere, I don't see any evidence that the writers of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> were thinking about almanac-style lists when they called for "sourced analysis". Also, please notice that some of the films on this list, including the <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck_%28film%29.html" title="Fuck (film)">#1 entry</a>, are documentaries, not works of fiction, making your attempt at applying <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> even more absurd.<br />
As for notability: notability on Wikipedia is established by what external reliable sources say. So, yes, if a reliable source counted ceiling tiles or the word "sailboat" in films, that might make it notable for Wikipedia's purposes. This seems absurd, but that's because our culture considers ceiling tiles and the word "sailboat" much less notable than the word "fuck" in the context of films. The MPAA doesn't rate films based on the number of ceiling tiles or the word "sailboat", but the use of the word "fuck" is one of their criteria for film ratings. In part because of that criterion, reliable external sources have taken to tallying up the frequency of its use. If it were not notable, the "bean-counting websites" would not exist.

<ul>
<li>Hmm. So counting "sailboats" or "President Bushes" don't get counted because our culture (and which culture is that, exactly? The phrase "Our culture" seems to have systemic bias issues) doesn't consider it the same as "fuck." Yet the lack of cultural context in the article is OK? That seems...flawed as an argument somehow. And, bean counting websites count the word because it's notable, but notability is established by the existence of the bean-counting websites? <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_logic.html" title="Circular logic">Circular logic</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it's not circular. The beginning is the culture-at-large (and since we're talking about English-language films, it's not systemic bias for us to speak of the common culture of Anglophone nations). As individuals at Wikipedia we cannot and should not attempt to determine what is and is not notable by merely using our own judgments. We can only judge notability based on external criteria, the most important of which is whether notable external sources have written on the subject. Notability flows from the culture (primary source) to external sources (secondary sources) to Wikipedia (tertiary source). POV problems arise when we attempt to judge the culture-at-large directly, unmediated by secondary sources. But if the secondary sources exist and are considered reliable by a consensus of Wikipedians, then they may be interpreted as a reasonable measure of the culture-at-large.<br />
In the context of a <i>list</i>, the question is not "Have notable external sources written essays about <i>why</i> this is important?", but "Have notable external sources catalogued this information?" If we were discussing a hypothetical article on profanity in film, you would be correct in calling for sources analyzing the cultural context. But since this is merely a <b>list</b>, all that is needed to establish notability is the <i>existence</i> of reliable external sources cataloguing the data. â€”<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 22:40, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I am saying that in the absence of sourced third-party analysis attesting to the significance of the word fuck <i>in the context either of the films, the films in relation to each other or the real world</i> the list is untenable. I have asked a number of times how various films on this list are rendered similar by the repeated "fuck"s. No answer to that question. I've offered examples of several other potential lists of films and of other objects which would not stand under Wikipedia guidelines and asked how this list differs from those. No answer. I've asked for a source which offers analysis of the repetition of the word within the films, between the films or in the real world.

<li>How they've been "rendered similar by the repeated 'fuck's"? That itself is one similarity!

How could this be significant to anyone? How about considering it in the context of the increasing commonality/acceptance of profanity on televsion?

<li>OK, let's consider the topic in terms of the increasing commonality and acceptance of profanity on television. What does the article say about the number of times the word fuck is in a <i>theatrical</i> film and the increasing commonality and acceptance of profanity on television... Huh. The article doesn't seem to say <i>anything</i> about the use of the word fuck in theatrical films and the increasing commonality and acceptance of profanity on television! In fact, the article doesn't say <i>anything at all</i> about the use of the word "fuck" <i>anywhere</i>, other than listing off times that it happens. Well, you know, all sorts of things happen. They happen even more frequently than "fuck" does in a film and there aren't Wikipedia articles about them. Which, even if you somehow can't grasp number of "fuck"s in a film is a loose association, the article, as I have noted a number of times with no rebuttal, is completely free of any context as to why "fuck" in a film is important. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:36, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

My refutation of your charge of violating <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> has been to demand proof that this constitutes a "loose association", which you have not furnished to my satisfaction (I ask again: how does a <i>list</i> whose subject has been extensively covered in outside sources and which 2 commonalities--films and frequency of 'fuck's--qualify as "loose association"?). As for <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, huh?? Exactly what is the POV that is being advanced? Pro-100ism vs. Anti-99ism?

This article does not deal with "Major characters", "Minor characters", or "Plot summaries".

<li>The POV that's being advanced is that 100 uses of the word is significant while fewer uses of the word is not. There is no rational basis for that assertion (unless you can point to some reliable source that supports the notion that triple digits is significant but double digits isn't). And your constant "proveitproveitproveit" which in my opinion (which under the humorous essay <a href="../../../t/r/u/WP%7ETRUTH_309e.html" title="WP:TRUTH">WP:TRUTH</a> is every bit as true as yours) amounts to little more than "nuh uh." I have explained by analogy. I have explained that the films share no elements of plot, style or setting in the majority of cases. I have shown that these items have nothing in common other than the presence of a word (and yes, that they are films, which, duh, it's a list of films).

<li>I agree with Black Falcon â€” there's nothing at <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> that applies to an almanac-style list of this type. Also, Otto's repitition of "100 is an arbitrary number" is becoming tiresome â€” the same could be said of <i>any</i> almanac-style list with an arbitrary cut-off point, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_highest-grossing_films.html" title="List of highest-grossing films">List of highest-grossing films</a> (why the top 50?) or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_National_Football_League_quarterbacks_who_have_thrown_at_least_100_career_touchdowns_f2c6.html" title="List of National Football League quarterbacks who have thrown at least 100 career touchdowns">List of National Football League quarterbacks who have thrown at least 100 career touchdowns</a> (it's right there in the title).

<li>Agree with Otto. It's not the frequency of use but the context that determines the meaning of the F-word. There's a big difference between a soldier getting a finger shot off, a sexual predator telling a little girl what he's going to do to her, and a comedian throwing a word in for effect, that the mere act of counting the number of times the word is used without regard for the context is the very definition of trivial. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 04:12, 25 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

The lower bound of the list being arbitrary is irrelevant to this discussion, and applies to all top/most lists in general.

<li>No one appears to be arguing that the word "fuck" is not of cultural significance. The question that I keep asking, and which no one seems able to answer, is regarding the cultural significance of the use of the word "fuck" <i>100 or more times in a movie</i>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:58, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this list is useful, well-cited, extremely well-written and of cultural significance. So far, I haven't seen any reasons given to delete it that make sense according to Wikipedia policy as I understand it. Please make sure that you actually read the article before voting, I rather suspect that a number of the "delete" votes here are basing their opinions on the name of the article alone, which does sound a bit iffy until you actually read the article. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 18:15, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If the list is of such cultural significance, then where is the sourced analysis within the article that explains its cultural significance? Surely for a list of such weighty cultural importance, it should be simplicity itself to point to a sourced analysis that explains why it's important that such-and-such movie used the word "fuck" eleventy-seven times, but the article is curiously lacking.</li>

<li>Well, so far I've offered examples of films from the list that have no relation to each other besides using the word a lot and there's been no refutation of it other than your saying "that doesn't prove anything" without offering up the slightest counter-argument.

<li>You have reiterated your opinion that the frequency of the word's usage is a "loose" association without actually justifying this opinion. Your statements assume <i>a priori</i> that this is a loose association, whereas what they should do is <i>reach this conclusion</i> (which justifies deletion) based on an initial set of premises. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The premise is, <i>look at the articles for the films</i>. Look at the plots, the themes, the settings. Do they share anything in common outside the word "fuck"? Your own top ten challenge shows exactly how loose the association is. Of the top ten films on the list, exactly two of them share any measure of plot, setting or theme, Goodfellas and Casino. None of the others bear any resemblance to those films or to each other. The films are the premise and the conclusion is they are not related to each other. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I ask again: why do they need to share anything besides the frequent of use the word 'fuck'? There is plenty of published material on that narrow subject alone. Please see my response above. Also, for the sake of brevity, I suggest we confine any further comments to one place as it's somewhat pointless to repeat similar points in three separate places in the article (and also out of consideration for the closing admin). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I had to use this page as jumping off point to find some more information and found it quite valuable. The loss of this page would be detrimental to wikipedia as a whole. 68.103.207.65 16:48, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There have been some well-reasoned delete votes and almost no compelling reason to keep. The vast majority of keep votes are completely insubstantial. That being said, my reason to delete is that this violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The data is sourced, but there is no source for compiling the data in this manner and making this conclusion about it - that makes it original research and it is prohibited. You need to find reliable sources that compile and analyze the usage of the word "fuck" in films, its effects, and even more important, why the word "fuck" is worth studying over others at this particular threshold. Otherwise, it is pure WP:OR. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMus_Musculus_8efa.html" title="User:Mus Musculus">Mus Musculus</a> 19:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Compiling a sourced list is not OR. This page does not introduce any theories, define new terms, introduce any arguments, or introduce an analysis or synthesis of published facts, opinions, or arguments in a way that advances a position. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 20:49, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
