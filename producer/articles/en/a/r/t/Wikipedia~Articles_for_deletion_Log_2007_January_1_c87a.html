<li><b>Comment</b> It says in the intro that there are 37,000 players. Is that notable for a video game? It seems like a big number, but I've never played an online game other than chess, so I'd like a second opinion. If it is a large number for its kind, then it should probably stay because of its notability in numbers. <b><a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>)</b> 03:59, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Numbers are irrelevant- it's sources that matter. The reason people sometimes mention numbers is because typically as a game gets very large, the likelihood of sources existing goes up. That being said, there are none that I could find. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 17:48, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's the "idol worship" part which suggested the attack angle to me (standard accusation from critics that Catholic Church engages in idolatory of the Virgin Mary).

<dd>Indeed, good point. Though with Karken's assertion, while it's clearly not nonsense, it does beg the question as to whether a db-bio would be even remotely appropriate.

<dd>Please help me out to keep this article. I do not know what to do to save this entry. I started this lemma just minutes ago and was buissy with editing as someone already want it for deletion.</dd>
<dd>2007 has been recognised as an official UN Year of the Dolphins and has only began today and therefore there is not much information available yet for the moment; just some basic facts. As the year will be continuing, international organisations, countries, media etc. will organise activities or pay attantion to it. So then thereafter there will be more possibilities to write and adjust this lemma in Wikipedia. - (Brabo 02:41, 1 January 2007 (UTC))

<dd>Brabo, I wouldn't worry quite so much -- the consensus so far is universally "keep" except for the nominator. I think that if you found some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">third-party independent references</a> such as articles in major newspapers (preferably linkable) that there would be no real objection. That said, I'll do some cleanup to bring the article more in line with house style. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:22, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> There is nothing notable about the woman's disappearance. People go missing everyday. It may be notable for that local area, but it is not notable outside of that local area. Also, there are no articles about the club outside of a mention that this missing woman owned it. No verifiability means no article. It was said that the article could be made verifiable (or was verifiable), but there are no sources cited nor found about the club. We can't keep everything on the grounds that there <i>might</i> be sources. No one is base their arguements on anything besides "oh, it's notable and verifiable". How is it notable? How is the notability verifiable? Again, a missing woman does not make everything connected to her notable. None of the arguements are based on policy, nor do they provide refuting evidence against the policies that are listed. For an uncited article to be able to survive on the principle that it is verifiable, just not verified, requires some showing that sources are reasonably likely to exist and can be resonably easily found by a person who is not from the area and knows nothing about the owner. The keep arguements say "It's notable" but are not providing proof of this with any sources. You are ignored the issue of verifiablility which is NOT optional or negotiable. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 18:27, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Unverified claims of notability. The owner disappearing does not make the club notable (A local bar owner disappeared a few years ago and is still missing but that is does not make him or the bar notable. Many people go missing every day from every social standing.) Notability is a guideline but <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is a POLICY that no article can ignore. <a href="../../../d/g/f/WP%7EDGFA_21d3.html" title="WP:DGFA">Deletion Guidelines for administrators</a> quite clearly states:</li>

You can't ignore the fact that there are no news stories on the club itself. What I am saying is, again, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> can not be ignored. Where are the articles on the club and only the club? The "best you have" is, I'm sorry to say, not good enough to pass one of wikipedia's main pillars. The news story doesn't even mention the club. It mentions an address where the car was found but nothing on the club. All the articles found are about the owner disappearing. It's a local story about a missing woman. Nothing notable about her.

<li><b>comment</b> kinda seems backwards. Most of the 'sources' being supplied or cited in the article (or here) are about the owner, and the only sources about the club are a blog and the own club's website. The owner is more referenced (mainly from sources that do not meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) than the club, yet she is the blurb on the club's page? Now even if we reversed it, I would still list the article for AfD (and follow up with a deletion review if it was kept by the closing admin) but it just strikes me as funny. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 00:39, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's an unconfirmed sequel of a game that just came out. The <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> tag I added was contested, and the tag was added a second time shortly after that. Because a contested Prod should go to AfD, I'm listing it here.

<li>The article said he started with a rating of 1933 and increased over 500 points to 1484. Surely these numbers are garbled or reversed. I also don't know what the Indian ratings mean.

<p>This isn't the kind of topic I like to nominate; it's just too subjective to be encyclopedic.

The fluid and usually informal nature of women's appearances in combat situations make inclusion standards deeply problematic. Would <i><a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_Metal_Jacket_35d6.html" title="Full Metal Jacket">Full Metal Jacket</a></i> qualify because of the female sniper in the final scene? Would the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_resistance.html" title="French resistance">French resistance</a> scene put <i><a href="../../../p/l/e/Plenty_%28film%29.html" title="Plenty (film)">Plenty</a></i> on this list?

<p>uninteresting, incomplete, potentially enormous... It may be tilting at windmills to try to get rid of this, but this list has such vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion that it could potentially grow to literally tens of thousands of entries, or more, and still be incomplete. And to what purpose? The result would be of mild interest, at best. I think this sort of thing is better served through categories. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 10:14, 1 January 2007 (UTC) Oh, and there are presently NO sources or references in the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> Potentially endless, badly referenced list containing too many dubious items. Romania named after Romulus? Erm, no. Neither, most probably, was Rome. The list fails to distinguish between mythological etymologies made up later in an attempt to explain place names ("Europe" from "Europa") and bona fide toponyms from real historical characters (Washington).

<li><b>Comment</b>. This really does not work. For a start, you have missed out places between countries and towns such as Australian states. Secondly you have not defined what a town or city is. A complete list would be very much longer and it is still impossible to get complete. Everywhere there are hundreds of towns that are not on the list. Also every entry will need a reference so they will be as long as the list. It is monster that serves no usefull purpose. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 11:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Two years ago, this article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Electric_Universe_concept_b0ef.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric Universe concept">nominated</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Electric_Universe_model_e183.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric Universe model">for deletion</a>, and no consensus was reached. The community has given enough time for supporters of keeping the article to make their additions and referencing to keep the article, but it is now more clear than ever that this article should be deleted on grounds of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">non-notability</a>, and it being impossible to reach standards required of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliability</a>. As <a href="../../../z/o/w/User%7EZowie_174c.html" title="User:Zowie">another editor</a> stated: "EU seems to be notable primarily in the minds of the advocates, and scientifically it is less notable than the sum of its parts."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electric_universe_%28concept%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97649600" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electric_universe_%28concept%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97649600" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> Any information contained in the article that is relevant to uncontroversial science (e.g. descriptions of plasma, z-pinches, or electric discharge) is already present at the relevant articles. Here are the reasons for deletion of the rest of the content:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article is written mostly by supporters and advocates of the concept which is a definite <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a></li>
<li>There are only two people who currently publish ideas of the "electric universe" and both of those people (Scott and Thornhill) publish exclusively on the internet or vanity presses. Despite being ostensibly "scientific" the concept has received no peer review. This makes their ideas <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</li>
<li>The article includes very misleading <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> amalgamations of various citations gleaned from mainstream sources in attempt to pass a veneer of respectability for the subject. This original research amalgamation includes using as "sources" papers written by Nobel laureate <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannes_Alfven_8b4b.html" title="Hannes Alfven">Hannes Alfven</a> and descriptive links to <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> press releases. However, neither of these sources was/is aware let alone actually supported/supports the ideas of Thornhill and Scott.</li>
<li>Contributors who support and advocate EU have falsely claimed that this subject has been subject to peer review research. In fact, every IEEE transaction paper the contributor listed to show evidence of "notability" is not about "electric universe" but rather about <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> (a different idea). Just recently, this charge was reinvorgated with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AElectric_universe_%28concept%29&amp;diff=97203764&amp;oldid=97201679" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AElectric_universe_%28concept%29&amp;diff=97203764&amp;oldid=97201679" rel="nofollow">false claim</a> that will be subject to a future peer-reviewed publication. This assertion also is in reference to <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a>. As such the "electric universe" has no single paper subject to peer review about its ideas.</li>
<li>For a <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">fringe</a> idea like this to be included in Wikipedia it has to have some recognition from the mainstream whether it be internet memes, the media, the scientific community, etc. In fact, there has been absolutely no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> nor <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> independent review of this idea since it is <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">not</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/WP%7ESCI_649f.html" title="WP:SCI">notable</a>. There is only one single piece of press that this idea ever received, and this piece of press is neither a notable nor a directly relevant example. The press was a single, non-notable article in Wired Magazine about an exchange on internet message boards between proponents of this idea and amateur space enthusiasts, obviously reporting of this sort violates Wikipedia's <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">internet verifiability rules</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliability concerns</a>. As such the subject fully and completely defies <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> in the "media recognition" category as well.</li>
<li>As stated by <a href="../../../z/o/w/User%7EZowie_174c.html" title="User:Zowie">another editor</a>: "As it is, the article has an alarming tendency to grow into a mat of poorly-connected references into holoscience.com and thunderbolts.info, and normal editing is impossible."</li>

<li><b><del>Keep and stubify</del>Delete without prejudice</b> Here's the problem. It appears that the subject has been noted by the press, as evidenced by links such as <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/space/0,2697,68258,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.wired.com/news/space/0,2697,68258,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/news/space/0,2697,68258,00.html</a> ... I think the article probably needs to be marked as potential pseudoscience, and described as unsupported by the general scientific community--but if a theory, even a hopelessly flawed and controversial one has received some press attention, then I think it needs to stay. Wired is a fairly notable source to have written about it. Therefore other people might come to Wikipedia trying to learn more about it, and they should probably learn that it is considered pseudoscience by most reliable sources. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:22, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We've been talking about the criteria for notability for scientific theories over at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28science%29_196b.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (science)">a project page</a>, and the question of how much press coverage is sufficient to make a theory notable. To me, a single mention -- in the context of "internet kook" news -- in Wired is insufficient really to make something notable, and the current criteria of "ongoing coverage" seems much more reasonable. In any case, do join the discussion over at that linked page on proposed criteria. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 18:16, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It is extremely difficult to create such an article for a theory that isn't completely incoherent like <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>. In my experience, such an article can only be created when the supporters of the concept are either banned for some reason, or banned by the ArbCom from editing articles on the topic. Even then, a fundamental problem with writing that sort of article is that while the pseudoscientists write copious amounts, there generally are not enough people who care about the topic to write proper debunkings, and most reliable sources don't consider the subject pseudoscience in a verifiable manner, since they either don't care or have never heard of the topic. This seems to be the case here: there simply is not a large enough corpus of critical material to create an article that treats the subject from a popular culture point of view. I think this criteria might be a good measurement of whether an pseudotheory is notable from a popular culture perspective: if a pseudotheory is notable enough in the media, it must have reached enough people who care enough to write debunkings. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 19:34, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>External sites appear to contain thorough debunkings, such as <a href="http://www.geocities.com/kingvegeta80/pseudoscience.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/kingvegeta80/pseudoscience.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/kingvegeta80/pseudoscience.html</a> and New Scientist seemed to think the issue was controversial enough to accept for publication some sort of "Open letter" on the subject. If you search on "Electric Universe" via google right now, the first link you get is the holoscience.com pseudoscience site; Wikipedia is third in line. I'm troubled by the idea that someone might hear about the "theory" and then search for it, and only find these other sites, with Wikipedia silent on the issue. If we allow articles on Wikipedia about malware (destructive software programs) with warnings about them, isn't it helpful to have articles about pseudoscience (with appropriate warnings) so that people can quickly learn that that these are merely the ideas of a few vocal people on the fringe? I'd be willing to switch over to Delete if I can be persuaded that there truly is no interest in the media for debunking and/or commenting on this subject, but I am concerned about removing it purely on the basis that it is an incorrect/implausible/pseudoscientific theory when it could simply be described as such. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 20:11, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>My suggestion here would be for you to start rewriting the article <i>now</i> from a popular culture perspective. The new article could be significantly shorter, so it shouldn't be so hard to do. There have been AfDs in the past which have gone from 95% of users being for deletion to being kept after such a rewrite. If you can rewrite the article to assert notability in the media, include proper criticism, exclude long passages purporting to be science, and cover the history and popularity of the pseudotheory, I believe you will find that most users here will change their votes. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 20:15, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or merge, but warn and truncate</b> I think the Electric Universe concept and websites are real stinkers, but that doesn't mean it is best to have no WP article about them. Capital punishment is final has not ongoing educational value. Better to hold the troublemaker in stocks in a corner of the village square so everyone can get a good look at him/her and his/her type.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest starting the article with the mainstream position: This theory is not regarded as having any scientific validity etc. etc. Then let the proponents have their say, briefly describing how their theory differs from others, and linking to their site. Its not reasonable to expect WP to give more space than that to a concept which is extremely non-conventional and lacking scientific notability. But that doesn't mean all mention of it should be expunged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Keeping a brief article with a non-conventional warning at the top is helpful for anyone consulting WP to find out something reasonably reliable about the concept.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the concept of "Electric Universe" probably meets the proposed criteria 6 or 7 at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SCIENCE" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SCIENCE" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SCIENCE</a>: "It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being found within a notable work of fiction." and/or "It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities." since there are far too many (20,000) Google hits for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Electric+Universe%22+Plasma" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Electric+Universe%22+Plasma" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Electric+Universe%22+Plasma</a> for the concept to be regarded as not accepted or discussed by a significant number of people. (Unless it could be shown that most of this was generated by the concept's proponents.) Maybe it is a work of fiction, presented as scientific fact, with the intention of selling books, or gaining speaking engagements in the New Age scene. (Though if the books Amazon sales rank of &gt;1,000,000 and <a href="http://www.fonerbooks.com/surfing.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.fonerbooks.com/surfing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fonerbooks.com/surfing.htm</a> are to be believed, they are only selling a handful a year at Amazon.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Overall, I think people who want to keep Wikipedia's science pages pure and completely uncluttered by even brief mention of challenging perspectives, including annoying lunacy, are swimming against the tide. The Internet is full of *stuff*. Human beliefs are messy. The best way to cope with contrary voices is to let them say a few words and give a link to their website - or link to a website where they are saying all they like. Pretending the voices don't exist, or that they WP is lofty enough to refuse to mention them at all, seems silly to me.</dd>

<dd>Good science isn't going to be harmed by clearly labelled links to sites which are radically at odds with mainstream thinking.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I know this topic is contentious, and that it has been the focal point of two ArbCom cases. I know that is going to make for an unpleasant task for the closing admin. But I simply cannot see any way that this article, and through it, this topic, meets inclusion standards. <i>As a scientific theory</i>, it does not approach the standards bar. The two sources overwhelmingly cited in its defense are thunderbolts.info and the journal Kronos. The website is not a reliable source as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> understands it; indeed, a case could be argued that the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Extremist_sources" title="WP:RS">guidelines for extremist sources</a> (that they "should be used only as primary sources; that is, they should only be used as sources about themselves and their activities, and even then should be used with caution") should apply to the dedicated websites of <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">fringe science</a> proponents. Likewise, Kronos is not an established, peer-reviwed, scientific journal as either Wikipedia or the physics community understands such ideas. Per the ArbCom ruling on Pseudoscience, neither such source is appropriate documentation for a science article. This topic <i>could</i> be written as a popular culture article, but currently the single reference to <i>Wired</i> is insufficient to meet the standard of multiple, independent, non-trivial references. On the other hand, the arguments to keep this article seem to fall back on a professional version of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> (sometimes drifting towards <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:IWROTEIT</a>) or an appeal to <a href="../../../c/e/n/WP%7ECENSOR_1cbe.html" title="WP:CENSOR">Wikipedia's status as non-censored content</a>.

<li><b>edit and keep</b>.I do not agree with some of the comments above , though they are made by people with whom I usually do agree. I do not find the article in its existing form the least sympathetic to the theory; the lead paragraph in particular is written with a POV which I can best characterise as <i>amused contempt</i>. The article is overbalanced by the discussion about deep impact, which may have been an interesting potential test case, but arguably an inconclusive one, as the concept/theory is so inspecific as to be able to explain away almost anything. The discussions of other elements of physics amounts to an assertion that the conventional theories are right--it is necessary to at least cite a demonstration of this, but--as noted above--few qualified people have taken this seriously enough to explain the errors. Though not a physicist, I have enough knowledge of science to interpret the material presented as demonstrating the theory (or concept) to be utter nonsense, and I think anyone with a college physics course would judge the same. Personally, I am not in the least amused by pseudoscience, and have an definite prejudice against it, as I consider the public knowledge of genuine science tenuous enough without introducing additional confusion. But I think assertions that it is non-notable a little absurd after the "Wired" article. I think assertions of verifiability equally absurd: the question is nt to demonstrate that the theory is right, but to demonstrate what the theory is, and the sources do that in a very full manner. it can't be OR either, as the theory is based upon whim entirely, with no research of any sort being evident. We do not refute nonsense by hiding it--we refute nonsense by exposing it. Exposing it means first displaying, and then discussing. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:51, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article should be deleted as it is an article of a single episode of a TV series - therefore (in my opinion) is notable enough to have an article on its own. The information contained within this article is quite similar to that of the actual <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nanny_%28TV_series%29_3b86.html" title="The Nanny (TV series)">The Nanny (TV series)</a> article, with a few exceptions. It is my opinion that this article should be deleted, or have its contents summarised, and added to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nanny_%28TV_series%29_3b86.html" title="The Nanny (TV series)">The Nanny (TV series)</a> - creating a redirect. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisch_fedd.html" title="User:Chrisch">Chrisch</a> 13:38, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment/question to administrators:</b> Just wondering, what is the official Wikipedia policy on articles written about individual episodes of (long running) television series'? It just seems that contents of such articles could be summarised in about a sentence or so on the proper article about the entire TV series, rather than having potentially hundreds of articles relating to each show on television... I'm just asking this because the article's creator is making more articles of this type (such as <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_Gets_in_Your_Lies_617b.html" title="Smoke Gets in Your Lies">Smoke Gets in Your Lies</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Fair_Nanny_dc76.html" title="My Fair Nanny">My Fair Nanny</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nuchslep_63e1.html" title="The Nuchslep">The Nuchslep</a>, so I think we need an administrator's opinion on what should happen to articles of this nature.<br />
<br />
A guideline has been created about the TV series "Lost", and it is quoted below:<br />
<br />
"In lieu of Episodes of Lost (season X), Lost season X may be created, consisting of a summary of the main themes and developments of the season, for the reader who wants a broad overview before diving into the individual articles. These season wraparound articles should be relatively brief, link to the individual episode articles where appropriate, and should not attempt to summarize individual episodes but rather emphasize broad themes, plot arcs and character developments." (copied from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lost_%28season_1%29___Lost_%28season_2%29___Lost_%28season_3%29_376a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lost (season 1) / Lost (season 2) / Lost (season 3)">here</a>)</li>

<li>The reason not to have both is that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information and IMHO these lists are exactly that.

And in some of these cases, I'd say a list would be a better idea since not all of the names deserve an article. The content is another issue, and one that should be referred to with cleanup. And indeed, I won't say I've reviewed all of those items. You nominated over a dozens articles. If you want people to judge those lists on their own merits, then nominate them individually. I decline to participate in this discussion in any way except the nomination, which objects to the concept of it. I don't.

<li><b>Keep</b>, oh the irony of using indiscriminate AfD listings to try to eliminate list articles for being indiscriminate lists! To be honest, I don't find the nominator's listing of each list article on an individual AfD page any more illuminating... they've still pasted the same dubious "reason" for deletion in each one without considering the merits of each article, so we might as well discuss it here instead of pasting identical keep reasons as seems to be happening in the discussions. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 15:19, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> While I have some issues with this whole situation, it is important to note that the original nominator did not perform the individual nominations himself.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, I split them up. And while I don't intend to justify what I did — but only because I feel rather miserably about making a mess of everything — let me explain. I came across one of the articles in the list and noticed that it had an AFD tag on it, but a redlink to the <i>Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/&lt;ArticleName&gt;</i> sub-page. (In retrospect, they had not been linked here with {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd1_cc96.html" title="Template:Afd1">subst:afd1</a>}}.) I looked in the history to see when it was tagged; it had been awhile. Then I went to the nominator's contribution history to see if there might be other odd things happening, where I noticed that there were <i>many</i> lists that had red-linked afd tags. (Again in retrospect, it was every list except <i>List of fictional actors</i>.) Unfortunately, I didn't look at them all, and I did not do enough investigation. Thus I did not come to this sub-page and see that they were all meant to point here. At any rate, before I found that out, I had already created subpages for (I think) every page that had been tagged. So it was I who created an indiscriminate number of AFD nominations, thinking that I was creating the subpages and thus completing them, when in reality they were already completed at this subpage — <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 17:38, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><del>Comment</del>Keep and stubify</b> The article currently has no useful sources, and the links to various karate schools should be removed, but I'm not convinced yet that the article itself should be removed. The subject of the article might be fairly notable if he's really responsible for directly or indirectly spawning a significant school of martial arts. Perhaps an editor with some expertise on martial arts could comment on this? (I'm also concerned that this is another case of either recentism, since the subject here would have pre-dated the Internet; or ethnocentrism, since it is about an Asian individual and we may not have readily-available English-language sources for him). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:12, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would say keep this. The history of Taekwon-do is shrouded in all kinds of mystery and needs clarification on a larger scale. This seems to do that. I admit that it needs to be rewritten but more importantly it needs to be finished. Chin Mu Kwan seems to be as important as any of the other taekwon-do organizations that are linked here. --Rasputin13 05:53, 2 January 2007 (UTC) There is great debate to the history of TKD. I have met some CTF members and they seem to be fairly true to the tenets but then it is just a sample. I say leave it under CTF as the organization and founder are one and the same to a certain extent. Adding to all the multiple histories of TKD can only help.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> As the quotation from Orwell in the article says: "...the word ‘Fascism’ is almost entirely meaningless". Not entirely true, but any encyclopaedia article on "neo-fascism" has got to define its terms more thoroughly than this one does. The only section that deals with actual neo-fascist groups and religion is the section on paganism - and that has no references. Parties that might reasonably be described as "neo-fascist", such as Alessandra Mussolini's outfit in Italy or Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National are conspicuous by their absence. Instead, we get a lot of stuff about extremely conservative religious groups with possible theocratic tendencies being called "fascists" by their opponents. Did Mussolini or Hitler aim at theocracy? No. So it's just "fascism" being used as a generalised insult for anything perceived as politically undesirable. Not encyclopaedic enough in its present state. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 10:56, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Re "conspicuous by their absence": Of course they're not mentioned in this particular article -- why would they be? They have nothing to do with the subject of the article.

<li><b>Reply</b> Maybe because they are among the most notable "neo-fascist" organisations currently around and the first term in this article's title is "neo-fascism". As far as I can see, this article doesn't even try to define that term. It mostly merely reports vague allegations that certain religious groups have some things in common with old-style fascism. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 16:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Of course there might be material in the text that might be relevant in other articles. Church-state relations in Italy, Germany and Spain during Fascism would certainly deserve independent articles. Particularily the relations between German Nazis and religion is very interesting and complex. However, there is no common denominator of all movements inspired by Fascism regarding religion. In some cases, Fascists (or people widely accused of being Fascists) have had a strong religious profile, whilst in other cases promoted secularism. There is no common denominator on which to build this article, the is no universal phenomenon to describe. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 11:14, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> - I've had a day to reflect on this (rather than just jumping in and reflexively arguing against deletion). Judging from the comments I've read here, there seems to be a serious misunderstanding of what the article is actually about. People seem to have misconstrued the title. (Possibly it could be modified slightly, if that's the case.) If the title were, say, <b>"Neo-fascist religious movements</b>", then I could easily understand the objections -- in fact, I would almost certainly <i>agree</i> with them. But the actual title -- <b>"Neo-fascism and religion"</b> -- indicates that the purpose of the article is to discuss <i>whatever connections there may be</i> between those entities. It doesn't <i>presume</i> that all of the religions that are discussed in the article do, in fact, <b>have</b> neo-fascist elements. The whole point, as I see it, is to help readers sort out which, if any, of them really <b>do</b> have such elements.</p>
<p>My impression is that some of the people who are supporting deletion really just want the subject to go away, because they find it offensive. But whether anybody likes it or not, it's a <b>fact</b> that countless such assertions are made about one or another religion, sect, etc. To simply delete this article -- rather than improving it -- would be to pretend otherwise, and would be a real disservice to Wikipedia readers, depriving them of an opportunity to learn about such issues from a <i>neutral source</i>. This article has a number of serious editors who in my judgement are committed to the need for an evenhanded and impartial article. Whatever flaws there may be should be eliminated through the usual WP editorial process. Deletion is far too extreme a "remedy" -- in fact, it would just be a copout, taking the easy way out, instead of doing the work to improve the article. <a href="../../../c/g/i/User%7ECgingold_abdb.html" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> 15:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Would you please avoid using <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> speculation like this and stick to the arguments people have made here. My objection is much the same as Soman's: this article is impossibly vague and disparate and has too much material where "neo-fascist" is used as a loose synonym for "totalitarian", "authoritarian" or even "theocratic". The bit that could be saved (the section which notes connections between genuine neo-fascists and neo-paganism) is unsourced. Get some references and save that and use it as a core to rebuild the article. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 17:38, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This page has a history. Its creation allowed for a serious discussion of the issue (see the cites) in a context that defused heated and lengthy edit wars over several pages that looked only at one religion, especially Islam. (See the battle over <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> for example). There are serious scholars who look at this question. See, for example, the <i>Journal of Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions</i>, especially Vol. 5, No. 3, (Winter), special issue on Fascism as a Totalitarian Movement: <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/tmp/2004/00000005/00000003" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/tmp/2004/00000005/00000003" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. See especially Roger Griffin's Introduction: "God's counterfeiters? investigating the triad of fascism, totalitarianism and (political) religion." Sure this page can be improved, but it does not confuse "totalitarian", "authoritarian" or even "theocratic" concepts, it attempts to tease out how they relate or do not relate using a framework developed in a peer review scholarly journal.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 14:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further comments</b> - I think it's worth noting that, even while this Afd discussion has been taking place, three editors (Rumpelstiltskin223, Bobfrombrockley, and Dragomiloff) have engaged in serious editing and the addition of numerous references. The section re <b>Hinduism</b> is already <i>much improved</i> over where it was previously -- which is notable, because this Afd nomination seems to have been a <i>direct outgrowth of the dispute</i> that was going on with regard to that particular section. This ongoing progress bears out one of the central points I made above:</li>

<dd>"This article has a number of serious editors who in my judgement are committed to the need for an evenhanded and impartial article. <i>Whatever flaws there may be should be eliminated through the usual WP editorial process.</i> Deletion is far too extreme a "remedy" -- in fact, it would just be a copout, taking the easy way out, instead of doing the work to improve the article."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Returning to another point I raised above, regarding the <b>title of the article</b>: I believe that the current title inadvertently raises certain expectations, on the part of some readers, in terms of the primary focus of the article, which is not so much on <i>Neo-fascism</i> itself, as it is on <i>religions</i> -- more correctly, <i>religious movements</i> -- which may have <i>fascistic elements.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While it's certainly true that changing the title wouldn't eliminate all of the hard work that will still be needed to improve the article, I do think that we should give serious consideration to modifying the title to better reflect the subject/issues that the article is intended to address. Perhaps something along the lines of <i>Fascistic currents in modern religious movements</i> (or more completely, <i>Claims of Fascistic currents in modern religious movements</i>). No doubt that can be improved upon, but I think it does more accurately denote the intended focus of the article.</dd>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> This seperate website has signifcance. It is over 50 years old and many non-Temple student alike ask of its history because it was built on land of the internationally known founders original home. I can understand the need for not having specific dormitory pages for others but this page was orignally created to recognize the signficance of this building as an orginal. While not on the orignal historic register yet as a building, it is also part of the Liacouras block of homes that were part of Berks Street that have been placed on the historic register (to my knowledge). Adjustments can be made, just inform what to do. Some winki's are learning so please enlighten. One of the most frustrating things about Winkpedia is when pages our deleted in entirely after much work. Also, citation was made -- sources used and put as links at the bottom. This can be improved if necessary. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 155.247.83.61 (<a href="../../../1/5/5/User_talk%7E155.247.83.61.html" title="User talk:155.247.83.61">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.247.83.61_22aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.247.83.61">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>delete</b> Seems like a very nice high school teacher. But not a notable one based on the objective evidence.

<p>Don't know if this is notable or not, though the article certainly doesn't provide context telling me who is in the association, why they are so important etc. Equally, I've no reason to suspect they're not notable and a few people have noted that they're not speedyable.</p>

<li>The subject of the article needs to be <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enotability_75cc.html" title="WP:notability">notable</a>. If this group has been mentioned in multiple independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (usually not including student newspapers), then it would typically be notable - and if there are those sorts of citations to establish notability, that's what the article needs. If there aren't (and I can't find any - that's why I nominated it), then the <i>subject</i> of the article is not notable, and doesn't meet the criteria for inclusion.

<li><b>Keep</b> On the discussion page for the University of NSW Revues, someone quite rightfully in my opinion argues that notability is subjective. The recent posting of clips from the UQ revue on YouTube has gained the show wide recognition within both the legal and engineering circles in Brisbane, as well as from other Australian universities and student theatre organizations, as is evidenced by multiple bulletin board discussions, independent blogs, links and YouTube viewings. The student university revue tradition in Australia is much more closely connected between different universities than it is in America; this is evidenced by the development of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_3rd_Degree_5384.html" title="The 3rd Degree">The 3rd Degree</a> which drew from writers and performers from multiple Australian universities, including the University Of Queensland. The page has now been written objectively, has had links removed from unnecessary pages, and is an objective statement of a show that does not necessarily have the worldwide reputation of Second City but is nonetheless recognizable and has a reputation within the Australian student comedy circuit - a valid category listing on Wikipedia - as much as any of the other Australian university revue pages on here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.102.42.97_3179.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.102.42.97">130.102.42.97</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/0/User_talk%7E130.102.42.97.html" title="User talk:130.102.42.97">talk</a>) 04:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I disagree. It seems like a group of people feel the need to put Linux on every platform they possibly can, and there's plenty trying to get it on the Wii — <a href="http://www.wiili.org/index.php/Links" class="external text" title="http://www.wiili.org/index.php/Links" rel="nofollow">here</a>'s a list of nine different sites up for Linux hacks especially (ten, if you include the site linked to). It's in development still, but it almost certainly <i>will</i> be done, and there's Wikipedia articles on software/hardware in development. Be more specific about what it fails in WP:SOFTWARE. Whether there should be a separate page on every variation of Linux, according to system... now, that's a different question. 66.69.90.253 22:42, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Y'know, you could find 1,000 sites on a given topic, but it doesn't mean it belongs on WP. 9 or 10 is pretty pathetic, what should we write an article about milk and cookies and the scientific interactions they create? <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7EScepia_1657.html" title="User:Scepia">Scepia</a> 00:10, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think this is a notable article, I agree that it needs some work and cleaning up, but it's a constantly growing and promising project that may even get some recognition from Nintendo (even if it's not quite positive, but there's a petition for them.). I say <b>Keep</b>. On the other hand, @Scepia, you are just in bad need of reading <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" rel="nofollow">this</a>, I know it's not a rule, but it may help us get your point. <a href="http://www.wiili.org/index.php/User:Luis_villase" class="external text" title="http://www.wiili.org/index.php/User:Luis_villase" rel="nofollow">Luis villase</a>

<li><b>I suggest we stop this AfD immediately and request help from an admin</b>. This article is in need of some serious cleanup, as it is completely mixing up two projects, the <a href="http://www.wii-linux.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.wii-linux.com/" rel="nofollow">Wii Linux Project</a>, and <a href="http://www.wiili.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wiili.org" rel="nofollow">WiiLi</a>. Most of what's in this article is actually about the latter (except for the arstechnica/slashdot quotes, which are about the former), but for some reason at some point both were considered the same project and <a href="../../../w/i/i/WiiLi_b23f.html" title="WiiLi">WiiLi</a>/<a href="../../../w/i/i/Wiili.html" title="Wiili">Wiili</a> now redirect to this article's page. The former project has absolutely nothing and is not notable at all IMO (they haven't even had an update since the wii came out, and their wiki is basically empty), while the latter is a well-known (if controversial and of debatable merit) project. Personally though, I'd just say <b>Delete</b> the whole thing and create a single article (say, <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_homebrew.html" title="Wii homebrew">Wii homebrew</a>) to encompass all of these sites and also including non-linux-specific homebrew (<a href="http://www.wiibrew.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wiibrew.org" rel="nofollow">wiibrew</a>, <a href="http://www.wiire.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wiire.org" rel="nofollow">wiire</a>, etc). Currently anyway, there is no Linux on Wii development, since it is impossible to run homebrew code, so the efforts to run homebrew in the first place are far more important (and more general). Stuff like the Wiimote reverse engineering is also not specific to Linux. Once someone comes up with some linux that actually runs on the wii, it might deserve its own page.

<li><b>Delete</b> - One or two paragraphs about non-existant projects does not count as "encyclopedia" news. This seems to read more as an advertisement to gain interest in the projects rather then information on the projects themselves. I personally agree with Marcan that we should have have a more broad article focusing on the entire homebrew scene, rather than a single project. <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_homebrew.html" title="Wii homebrew">Wii homebrew</a> would do nicely. -- <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkain_1ac3.html" title="User:Darkain">Darkain Dragoon</a> 21:54, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alright, I can see that it doesn't establish notability aside from having been noticed by Macworld on one occassion. Definitely should not be speedied though, to give the article's creator an opportunity to address this. I suspect that with a company that's been around for a few years with 700K Ghits there's a good chance notability can be established. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 23:52, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a person who lives near it, I can assure the other editors that this is an important hotel. The hotel itself is notable, but the article is weak. That might change. The hotel is not technically in the Back Bay Historic District (the District includes buildings north of Boylston and west of Arlington). If knowing the hotel's historic preservation status were the key to this debate, I could call someone, and eventually find a reliable source. I did see one comment turn up in a web search: "Hotel built in 1928 and some ADA modifications were not possible due to historic preservation.", at <a href="http://www.apa.org/convention99/information/homepage.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.apa.org/convention99/information/homepage.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 00:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This list and all others like it should be included as bibliographies at the end of specific articles.

<li>Sorry. Bad idea. "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Computational_geometry.html" title="Computational geometry">Computational geometry</a>" is now in a pitiful, sketchy state. It may be expanded at least 4-5 times. List of books is a separate, detachable topic. What purpose is to bloat an article with it? It is just one click away and its separation does not break the logic of the article in any way. I also intend to expand the list with brief annotations. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 22:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>In my opinion that "one click" is more of a problem than the "bloat" added to the article (in small print you can list over 30 books on a single screen). Why break with the convention of listing literature relevant to a subject in the article itself? —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R.

If that list has too many books--that is, if some of them aren't important enough that they should be included in the article to prevent it becoming too large--then the solution is simply not to include every book, but rather only those books which will be particularly useful.

<li>In this particular case all books are quite different in subject coverage. Therefore, like I said, I am going to provide brief annotations for these books. This will considerably bloat the main article. I'd rather suggest this page is <b>already merged</b> articles about <b>separate</b> books. Rephrasing, all these books are <i>notable</i> each in its own aspect, but this domain of knownledge is quite narrow, and it makes sense to see side-by-side comparison of these books, rather than to have them in separate articles, prone for aggression from those who think that only pokemon, porn stars and sexual slang are notable topics. Unfortunately experts in computational geometry do not rush into wikipedia, rather in opposite direction (I did notice several familiar names, who quickly became disinterested in wikipediting) `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 20:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From a brief reading of the list and the topics suggested by their titles, it seems to me that several of these books would be appropriate on more specific articles--in particular, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combinatorial_geometry.html" title="Combinatorial geometry">Combinatorial geometry</a> has a separate page, as does <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_gallery_theorems.html" title="Art gallery theorems">Art gallery theorems</a>. The fact that the books differ in coverage then seems (to me) to be because some of them are about different topics which we also have articles for. If that's the case, then those books should be listed on the appropriate articles. It's true that an annotated list of books on a topic is useful, but there's no reason you can't annotate a further reading list. Also, if the books truly are all important (i.e. introduced major theorems or ideas) then they may merit a mention in the main article (in a history section, perhaps) for that reason. At any rate, wikipedia is not paper and there is no reason we can't include all relevant (and verifiable) information, as long as we are careful about the presentation. I just feel that it's more useful to present it on the article rather than in a separate list. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 22:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Providing 'brief annotations' for the books is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original Research</a>, instead you need to provide 3rd party references stating that these books are the best in their respective fields. That is the point of this AfD which still has not been addressed. There is no source stating that these books are any better or worse than any others, or that they provide a complete background to the topic. --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve <sub>(Slf67)</sub></a> <a href="../../../s/l/f/User_talk%7ESlf67_bed3.html" title="User talk:Slf67"><sup>talk</sup></a> 23:59, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ah, not quite.

<li>Give me a break, man. I have four computers at home, but only two hands and two pairs of glasses. But this is not a reason for article deletion. I agree with you, but if I decide to write a detailed report about some book, I will write a separate page about it (and some smartass will probably come and say "WTF, prove that this book is better than the rest or write about all other books, otherwise I delete it because you are POV-pushing"). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 19:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, I'm advocating merging this into the main article on computational geometry--I don't want any information to be lost, I just think it's better presented along with the subject of the books, where people will see it more readily. Regarding deleting an article about a book: if someone did that, though, they'd probably be wrong. If you wanted to write an article about a book that was actually notable, according to our own guidelines, then the existence of articles on other books has no bearing on this. Their claim may mean we'd have to go through an AfD for the book, but in the end things should work themselves out. I don't think that keeping this article just as a prophylactic measure against future problems is a good idea, though. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 21:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> into computational geometry per Ruud's excellent suggestion. With all due appreciation for the valuable expansion of the original skimpy list, article bloat is not an impending problem. After merging we'll have an estimated length of 15K. By the time the article becomes unwieldy because of the envisaged expansions, it is more likely that the remedy is found in spinning off specialized subtopics than in having this list as a separate article (and see also Soporific's suggestion above). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lambiam_2f72.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lambiam">contribs</a>).</small></li>

This article does not fall under any " <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not</a>" categories. It is both verifiable and not original research (encyclopedic quality). It also has a neutral point of view and does not violate Wikipedia copyright policy. Therefore I believe it has been inproperly considered for deletion and should be removed from this list.

What usually happens is that a not-so-valid reason is first given simply to get the ball rolling, and with time actual criteria are then accumulated. I will not waste my time explaining how the article satisfies actual criteria, because it is likely that either 1) even if it does, I wouldn't be able to convince anyone and my vote is one keep out of many deletes 2) it doesn't satisfy the actual criteria. My initial point remains valid, deletion of an article should not be based solely on proposed criteria, especially when the people who are defining the proposed criteria are the same ones attempting to delete the article. Now that actual criteria have been stated, I will remain silent if success is achieved, however I will not retract my Keep vote, as it still stands that the article was initially attacked without solid warrant. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 00:44, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As a holistic thinker, my personal notability criteria is far more lax than those of Wikipedia, and as such you would likely find any arguments I make concerning notability to be inapplicable here. As a Wikipedian, my contributions are bound by guidelines put forth by the founders and community, whether or not I agree with them from a scientific standpoint, and as such I have always stayed just within the boundaries of Wiki and cited my work as per the older guidelines. Indeed I do think that most, not all, topics concerning physics, whether mainstream or not, deserve mention. Many years ago on Wikipedia, I was under the impression that it is for the reader to decide what is noteworthy, that was the whole point of writing articles with NPOV intent. However it appears that over the years notability has been incorporated further into Wikipedia guidelines than it was in the past, and the recent Pseudoscience arbcom case and its subsequent outcomes demonstrate this. Wikipedia has changed over the years, notability has become far more strict, as evidenced by the current proposals being put forth to further restrict content to only orthodox views. In my opinion, it has gone too far, but that is just my opinion, hence not noteworthy per the standards.-<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 03:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I appreciate that comment. But given the precedents and recent and past happenings here on Wikipedia, I very much feel that my attempts to affect notability standards would be a personal waste of time.

<dd>I am not the deceiver or the lier here! All I have stated above was in good faith and the best accurate to my knowledge: Dr. Aspden published about <b>145 papers</b> (not including books and patents) distributed through some of the most notable peer-review journals and in alternative non-mainstream journals (see <a href="http://www.aspden.org/papers/bib/refs.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aspden.org/papers/bib/refs.htm" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>)! In spite of all current technology and the intellectual advancement of the last century, You are doing here exactly what the middle ages dogmatic Church did toward the forefathers of Science (except the [physical] death penalty, that would be improper of our advanced society...).

<dd>Of course Wikipedia editors won't kill him - but he should <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anti-relativity_af68.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anti-relativity">watch out for particle physicists</a>. On a more serious note, the Pseudoscience ArbCom decision precludes the use of "alternative non-mainstream journals" as sources for scientific topics. Also, I would recommend for your sake that you not make the stereotypical crackpot arguments like comparing us to the church in the middle ages. We've heard most of them before, many of them more creative than yours, and they will just make editors lose respect for you and view all of your arguments with distrust.</dd>

<li><b>rewrite from a NPOV</b>This is one of the most difficult cases in pseudoscience--when a scientist with definite conventional credentials in a subject adopts what would generally be considered highly unusual views. The "definite credentials" refers not only to his degrees, but to the journals where some of the work as been published, which are as reliable sources as can be imagined. But there are no references to the acceptance of the theory by any other scientist. The article with the greatest number of citations as shown in Web of Science is no.3, to which there are 23 citations. However 21 of those 23 are in later papers by Apsden himself, which is fairly clear evidence that nobody else thinks him worth citing, even to refute.
<p>In any case, the article as it stands is also wholly unacceptable. It assumes the truth of his theories, and--while admitting there are criticisms--goes on in a manner as if here were none. I think a NPOV article could be written, but he and his supporters would find it highly unsatisfactory, for the plain honest presentation of the material shows it not accepted. The edit history reveals that his supporters have resisted any critical comments. I can see no basis we can refuse to include an article. However I do not see how one could be written. I certainly would not attempt to do so against the expected reverts. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:29, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
