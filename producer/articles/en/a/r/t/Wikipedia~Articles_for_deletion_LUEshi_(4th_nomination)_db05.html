<p>This is the very definiton of cruft. The only assertion of notability is the fact that it was signed by Shigeru Miyamoto. Other than that, it's an unnotable internet meme <a href="../../../t/o/f/User%7EToffile_98ee.html" title="User:Toffile">Toffile</a> 08:14, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Delete</b>. "LUEshi" is a meme virtually exclusive to the GameFAQs community. It isn't nearly as widespread an internet fad as something like <a href="../../../o/_/r/O_RLY__dcc3.html" title="O RLY?">O RLY?</a>.

<li>Changing vote, and additional comments. The article itself is largely fluff and only references GF/LUE/LL throughout its content. There is nothing in the article to suggest any significance outside of the community; it's comparable to the majority of the "Notable memes" list in the <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> article. In my opinion, LUE itself is significant enough in GameFAQs history to warrant its own article (though others disagree), and LUEshi should then be part of such an article. The meme itself does not deserve its own page. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">WarpstarRider</a> 22:22, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Easily passes a standard Google test. It's popularity has spread beyond the GF boards- merging it with that article would not make much sense.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would say merge with the GameFAQs page, but I think that it's too long to really fit there on its own, so it should probably have its own article.

<dl>
<dd>Let me clarify. My first thought was yes, merge it into GameFAQs message boards (heretofore referred to as GameFAQs). However, I went over to GameFAQs and noticed the article was already moderately long, and even if the whole article is not necessary for a merge, it would still account for a significant portion of the GameFAQs article. If there were a page such as GameFAQs fads, or something of the likes, I would say merge it into there, but I don't think that there are enough other fads to justify that kind of page. -<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordanhurley_5b45.html" title="User:Jordanhurley">J Train</a> 03:43, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is getting insane. I'm predicting that this article will soon become a <a href="../../../g/a/y/Talk%7EGay_Nigger_Association_of_America_f69d.html" title="Talk:Gay Nigger Association of America">GNAA</a>-type article, lots of AFD nominations (GNAA has eight AFDs as of this writing) but no deletions. Each AFD here keeps getitng shot down... - Hbdragon88 21:59, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Oh my, the LUEsers are up for it - I see a topic with 41 posts about this AFD nomination, plus two other topics about it. I don't know if this kind of effort was mobilized for the third nomination, but it's moving. And if this gets deleted, could it be protected? - Hbdragon88 22:11, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Is there some conspiracy to remove internet memes from Wikipedia we should know about? LUEshi is quote notable, with GameFAQs being one of the larger internet communities.

<li>Right. Let me clarify. The reason I've voted to delete is both that I agree with the nominator and that I instinctively vote to delete articles where a flood of "meatpuppets" (meaning new users, users with very few contributions, or unregistered users, no more and no less) contributes and asks to keep or "do not delete". My request was simply for the closing administrator to carefully check whether contributions from certain users should be discounted. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 21:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yeah, your logic is pretty flawed. Maybe you didn't read the article, but this was actually a huge deal on GameFAQs and other places, such that users were banned or suspended for 2 months just for posting it once, and it's not anything shocking like tubgirl, goatse, etc. Your picture you've uploaded is just that; something of note to you, not a website with 3 million registered users and "hundreds of thousands times more hits than your personal website does". -<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordanhurley_5b45.html" title="User:Jordanhurley">J Train</a> 03:34, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pfft. Nobody was banned for LUEshi. The worst I heard was purgatory, but that was pretty much brought on yourzselves by abusing it to the point of no return (i.e. Night of a Thousand LUEshis). Out of the 3 million <i>registered</i> GF <i>accounts</i> it was only a big deal to a few thousand, the LUEsers (22,000 as of ExcLUEsivity). Anyway, you're making it a strong canidate for merger - this did in fact was a big deal on GF, but can you prove it was a big deal elsewhere? - Hbdragon88 03:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It could be condensed down to a couple of paragraphs or two; it wouldn't be too hard. For instnace, before Cassandra de Vries was merged into <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_Dark_3e3a.html" title="Perfect Dark">Perfect Dark</a> ( see its last <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cassandra_de_Vries&amp;oldid=22377466" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cassandra_de_Vries&amp;oldid=22377466" rel="nofollow">edit before merger</a>), that article was pretty long. But most of it was drivel and repetition from the main article. I could see LUEshi being condensed down to a small notation in the LUE section currently at the GFAQs message boards article. - Hbdragon88 04:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Two questions should come out of this whole discussion. First, are fads and internet memes noteworthy. Are they significant in the sense that anyone looking back years from now would even care? Probably not. Are they significant in the sense that someone might actually look up something like this for reference, yes, I've personally looked up the <a href="../../../o/r/l/ORLY_bceb.html" title="ORLY">ORLY</a> article myself to figure some things out. In discussing internet memes their inclusion may be inevitable in a community dominated by the internet.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The second question is whether or not it's possible to lobby wikipedia. Can a dedicated enough forum, which is all we're talking about here, defend an article or topic of their choice and promote it to notability? These votes suffer from a self-selection bias, the only people likely to show up are people who really want to defend the article, few people are likely to put the same effort into getting rid of it. But does this basically mean that a commmunity like somethingawful or slashdot can hold wikipedia articles hostage or dominate coverage of themselves and promote their topics? Aside from making votes like this more public or putting out an appeal to wikipedia that a message board or community is exercising undue influence, I'm not sure what we can do.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigCow_5aad.html" title="User:BigCow">BigCow</a> 09:49, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Considering that, I, a LUEser, do not believe in the notability of this article, I think we can rule out the idea that any community can truly be solid on this issue. I think that notability of memes will establish itself, without the community's interference. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a></strong><em><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Simpson</font></a></em> 03:03, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the long run, almost certainly, just like in the long run any article tends towards being accurate since enough people will have had a chance to correct it. However, in the long run, we're all dead. The average VfD may have only dozens of users where as forums have hundreds of members at their disposal, we'll just have to trust that people in the community of wikipedia make wise judgements.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigCow_5aad.html" title="User:BigCow">BigCow</a> 20:55, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Weak Keep'</i> It has played a very prominent role being a bannable offense and posted in many places. It's been around for a while and gets over 50,000 hits on Google. I'd say that is notable enough for an encyclopedia article on this internet meme as it will grow. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandBoxer_f4c8.html" title="User:SandBoxer">SandBoxer</a> 02:56, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> By itself, the meme is too obscure for its own article, but seeing as it's wrapped around such diverse areas such as GameFAQs, YTMND, eBaum's World, and Miyamoto, I'd say it just aobut qualifies as Wiki-worthy. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronMasters_79bb.html" title="User:BaronMasters">BaronMasters</a> 00:35, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
