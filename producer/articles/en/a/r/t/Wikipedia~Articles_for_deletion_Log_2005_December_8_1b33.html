<li><b>Comment.</b> This is a flawed nomination. (1)&#160;If you have actually read the article in question, you will see that there is no hate speech in the article. (2)&#160;The group is certainly substantiated if you would bother to make a Google search for it: approximately 150 solid hits. (3)&#160;The article does not appear to be vanity as some users are claiming here. It appears to be a reasonably factual report on the group. I see no espousing of dogma in this article. So the only issue left here is notability, and in fact it does seem to be a rather obscure group. However, we do not delete articles from the Wikipedia because we don’t like the politics of the subject of the article. If we were to do that, we would delete <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacy.html" title="White supremacy">White supremacy</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skinhead.html" title="Skinhead">Skinhead</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>, and myriad other groups and subjects. I have no particular interest in the UFP, but don’t delete articles because you think the subjects of the article are despicable. ◎<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 06:00, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Flawed nomination? Possibly. Reason to vote <i>keep</i>? Not a chance. The article itself says it's hard to know how much support this mob has, which is not a convincing assertion of notability. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 06:17, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> With all due respect, I disagreed with DanMS' assertion that the group is notable and the nomination is <i>flawed</i>. Although Google search appears to provide <i>150 solid hits</i>, a closer look reveals that the original hit count is 32 <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Universal+Fascist+Party%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Universal+Fascist+Party%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This already includes 2 from Wikipedia, plus group's responses to various blogs/forums. Furthermore, I did a quick search in Google's news and it does not show any news article based on the group. From the above reasons, I have strong doubts about the group's notability. Another point that I want to raise is that Wikipedia has a policy on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a>. The allegation posted regarding Yahoo's decision to delete the group and/or Yahoo's position on internet censorship is only <i>allegation</i> and not supported by evidence (other than the group's claim on its webpage). Therefore, I had voted <i>delete</i> earlier and do not believe this nomination to be flawed. After all, assertion that <i>article is unsubstantiated</i> can be considered as a valid reason for afd. --<a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurricane111_4e5e.html" title="User:Hurricane111">Hurricane111</a> 06:55, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response:</b>
<ul>
<li>I did not vote to keep. Please read my comment.</li>
<li>My issue was with the nomination claiming “unsubstantiated” and “hate speech.”
<ul>
<li>“Unsubstantiated” means “not verifiable.” The number of various Google hits, whatever the actual number is, verifies the group’s existence.</li>
<li>There is no hate speech in the article. Please read the article before you vote.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I did not assert that the group is notable. I said the group is “rather obscure,” which means non-notable.</li>
<li>My second issue was with all the voters claiming vanity. Please read the article. I don’t think this article can be construed as vanity.</li>
<li>Please put some thought into your votes.</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Guys, AfD is not the place to go if you want something merged (once something's already on AfD, of course, merging is a valid option — it doesn't have to be deleted/kept). Please don't use AfD unless you want something deleted outright. Also, "merge and delete" is invalid — because the history of the deleted article is hidden, the authors of the merged portion are no longer credited, which is a violation of the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. Regardless, it looks like the article was created because <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenmoshe_a3c2.html" title="User:Benmoshe">User:Benmoshe</a> felt that <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Defense_League_6e46.html" title="Jewish Defense League">Jewish Defense League</a> was inaccurate, or at least insufficiently NPOV; these issues can be solved by modifying the original article, not by setting up a new version. This, and to a lesser extent the sheer numbers on the side of deletion, lead me to believe that deletion is the appropriate option. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 15:03, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I may seem combative because neither I nor my organization is being treated objectively or with respect. I may not be experienced in the use of Wikipedia, however, my only purpose is to correct information which seemes to me to be deliberately malicious in nature. I would appreciate your assistance and would be delighted to exchange emails on this subject. I have no idea what "forking articles" means.

I would AfD a "List of anti-life people" just as quickly.

<dd>I'm assuming that you mean to be talking to me. Yes, of course you have the right to ask questions. Nonetheless, whether or not Sherurcij considers himself to be "pro-life" or "anti-abortion" is totally irrelevant to this article, and is the kind of question that starts flames. Why not stay on topic, and argue the keeping of this article on its merits, rather than starting a discussion that's likely to start a fight and isn't relevant? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">(talk)</a> 21:10, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There isn't a similar list for pro-choice or pro-abortion people. Because of that it makes the lists on this issue unbalanced. Also I don't think it's common for there to be lists concerning a position on a single issue. For example List of euthanasia opponents, List of gay-rights activists, List of birth control opponents, etc. I'm pretty sure will all come out red. Somewhat embarrassingly for my case though there is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_disability_rights_activists.html" title="List of disability rights activists">List of disability rights activists</a>. I am disabled, however I don't entirely agree with the activists, so I'm not sure where I feel there. Still that issue is in least able to be annotated without ticking people off and there is no category for the activists themselves. (There is Category:Rights of the disabled, but it's not specific to people) Still I have not yet voted though and I'm not sure I will. I am Pro-Life/Anti-Abortion/Anti-Choice(terminology is irrelevant to me) but still in this case I'm not sure the list can do more then the categories on this.(There is also Category:Pro-life politicians) Normally I like list, but as mentioned this maybe can't be annotated or sourced without causing a fight so may become worthless. If this gets deleted though I will actively vote to delete any List of pro-abortion people, List of pro-choice people or whatever term is used when it arrives.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>Thanks for making me aware of that. I added a "mergeto" on List of computer games featuring ants. On pacifists I don't know. That's also single issue I guess, and there isn't a List of militarists, but somehow it feels like pacifism is more of an entire life. My life is really not much like <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wangari_Maathai_b75a.html" title="Wangari Maathai">Wangari Maathai</a>, she isn't on this list but she did come out against abortion<a href="http://www.equityfeminism.com/archives/years/2005/000002.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.equityfeminism.com/archives/years/2005/000002.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2004/dec/04120702.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2004/dec/04120702.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, and there is a great chance anti-abortion people have less in common then pacifists do. Which would risk having a list that's a random group of people with little in common which seems to be something they're moving away from.

<li><b>Comment</b>. How consistent. The preferred response to the CFD attempts on Category:Pro-life celebrities et al was "there's already a list; listify." Now we finish up by deleting the list.

<li>For the record I'd have voted keep on that category. I strongly believe that categories are the way to handle this kind of thing, not least because individual article authors will see and review the addition of the category.

<dd>Thanks, Zaphod.&#160;;) I was somewhat out of line with that consistency remark, as it's not the same people participating in both discussions. But it is true that when the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, we can get those kinds of effects. I think we'd also see very interesting results in both discussions if we correlated each person's personal view on the political subject with their view on whether or not the category or list is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 20:14, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>And this means they should be in an encycopaedia even when there's nothing say about them? Just how many thousands of non-notable companies would be included on the grounds that they are the biggest manufacturer of something or other? Even a tiny company could qualify if the product were obscure enough. And of course a tiny company could rightly get in if it were genuinely notable -- but size is not the same as notability.

<ul>
<li>Sorry to keep on but could you point me to something more specific? Which "multiple non-trivial published works/ranking indexes/stock market indexes" exactly? (Note we're talking about Sharwoods and not Pataks or Rank Hovis McDougall.) Some of the comments here imply an inability to distinguish between "yes, I've seen that in shops" and "yes, I'd expect to see it in an encyclopaedia". Even a small supermarket has thousands of product lines and brands; where should we draw the line? Everyone seems to think this is a notable company but no-one seems to know anything very notable to say about it, and we're still waiting to see any evidence of notability in the article. And no offence, but while I'm sure Sharwoods would love to be thought of as a <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synonym.html" title="Synonym">synonym</a> for Indian cooking, someone's idea of Indian cooking would have to be pretty limited to think "Indian cooking?

Unless a forum has had an impact on the world outside its user community, it is not likely to be encyclopedic.

<p><b>Keep</b>. I created the article. It may not seem notable because the podcast was just created today, but if you check the page history for <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangulation_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Triangulation (disambiguation)">Triangulation (disambiguation)</a>, a link was already present before I created the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia writes backwards, not forwards in time. Articles are here for subjects that have demonstrated their significance, not for subjects that may be significant in the future. When this podcast is famous, an article can and should be written! <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 03:59, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just for comparison, what if it were a musical album that was released by a major band today? Certainly the association with the major band would make it potentially useful. What if it were a new show premiered on a major television network? Would that not then justify a new Wiki article? <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunnerupnj_cf49.html" title="User:Runnerupnj">Runnerupnj</a> 05:23, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunnerupnj_cf49.html" title="User:Runnerupnj">Runnerupnj</a>, that's irrelevant. This isn't an album by a major band. It's not a TV show that will be watched by many people. It's a podcast. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 05:43, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Following your argument, should we also nominate for deletion Laporte's other podcast <a href="../../../i/n/s/Inside_the_Net_ac16.html" title="Inside the Net">Inside the Net</a>, along with other podcasts such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Overnightscape_bae7.html" title="The Overnightscape">The Overnightscape</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dawn_and_Drew_Show_726b.html" title="The Dawn and Drew Show">The Dawn and Drew Show</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Insider_483e.html" title="Catholic Insider">Catholic Insider</a>? And what about other media such as the book <a href="../../../h/o/w/How_to_Good-Bye_Depression_0f31.html" title="How to Good-Bye Depression">How to Good-Bye Depression</a>, which, as I mentioned below, was nominated twice for deletion and retained both times? Or what about a movie such as <a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensign_Pulver_184c.html" title="Ensign Pulver">Ensign Pulver</a>, which seems to be notable only because it was a sequel to a more popular film? It doesn't seem clear to me why <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer_Defined_fc48.html" title="Homer Defined">individual episodes of <i>The Simpsons</i> can have entries</a> while a popular (even on its first day) podcast cannot. It is not clear what is defined as notable and what is defined as not notable. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunnerupnj_cf49.html" title="User:Runnerupnj">Runnerupnj</a> 06:02, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Podcasts that are notable should be kept. There are probably a lot of podcast articles here that should be deleted. You can nominate them for deletion if you'd like to spend the time on that. However, the existence of other inappropriate articles on Wikipedia doesn't make your article appropriate. Notability or lack thereof is defined by consensus, and so far, the consensus is overwhelmingly that this is non-encyclopedic. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 06:06, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Notability or lack thereof is defined by consensus" -- I understand this, but I do feel compelled to put up a spirited defense. I didn't have any interest in starting this article, but someone had already created a link to the <i>Triangulation</i> website over at the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangulation_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Triangulation (disambiguation)">Triangulation (disambiguation)</a> page. Should that entry be stricken as well? At the same time, I would like to site <a href="../../../f/a/q/WP%7EFAQ_154a.html" title="WP:FAQ">WP:FAQ</a> which states "Most people dislike stubs, even though they are probably a necessary evil. Many excellent articles started out as short stubs, thus existing stubs should be expanded into proper articles." Is there anything I can do to meet your criteria for making the entry more WikiWorthy? I would surely like to retain the article on some level, because more information is better than less, and because when visitors come looking for information in a week or two, there should be <i>something</i> rather than nothing. And for the record, I would not delete for the <i>Simpsons</i> episode articles for deletion because (a) like I said, more information is better than less and (b) such a motion would almost surely fail not because the episode is more worthy than this podcast but rather because the supporters of <i>The Simpsons</i> -- of which I myself am a fan -- would defend it with such overwhelming vigor that my vote would get hammered. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunnerupnj_cf49.html" title="User:Runnerupnj">Runnerupnj</a> 06:20, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-noteworthy, borders on vanity. Ifnord 04:10, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well it's not advertising or vanity, in as far as that I am not involved with the podcast nor do I have any connection (personal, professional, or otherwise) with the people involved. As for non-notable, I remember that <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/How_to_Good-Bye_Depression_0f31.html" title="How to Good-Bye Depression">How to Good-Bye Depression</a></i> was nominated not once but <i>twice</i> for deletion and yet was voted to be retained both times. If sufficient justification was found for a book like that, then certainly I would assume that one can be found for a podcast with an association to three major tech figures (the first podcast includes <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Lessig_0ce0.html" title="Lawrence Lessig">Lawrence Lessig</a>). Before posting this reply to your comment, I reviewed <a href="../../../f/a/q/WP%7EFAQ_154a.html" title="WP:FAQ">WP:FAQ</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and I still think there is sufficient justification to retain the article. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunnerupnj_cf49.html" title="User:Runnerupnj">Runnerupnj</a> 05:23, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yup, <b>delete</b> unnecessary/useless pages. However, since the vast majority of the edits to <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abomination.html" title="Abomination">Abomination</a> referred to the Biblical meaning, it probably should have been moved to <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abomination_%28Bible%29_16ac.html" title="Abomination (Bible)">Abomination (Bible)</a>, with the redir converted into the disamb page.

<li>I think we definitely shouldn't delete all the articles.

<li>There's no reason to delete everything--it would probably be a GFDL vioalation anyway. All that needs to happen is have an admin merge the appropriate histories and get rid of the useless stuff left over--that's why that functionalality was added to the software.

<li>There is no need for deletion, or requested moves, or history merger. There is no need for an administrator to do anything. Non-administrators can easily fix this themselves. Just <b>redirect</b> abomination (disambiguation) to <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abomination.html" title="Abomination">abomination</a>. This will allow you to use the {{<a href="../../../o/t/h/Template%7EOtheruses2_87e8.html" title="Template:Otheruses2">otheruses2</a>}} template, which requires an "X (disambiguation)" article, on the disambiguated articles, should you want to.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I notice the overwhelming amount of keep votes here and have seen similar trends in other articles. What people seem to forget, imho, is that while the act of the first passenger shot by an air marshall is significant, and I therefore support keeping the AA flight article, the person Rigoberto Alpizar is in no way notable except for (the sad) fact that he happens to be dead. An encyclopedic article about a person should, again imho, be a biographical article about the notable life and/or accomplishments of said person. Mr. Alpizar has accomplished nothing that is notable enough for him to be remembered in a few weeks time except, again, for the fact he was shot dead. He was no politician, scientist, humanitarian or artist, he was no more notable than you or me. I suggest we put the info that is of note into the flight article but I vote delete for this one for the stated reasons.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 16:12, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b>. Look, the man himself is utterly non-notable.

<li>I don't think anyone saying we should merge is saying we get rid of information. What we are saying is that we shouldn't have an article on the man <b>and</b> an article on the flight. The flight is only notable because of the man, and the man is only notable because of the flight. The people you all name are not fair comparisons as they do not really have an article that they could be merged into (apart from a more general article on police shootings or something). <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a> - <a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Hello</a> 03:43, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I take your point that information is duplicated in those two articles (though surely this should have been a vote to merge rather than delete). You could see the incident as being about what happened to a certain man, or what happened on a certain flight, and no doubt time will tell what name it goes down in history under. But I was disagreeing with Kalsermar's view that the man is non-notable because he never did or achieved anything notable except by dying -- this is what I meant by "sad celebrity". Also, I would think that there is scope for the article about the man to contain important information (yet to appear but no doubt emerging as investigations progress) that perhaps applies more to him than the event itself. Not just trivia but stuff about his personality, mental condition, (lack of) terrorist affiliations etc. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 19:32, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>And Eusebeus, a website which has added 891 members in 5 months members actually has grown quickly.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I suppose I understand that, although a few comments seem a little snide. One thing I don't understand about the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> rules is that no site with less than 5000 members on a site is worth mentioning. Why is that? Does that mean that what has not reached the mainstream media is not worth considering? Does that mean that only popular things are worthy? If oprah talks about it then it's worth including, but otherwise it's not? Whatever happened to the concept of exchanging ideas? Or is it designed to remove clutter from the website?

<dd>Pretty much. I mean, Wikipedia is not just free space for whatever people feel like. I know people get that impression sometimes, and it seems harsh when a bunch of strangers start going "<b>Delete</b> your webpage" but the bottom line is that this is an encyclopedia. What exactly "notability" means is an endless debate, but <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> tries to establish sites that a lot of people have heard of, and are likely to be looking up in an encyclopedia. It's not at all a slight against a given site (my favorite website/community for example, which I've been a part of since 1996, wouldn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in a million years). --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:39, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

They have played to large sell out concerts, and their music has been included on several best selling compilation albums. Their first album release was 1998, and I think that they have had 5 or 6 album releases, not including their inclusion on about 15 compilation albums. Allmusic.com recognises them. It is a bit difficult to search for them though since the name is used in so many other things. There are many songs called Stigmata (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_%28band%29.html" title="Ministry (band)">Ministry</a> had a famous song called Stigmata, for example), and there are quite a lot of other bands called Stigmata as well. Therefore, they probably should be changed to Stigmata (Australian band), just to be safe. I have some of their music here, from a triple j release of "the best in heavy metal music for 2004".

<li>Actually, I just had a thought. What I could do is write an article for <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stigmata_%28song%29.html" title="Stigmata (song)">Stigmata (song)</a> for the famous <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_%28band%29.html" title="Ministry (band)">Ministry (band)</a> song that inspired everything else, and then include all of the snippets in there. Its pretty clear that the Ministry song inspired all of this. Then we can do a merge&#160;:). That might be a better way to go about it. <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepultura.html" title="Sepultura">Sepultura</a> also did a song called Stigmata (or at least a cover of Ministry's song) and I keep seeing Stigmata this Stigmata that everywhere.

<ul>
<li>Actually, just on that, I noticed that NONE of Ministry's songs have their own article. I was like WTF? Jesus Built My Hotrod was extremely influential, if for no other reason than it was banned worldwide by religious groups. A line out of the song was "Jesus is the Devil". They were sued for that, and had to change the line to "Jesus was a carpenter". It was perhaps the most famous banned song about Jesus Christ. Because there is a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Rock_e44c.html" title="Christian Rock">Christian Rock</a> band called "Ministry", the heavy metal band has come under constant criticism for the way that they do their music, which in turn has led to Ministry in effect taking them on and releasing both fake Christian Rock songs like "Jesus Built My Hotrod" and "Stigmata" as well as raging criticisms of Christianity, in a similar vein to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sabbath_9b9c.html" title="Black Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, except that Ministry are not satanic - they are in effect having a joke at the expense of Christianity. Ministry inspired such bands as <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundgarden.html" title="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_In_Chains_3180.html" title="Alice In Chains">Alice In Chains</a> to create their own stinging attacks on Christianity, and the song "Stigmata" was seen as the inspiration for the concept for all of these bands, which also later included <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Cooper_62c7.html" title="Alice Cooper">Alice Cooper</a>'s own attack on Christianity. These stinging attacks were also referenced in the movie by the same name - <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stigmata_%28film%29.html" title="Stigmata (film)">Stigmata (film)</a> referenced some of the criticisms from the 1988 Ministry song. However, Ministry's most popular song was in fact "Just One Fix", which was in reality an attack on drug use and trying to convince people not to take drugs - but for a long time was portrayed in the media as encouraging it. As Ministry's lawyers were able to prove that it was discouraging drug use, that song increased their credibility significantly, and became their signature song. Whilst they were hurt by the likes of "Jesus Built My Hotrod", "Psalm 69" and "Stigmata", "Just One Fix" helped them. According to chart success, however, "Lay Lady Lay" was their most popular, and, like <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica</a>, their cult icon status eventually led to actual chart and album success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Many other bands have copied Ministry, and they have been regarded as one of the forefathers of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_metal.html" title="Death metal">death metal</a>, and were often referenced with new hard metal groups. Eventually, groups such as <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opeth.html" title="Opeth">Opeth</a> and Carcus came about which were in fact heavier than Ministry, and that became the description of what death metal was - if it was not as heavy as Ministry, then it was merely heavy metal - any heavier and it was death metal. Stigmata the song was known to describe what Ministry was all about, and influenced culture throughout the heavy metal and death metal world, leading to the creation of a number of bands including A US band in 1989 who had 6 major albums, a Sri Lankan band and most recently an Australian death metal band in 2004. The song has been covered and referenced in a large number of others.</li>

<p>Yes, I know that's original research, but I know its true. I think that's the way to go though. But is there agreement that the song "Stigmata" is suitably influential to warrant its own article? It didn't have chart success, but had a huge influence. There are a number of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica</a> songs like "<a href="../../../o/n/e/One_%28Metallica_song%29_f7cd.html" title="One (Metallica song)">One</a>" that were similarly influential. I would like to make an article for Jesus Builty My Hotrod, Just One Fix and Stigmata, all Ministry songs. IMO the others weren't influential enough. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 03:04, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This chat forum gets thousands of hits per day and millions of hits per year. Many posters spend hours there every day. Two posters have dated after meeting on the forum, and one poster went to stay with another as an exchange student.

<p>Capitalist do you have a life? seriously. Type Planet Rugby Forum into google and see how many hits that come up (over 2,000,000). New Zealand All Blacks Rugby coach Graham Henry has posted on the forum, legendary Australian coach Rod Macqueen, Brian Moore (BCM), Stephen Jones (Southern Softie), If those people aren't significant then I don't know who is.

<p>Honestly, what harm is there in this for one. Secondly what is the point in deleting something that nobody really checks on. Finally, it has its place. Wikpedia has become a social encylopedia where people search for things that are not only obscure and bizzare, but with the current trends and a history on something you will not find in your Britannica's and Funk n Wagnalls. It should stay for the fact that somebody has spent time to write it, have a laugh and allow people to voice an opinion, point of view, whatever. If you start silencing things as inane and trival such as this; when will it stop??? <small>(<b>Note:</b> this previously unsigned comment made by LachlanG on 13:54, 8 December 2005 and moved from top of page to here for readability by me.) <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 14:18, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Should be saved, it's a large forum which has grown loved by the people that frequent it, I ask you: how can musicianforums have an entry and not this?</p>
<p>It should certainly be indexed on Wikipedia. There are some very useful threads that run here too - there are enlightening law discussions following major games, and more often than not it is possible to follow a game in realtime because some dedicated individuals post regular updates as they happen. This is very useful to rugby devotees who live in countries with little or no rugby traditions, such as Thailand, China, and Australia. Steenbras</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> "Useful", "enlightening", "loved by the people that frequent it", "being able to follow games in almost-realtime" does not make it encyclopaedic. Yes, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, but it <i>is</i> an encyclopedia, and as such subjects have to satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">certain criteria</a> to merit articles, which this doesn't. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 13:30, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok why not clean it up to make it further encyclopedic? It should be kept, it can be useful for people since this is indeed the biggest rugby forum on the internet that doesn't contain one-eyed bias.Girvan Dempsey</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Zunaid - I appreciate the positive nature of your post. I would like to make the point that all of the new users that you list are genuine, unique posters on PR forum. I think that 'meatpuppets' refers to multiple personas from just one person? I would argue that the entry for the PR chat forum be retained as it is a very real entity and therefore its entry may be of some reference value to users of wikipedia. The arguments against retention appear to be more based in a general disdain for message boards in general. PR forum is quite obscure, I will certainly concede that much, but surely obscurity is the raison d'etre of an encyclopedia? Girvan The Swerve 14:34, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Planet Rugby itself doesn't have an article, or I might have suggested a paragraph be added to that article about the forum. and <b>Comment</b> for Girvan the Swerve: meatpuppets are a bit different from sockpuppets, at least in Wikipedia usage of the terms. Sockpuppets are alias accounts for the same person. Meatpuppets usually refers to real separate individuals who have been brought to Wikipedia solely to participate on one side of a discussion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonCopy_758c.html" title="User:CarbonCopy">CarbonCopy</a> 14:55, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for that Carbon Copy. I realise now that I am guilty of meatpuppetry, but with the sincerest possible motives. I think the general concensus is to delete the entry for planet rugby chat forum and add a new entry for planet rugby with a reference to the chat forum. Girvan The Swerve 14:58, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Multiple personas from one person are <i>sock puppets</i>. From the sock puppet article:
<blockquote>
<p><i>A <b>meat puppet</b> is a variation of a sock puppet; a new internet community member account is created by another person at the request of a user solely for the purposes of influencing the community on a given issue or issues.</i></p>
</blockquote>
You have to concede that the current situation is almost <b>exactly</b> the definition of a meat puppet; it looks as if new members are being recruited on some sort of "save this article" campaign. Obscure does not = non-encyclopedic, but unimportant/unreferenced/non-notable does. The article isn't up for deletion because the topic is obscure, it's up for deletion because the article itself <b>fails to assert</b> the notability of the subject. This does not neccessarily mean that the subject isn't notable, just that the article doesn't provide <b>evidence</b> that it is. If you really want to save this article then take heed of the suggestions being made here: include <b>references</b> to the media, <b>provide evidence</b> that famous rugby players post there, demonstrate that the site has influenced some aspect of the game or society, show that the forum has been <b>cited</b> in a newspaper or other published medium. If the forum really has done that then I'm quite sure it <b>is</b> notable, but the article doesn't provide any <b>evidence</b> of this, see what I'm saying? Maybe the article doesn't do the topic justice. Heaven knows it's in a god-awful state at the moment. So rewrite the article, and maybe, just maybe, you can save it from deletion. What could then happen is that people here would re-read the improved article and hopefully change their votes because of the improvement. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 15:23, 8 December 2005 (UTC) <small>(That's enough rambling from me, I'm off home, will catch up on this tomorrow.)</small></li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> The Planet Rugby page is almost an exact duplicate of the Planet Rugby Chat Forum article. A subversive attempt to keep the content alive? It certainly seems so.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Vanity. However, to delete it because it has too few Google hits is unsound. It may be the case that this is the first mention of this topic on the internet; it could also be the case that Google has intentionally or otherwise removed it from its indices.

<p>Nonnotable fantasy CRPG; <strike>about 230 players worldwide (according to the server statistics; there might be other players on other servers as well). I'm sure a lot of effort went in to making the game, and if the article is deleted I encourage them to come back and create an article again after their game becomes popular and notable. I'll even help edit it. But as it stands now this is basically a vanity article for an unknown game.</strike> Withdrawing AfD <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 05:21, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, though I may be partial as I'm one of the major authors of the article. Just noting some small facts: "there might be other players" is probably a gross understatement as there's dozens of servers <a href="http://www.lotgd.net/logdnet.php?op=list" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lotgd.net/logdnet.php?op=list" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, a fact which <i>alone</i> could be considered some sort of indication of its popularity. The busiest servers seem to have 100-200 users online at peak times, which is (at least so I've noted) pretty much for a MUD-like environment. Plus, do we even have notability criteria for online games, anyway? Especially MUD-like systems? By the way, I'd be very interested to know how you pulled the 230 player figure, I'm not sure how to get the server to report that, anyway. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 07:25, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Amending this vote a little bit: If the vote goes for removal on grounds of notability, may I suggest we <b>Merge</b> something to <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon_ad59.html" title="Legend of the Red Dragon">Legend of the Red Dragon</a> instead, for example, by expanding the definition.

<li>Further comments: Ngh, I'd <i>really</i> like to know how to come up with the player statistics. The only statistic I could find was the <a href="http://lotgd.net/forum/" class="external text" title="http://lotgd.net/forum/" rel="nofollow">central server forum</a>, which has 1851 members (and I'd make a careful educated guess and say only a fraction of everyone who plays posts there). And before you toss Alexa or WP:WEB at me, remember that this isn't a web site, it's <i>an online game</i>, for which there <i>should</i> be a notability criteria of some sort. Played by a huge number of open-source hippies who use Firefox and don't subscribe to Alexa spyware, too. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 07:43, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hold on a minute here... Secret Pants neither wrote nor endorsed the deleted article, which was wrought with misnomers and poor grammar. Secret Pants has most certainly been in existence for over a year. The group does not yet have it's own TV show; however, we also don't appreciate being equated to a "garage band." It lends a poor image to potential fans, is false, and the statement is discoverable via a google search. The Secret Pants cast and production team includes a three time Emmy nominated producer and a collection of sketches, some of which boast over a million hits on the internet. Just last month Secret Pants was listed as a "Best of the Web" editors choice, keeping company with the Daily Show and Microsoft. This New Year's Eve Secret Pants was offered (did not seek) a headlining show at Philadelphia's North Star Bar, a venue that plays host to hundreds of celebrity acts per year. It is not simply a local club, as the administrators have suggested. And Secret Pants only makes live appearances on special occasions. We are not a touring group. That some Wikipedia administrators have equated the comedy troupe to a garage band (based on what?) evidences a research effort that is lackadaisical at best. We feel Wikipedia, as a heavily consulted internet reference database, should make amends by undeleting this article so Secret Pants can edit it for accuracy.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Question 1 is whether anyone actually disputes the very existance of this group? The way I see it there are, from each other completly separate, websources confirming the that such a group had existed. The speedy deletion nomination was posted when the article was still at <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_Group_of_the_Balears_2c13.html" title="Liberation Group of the Balears">Liberation Group of the Balears</a>. Question 2 thus becomes the issue of notability. IMHO any political organization that operates in the public sphere is notable, because it operates in a context of interaction with other political organizations and currents. Of course there is a possibility to delete obvious frivolous constructions, which are a phenomena of the internet age (for example, check dalitstan.org for a number of obviously imaginary outfits). On the Swedish wikipedia there was a discussion on whether to delete the article <a href="../../../../sv/h/%C3%B6/g/H%C3%B6gerpartiet_de_Konservativa_2fbc.html" class="extiw" title="sv:Högerpartiet_de_Konservativa">sv:Högerpartiet de Konservativa</a>, which obviously was four guys and website. But I don't really see any such aspect being raised in this particular discussion. This article obviously needs expansion, perhaps putting a notice on the Catalan wikipedia to assist with providing info on the group. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 17:51, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Moreover I find this group notable in the sense that they promoted a line in the national question that differed significantly from the major trends at the time. The virtually permanent debate on pan-Catalan identity versus provincial identities (like Valencian/Balear language, etc.) comes into play. More deserved to be written on wikipedia about these issues, and in this case about the national project of PCE(i) and GAB. It is already noted that PCE(i), which essentially emerged out of the Catalan left did propose a line in the question of nationality (amongst other thing designing its own national banner). In short, contribute rather than delete. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 17:58, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>created this article as just a modest piece of info on Coit Cleaners, a compnay I am fimiliar with. Since then this has become a place where <b>users have spread insulting lies and falsaifed information</b> on the topic. Every edit, since my opening one has either focused on irelavant sexual harasment cases, or misinformation. I have had to correct this article again and again. Just now I saw that another guy keeps adding sections on a sexual harrasment on Lou Kearn. (Who just happens to be my grandpa) Now let's cut the crap. Just delete this and we won't have anymore junk on sexual harasment or falsaifed information. If people just keep screwing this up there is no point in having it. It's not an important article anyway. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 06:30, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>- I'm not entirely convinced of the notability of this company, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Reyk. I nominated this company for deletion last time, but was convinced otherwise by the discussion. The sexual harassment suit is documented. the only "falsified information" I'm aware of is the mistaken change of the company's headquarters to Arizona, which is easily rectified. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 10:12, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Here is the sequence of events, which I think might prove instructive to other editors who come here to promote a company.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>I found an egregious advertising link to <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coit_Cleaners_f628.html" title="Coit Cleaners">Coit Cleaners</a> in the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parquetry.html" title="Parquetry">Parquetry</a> article, which had been inserted by the creator of the Coit Cleaners article.</li>
<li>That led me to Coit Cleaners, which seemed non-notable (and also spammish), so I researched the company.</li>
<li>The led me to the lawsuit information, which I inserted in the article. (My source, listed in the article, is the <a href="../../../e/e/o/EEOC_ae6c.html" title="EEOC">EEOC</a> report on the settlement.)</li>
<li>Now the original author of the article no longer wants the article to exist. A cautionary tale, I'm sure. I'd never have found the lawsuit info if the person hadn't spammed Parquetry.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>BTW, the original author reverted my edits, so you all have not been discussing the article as it actualy is. If anyone goes to the article and doesn't see the info on the lawauit, if you'd be kind enough to revert it back in, that'd be great. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 12:42, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I went through steps 1 and 2, myself, leading to the original nomination. During the discussion, I was convinvced by others that the company did indeed have some claim to notability. I was still bothered by the spam-like links in other articles, but decided to not remove them because my objectivity might be questioned. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 13:13, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Within the next 24 hours I will add citations for all of the info I have added to this article and specifically tag all non-sourced claims. This should address any claims as to misinformation, which I will note is not a valid cause for wholesale deletion. --<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> <a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">(email)</a></small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 19:39, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I've rewritten the discription section and provided sources for all of that. All of the harassment section is verifiable from the provided links. The only unverifiable claim was that of "world's largest." The company's website claims to be "one of the world's largest," so that's what the article now says. Everything is verifiable. The company is also notable per community consensus in the previous AFD. (As it is a privately held company there is very little information available on employment figures for Coit, but according to <a href="http://www.insightdirect.com/press/3_31_04.html" class="external text" title="http://www.insightdirect.com/press/3_31_04.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> the main headquarters employs 100 people.)

<p>The Diplomats, while not as popular as say, G-Unit, do in fact have a dedicated following, almost along the lines of Wu-Tang Clan. Cam'ron has been mentioned as a top-notch rap artist since 1997/1998. The overall tone of the article may need editing, but the entry does not warrant deletion. I heard about the question of deleting this on Okayplayer... it reflects very badly on Wikipedia that there would be a question about deleting one of the most popular crews in hip hop at this moment, as it makes it seem like Wikipedia is out of touch with anything black. I know it's not Wikipedia's fault, but it just looks bad, you know? KEEP: Cam has had a very accomplished solo career and the Dips are responsible for a lot of trends you're starting to see in the rap game now. They may not sell as well as other crews, but niether did Gangstarr, and no one would question their influence. KEEP: maybe take out a bit of the slang, but this is an article about a legitimate group</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>Collectively, Cam'Ron, Jim Jones and Juelz Santana, the three main members of the Diplomats have sold millions of albums. Juelz album is currently #9 on the Billboard charts, having sold 179,000 copies in its first week. This should absolutely not be deleted.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Dipset are very well known with young urban visitors to the site. Removing such a page would be losing touch with a key segment of society.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>haha this line: "G-Unit, do in fact have a dedicated following, almost along the lines of Wu-Tang Clan" is the line of someone who knows nothing at all about hip hop, as such it is hilarious.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>KEEP: They have been featured in numerous mainstream magazines. If you search google for "Diplomats" most of the links on the first page refer to this hip hop group rather than to the original meaning of the word "diplomat" which should say something of the groups popularity. I would suggest that whoever recommended this article for deletion do two simple google searches: one of "diplomats" and a second search of "dipset". Hopefully, this will remove any doubt as to the group's signifcance.</p>
<p>The guy must not have researched before nominating this.</p>
<p><br />
KEEP: The Diplomats are legitmate and notable. I was absolutely shocked when I saw that this was being considered for deletion. Members of the group have appeared as the musical guests on the Tonight Show and the members have sold millions of albums.</p>
<p>Keep: This group is very well know. (personal attack removed)</p>

<p>Definitely one of the better articles I've seen for a non-notable band, but the band is nonetheless not notable enough for an encyclopedia article. They basically fail all of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria that I could check. Two of the three reviews are from sites that I've never heard of, though perhaps someone here could vouch for their influence. The third (first listed) says nothing more than "<i>Local bands that won't stay under the radar much longer</i>" and lists a dozen bands from the area. <b>Delete</b> until they hit it big.

I've also participated on some of the message boards where he trumpted his claims. (For example, you can find a reference to his activity on <a href="http://www.cryptozoology.com/articles/interview.php?PHPSESSID=c87d63fe25ad08c0ab9da7a3dd1f895c" class="external text" title="http://www.cryptozoology.com/articles/interview.php?PHPSESSID=c87d63fe25ad08c0ab9da7a3dd1f895c" rel="nofollow">cryptozoology.com</a> - though most of his posts were under false names, or have been deleted.)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Even if he is notable, he's not <i>very</i> notable. So adding his bio only adds a tiny amount to Wikipedia's value as a reference tool.</li>
<li>Keeping this article means that it will have to be NPOV.</li>
<li>This will likely enrage the subject, causing him to try to get more people to vandalize Wikipedia.</li>
<li>If successful, this will force the diversion of resources to preventing that -- resources that could be be spent creating and improving useful articles.</li>
<li>Therefore, retaining this article is <i>likely</i> to result in a net loss to Wikipedia's value as a research tool. And that's the bottom line, I think.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Yes the diversion of resources and general headache is bearable, but why? <i>Who needs it?</i>. I had a very similar comment a couple days ago to to someone who created (re-created I guess) an article for hyper-disruptive editor Marc Perkel. It adds up, and <i>how, exactly, does this help to build an encylopedia</i>? And this guy is worse than a disruptive editor. He's <i>recruiting</i> disruptive editors.

<li>Actually your argument indicates why we should <i>not</i> delete on the basis of disruption. If we do, we encourge people to disrupt other articles because they don't want an NPOV article to exist for a controversial topic.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I have to agree with DanielCD (and not because we have the same name) and Caerwine.

<li><b>Keep</b> He may be a nutcase and a potentially disruptive editor, but that doesn't make him non-notable. I don't think it would be too difficult to make the article conform to NPOV standards.

<p>"Tell them that it is good they edited my page or the page about me, to be more fair than before, since really nobody but a sysop or an admin can make any edits in the main page article "stick". Wikipedia has this quaint idea that non-experts can edit the work of experts. Amateurs can edit the work of pros,etc. This puts Joe Six Pack on the level of Dr. Steven Hawking. Any, try to enter that www.ufomind.com is a a trashing site and some 15 victims have tried to sue the webmaster, who thumbs his nose at them. ufomind.com is trashing me als, and many fools actually believe it is written on the internet, that it MUST be true. Bonk! Am I vitriolic? Only when unfairly attacked, first. Am I malicious? Only against hoaxers and attackers. Do I flame? Only against flamers. Wikipedia people are very naive and ignore all this. Is is "bad" to threaten a lawsuit? Only in the mind of a naive 16 yr old. Oooh, ooh, he threatened a lawsuit! WOW! Nasty! Mean! -- -well, jerks, what if a car runs down your mother and you have to sue the driver? Is this "bad"...??? Or is someone defames you unfairly, --OOH,OOH, he threatened to sue....OH DEAR! Wikipedians, get real... however, my thanks for at least some fairness. Next, how about some reality on new items on Bigfoot? The Bigfoot page is bad,bad,bad."</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> So simply because I am new to the process completely invalidates everything I have to say? I am not allowed to have an opinion because I am new? Don't misunderstand what I'm saying here. I am not mad, just a little annoyed. And Smurf.. you demanded I have a subject line so I put in a subject. You seem to be angry that I prefer to speak in complete sentences and not in bits and pieces. But lets set that aside for a moment. I am not mad at you. At least not for that. It's your attitude about the troops that convinced me that my time would be better spent on another website.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is suppose to be an objective website. And as much as I would hate to admit it, the Smurf has just barely made a name for himself as to have a place on this site. But given my experience with him, I believe that he will not be able to resist the temptation to alter or sway an article concerning him. Does that mean that it should be taken down? No, it does not. But it will certainly have to be monitored. <a href="../../../v/i/l/User%7EVilaWolf_febe.html" title="User:VilaWolf">VilaWolf</a></p>

<p><b>In defense</b> 1)Beckjord has removed 6 days ago, maybe 7, from his forum, any suggestion to trash Wikipedia. There is no such threat of vandalism. Repeated reference to this non-event are irrelevant from the guy with the Russian letters name.Evidence: visit <a href="http://www.bigfootforums.net" class="external free" title="http://www.bigfootforums.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigfootforums.net</a></p>
<p>2) Who is interested in Beckjord? 20 Million People on the Letterman show, 15 million on the Jay Leno show, nine million people on the Coast to Coast AM show. Other millions from NBC,CBS, CNN,BBC and others. Unpopular (as science pioneers often are) as he may be to some, he has come to represent Bigfoot research and CZ research. His work is cutting edge and is evennow influencing writers as Chris Murphy, "Meet the Sasquatch" who previously held to older ideas. Reference? Evidence? visit <a href="http://www.hancockhouse.com" class="external free" title="http://www.hancockhouse.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hancockhouse.com</a> and click on the Murphy Files forum. You will see a sea change in this man.</p>
<p>3) Beckjord does no "vandalism". He offers his expertise in the topics. He does edits and critics jump in and declare, unfairly, that these edits are vandalism, when they in fact are not. Evidence: common sense.</p>
<p>Merry Wikipedia to all, and a Happy New article. If I offer multiple comments, it is in order to refute false info. beckjord<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.208.227.49.html" title="User:205.208.227.49">205.208.227.49</a> 19:08, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: And this my friends, is standard behavior of Beckjord, man of a thousand IP addresses. He's also failed to bring up the fact that he's repeatedly made false claims such as his 9/11 "consulting services" that were nothing more that his boosting his own ego and trying to profit from disaster. "Calls not from media are returned collect." as he is fond of saying.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. As he's been featured on national print and television media he's at least as notable as many other people who have Wikipedia articles.

<p>Note re Vila Wolf: this a lady who is unhappy I banned her from my discussion forum for her refusal to stop sending in all her posts with the subject line "boo", which made it hard for other readers to decide what her issue in each case was.

<p>In further defense: I have just web-published ( <a href="http://www.beckjord.com/originoflife" class="external free" title="http://www.beckjord.com/originoflife" rel="nofollow">http://www.beckjord.com/originoflife</a> ) my Multidensional Theory of the Origin of Life , which ties in with alleged interdimensional travel by alleged strange beings as often discussed in cryptozoology. (Kangamoto,Bigfoot,Nessie,etc) In time, I will submit this theory for an article in Wikipedia. I do not have to be Einstein to follow up on his ideas, nor do I need to be Kant or Hegel to suggest a theory. BTW, somemone accused me of extreme arrogance to suggest I had "done" a Jane Goodall-type experiment with Bigfoot. First, I know Dr. G in person, and second, I merely *attempted* such an experiment. Bigfoot creatures ate my food, appeared once, but they never sat down in my lap. They did, however, show up on film, even if not seen. <a href="http://www.bigfoot.org" class="external free" title="http://www.bigfoot.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigfoot.org</a></p>
<p>Have a good one. The world changes all the time.</p>

<p><i><b>KEEP</b></i> Reason: There is independent matter that exists that supports the position that Bigfoot may be <b>both</b> a simple animal <i>and</i> be a Interdimensional Creature. The reason there are no bodies is that predators and scavengers destroy them, (which also frustrates law enforcement looking for evidence in murder cases), in the case of the animal bigfoot, while a alien(to us) has abilities that are considered bizarre, and this thing may be from another plane of existance. <i><b>Personally</b></i>,I believe that Bigfoot is BOTH a simple animal native to Earth <b>AND</b> I've seen <i>independent</i> evidence that indicates that a alien "Bigfoot" is also visiting this planet. The Interdimensional Bigfoot has known bizarre abilities such as glowing eyes, superstrength, teleports, is telepathic/empathic,and if fired on, weapons have no effect. There are as stated <b>two</b> creatures, one is a animal native to Earth, the other one is a alien from another dimension. As for "vanity", one should dump <i>all</i> of the celebrity articles such as Jay Lenno, David Letterman, Howard Stern, since they personally promote them. The reason I'm investigating Bigfoot myself is that I'm monitoring the Fouke,AR situation, and have heard that one was seen in a nearby county I was living in. As to the "nuts" references, read the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robertson_Panel_866f.html" title="Robertson Panel">Robertson Panel</a>. This states that the CIA had initiated this to "reduce" interest in <a href="../../../u/f/o/UFO_9768.html" title="UFO">UFOs</a>, and one facet is to have people who has had encounters w/ UFOs/Aliens to be declared mentally unfit, since psychiatrists are also employed to do this. Should there be alien contact, some of these people may revolt out of vengeance and/or for religious reasons. While travelling the US, I've been told about this matter as well. I travel the US as, among other things, as a prospector and as a paranormal investigator, and I've seen things that are beyond belief. The reason people are shooting @ Bigfoot is to provide the "Skeptics" a BODY for their examination.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 21:09, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>. Has anyone seen the man's <a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBeckjord_caa6.html" title="User:Beckjord">user page</a>?

The highlights: he compares himself to Albert Einstein and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Alan_Wolf_a545.html" title="Fred Alan Wolf">Fred Alan Wolf</a> and declares his intention to flout policy when he believes that it needs flouting. The talk page discussion is similarly rich; he trots out the old claim that Wikipedia is flawed because the common editor has as much clout as "experts" and he reiterates his belief that since we're all wrong and he knows better, he can do whatever he feels necessary to fix it. Hell, look above: he's already planning to submit material which is unequivocably original research.</p>

<p>This page is self-admittantly "an intro to [... various loosely-related topics]", in other words: a textbook, not an encyclopiedia article. There is no clear definition of what "Boolean logic" actually is, only attempts to teach it. It duplicates content from <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_Theory_dd7f.html" title="Set Theory">Set Theory</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_Algebra_8f51.html" title="Boolean Algebra">Boolean Algebra</a>, and <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_Table_e21a.html" title="Truth Table">Truth Table</a>. In my opinion, the only section of this article that doesn't either duplicate an existing article or belong in a text-book is 'Applications', which could easily be re-worded to fit into <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a>. Also, it is my understanding that this article was created because of edit wars over accessibility and accuracy concerns in Boolean algebra - in which case, the optimal solution would be to fix that article (which is already a lot better thanks to the work of <a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a> and others), rather than fork it into a non-article on a poorly-defined topic.

<li>Are you kidding?? AfD is certainly not the place to work out internal differences on a page. Extensive work has gone into the article and if the editors (you the nominator perchance?) are locked into some kind of impasse, there is mediation. As a mere formality, I will note also that Boolean Logic absolutely deserves an entry. This is bad faith and I assume the nom is a pretty obvious sockpuppet for one of the principals on the talk page. <b>Speedy Keep.</b> <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 13:33, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This looks to be a complex and fraught issue. There is also <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra_of_sets.html" title="Algebra of sets">Algebra of sets</a> and other articles. I'm not really qualified in either the subject or the history of the articles, but I looked them over, and if I may make a few comments?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>On such an important and technical subject, my personal inclination is to have information that is accesable to people at various levels of baseline knowledge.</li>
<li>The article "Boolean algebra" looks to be a good, technical article. I couldn't understand it.</li>
<li>The article "Boolean logic" looks to be a good article with good diagrams. I was able to understand it. The sections "English language use of Boolean terms" and "Applications" seemed to me to be useful information well presented, on much more layman level than the other articles have. This info doesn't seem to exist anywhere else. I'm not sure where you'd merge it to, and it would seem a shame to just delete it.</li>
<li>The article "Set Theory" is a short article that is almost a kind of disambig page pointing to various places for more info.</li>
<li>The article "Truth tables" shows many different kinds of truth tables, while "Boolean logic" only has a short section on truth tables.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I don't see what's broken here. True, the article "Boolean logic" is didactic and needs a minor rewrite for tone; that doesn't look to be too hard to do. And perhaps the articles should have different titles, I don't know.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also note that the article "Boolean algebra" contains a note at the top that says basically "Go look at 'Boolean logic' for a more basic intro to this stuff". That works for me. "Boolean logic" could have a similar note placed at the top pointing to "Boolean Algebra"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You COULD Merge the first five sections -- "Algebra of sets and Venn diagrams", "Terms", "Example", "Chaining operations together", and "Use of parenthesis" -- FROM <b>Boolean algebra</b> TO <b><a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra_of_sets.html" title="Algebra of sets">Algebra of sets</a></b> and delete all or most of the rest of the article. I don't see how that would be an improvement, though. My inlincation would to make sure all the articles were peppered with links to the other articles and leave it at that. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 14:06, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>; I'm convinced there need to be separate articles for the algebraic structure (currently at <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a>) and the kinds of manipulations taught to many as "Boolean algebra" in which algebraic structures are never mentioned (currently at <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a>). I'm not sure what the content of the latter article should actually be; I do think that needs to be clarified and the article should be reworked to have less duplication (part of the problem is that the author of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_logic.html" title="Boolean logic">Boolean logic</a> was convinced he was writing a simple version of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_algebra.html" title="Boolean algebra">Boolean algebra</a>, so he may have intentionally written a parallel article to the latter's "simpler" content).

<ul>
<li><b>P.S.</b> I also don't think the nom is bad faith. There <i>is</i> a serious problem figuring out what the article is really supposed to be about; I personally don't really know, beyond that it's about a subject taught in school as "Boolean algebra" that never defines <i>a</i> Boolean algebra.

<p>This page is incorrectly spelt. There is an existing page, correctly spelt, that refers to the same topic. I have merged the content into the correctly spelt page (<a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumela_Monastery_84c2.html" title="Sumela Monastery">Sumela Monastery</a>). A redirect is pointless because of the spelling mistake. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_cowie_0ddd.html" title="User:Rob cowie">Rob cowie</a> 13:19, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>With respect, no encyclopaedia should include articles that are incorrectly spelt. This is not a case of an 'alternative' spelling, it is wrong in any dialect of English. Its deletion will not cause any information to be lost and will improve the quality of wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_cowie_0ddd.html" title="User:Rob cowie">Rob cowie</a> 08:43, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>No. Its deletion will mean that the <i>next</i> time that an editor comes along, makes the mistake (a mistake that has already been made once, and will thus very probably be made again), we'll end up back at AFD again, with your nominating the <i>next</i> duplicate article that is created. There's no need to keep treading this same path through AFD over and over, each time that yet another editor makes this same mistake, when a redirect prevents the problem from actually happening in the future.
<p>There's also the fact that your own merger of the article's content now prevents the article from being deleted. <i>Article <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_ec58.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge">merger</a> does not involve deletion as its final step.</i> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:56, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li>I suspect the error was made prior to the correctly spelt article was created; it seems likely that a user searched for 'Sumela Monastery', did not find a page and thus created it (albeit with a spelling error). I don't follow the logic that the mistake is likely to be made again... this time, a correct article exists. Following this course of action will inevitably lead to vast numbers of redirect pages with incorrect spellings - surely unsustainable? Further, I fail to understand why an article merge (which is essentially an edit by a user) then prevents the article from being deleted. Why is this the case? Is that for ever?<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_cowie_0ddd.html" title="User:Rob cowie">Rob cowie</a> 21:41, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page may be a little vain, but it's not a hoax. This guy has a volume of poetry called 'Silent Nightlife' out which is actually on my bookshelf right now and he's had various pieces in the Times Lit Supplement. I met him at an Ottakars evening in Norwich a few months ago where he read a story. His father is Roger Caldwell as somebody said above. This isn't a hoax, even if he isn't cross referenced on google yet. (YET is the opperative word!) MisterMike</p>

<p>He was on Newsnight Review? Wow, I've only ever seen him on the Daily Politics a few times. I'm pretty sure I saw Caldwell at a signing. His father is Roger Caldwell who signed with Peterloo Poets earlier this year. His grandfather was W. Alex Caldwell who did indeed reesearch malaria and help find a cure. I just did a quick search for you lazy people and found a highly insightful article written for the Social Review in 1999 regarding the Kosovo conflict - <a href="http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/sr233/letters.htm" class="external free" title="http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/sr233/letters.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/sr233/letters.htm</a> It just came to mind that at the signing he declared himself an 'internet sceptic' but I assure my fellow Wikipedians he does exist and the profile is accurate, although I can't confirm the Baltic or bass guitar items.

<p>Tell me did you even know what the social review was at the age of 15. How many novels, volumes of poetry, beautiful short stories had you churned out by the age of 21. Wikipedia is just the start for this internet sceptic. It is important he is recognised on the internet not just amongst book worms and the political academics of the world over. −Signed MysÊlf</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>. ROGER Caldwell's work 'This Being Eden' is listed in the British Library catalogue. I would accept this as irrefutable proof of its commercial publication. However, ALEX Caldwell's work is not listed - which means it either doesn't exist or it is a vanity publication. Hence, caldwell junior cannot be said to be notable for his literary output. <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddie.willers_4fa8.html" title="User:Eddie.willers">Eddie.willers</a> 01:37, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>I second Roadster's suggestion</b> as there are a handful of Billy Brewers having frequent Google hits.

<p>Vanity, advertising. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Bergsma_cf01.html" title="User:Mark Bergsma">Mark Bergsma</a> 15:45, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Although we do now insist on this article to BE REMOVED (together with all other articles and posts that refer to our trademarks including this one), we do not agree with Mark Bergsma on the reasons why.</p>
<p>There is no vanity or advertising whatsoever, only facts.</p>
<p>You (Mark) should learn about the difference.</p>
<p>We are not interested in the kind of customers that would be attracted by claiming we are so much better, faster or cheaper than the competition.</p>
<p>Our Wikipedia pages have been set up strictly to inform people, like most other countries and/or companies maintain one too.</p>
<p>As for mark's problems with the existance of our souvereign state, which has by the way been informally acknowledged as such by the netherlands as well as several other countries, and fellow microstates (note: not micro-nation as we DO have a physical territory),</p>
<p>If mark thinks we're not a real country then his objections certainly also do apply to both Luxembourgh and Belgium, both of which are (partly) former dutch territory, the latter even had a war about it. (At least we've paid for it..)</p>
<p>Mark Bergsma is advised not to interfere with other people's business, as it is likely to fire back at him and make people terminate their participation in projects like Wikipedia.</p>
<p>We hereby declare our participation in the Wikipedia project to be terminated, and revoke any rights to the use of any material or trademarks therefore granted to the Wikipedia project.</p>
<p>The following articles, as well as all other references and uses of the trademarks CyberBunker and CB3ROB within Wikipedia are to be removed: - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB3ROB" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB3ROB" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB3ROB</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberBunker" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberBunker" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberBunker</a></p>

<p>The article claims that he was a pulp writer who failed to find much fame before his death, or after. That's an understatement, since Google finds no evidence of his existence or the existence of his listed writings; neither does Amazon list him as an author. It is still possible that he's simply that obscure (rather than that this is a hoax), but that raises the obvious question of why we'd have an article for an author that obscure. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:52, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>You hit the nail on the head, the reason you can't find him on anything is because he is just that bad and obscure. The only reason I was able to find anythign on him was because for some reason my grandfather took a liking to him and collected all his books. I tried to find more on him and nothing was listed on wikipedia, so I made the page from what I knew. I'm going to argue that just because hes obscure the page should be deleted, I still think he's worth entering.

<li>Well, unfortunately, that's one of the woes of Wikipedia; everyone has their favorite obscure authors/poets/musicians they'd love to write articles about, but if the subject really is that obscure then it doesn't meet Wikipedia criteria.

<li>I'm pretty new to wikipedia, so if you could I'd like to see the actual policy information pertaining to this subject for this example and my own future use. The only thing I can find on this in what wikipedia is not, is that wikipedia is not a memorial and that people must have some claim to fame outside family and friends. I know, as the article specifically states, that he acheived little to no fame, but, he did write a fair amount of books which I think should warrant the article to stay. Now, I have nothing against you, but it would be nice to get a second opinion on this matter, preferably one neither of us is connected to. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeefybot_ce15.html" title="User:Beefybot">Beefybot</a> 15:49, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Helpful Suggestion.</b> If you have copies of the books then can you not, at least, quote the publisher and/or the ISBN? This would verify, wrt wiki standards, that these works exist - despite what the Library Of Congress says! Alternatively, how about scanning the front covers or the whole work? It's now more than 50 years since his death so the books should be in the public domain. <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddie.willers_4fa8.html" title="User:Eddie.willers">Eddie.willers</a> 21:32, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I won't be able to get the ISBN because if I remember correctly that wasn't really adopted until 1970, quite a while after the books were published. I don't have the books with me at the moment (My Grandfather has them) but as soon as I get at them I'll get a publisher and a scan or two if I can. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeefybot_ce15.html" title="User:Beefybot">Beefybot</a> 22:04, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Simply having written a number of books doesn't make one notable. It is the impact that those books have that makes them notable (or at the very least their sales).

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I couldn't find this author in WorldCat either (a catalog of library catalogs). Perhaps if you could include a bit more about the publishers of these books?

<li><b>Delete / Merge</b> This is actually a mistake from the part of the creator of the article. What the creator describes is commonly known as UV Tattoos, and they are not invisible because of the common scarring that occurs when the blacklight ink is incerted to the skin (please forgive my bad English). I will create a new entry for UV tattoos, if that is ok. This article is pretty useless, as it contains <s>few facts and litte information</s> misinformation. <i><small>(previous unsigned comment by <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliF_0fb9.html" title="User:EliF">EliF</a>, 12:48 9 December 2005 (UTC))</small></i></li>

<p><b>Delete:</b> Without unnecessarily dismissing the positive points of including pop-songs, may I draw your attention to the initial question of longevity for this article, as per the wiki guidelines for inclusion? Do you honestly believe that in the year 2105 that a Wikipaedia user is going to type in the words “luxurious” expecting to find this ephemeral, predominantly MTV-specific pop song?</p>
<p>Has it made such an impact on the collective imagination e.g. “Happy Birthday”, “New York, New York”, that our grandchildren’s grandchildren will be singing it?</p>
<p>Due to the very nature of mass marketing, articles about commercial pop songs are very easy to verify. Does this by itself validate their inclusion in this project?</p>
<p>This sort of grass roots advertising is often effectively undetectable, what with zombie e-teamers running all over the web.

<li>'<i>Delete</i> As per nom. Songs in and of themselves are not notable, and there is no indication in the article about this particular song's impact on music in general. There isn't much that would merge well into the article on the album, and there are several other songs from the album which have articles that should be considered for deletion. Perhaps 'Rich Girl' might stay by being briefly mentioned in <i>If I Were a Rich Man (song)</i> as it already is. DeathThoreau 02:42, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Of course <b>keep</b> it. This battle has been fought too many times (the argument over single inclusion) and it has been very decisively determined that the community favors these articles. Unless some evidence arises that the community is moving back towards deletionism on this issue (the general tendency seems to be strongly towards inclusionism), I think nominations like this should simply be removed. Maybe we can still have the vote if a stubborn deletionist insists, but it's absurd to have that template stuck at the top of the article.

<p><b>Delete</b> I am no sock puppet, although the crushing, gang-related mentality of certain rabid Gwen Stefanni fans really does indicate that this project has been infiltrated by e-teamers at the very least, and professional marketing people at worst.</p>
<p>My reasons for pursuing this question was that on the day that Gwen got her free commercial on the front page of Wiki, an article that I was adding to was deleted on very flimsy grounds, in fact the same flimsy grounds that you e-teamers are knocking the system with here and now.</p>
<p>It seems there is one rule for major record labels and quite another (terminal) one for local press.</p>
<p>Two questions: (1) why don't any of "you" address my original question directly, i.e. is it correct to assign words of the English Language to minor historical events in an encyclopaedia, especially pop songs that don't even get much of a UK release? (2) why is this information not included in the pop-stars bio, where it clearly belongs; why must it have its own entry?--<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasBeen_ab7a.html" title="User:HasBeen">HasBeen</a> 09:30, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your replies so far. I don't want to seem pushy, but I don't think my question is being addressed: who will type the words "rich girl" into our search engine expecting to find this thinly-veiled advert for a pop-song, even next year, let alone in 2105?</p>
<p>I'm not doubting that the words "gwen stefanni" will be a popular choice for many browsers, and should details of her songs go there?</p>
<p>This is a question of associating words of the English language with ephemeral pop ditties that frankly do not deserve such attention. Here in the UK, this pop-star is minor, and certainly not worthy of note any more than the long line of Madonna-clones that churn out from over the Atlantic.</p>
<p>I find it highly suspicious that such a quick response was made to my request for deletion, further confirming my suspicions that Wiki is being used by mass-marketers to flog goods.</p>
<p>That the Wiki policy seems to revolve primarily around verification of information makes this advertising easier.</p>

<p>I am no sock puppet, although the crushing, gang-related mentality of certain rabid Gwen Stefanni fans really does indicate that this project has been infiltrated by e-teamers at the very least, and professional marketing people at worst.</p>
<p>My reasons for pursuing this question was that on the day that Gwen got her free commercial on the front page of Wiki, an article that I was adding to was deleted on very flimsy grounds, in fact the same flimsy grounds that you e-teamers are knocking the system with here and now.</p>
<p>It seems there is one rule for major record labels and quite another (terminal) one for local press.</p>
<p>Two questions: (1) why don't any of "you" address my original question directly, i.e. is it correct to assign words of the English Language to minor historical events in an encyclopaedia, especially pop songs that don't even get much of a UK release? (2) why is this information not included in the pop-stars bio, where it clearly belongs; why must it have its own entry? --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasBeen_ab7a.html" title="User:HasBeen">HasBeen</a> 09:29, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HasBeen_7dd2.html" title="Special:Contributions/HasBeen">contributions</a> convince me that you are a sockpuppet. Let's make something clear: if <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">the Beatles</a> are worthy enough of possessing articles for their songs, then so is <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwen_Stefani_f1e7.html" title="Gwen Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a>. The quantity of the song's performance, or the quantity of the musical arist's presence and popularity is irrelevant. In this case, Gwen Stefani will never be as popular as the Beatles were — however that's quantity and overlooks the quality of the actual song inspiration, composition, chart performance, etc. If Stefani should not be allowed to have articles on her single releases, then all of the Beatles singles are going to be removed. —Hollow Wilerding 21:22, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You see, you agree with me! I think Gwen, The Beatles and even Clockface should all be included in this project, I just don't see why we have to endure a free commercial masquerading as a new article every time a new single gets released. <b>The place for this article's content is in the bio. That's where people are going to want to find this information.</b> If I were looking for rare Gwen Steffani b-sides, I'd type in her name, not guess at a half-remembered song title. Please explain to me why including this information in her bio is unacceptable. <b>Move information to bio, then Delete</b> --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasBeen_ab7a.html" title="User:HasBeen">HasBeen</a> 10:20, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia's guideline on notability of songs usually draws the line at singles. B-sides would most likely be merged into the single or album if it were on AfD. Singles released by a notable musician are acceptable in Wikipedia. Simple as that. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> <sup>[ <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndylkl_776e.html" title="User talk:Andylkl">talk!</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andylkl_d01c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andylkl">c</a> ]</sup> 13:45, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, but this particular single drew a blank in the UK, as does this pop-star. I also imagine this is the case in the rest of Europe, Africa, Asia, China etc, etc... Again, <b>please supply one good reason as to why this information should not be copied to her bio</b>; that's where people are going to look for this sort of thing. By all means let's do the same with the Beatles if it makes you feel less "victimised".

<p><b>Delete:</b> Without unnecessarily dismissing the positive points of including pop-songs, may I draw your attention to the initial question of longevity for this article, as per the wiki guidelines for inclusion? Do you honestly believe that in the year 2105 that a Wikipaedia user is going to type in the words “what you waiting for” expecting to find this ephemeral, predominantly MTV-specific pop song?</p>
<p>Has it made such an impact on the collective imagination e.g. “Happy Birthday”, “New York, New York”, that our grandchildren’s grandchildren will be singing it?</p>
<p>Due to the very nature of mass marketing, articles about commercial pop songs are very easy to verify. Does this by itself validate their inclusion in this project?</p>
<p>This sort of grass roots advertising is often effectively undetectable, what with zombie e-teamers running all over the web.

<p><b>Delete</b>. I am no sock puppet, although the crushing, gang-related mentality of certain rabid Gwen Stefanni fans really does indicate that this project has been infiltrated by e-teamers at the very least, and professional marketing people at worst.</p>
<p>My reasons for pursuing this question was that on the day that Gwen got her free commercial on the front page of Wiki, an article that I was adding to was deleted on very flimsy grounds, in fact the same flimsy grounds that you e-teamers are knocking the system with here and now.</p>
<p>It seems there is one rule for major record labels and quite another (terminal) one for local press.</p>
<p>Two questions: (1) why don't any of "you" address my original question directly, i.e. is it correct to assign words of the English Language to minor historical events in an encyclopaedia, especially pop songs that don't even get much of a UK release? (2) why is this information not included in the pop-stars bio, where it clearly belongs; why must it have its own entry? --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasBeen_ab7a.html" title="User:HasBeen">HasBeen</a> 09:28, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HasBeen_7dd2.html" title="Special:Contributions/HasBeen">contributions</a> convince me that you are a sockpuppet. Let's make something clear: if <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">the Beatles</a> are worthy enough of possessing articles for their songs, then so is <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwen_Stefani_f1e7.html" title="Gwen Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a>. The quantity of the song's performance, or the quantity of the musical arist's presence and popularity is irrelevant. In this case, Gwen Stefani will never be as popular as the Beatles were — however that's quantity and overlooks the quality of the actual song inspiration, composition, chart performance, etc. If Stefani should not be allowed to have articles on her single releases, then all of the Beatles singles are going to be removed. —Hollow Wilerding 21:21, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You see, you agree with me! I think Gwen, The Beatles and even Clockface should all be included in this project, I just don't see why we have to endure a free commercial masquerading every time a new single gets released. <b>The place for this article's content is in the bio. That's where people are going to want to find this information.</b> If I were looking for rare Gwen Steffani b-sides, I'd type in her name, not guess at a half-rmemebered song title. Please explain to me why including this information in her bio is unacceptable. <b>Move information to bio, then Delete</b> --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasBeen_ab7a.html" title="User:HasBeen">HasBeen</a> 10:18, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're going to include the many chart tables in Stefani's article? Uh... —Hollow Wilerding 00:16, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Why not? Clearly if all the information is excessive for her bio, then perhaps it should be included in a fan-site, or perhaps her own official webpage? So far the only argument against including this information where it most likely should be placed is one of editing: join the club. All of Wiki's articles are editted in one way or another... Your reply does nothing to assuage my fears that this article is little better than commercial advertisment; is that what wiki is for? <b>Move the information and Delete</b>--<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasBeen_ab7a.html" title="User:HasBeen">HasBeen</a> 09:40, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As I understand it, Jonathan Unger is a fairly substantial figure in his community. And his potential for future prominence seems very great. He is a gifted diarist and has compiled records of his teams' extraordinary championship runs that are the stuff of a good novel or a great movie. Mr. Unger may lack the stature of a professional coach, but if Wikipedia is capable of supporting 850,000+ entries, surely this entry is one that ought to be kept. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 168.98.32.51 (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.98.32.51.html" title="User talk:168.98.32.51">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.98.32.51_e0de.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.98.32.51">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<li>The man is a figure of not just local but regional prominence. He is well-known throughout the Ohio high school sports community -- his undefeated seasons, back-to-back championships, and bizarre but charming habit of giving longwinded and overwrought inspirational/motivational speeches to his OPPONENTS after games have made him probably about as beloved and famous as Gerry Faust was just before he left Ohio high school football to coach Notre Dame. He clearly belongs in the Wikipedia pantheon. By the way, I am not a member of the "14th Circuit" mentioned in the article. Nor do I live in Cincinnati, where Mr. Unger coaches. I have no vested interest in this entry. But I know Ohio high school sports, and I know that this guy is the real thing. He's a coaching giant in the state. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 149.142.180.179 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_149.142.180.179_fb86.html" title="Special:Contributions/149.142.180.179">contribs</a>) 18:58, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>This is not controvertial, but just a misapplication. The formula only works for point masses. It happens that at least as long as you are outside a regular ball mass then the ball's gravity is the same as if all it's mass had been at a point in the center of the ball. So since one of the objects is not outside of the other the formula can not be applied in this case. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 18:42, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In a nutshell, this is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. Claims to be " a superhero" but doesn't say where we can read about him, or even what company publishes books concerning him. The context tag was removed (apparently by the author) without addressing this problem. While there are a lot of results for "Captain sensible" on Google, none clear up this article that I can tell. The problem becomes especially evident when you try to narrow it down <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Captain+sensible%22+Exeter&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Captain+sensible%22+Exeter&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> or find specific terms from the article. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Baron+Von+Reckless%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Baron+Von+Reckless%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22The+Sensible+Throw%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22The+Sensible+Throw%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>.

The article seems to indicate that he is primarily notable for this yet-to-be notable web site. The article said that he "dabbled in photography"; so it is not asserting notability/claim to fame in that arena.

<p>Gents, I assure you that "Patent Jock" is not a coined term or a made up word. This term describes a type of patent attorney, and is known most frequently in the patent bar circles. Indeed, in my firm we frequently used this term to denote a patent attorney skilled in the practice of patent law. I first learned of this term several years ago while studying law. I understand Wikipedia's concerns regarding the delisting of new, coined terms, but Patent Jock does not fall in this category. Also, I am not so sure that measuring a term's worth by a google search should be the test for deletion in Wikipedia. For that matter, what is the test (or standard) that one needs to maintan an entry in Wikipedia? Do you need several entries from other folks attesting to the existense of "Patent Jock"? If so, please let me know. Additionally, please let me know what other evidence you need so that the "Patent Jock" wikipedia entry survives the current delisting onslaught. Further, I plan to further edit the "Patent Jock" entry to further define what the term means and would like to know what additional information I can provide to ensure that you do not delist this term. Many thanks.Jhyancey 11:45 PM ET, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a patent attorney, I think I can speak on this topic.</p>
<p>Shawnc, with all due respect, one who is skilled in the practice of patent law is a great definition of a patent jock. It builds on the standard for reviewing whether a patent is novel and non-obviousness; the government imposes this standard on patent prosecuters or pro se applicants before granting or issuing a patent. Thus, one who is skilled in the practice of patent law is capable of drafting patent applications.</p>
<p>A patent jock not only prosecutes patent applications before the USPTO, but has the skill to litigate patents, and review patents for potential infringement. It is often necessary for a patent jock to have a science background, as being a patent agent or patent attorney requires the same.</p>
<p>I believe I even have seen this term in print; it may have been in a novel having a patent agent or patent attorney as a character. I recognize the term as being used often in Boston, Atlanta, Los Angeles and New York patent circles.</p>
<p>After a quick google search, I found the following:</p>

The origin of the term is not clear but was practiced as early as 1990 by Paul S. Angello of Stoel Rives Boley Jones and Grey, Portland, Oregon. Posted by Jhyancey 12:45 PM ET, 12 December 2005 (UTC) on behalf of US Patent Law Professor.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Although the sites referenced by User:Patentgeek are not of the standard we usually require, I think that in this case the term is so specialized that there may not be any such references.

<li>The device described in this article is not a bottle opener. A bottle opener opens bottles. Although a "church key" is one particular type of bottle opener, <i>this</i> church key is a device that opens <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin_can.html" title="Tin can">tin cans</a>, and is nothing to do with bottles. Take a look at the picture that the article links to. It is even distinct from a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Can_opener.html" title="Can opener">can opener</a>, as a church key is used for opening tin cans in an entirely different way to the way that a can opener opens cans, and is generally used on rectangular cans, where can openers are usually unwieldy. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:06, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Explorer_6bc1.html" title="Internet Explorer">Infernal Exploder</a> blew up on me before I could get back to this.

<li><b>Keep</b>, events in Côte d'Ivoire don't show up that often in the news, but this term's been used by <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5603.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5603.htm" rel="nofollow">U.S. Department of State</a>, which sounds like a reputable enough source for me.
