<li><b>Keep Both</b> I strongly believe that any official member of such a hugely popular band should be included in their history and have their own page. Iron Maiden is one of the top selling and grossing acts in the world. These members are discussed in their DVD biographies and the band even did photo sessions with them. It makes no sense for them to be deleted. I know if I was was scanning the various Maiden band members, I'd be very disappointed to see two names I'd like to know more about, but they have no links. Each member has a story, and I feel they should be included. Leper Messiah 33 22:29, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But alas the articles say nothing of interest. No date of birth, no photo, no where are they now, nothing. The reason? These guys aren't covered by the media because they're not notable. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I have no idea about Go, and agree that the page could do with some explanatory text (to avoid reactions such as Nardman1's, if for no other reason), but (a) most people coming across this page are likely to do so from the main <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kisei.html" title="Kisei">Kisei</a> page, so will get the context from there; (b) there is a WP Go Project who could be asked to tidy up this sort of page if thought necessary, or salvage the main points of this and the other 30-odd similar pages for this championship into a more limited form. Not sure of the appropriate WP policy for recording results of tournaments in this, or other, games/sports - if the policy is no, then the page should go, as it were...

But if we do come to the comprimise of deleting such articles except the 1st Kisei, I'd like it if it wasn't speedied, as I'd like to backup these articles and possibly put them up somewhere else.

<li><b>Keep</b> No one seems to be denying that the subjects of these articles are notable; the only concern seems to be with the quality of the articles, which isn't the concern of AfD. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 05:48, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps; however, it is a disturbing trend recently where AFD is being used as a five-day timed "cleanup now" tag.

<p>As a list, this is an indiscriminate collection of information and redundant to search.

<li>This isn't really what disambiguation pages are for. Nobody could reasonably expect something as generic as "Bell" to be <i>disambiguated</i> (there could be <i>thousands</i> of entries). Furthermore, we have to maintain 2 sets of pages here, the Bells list and the more specific (and proper) dab pages like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Bell_f80c.html" title="Mark Bell">Mark Bell</a>. At the very least shorten the list by listing <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Bell_f80c.html" title="Mark Bell">Mark Bell</a> as one link to that dab page or doing some transclusion. Otherwise, the result is likely to be a badly maintained mess. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In the English language, people are often referred to by their surnames, especially if the speaker or writer doesn't personally know the person. As such, it's completely logical that surnames need to be disambiguated. For example, Bill Clinton is often referred to as President Clinton and Barack Obama is often referred to as Senator Obama.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 05:35, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

There has been no assurance Dr. Becker-Wiedman has released this article under the GFDL.

<li><b>Delete</b>, not because of the copyvio which isn't one as said above.

<dd>Interesting point, that, too. This article is sort of a cluster-f and there seems to be a group that wants to enforce the status quo. I can't exactly explain why I experienced such a sinking feeling when I encountered this article, but I will admit my impulse was "burn it! kill!" as it hurts my brain in so many ways to think about all the issues that encumber it.

<p>The article may benefit from some editing. I fail to see the POV...it currently represents a consensus built after extensive wrangling and the use of advocates, RfC, and mediation. The term is a broad one, without the specificity of the clinical diagnosis of Reactive Attachment Disorder (DSM-IV-R). However, it is a term that is used extensive in literature, on the web, and in various publications. As such, the term does deserve an encyclopedia article discussing the various issues involved in its use, lack of clarity of defination, etc. It is not a POV term for <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_Theory_ebc1.html" title="Attachment Theory">Attachment Theory</a>; that is a completely different term.

<li><b>Rewrite</b> - The use of an entire article copied and pasted into Wikipedia from a single source on a controversial issue must surely be questioned. It's amusing to see people saying "someone has been editing the article" as if that's a bad thing.

<p>This article is about a probation officer who may well be performing a valuable service for society yet does not seem to have attained encyclopedic notability. Although this article contains six external links, none of them appear to have to do with this person. Three of those links go to the home pages of organizations he is affiliated with but with no reference to him personally. Another link <a href="http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/news/17549.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/news/17549.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> supposedly describes a study in which he participated, but the article at that link does not mention this person. And the remaining two links refer to a police officer in <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overland_Park%2C_Kansas_c43a.html" title="Overland Park, Kansas">Overland Park, Kansas</a> being honored for catching a criminal by noticing a forged license plate. However, that incident took place in the year 2000, when the subject of this article was apparently still in community college or university in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, over 400 miles away from Overland Park. Thus, the officer honored in Overland Park is most likely a different person. The article asserts that the subject's main claim to fame is his participation in a study in 2006, yet no sources have been provided that describe that study or connect him with it, nor have I found any on my own. I previously submitted this article for proposed deletion, but the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> tag was removed by the article creator. I recommend a <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:12, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is a registered political party in Newfoundland and Labrador (see reference provided in article) founded by a former Member of the House of Assembly. Also, it now passes the primary criterion of the WP:ORG test: "A company, corporation, organization, group, product, or service is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other."

<li><b>Keep</b> I prod'd this article earlier for being questionable without reference. The notability of a person who died in a truly unique way is hard to disregard. It is true that the article could certainly do with some expansion, particularly about the person in question. Unless there is a copyright violation(copying without permission) using the phrase "copyvio" does not justify a deletion.

<li>Yes, I consider an unverified, probably self-published bio on a BBC website to be an unreliable source and contributory to the COI problems inherent in the article.

<li>I'm afraid I find your argument completely unconvincing. The BBC is not merely a reliable source, but damn near the gold standard of reliable media sources upon which we rely. Furthermore, I'm unsure what your premise is for claiming that this bio is "self-published," other than it is on the BBC website and that Coyle works for the BBC ... how many tens of thousands of employees must the Beeb have? Claiming that the BBC is unreliable just because the subject of the article works for it is a dizzying leap of logic for which I'd be interested in seeing your supporting evidence. Finally, while you lean heavily on the "independent" source argument, in point of fact, nothing in <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> requires the use of independent sources having no connection to the article's subject.

<li>Part of his job is to publish material on the BBC website. That makes the BBC website, <i>as it relates to him</i>, self-published. I would not suggest that the BBC is not a reliable source for stories that are not about topics or persons directly related to the BBC, but in an instance of a BBC website maintainer it's not. The portion of the article talking about his leisure interests is sourced by the website for an organization of which he is the leader, which as far as I'm concerned also constitutes a self-published source. As far as using such sources go, the relevant section of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> states: "Material from self-published or questionable sources may be used in articles about those sources, so long as:</li>

<dd>It is certainly <i>possible</i> that he put up that material. It is by no means self-evident, and you're presuming (based on what premise I cannot fathom) that the BBC is in the habit of letting its webmasters just put up anything they want without any internal controls whatsoever. Furthermore, you're leaving out the beginning sentence in your laundry list - that they pertain either to:

<dd>Right, material <b>that has been published by the author</b>. That's an either-or statement so if it meets either side it's self-published.

You've also failed to address the fact that the remainder of the article is sourced by the website of an organization of which he is the chairman, you've failed to address the fact that there are no sources other than ones that are directly connected to the subject himself that attest to his notability and you've failed to address the conflict of interest issues. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:52, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(shrugs) The <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> <i>guideline</i> (and it is only a guideline) discourages editors with a conflict of interest; it is neither implicitly nor explicitly <i>prima facie</i> grounds for deletion. You have consistently refused to tender your proof that Coyle wrote that bio himself on the BBC website, and you've consistently refused to explain which, if any, biographical elements you challenge. In effect, the sole prop for your argument to delete is the premise that the BBC must be publishing lying bios about its own employees. There comes a point where <a href="../../../s/e/n/WP%7ESENSE_4fdd.html" title="WP:SENSE">common sense</a> should apply, and we're well past it. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, no, the "prop" for my belief that the article should be deleted is that there are no independent reliable sources of which he has been the primary source that attest to the subject's notability. I'm not quite clear where the breakdown in your understanding of that is. It is not a question of "challenging" specific biographical details. It is a question that <i>the article as a whole is not properly attributed</i>. Nor did I ever say that the COI was in and of itself grounds for deletion but it is something that should be weighed in the process rather than just dismissed with "it's just a guideline." Can I prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Coyle himself sat at a comuter and typed out the BBC entry word-for-word? Of course not. But hey, <a href="../../../s/e/n/WP%7ESENSE_4fdd.html" title="WP:SENSE">common sense</a> tells me that the guy who's responsible for maintaining the content of a website had a hand in creating the material. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Telegraph item is about someone named Greg Dyke. The Motherwell Athletics Club is an organization of which Coyle is the chairman, meaning that it's not independent. The Glsgow Student item is a program booklet which mentions Coyle as one of a number of speakers, in a note that's about two paragraphs long, making it a trivial reference. And the EPUK site appears to be an email list, which is one step below a blog as far as a source goes, and I didn't notice a reference to Coyle in it anyway. None of these sources meet <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:01, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A petition signed by dozens or hundreds of people does not establish the notability of the people who signed it.

<li>To the "merge" voters: I can't understand how you want <i>all</i> of these characters to be merged. I can understand a few of them that are both recurring and play roles in the storyline, but do you really want <i>all</i> of them merged? That's ridiculous; the main reason why I'm nominating most of these is because they're non notable and I guarantee you that if <i>all</i> of these characters are merged into a "list of characters" article, I will eventually nominate that one, in turn, if the non notable characters cannot be removed from the list. ♣ <a href="../../../k/l/p/User%7EKlptyzm_14bd.html" title="User:Klptyzm"><font color="blue"><b>Klptyzm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/l/p/User_talk%7EKlptyzm_0579.html" title="User talk:Klptyzm"><font color="#FF0000">Chat wit' me</font></a> <b>§</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klptyzm_dc1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klptyzm"><font color="#FF1234">Contributions</font></a></sup> ♣ 19:56, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>How will having minor characters deteriorate the overall quality of the list? In fact, many lists are <i>entirely devoted to</i> minor characters, such as <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_Seinfeld_bc68.html" title="Minor characters in Seinfeld">Minor characters in Seinfeld</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_characters_on_South_Park_7b61.html" title="List of minor characters on South Park">List of minor characters on South Park</a>.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 08:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ok, either you know <i>nothing</i> about the TimeSplitters series or you're a fanboy of the series, because many of these "minor character" lists list <i>important</i> minor characters; 90 % of these characters listed don't even appear in the <i>storyline</i>, and, if they do, it's only once. Like someone said, most of these articles consist of only the descriptive paragraph found in the "gallery" section of the games, which are not neutral and in-universe and, unfortunately, that's the most you're gonna get out of them. In the end, merge is too generous.

<li><b>Delete all, hell no to merge</b> - there are over one hundred character models in each TimeSplitters game, each one of these has a paper-thin one paragraph storyline and absolutely no significance whatsoever. A merged list of TimeSplitters characters would be a bloated and useless monstrosity, and an incomplete one at that, considering that only a couple dozen characters are covered here.

NONE of these articles are marked for deletion. Yemassee (journal) compares favorably to them in terms of notability. The journal is also notable as the public face of the flagship university of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_South_Carolina_313d.html" title="State of South Carolina">State of South Carolina</a>. It is the most important publication of its kind in the Southeast--the literary leader in the region. Creative writers know about this journal, and they know its history and its prestige. Your measure of the importance of the journal based upon its web presence doesn't really mean anything. Just because you can't come up with thousands of hits on google doesn't mean that something is not notable or important. If you can think of another way for me to make it sound more notable, then please make a suggestion, but I contend that the journal is <i>clearly</i> notable.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, first off, if you claim the information is verifiable, verify it; let's see some sources. Secondly, you make a number of unsupported claims about the magazine's notability -- THE public face of the university (I'm sure the school's sports teams would demur)? THE most important such publication in the Southeast? If it is as overwhelmingly highly regarded as all of that, that regard should be based on fact, not supposition; source any such reviews or critical acclaim (I don't consider it a positive sign that the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Public_Library_d990.html" title="Boston Public Library">Boston Public Library</a>, a library exceeded in size of collection only by the Library of Congress and Harvard's, doesn't have this literary leader in its collection). Thirdly, while the article drops several names, there is nothing backing that up. If there indeed have been such interviews, issue please? Fourthly, whether the article constitutes original research or is written in NPOV style or not is irrelevant; the merits of this AfD aren't on such grounds. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 05:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is <i>not</i> irrelevant that the article presents no original research and is written in NPOV. The merits of the journal do not rest on its popularity with Boston Libraries but rather upon the quality of its publications. I will add the issues corresponding to the interviews that are now mentioned in the article. The journal is obviously the <i>literary</i> public face of the university, along with Dr. <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwame_Dawes_d58f.html" title="Kwame Dawes">Kwame Dawes</a>--Distinguished Poet in Residence, Director of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Carolina_aeeb.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> Poetry Initiative, and faculty advisor to Yemassee (journal)--and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janette_Turner_Hospital_9e96.html" title="Janette Turner Hospital">Janette Turner Hospital</a> (acclaimed novelist, Distinguished Professor, and Distinguished Sponsor of Yemassee. The claims of notability made in the article itself, backed up by the journal's website and by the printed publications of the journal, establish the notability clearly. <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwame_Dawes_d58f.html" title="Kwame Dawes">Kwame Dawes</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janette_Turner_Hospital_9e96.html" title="Janette Turner Hospital">Janette Turner Hospital</a>, and Dr. <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Bruccoli_6234.html" title="Matthew Bruccoli">Matthew Bruccoli</a> (a patron of Yemassee) do not lend their support to literary ventures of no merit. Indeed, their support contributes to the journal's notability. As mentioned above, <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Walcott_2217.html" title="Derek Walcott">Derek Walcott</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazuo_Ishiguro_1af5.html" title="Kazuo Ishiguro">Kazuo Ishiguro</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Olen_Butler_3a53.html" title="Robert Olen Butler">Robert Olen Butler</a>, winners of the <b>Nobel</b>, <b>Booker</b>, and <b>Pulizter</b> prizes do not grant interviews to non-notable publications. Indeed, the presence of their interviews within the pages of Yemassee are alone enough to verify its notability.
<ul>
<li>Fair enough -- <i>then back up your assertions.</i> You are quite incorrect if inferring that the quality of this publication (such as it may be) is at all pertinent here. Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion rests principally on <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">verifiability</a>. As you should know, the publication's own website does not suffice for verification purposes per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. Yay for sourcing that namedropping; now all you have to do is come up with some third-party verifiable sources for the mag's reputation, or else edit those out. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 01:28, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>At the risk of being contentious, your arguments are a little circular. Notable and famous literary people are interviewed in the journal, ergo the journal is important because famous literary people wouldn't be interviewed in an unnotable journal. What I'm looking for is articles <b>about</b> the journal. I also notice that Yemassee is not indexed by <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/" class="external text" title="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/" rel="nofollow">Project Muse</a>. And, yes, while Google hits are not a sole indication of notability, they do provide one marker or indication of possible notability. For example, although I'm not a close follower of literary journals, I have heard of <i>diacritics</i> and <i>Sewanee Review</i>. Should all of the journals you mentioned above have articles on Wikipedia? I don't know. That falls under <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a>. I'm a little concerned that your argument is one of "fame contagion". On Wikipedia, the wife or husband of a notable person isn't automatically notable <b>because</b> of their relationship. I'm thinking a similar standard here. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b><font color="green">Pig</font></b><sup><font color="red">man</font></sup></a><sub><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">dialogue</a></sub> 02:22, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>RGTraynor, okay. You make some fair points. I'll go to the library. The journal was founded in the same year at <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Dickey_687c.html" title="James Dickey">James Dickey</a>'s 70th birthday. Dickey was the king of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_South_Carolina_d301.html" title="University of South Carolina">University of South Carolina</a> English Department at the time, so perhaps he was the first faculty advisor. Would that be notable? Otherwise, I'll sort through newspapers.</li>

</ul>

</ul>
<p>Pigman, literary journals achieve notability by publishing famous authors. This is not circular. It works in reverse: publications become less notable when they stop publishing famous/notable authors. What you call "fame contagion" is, in fact, the primary principle of notability for a small, tax-exempt, non-profit literary publication. In fact, such a publication cannot do much better than Yemassee has done. It is clear, that you are "not a close follower of literary journals." Another way that small literary publications achieve notability is by publishing texts that are selected for awards. See the article for new info on this front. Notice that it is cited.</p>
<ul>
<li>Err ... perhaps you are conflating the term "notability." I mean it as it is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">defined on Wikipedia</a>, not by some subjective non-Wikipedia standard. To quote: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered. If the depth of coverage is not substantial, then multiple independent sources should be cited to establish notability. Trivial, or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability ... Notability is not synonymous with "fame" or "importance". It is not measured by Wikipedia editors' own subjective judgements." This is where Yemassee fails completely, so far, and this is why its lack of inclusion in the collection of the United States' largest municipal library is damning. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:08, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is list that is entirely original research; there are no sources to back up the loooong list of POV claims. (And, no, random people on the Internet are not acceptable as sources, we need confirmation from people who have an actual involvement with those characters, which is exceptionally unlikely. A POV that's shared by some guy with a website is still a POV.)

This is just a handful of blurry home videos uploaded by some guys over a period of several years to their own website, and must they be thankful that Youtube exists now. Looking at the previous AfD, the assertion that closing admins look at the merits of the debate rather than counting votes is a touch shaky. A directed Google search (minus Wikipedia and their own website) turns up <b>zero</b> hits. To their credit, this was posted to their website's own log: "In case anybody cares, the Kyle and Evan Do The Movies article on Wikipedia is on its way to an eventual death. It's been flagged with 3 seperate "this is not a good article" notices. They also have a good point, it's not notable according to the notability guidelines." <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:12, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> To be completely fair, looking at the original AfD again, most of the delete arguments weren't exactly convincing either. They were simple votes with no explanation. So I think keeping the article was the correct move, but not as a "keep", but as a "no consensus". <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> (<a href="../../../y/t/n/User_talk%7EYtny_624b.html" title="User talk:Ytny">talk</a>) 19:12, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This cut-and-paste nomination streak is bothersome, and suggests kneejerk nomination with no attempt to uncover whether the subject is notable. In Shine's case, she appears to be. UK Google returns nearly twelve thousand hits, she's got a dozen or more books currently in print, and among those hits are reviews and citations from the Observer, the BBC and other such sources. All that took me about four minutes to research.

<li>Good point. Based on that, I suppose it's a possible search term for either the mother or the child, and a redirect to the mother's article, which mentions both, is appropriate.

<li><b>Comment</b>, there are no reliable sources provided in the entry. With a search, I see phrases like "Guy Finley is the best-selling author of...", but I can't find anything reliable to back this up. When did he appear on the list of bestsellers? I also see that he was signed to Motown Records; anything to back that up as well? The subject's own website, his publisher's website, and a blog aren't quite convincing. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 11:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. You have got to be kidding me; this cut-and-paste AfD nominating is getting overripe. Finley has over 127 <b>thousand</b> Google hits, his website is a Google featured link, the article is extensively sourced, he has a weekly radio show, his book has an Amazon sales rank around 24,000 (which is pretty good, especially for a five year old New Age book).

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not particularly convinced by the Google hits argument, as most of that is just people talking about him on their personal websites, not publications. The Google sponsored link was likely paid for by his website. The article isn't very extensively sourced, at least not to multiple independent reliable third-party publications.

<li>From <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: "Notability can be determined by ... a large fan base, fan listing, or "cult" following." 127,000 hits of nothing but people talking about this guy on their blogs is a considerable cult following; we've passed Youtube "entertainers" with a tenth that much buzz. On his book sales alone he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; there's the one book with an Amazon sales rank of 24,000.

<p>This term supposedly refers to <i>"fantasy in which the world (unlike other fantasy settings) closely follows the laws of science"</i>. This term appears to be original research, and has no clear definition or difference from other genres. The Category:Hard fantasy contains many settings that are heavy with magic, such as Tolkien's and Steven Erikson's. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:27, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem with the term <i>hard fantasy</i> is that it is hard to define it. There seems to be two competing definitions out there, one being the above mentiond, and the other being essentially the opposite, core fantasy with little resemblance to the real world. Most of the sources I find, unfortunately, seem to be blogs and it's doubtful if there exist enough reputable sources out there to salvage it. <b>Weak Delete</b> for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_fantasy.html" title="Hard fantasy">Hard fantasy</a> unless it can be sourced and mentions the competing definitions to avoid <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issues. <b>Strong Delete</b> on the category, though, as the term has no accepted definition yet any such list or category would seem nonsensical to the reader - but isn't CfD a better place to list that? <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:02, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The sourcing problem still exists. The first source you offer must be discounted because we don't even know what that source says. The second two you have posted are the same book, and even it is a little dubious as it admits the definition is arbitrary and perhaps even a neologism. Again with proper sourcing I'm not opposed to hanging on to this one but unfortunately all that can be found thus far is blogs or indeterminate sources. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 17:03, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'd be happy to do so. "Closely" follows the laws of science? How closely? Are there any supernatural elements at all? If so, how are <i>those</i> justified? Oh, you mean they follow the laws of science because the author (or the person making the assertion) wants it to do so and has cobbled together a rationalization. And so on. From many years exposure and experience, the ability of SF&amp;F fans to split hairs down to millimeters thick is huge, and I doubt you'd get anywhere remotely close to a consensus as to what qualifies as "hard fantasy" or not, let alone whether specific works met those criteria. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:48, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ah, I see. Well, as I see it, that's a problem for the people using the terminology. They're welcome to argue over it. However, it is used, so Wikipedia should include information on it. If there's more than one conflicting use, then include any that can be sourced. The lack of definitiveness, especially in genre fiction, doesn't bother me. I can accept that the subject will remain in dispute. Thus the thing to do is cover the dispute, not ignore the subject. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just because hard scifi is recognized doesn't mean that hard fantasy is - in fact it doesn't seem like there is much academic research regarding it and the only use of the term seems to be on blogs, message boards, and the like. It's like saying that just because "hard scifi" is a legit genre then "hard horror", "hard Victorian era dramas", etc must be considered equally as legit. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 01:57, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The information in this article. Its completely unreferenced. Lets hope Charles Fort was actually conducting original research when he did his experiments, because otherwise it would be 'academic' plagiarism. Very little of Charles Fort on mysterious appearances and disappearances is salvageable, now that I look at it more carefully. Its mostly a tangent essay that just invokes his name. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECornellrockey_19bb.html" title="User:Cornellrockey">Cornell Rockey</a> 16:28, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article poses a conflict of interest, as the originating editor is also apparantly one of the founders of the venture. The content is mostly speculative, considering that the working reference describes the site as being in "open beta" therefore it fails <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>. The article mentions that they attracted some venture capital, but there's no indication that the website itself is notable, only perhaps the funding thereof. It's not even a particularly large amount of venture capital. The website itself appears non-notable, and the links that might confirm notability are broken. Wikipedia is not a place for you to garner publicity for your web 2.0 startups. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 12:36, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, changing my view to a <b>weak keep</b>.

I won't be upset if this does get deleted, but I would suggest the closing admin take a look at the sources before making a decision. Verifiable = yes. Notable = maybe. Conflict of interest = yes.

<li><b>keep</b> - this is the most important <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyboard.html" title="Bodyboard">Bodyboard</a> competition in the world tour currently. You can't argue the notability of a competition by it's prize solely (but you seem to have misread the top prize: you only listed the prize when it wasn't an international event yet). You should have tried the article's talk page before AfD this article. Too harsh behaviour! <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 16:53, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Per the article, which is the only evidence a casual reader has about the event, the last competition was in 2003. If it's the most important competition, why hasn't there been one in the past four years. BTW, the top prize in 2003 was $6000 USD, hardly a large sum compared with the top prizes in other athletic events. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparklingWiggle_144a.html" title="User:SparklingWiggle">SparklingWiggle</a> 13:38, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The competition is still going on. I did not have the time to include the information about 2004, 2005, 2006 and upcoming 2007 event. I thought the community would take care of this. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 13:44, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Prize</b> alone does not justifies. <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyboard.html" title="Bodyboard">Bodyboard</a> is a sport with lack of sponsoring, so competitions do not amount to so high a prize as surfing yet. It's getting better. But this is the most notable event in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Tour_7a82.html" title="World Tour">World Tour</a> currently. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 13:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Prize certianly does contribute quite a bit to an event's level of prestige. If the event had a prize on the order of $100k to $1 mil I don't think there would be as much question about its notability. We list collectible card tournaments with scant sources because their prizes can be up to a million dollars. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparklingWiggle_144a.html" title="User:SparklingWiggle">SparklingWiggle</a> 14:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Please, see the article again, I have provided a few sources for the stats and updated with 2004, 2005 and 2006 data. I don't think I need to provide anything from the sources above, which are mainly USA sources which tend to ignore the rest of the world, mainly a sport that is more common in Australia, Brazil, Portugal, etc. As I said to you, this is a sport which is currently suffering from lack of sponsoring.

<li><b>Delete</b>. While it's clearly important in the bodyboarding community, there is nothing notable here for an encyclopedia.

<li>The self-referential citations are for the stats which came from the primary source to avoid errors. I think I'm now confused as what is a notable sports event. It is the most important bodyboard event in the tour today along with the Pipe Master. I don't know if wikipedia is running out of disk space, but I think this article is encyclopedic due to its relevancy to an international sport. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 17:09, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The problem is - you can't ask readers to take your word for it. You have to provide reliable, independent, verifiable citations that show how important the event is.

It is the same as denying that an statement of an authoritative association like <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a> is not reliable. IBA is the authoritative association of bodyboarding in the world, it has the final word on rules and which competitions count to the tour.

By the way the articles about the World Tour and IBA are still lacking information, they are all stubs right now.

<p>This does not read like any sort of encyclopedic article, nor does the framing of the article (its title, scope, and so on) seem particularly useful. At best, this is a series of thoughts and ideas (presented in an argumentative or persuasive style) that might be relevant to various articles on religion and politics.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact that this article in its current state is not very good is not grounds for its deletion. This is a well known term from Jungian psychology. Jungian psychology may be a load of myth-mongering codswallop, but the better known features of its jargon such as this (41K google hits) deserve articles. If you think it covers material better handled elsewhere, turn this into a fancy disambiguation page, with brief discussions of what aspects of it are discussed elsewhere. A plausible search term, it should not be left blank, nor its history erased from public memory. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 18:45, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>in that case, can you suggest appropriate Jungian psychology redirect target? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 19:28, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd have to defer to experts here, but my guess is that some would be discussed under <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_unconscious.html" title="Collective unconscious">collective unconscious</a>, mentioned above. <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archetype.html" title="Archetype">Archetype</a> is also something that should be mentioned here. Both of those articles, but especially <i>archetype</i>, could stand improvement themselves. The Theosophical concept of <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_race.html" title="Root race">root races</a> also is deserving a mention in this context; it represents a stream of prior speculation from which Jung borrowed heavily and consciously. Surprisingly, the Theosophical article is the best one on a related subject I have seen; that bit of lore is now picturesque enough to be 'interesting'. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 20:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No expertise here from me, I'm not that kind of Psychology Professor. I don't think a fancy "List of topics only superficially related to the Jungian concept of Racial Memory" disambiguation page has a good prospect of achieving featured list status. From a quick look around, there doesn't seem to be an obvious redirect target. If this is to be kept, I suggest making into a <a href="../../../j/u/n/Category%7EJungian_psychology_bbcf.html" title="Category:Jungian psychology">Category:Jungian psychology</a> stub. Keeping all these poor and unsourced musings is a bad idea IMHO. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 20:45, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Why guess when one can <i>look for</i> those experts? Looking for sources is part of the proper study of encyclopaedists, and it certainly prevents the error of lumping Freudian concepts into Jungian psychology. Some quick research turns up <a href="http://dx.doi.org./10.2307/488538" class="external text" title="http://dx.doi.org./10.2307/488538" rel="nofollow">this</a>, page 24 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 069102586X</a> and pages 385–386 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0898623871</a> (both of which latter discuss Freud's postulation of a racial memory, the former in relation to the ethnopsychology of Jews and the latter in relation to perceived resistance by patients to analysis), and page 182 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0674615409</a> (which also discusses Freud and racial memory). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> This cannot persist unreferenced, and I think it is a bunch of hooey, personally, but I certainly heard mention of it in intro psych in reference to Jungian psychology, so references exist out there for someone to write such an article.

<li><b>Follow-up Comment</b> - There is still no official announcement. MLB previously announced plans for a network in 04, but then abandoned them for a proposed network with Fox, before this DirecTV discussion begun. The NBA and Time Warner announced a joint sports network in 2002, but that didn't materialize either.

Not that prize amounts are automatically tied to notability, but this was something set up by the guy's sister and the prize is 1,000 pounds and a silver pen?

<dd>Are there multiple independent reliable sources that attest to the claim that the award is the most prestigous of its type in England? I looked at a few dozen sources and could not find any that mentioned the award in that context or much beyond any context other than being trivially noted in articles about various recipients. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Her article, the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomsbury_Group_3901.html" title="Bloomsbury Group">Bloomsbury Group</a> article and a cursory look through a number of online sources don't indicate to me that Garnett was anything more than a tangential part of the group so I'm not finding a keep argument on that basis very persuasive. I am also not finding sourcing indicating that the Ackerley prize she won is of a calibre that asserting her notability on the basis of winning it is similarly unpersuasive to me. Her notability seems to be almost exclusively a product of her relatives' and notability is non-transferable. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:46, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is an important repository of old Jèrriais texts (some published, some unpublished), and it has been used extensively by those trying to work with Jèrriais who do not live on-island.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>I have now amended my profile page, if you all kindly go there, you will see my views about all issues concearning Wikipedia. Mind you, I have actually written a few articles on here, during the last 2 years,.. Most of them weren't in connection with Croatia. My IP address has few months ago changed, meaning, that most articles I wrote on here, have been approved as stubs, with proper references to support them, and other users contributions.<br />
However, I decided a few months ago to start contributing to more disputable articles...for example critisizing [Dubrovnik Highlands] article..which is totally OR...and yet, considered a stub with no references.<br />
In the same time, my article which is part of Croatian ethnology, unfortunate for being mostly from oral traditions, is being nominated for deletion simply because they never heard of it, pretty much brings us back to the whole Dalmatian Action Party (Dalmatinska Akcija) subject. I know I can wirte an article about them, and give plenty of reliable references to go with it,... but then,.. why would I bother, when someone could just as easly, delete my article on the grounds that it isn't Croatian enough.....And, I would have wasted another hour on this site, for no reason. --<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELondon321_53c8.html" title="User:London321">London321</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELondon321_35fb.html" title="User talk:London321">►</a></span> 16:30, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>How nice of you to claim that it's discrimination and anti-Dalmatian sentiment that is the reason your this article has been nominated for deletion ("And now, my latest article about the accent of Korzulot has been nominated for deletion, simply because it just might be to sensitive for a few croats.(on the grounds that its not referenced).").<br />
Unfortunately, I didn't nominate it for deletion because I have some vendetta against Dalmatians or because I'm a Croat apologist or whatever. I nominated it because <i>there's no evidence this dialect exists</i>. If it does exist, and been mentioned in a reliable published source, by all means cite it, and I'll cheerfully admit I was wrong. But if it hasn't been mentioned in a reliable published source, even if it does exist, then Wikipedia does not allow the article to exist, because it is <b><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a></b>. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 18:15, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll try this again. You want to delete this article citing it as "indiscriminate information". Then by your definition, <b>all</b> the episodes should be put up for deletion, since they follow the same format. You also say that this is not notable. Care to explain how it's not, seeing as it's the pilot episode and serves as the basis of the entire show?

<li>1. This is not a mass AfD. Please discuss whether or not <i>this</i> article should be deleted. 2. The episode in question is non-notable because there are not enough reliable, 3rd party sources to write an article. 3. The article is a scene-by-scene plot summary of a TV episode.

<li>Where did I say that this was a mass AfD? I only said that if you're going to can this one, can them all since they fall into the same category that you have placed this one in.

I also took the time to read some of the discussions surrounding this issue and they all seem to agree that AfD's like this will cause more harm than good.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Some episodes of some series are notable - for instance, the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Enough_at_Last_261d.html" title="Time Enough at Last">Twilight Zone where Meredith breaks his glasses</a>. But every episode of every notable series is not going to become a part of pop culture. This means that these articles will never be anything beyond plot summaries and "special guest" lists, occasionally with an item or two of dubious-quality trivia. <b>While the information is interesting - sometimes even fascinating - to pour over</b>, I don't believe it belongs in Wikipedia. I'm not aware of a TV-related Wiki, but there surely must be one leading candidate to which this material can be transferred. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, however - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_I_Love_Lucy_episodes_e313.html" title="List of I Love Lucy episodes">airdates and episode titles of television shows are good</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a>. Episodes of television shows which have made a <i>timeless, lasting impression</i> on popular culture - and yes, I am a stodgy, pole-in-the-ass academic - deserve mention. The third episode of the fourth season of Aaron Spelling's Presentation of Stephen King's Suchandwhat does not deserve an article of its own. The "keep" vote above me seems to be based on a slippery slope fallacy, with shades of <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a>. I'm sure that my opinion is not the most popular one there is - but if <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, then I think it's best to begin backing that up with action - even if it means hundreds and hundreds of new AfDs. --Action Jackson IV 07:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or at worst merge. I am fine with almost any television show broadcast on a major network having its own article. If you don't want that, then I would be content with including the information on a page like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ben_10_episodes_8ee3.html" title="List of Ben 10 episodes">List of Ben 10 episodes</a>. But deletion? Nope. If you want other content, see if that can be added. Especially for the premiere episode, which could have a lot of information come out about it. Has this show been released on DVD with a directory's commentary? That would be quite useful in adding more content. But seriously though, if this is about a general issue, then it's important to note that isn't just an issue which would impact one series, but literally dozens. I suggest taking it to the Village Pump instead. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a one episode character from the Simpsons. He has no real notability besides the one episode, his arguably notable death, and a few cameos(by family and grave).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Explain to me where this article fails inclusion criteria. He's a notable character from a very notable episode and notability shouldn't be dicatated by his number of appearances. There are entire chapters of books (ie. <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_Simpson_9dc8.html" title="Planet Simpson">Planet Simpson</a>) devoted to his one appearance. I'd say that he is more important to the series than half of the characters that have pages and I have no idea why people keep going after this page when there are much less notable Simpsons characters with pages. And, the afd system is being misused. It shouldn't be used with the sole intention of getting an article merged. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 00:19, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I just saw that it was a problem article, so I decided to put it here. I really don't see how any of that earns him a page. That should be what places him apart from nameless characters. Even then, the bulk of the page is a plot summary and trivial cameos, basically the same thing as a list entry linking to the episode article. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 00:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So? Then you slap a clean up tag on it, you don't nominate it for deletion. I think The Simpsons WikiProect has pretty good about merging character pages (there are about 80 right now and I have plans to merge another 10), but I really do think that Grimes is a standout. It also isn't easy to merge pages considering that we're supposed to keep the one-time and recurring character lists short, but they fill up fast. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 00:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, I shouldn't. This is a one-time character who is popular among fans and the writers/animators/etc. That does not constitute notability.

<li>Well, as I see it, I think your evaluation is based on a faulty premise. An article's existence is a minimal question. There is no level between individual articles in and of themselves, whether it be Frank Grimes, Sideshow Bob, Homer Simpson or Abe Lincoln. One individual article? Means little. The length of the article, now that can mean a lot, or the existence of other articles about aspects of the subject, even a category in some cases. So, I really don't think your complaint makes a difference. Almost everybody could be said to have an article. If that's all you look at, then I'd say your perspective was myopic. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:35, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> If Leno goes 'jaywalking' and asks about Damocles, most people won't know. If they do know, they probably know <i>because</i> of <i>The Simpsons</i>. Ask them about Frank Grimes, and you'll get more correct answers than asking for Damocles. So no, at no point will they even be in the same situation.

<dd>If they know who Frank Grimes is, yes. The fact of the matter is that even despite that, Damocles deserves an article much more. The only arguments for Frank Grimes are popularity and "I like it", while those against it have redundancy to the episode's article combined with lack of a significant role in the series. Major popularity, minor importance. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 01:01, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Popularity and notability are two entirely different things. The only reason that this AfD won't pass is both because someone posted that it was being AfDing on the Simpsons Project (which is really in bad form, since it looks more like a call to arms than trying to get specific editors involved) and because people use the "I like it" argument. But regardless, the closing admin should take into consideration that the AfD was skewered by the Simpsons cabal being called to arms to defend the article. And by the way, do you have any coverage by a source other than the creators, fans, or a fan site? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 03:34, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, I would say the reason this AfD won't pass is because the argument for deletion is unconvincing. Now that said, the person making the nomination really should have consulted with the project before this action anyway. Not saying whatever their opinion might have been would have forbidden this, but that would have been a better way to go about the process. However, since it was nominated, getting the involvement of editors interested in the subject of the Simpsons is very important, which is why I did add it to the main page. Adding it to the talk page? Bit redundant, but I don't see too much of a difference. Now if somebody is going out and soliciting individuals, that would be more inappropriate. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Quick question, is it Grimes being discussed, or Homer's Enemy? For those to really show Grimes as notable, they should have little to no mention of the episode. Also, if these books do truly define his notability, why are they only used to source things that happened in the episode? And ALTTP, I believe those count as secondary sources. They're written by people that study the Simpson's effect on culture(as far as I can tell), which seems to match it's definition.<a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 16:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

Citing things about the episode doesn't do that. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 18:25, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I thought that sentence was something that would be original research if not attributed, are you saying the episode says he represents the real world? That the books talk about him is what establishes notability, it's dissecting his appearance in the episode. It's not whether he is bound to episode, but whether he is a notable enough aspect of the episode. The keeps feel he is. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 19:46, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>So? If all he is is a notable character in that episode, his notability doesn't escape the episode.

<li>Not true, being in multiple episodes doesn't establish notability, and being in one episode doesn't preclude it.

<li>How can you say "per Augurr"? That's not even a legitimate reason to keep. Hell, if I was being a Frank Grimes, I would be in the right - if I'm being Frank Grimes, I would be realistic.

<li>The main defense in keeping the article is that Grimes is notable. So far, only the epsisode has been notable. Grimes is always mentioned with the episode. That asserts no notability. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 20:26, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>See <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html#Primary_criterion" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)#Primary criterion</a>. It says: <i>person is notable if he or she has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, intellectually independent,6 and independent of the subject. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered. If the depth of coverage is not substantial, then multiple independent sources should be cited to establish notability. Trivial, or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability.</i></dd>
<dd>A student newspaper is not not reliable because a student is not an expert. Anyone who goes to that school, whether a student or a professor can create a page on anything, and post it on the school website. Just because it is there does not make it reliable.--<a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 03:45, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
