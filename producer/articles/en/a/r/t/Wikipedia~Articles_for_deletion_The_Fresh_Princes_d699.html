<li><b>Don't delete</b> This article is about a music group popular in the Long Island, New York underground, not the Will Smith show. This is one of the few detailed accounts of its kind. Popularity is not grounds for validity. Information regarding this band is scant, and can only be found in a few magazines. I feel bad for the experimental music community if they are all treated in the same manner as the Fresh Princes. I have relatives of relatives who live in their hometown, and all of this information seems to be relevant and valid in regard to their history and personalities.

<li><b>do not delete</b>The Fresh Princes, or Ozark Softscape, are absolutely wonderful. They are pioneers of this age. While they seem to have a larger following in Asia, it is important for cultural scholars to have a place to find otherwise inaccessible material on them. Rather than simply suggest deletion, it would be helpful for both those interested and the authors themselves for an explanation to be included.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Do not delete</b> There are no limitations on the actual popularity of the subject of the article. Just because this subject is obscure to some, does not mean that it is innapropriate for this database. This is article is clear, concise, and to-the-point. It effectivly explains the topic of the article in an informative, and unadvertising manner. It provides no external links, and does not solicit. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.47.1.254 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.47.1.254_2dac.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.47.1.254">contribs</a>) 21:59, 29 July 2005.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is an coherent, objective article regarding a group that is obviously important to a demographic of shifting its musical attention. Its incidental lack of nationwide popularity is not a fair grounds of deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.184.172.80 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.184.172.80_e74d.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.184.172.80">contribs</a>) 22:02, 29 July 2005.</small> ...which would be this user's <b>third</b> vote.</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> While this band is obscure, I belive that it does warrent a listing here at Wikipedia. The information contained is well thought out and informitive.

<li>You're partially right, we love informative, thought out articles, but not everything needs one. For example, I could write a very thought out and informative article on my friend's dog.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A band who formed earlier this year and to date have not had a record commercially released or played a national tour.

<p>I would bet that the Fresh Princes have no idea this exists. There were quite a few mistakes in this article because they are basically about as popular today as <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung_Leg_799c.html" title="Lung Leg">Lung Leg</a>. It might actually be flattering to them. It really is amazing how much they were able to contribute when they were under the Girls title. In any case, the "sockpuppets" you mention are a result of confusion in using the convoluted voting system.</p>

<p>No one here likes The Fresh Princes? This is ridiculous! Why does everyone care so much anyway? Also, I recall that one of the people who voted against this article wrote a series on KISS. WHAT IS THE EXCUSE? <small>(Unsigned comment by 24.184.172.80 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.184.172.80_e74d.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.184.172.80">contribs</a>))</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Get a clue. Wikipedia has guidelines for what makes musicians notable. Please see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines</a> and don't take the VfD process personally. Multiple unsigned entries, from unregistered users, made to look like votes (except that the proper way to express <i>Don't Delete</i> is actually <i>Keep</i>) does not help your case. Only one vote can be considered. Making points outside of Wikipedia guidelines does not help your case, either. Whether we like them or not doesn't enter into it at all. Oh, and -- signing with 4 tildes "~~~~" is easy. Watch: <a href="../../../w/c/f/User%7EWCFrancis_461e.html" title="User:WCFrancis">WCFrancis</a> 08:12, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Oddly enough I have run into valid forms of this band all over the wildly exciting internet. They are an ever popular and dare I say prolific band that many seem to enjoy. For the rest of you that have seemingly wasted much time on debating the inclusion or (mostly) exclusion of this entry, I pity you for trying to create such an exclusionary site for absolutely no reason. 68.117.137.4 03:29, 3 August 2005 (UTC)MJK68.117.137.4 03:29, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, you must spend your time on a different wildly exciting internet than I do. A search for "The Fresh Princes" Pogsnatcher got me, count 'em, zero hits. A search for just "the fresh princes" got 138 hits, none that I could see referring to this group. So non-notable it is. No one here doubts the fact that your band is entertaining. But you do not have a track record. This encyclopedia stretches its arms far more broadly than any paper-based encyclopedia, but it is still an encyclopedia and it only accepts entries on those who have achieved some degree of notability. Please read the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> article to see what is required for a band article to make it here (and yes, it's not official policy yet, but it is about as close as you're going to get). <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 04:31, 2005 August 3 (UTC)</li>
