<dd>He is not "well known". He certainly is not one of "the few" who have published on Jewish "meditation and mysticism" or in the areas of "meditation and reincarnation". He is a <b>self published</b> vanity author, who has never had a book reviewed by a major publication. He apparently created this article and spammed references to himself all around wikipedia to drum up publicity for himself. He is the very definition of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and has no <b>non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject</b>, let alone multiple references.

<dd>Actually you are incorrect. Aronson publish real books but are also a vanity publisher. Meaning they will publish almost anything as long as you pay them. Give them a call and ask them - I happen to be well aware of the situation there. Not that that would make any difference - there are still no non-trivial published works with Pinson as a subject way which are notable in any and he has very low ghits. There are many more notable than him Goldie Milgram, Ariel Bar Zadok, Akiva Belk, Akiva Tatz, Joanne Gerber and the list goes on. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">David Spart</a> 11:28, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the books are vanity, and the "reviews" are all in non-notable publications and are mostly not about his books especially. There are no non-trivial external sources about this individual, merely two or three fleeting references to his work (one by a friend) and a review in a non-notable web journal. "Ascent to Safed" said that he is "reliable and authoritative", that just about says it all. You choose to delete Sokolovsky a few weeks ago because he is against your POV despite being notable, but want an article on a genuine nobody because he conforms to your own POV despite having no notability whatsoever. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">David Spart</a> 12:53, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b> - the seconadry sources cited in fact do not make him notable. The citations at ZEEK/ Forward are using him as a safe whipping post to say what they dont like about current Haredi books seeking to present Judiasm in a hip way. They show just the oppsoite of notability. They show that he is a small enough person that a reviewer can trash him and not worry about reprisal. The article from Brown is in a STUDENT journal of Brown U. is just that, a student journal. We dont included every rock band, visiting rabbi, or hillel director who gets cited in a student article. The books do indeed seem vanity and it looks like several of his works have not even appeared. He uses of conflict of interest words and peacock words in his own self promotion, these words of promotion are then compied into the articles by and about him is equally a sign of NN. He may be a nice guy, a smart guy, and he may give many lectures, but he is less than Steve Burg - head of NCSY - whom we decided to delete. He is also less than several of the names mentioned above. He also may be important in 5 years from now, but now he is not. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">Jayrav</a> 20:06, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd just like to note that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> states that <i>a topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other.</i> It doesn't say that it's not notable if those sources "trash" the subject (meanwhile I don't agree that Forward or Zeek "trashes" Pinson). I also didn't like seeing the Steve Burg article deleted, as I think being the head of <a href="../../../n/c/s/NCSY_4e8b.html" title="NCSY">NCSY</a> is notable, but I tried and was unable to find any secondary sources about him, unlike in this case. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 20:52, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is daft. The references have to be non-trivial. A trashing en passent is not good enough, and frankly any mere book review is not really ok since it is not discussing him only his book.

<dd>The article in the Forward was by the editor of Zeek, hence the articles are quite related. Unfortunatly, this is a case where a speedly delete might have been kinder and more efficient, so that two weeks later someone could start a normal modest article about the guy. The creators of the original article called him "the greatest modern Jewish philosopher" and compared him to Luria. Not a good way to start a modest article of a minor person. Maybe he does deserve an article but this case seems to be working backwards from COI and megalomaniac Peacock words to establishing even minor notability. Even now, I find it offputing that the article calls Pinson, someone who only gives a few adult ed classes, a "rosh yeshiva." --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">Jayrav</a> 21:07, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is also the article about Pinson in <a href="http://www.spiritualityhealth.com/newsh/items/blank/item_10288.html" class="external text" title="http://www.spiritualityhealth.com/newsh/items/blank/item_10288.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Spirituality &amp; Health</i></a> which is a magazine that likely appeals to a narrower niche but still qualifies as a <i>secondary source that is reliable and independent of the subject</i>. Whatever peacock words the original author of this article used really doesn't matter as that's easy enough to remedy. Anyway, do whatever, I'm getting frustrated and exhausted wasting time and effort when so much of editing at WP seems to center around people's private beefs and personal quarrels with other editors rather than reasonableness (this is not directed at you particularly, just a general sense I'm getting on these afds, which means time for a break for me). --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 21:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
