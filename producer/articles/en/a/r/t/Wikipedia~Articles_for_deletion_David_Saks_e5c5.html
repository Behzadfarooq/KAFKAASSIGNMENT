<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>.</li>
<li>If you take the time to visit Mr.Saks' webpages at DavidSaks.Com, in addition to the letterhead from Graceland on his home page declaring it the first cover, you will see links in the upper right corner of the home page that direct the visitor to a page called "APS Letters". You will find on this page the following&#160;:</li>
<li>1.The Cover of the March 1993 edition of the American Philatelist referring to the editorial written by Mr. Saks which followed the first day event at Graceland.</li>
<li>2.A letter of congratulations from the American Philatelist editor, Bill Welch congratulating Mr. Saks for "snagging number one" and "getting his retirement fund off to good start".</li>
<li>3.A copy of the honorarium check presented to Mr. Saks by the American Philatelic Society for his guest editorial.</li>
<li>Other photos on this page are of Mr.Saks with the first day cover at Graceland and a publicity photo in a U.S.P.S. postal truck.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the page link entitled "FDC Details" you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.A reproduction of the cover including the signatures of Priscilla Presley and other dignitaries who attended the event, including the Mayor of Shelby County, Sam Phillips and the artist who designed the stamp, Mark Stutzman.</li>
<li>2.The reverse of the cover signed by Graceland CEO Jack Soden and other dignitaries.</li>
<li>3.Examples of the cancellation verifying the cancellation date.</li>
<li>4.The reverse side signed by Frank P.Brennan Jr.,General Manager of the Media Relations Division of The United States Postal Service, Bill McAllister, the Philatelic Writer for The Washington Post, and Mark McEwen, anchorman of CBS This Morning.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Graceland Gate Cancellation adorns the reverse in addition to the circular date stamp of Jan 8,1993,including the Graceland zip code,38101 insuring the cancellation date.</p>
<ul>
<li>5.The second letter of authenticity authorized by Graceland manager Debby Johnson and signed by Graceland merchandising manager the late Laura Ferguson.</li>
<li>6.A copy of Mr.Saks' Guest Editorial The American Philatelist March 1993.</li>
<li>7.Mr.Saks Editorial 2nd page.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the "Testimonials" page you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.The article by John Dunn,Editor of Mekeel's Stamp Weekly Proclaiming Mr.Saks' Elvis Presley First Day Cover "One in a Million" February 12,1993, approximatley one month following the event.</li>
<li>2.A link to Mr.Saks' biography.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for sources on the songs and notability, Mr.Saks has met the criterion based on the fact that:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award,i.e.,Official Song of Memphis.</li>
<li>2.Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above., ie, the late Mr.Ruble, as noted on the Fast Mothers site and by the city council resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a collection of works for the piano are made available on Mr.Saks site. The Fast Mothers site discusses the awards presented Mr.Ruble. In the City Council resolution Mr. Ruble is praised along with Mr.Saks for giving the city of Memphis,"A wonderful celebration of itself." Mr.Saks is more than qualified to be represented, and certainly worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. As to other details in the article, you should edit as you find appropriate, regards verification of his education and, among other items, his musicianship. As I am new to the forum (five days), I apologize if my corrections and actions have been misunderstood and out of keeping with protocol. I can only learn as I progress. Please consider allowing Mr.Saks the courtesy of this addition in this excellent forum. I hope that his honor will be upheld in any event.(<a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7EReneec_9c3d.html" title="User:Reneec">Reneec</a> 05:41, 8 February 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Obviously these viewers did not read the "Talk Memphis" page thoroughly.

<dd>We're looking for two things here - verifiability of claims and proof of notability. Information must be verifiable to remain in a wikipedia article.
