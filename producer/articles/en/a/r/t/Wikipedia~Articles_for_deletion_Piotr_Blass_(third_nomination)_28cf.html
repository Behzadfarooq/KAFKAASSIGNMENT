<p>This page has a relatively tortured history on Wikipedia, namely two AfD's and a DRV, as well as other discussions regarding behaviour linked to it.</p>
<p>This is a procedural nomination, stemming from <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">Trialsanderrors</a>' desalting of this article with the concensus of deletion review. This was done so a draft, written by <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> and now located in the articlespace at this article name, could be moved into the articlespace. It gathered a concensus to relist pending possible further notability discussion at this AfD. As this is purely procedural, I <b>abstain</b> presently, not withstanding the fact I may give further opinion if I feel it is merited.</p>

<dd><b>Further note:</b> there was a not-quite-as-strong-as-the-<b>unsalt</b>-concensus-but-still-strong concensus that this probably passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and hence relisting may be moot. Whether it is or not, I felt that there is adequate reasoning to relist, as some pointed out that they purely wanted it "relisted" to get a definitive answer at DRV, and that others were wondering about potential <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> problems in addition to a discussion about notability. I have no opinion on the validity of either view presently, but they <i>should</i> be discussed, and here is a better medium than any other given what this article has been through, and how it has resurfaced (as a rewrite via DRV). If this turns into a <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">snowball</a>-style keep after a couple of days, I would encourage closing this early, given the rewrite is so dramatic. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a></b> 08:03, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I can't access the provided links to the sources, but titles like "<i>7 also-rans in governor's race chase elusive spotlight</i>" and "<i>PBCC president list final at 76</i>" and sources like "<i>Local section, page 3B</i>" always make me suspicious, so I had to rely on my own Lexis-Nexis/Newsbank search. There's quite a few scraps (45 hits total), but if I restrict the search to "Piotr Blass" in headline or first paragraph, I'm down to three. They are:
<ul>
<li>"<i>GOVERNOR WRITE-IN SEES EINSTEIN SOLUTION</i>" ← Full portrait. (Palm Beach Post, The (FL) - August 27, 2006 length: 838 words)</li>
<li>"<i>Saying he wanted to be a voice for the common people, write-in gubernatorial candidate Piotr Blass on Thursday appealed to a Palm Beach County judge to set the stage for him to participate in Monday's debate between his two more well-known opponents.</i> " ← passing mention</li>
<li>"<i>The candidates include Edward J. Foley, principal at South Area High School, a Lake Worth school for potential dropouts; Piotr Blass, a math professor at Palm Beach Atlantic College</i>" ← passing mention</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Blass's career as academic certainly doesn't pass <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. His best-cited contribution gets 8 cites (all by either Blass or Lang), the rest get 4 or less. One article does not <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> pass, a handfull of self-cites does not <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> pass, and the puffery doesn't help either. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 10:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Badlydrawnjeff; article clearly establishes notability and cites a range of sources; result of previous AfDs does not constitute a reason for deletion.

<li>I don't believe anyone said as such (the last AfD applies), because this is a totally new article, hence the DRV decision. If I inadvertently said so in nomination, please allow me to correct it; I'm merely (trying to) apply consensus and common sense on a hot topic (at least, I hope it's <i>common</i>...). Of course, your statement could have been made in advance for anyone who uses the argument, but you never know over the internet&#160;:) Cheers, <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a></b> 13:32, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> His candidacies seem to be the heart of the notability claims. A perennial marginal/write-in candidate for various offices, with the trivial news coverage that such candidates usually get, does not look notable to me. In an open democracy, anyone can declare themselves a candidate. Being taken seriously, or even getting serious coverage, is something else. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 15:07, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Fan1967. The claims to notability are extremely weak. As mentioned, anyone in the street can declare candidacy, and it is a matter of course that these get minor news coverage. As an analogy, we don't have articles for every minor political party that runs in every election, since it is such a trivial matter to get a party registered. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 16:08, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is the third time I am writing this. Blass is not notable as a mathematician. His math papers have low citation, including his pride thesis which has a total of four (on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Scholar_5e38.html" title="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a>). His politics is even less notable, although I am not an expert. The warning is the long-long-long section about his gubernatorial campaign which ended with his getting "eighteen votes". That's about one line per vote. Not notable by any stretch. <a href="../../../m/h/y/User%7EMhym_f8c3.html" title="User:Mhym">Mhym</a> 16:19, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>So, is this saying how many papers cared to list him or how few votes he received? I once wrote-in my boss in mayoral elections.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other such that there exists enough source material to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic. <b>(1)</b> The present article is a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic, which is the purpose of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. <b>(2)</b> Since Blass has been the subject of numerous published works the topic meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. There presently are 28 non-trivial published works footnoted in the article. These three published works were mainly about Blass and by themselves meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>: <b>(a)</b> Vash, Will.

Blass' efforts appear to have been to get an article about himself on Wikipedia with little clue of how to do it. I think the present article will help reduce any behaviour issues. <b>(4)</b> It is not reasonable to expect the article to meet guidelines for which there is not enought non-trivial published works. There are no published works about Blass being a great fisherman or a great footballer; is that a reason to delete the article? Please keep in mind that the topic does not create the article; rather, it is the non-trivial published works that create the article and it is those non-trivial published works which are judge under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 16:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Articles on people need a claim to notability to avoid being speedily deleted per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a>. This article doesn't even make clear what this claim is. Mathematician? Clearly he's nowhere near what our standards for <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">academics</a> are, per above. An "early proponent of the Internet who formulated in 1987 what is believed to be one of the first high-level online math journals"? It seems the sole source for this statement is Blass himself, as conveyed to a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#The_neutral_point_of_view" title="WP:NPOV">sympathetic</a> Palm Beach Post. The vagueness of this comment (which "high-level" journal? Why 1987 when the internet goes back to the 1970's? Who are the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">prominent adherents</a> who confirm Blass's involvement?) puts this almost outside <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and certainly outside <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. A perennial minor candidate for various elections? There is a consensus that minor candidates who haven't established notability for themselves otherwise are at best mentioned in the campaign article per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>. Clearly all articles minus one have the election as their focus and portrait minor candidates in a cluster (<i>"Fringe candidates"</i>) for the sake of comprehensiveness. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:17, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The math journal claim is a bit odd. Certainly <a href="http://www.ulam.usm.edu/" class="external text" title="http://www.ulam.usm.edu/" rel="nofollow">Ulam</a> exists and existed, the earliest reference I can find is this USENET posting from 1993<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.pacs-l/browse_frm/thread/3c9d926870b3f090/964d91f632d8f106?lnk=st&amp;q=ulam+quarterly&amp;rnum=32&amp;hl=en#964d91f632d8f106" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.pacs-l/browse_frm/thread/3c9d926870b3f090/964d91f632d8f106?lnk=st&amp;q=ulam+quarterly&amp;rnum=32&amp;hl=en#964d91f632d8f106" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which doesn't mention Blass. Per my knowledge of such things (yes, I go back to the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bang_path.html" title="Bang path">bang path</a> days), it's entirely possible that it was the first journal in mathematics available strictly online, but I would expect he would turn up in the electronic record somewhere if he were a significant part of bringing it to life. Given other odd claims in the article, I'm not inclined to give this claim the benefit of the doubt. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't so much doubt his involvement than that the founding of the journal was a significant event. ISI Journal Report doesn't have a listing of it, JSTOR and ScienceDirect have one cite each to an Ulam Quarterly paper, Newsbank comes up with nothing. Factiva has two passing mentions in 1994, neither backing the claim that it was "the first" or even "early", and it's certainly not "high-level". The article is still 90% puffery, 10% substance. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 22:51, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Trialsanderrors and Fan-1967. Local publications and passing mentions don't seem to convey substantial enough notability to make it. There are lots of fringe candidates who get mentions in election campaigns, and sometimes whole articles about them in the local papers, but usually on slow news days. The published works, as Trialsanderrors mentions, don't do much to meet WP:PROF, either; to me, this just doesn't quite make it. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 17:14, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Really nothing more than a perpetually failing political candidate. While the litigation he is involved in might be notable, or have produced case law of significant precedential value in Florida, the parties to the litigation itself are not automatically notable themselves. There are thousands of important family law cases when one considers the number of jurisdictions. While there may be articles on those cases, unless the participants in those cases are notable <i>for other reasons</i>, there is no need for an article on the parties. If the case is notable, then there should be an article about the case, but we don't need an article on only <i>one</i> of the parties in the case. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:03, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
