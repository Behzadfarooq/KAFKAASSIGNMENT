<p><b>DELETE</b>: While a good effort at making an inteesting article, two thirds of this article violates the concept of <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">No original research</a>. With the exception of the Starfleet ranks, and a very small portion of the Bajorian insignia, the rest of the info in the article is based on conjectural information which has only been published on unoffical fan sites. The Cardassian, Romulan, and Gorn insignia are therefore pure theory not supported by any references to the actual producers of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> series. It would be possible to do a total revamp of the article, but I feel it would be easier to simply delete the existing one and start over. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 17:34, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I know the TV show doesn't get too much into insignias and such, but are you sure that most of this is speculative? It seems to me that at least one of the many, many, many official and semi-official Trek books out there would cover it. I mean, there are official books covering everything from how to wish your grandma "Happy Birthday" in Klingon ("Quchjaj qoSlIj") to how many moons orbit the sixth planet of the Delta Triciatu system (four). So it seems hard to believe no official source ever laid out what the ranks and insignia are... surely the show's writers at least have style guides to cover such things for the purpose of continuity. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 18:47, May 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Further comment</b> After submitting the above, I had yet another thought: there have been plenty of licensed Star Trek paper RPG materials as well as numerous video games, some of which allow the player to play as various non-Federation races. Surely these materials must cover the ranks and insignia. I am now 98% certain that the article could be preserved with official information if someone looks hard enough. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:05, May 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. WikiProject:Star Trek set up the rule of thumb on this which is canon should take precedence, with fanon and conjecture and non-canon being mentioned as trivia. And the official party line from Paramount is that canon is only material seen on screen in a live-action production. So unless a comparative chart of ranks was visible in an episode or movie, or there was considerable on-screen evidence of ranking (i.e. Starfleet), it's very difficult to put together a chart like this that remains within canon. Even official books like the Encyclopedia aren't considered full canon unless a writer makes use of the information therein. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:59, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Insignias are the frend of the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalek.html" title="Dalek">Dalek</a> and must not be desroed, inacuracies should be fixed, no disagreements here. I have no direct access to such official sources, veify my data I am cool with that. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcat_e5e1.html" title="User:Coolcat">Cool Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECoolcat_c966.html" title="User talk:Coolcat"><sup>My Talk</sup></a> 18:53, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Furter comment: I think we should use games such as Starfleet Command 3 as primary source. That has Romulan, Klingon, Federation, and even Borg ranks. I am not sure which ranks if any appeared at the armadas. Ill look into this right now. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcat_e5e1.html" title="User:Coolcat">Cool Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECoolcat_c966.html" title="User talk:Coolcat"><sup>My Talk</sup></a> 23:07, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike><b>Keep</b> - I really dislike the fan-made up stuff being here, and would much prefer the article be completely redone to stick with KNOWN information, not made-up info cause someone enjoys photoshop. That said, i'm voting the topic, not the article, and it should absolutely be rewritten, not destroyed. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> 18:56, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</strike>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <i>rewrite</i> from scratch to remove non-canon material and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">fanon</a>, which pretty much means all the <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorn.html" title="Gorn">Gorn</a> info, to begin with. This chart also looks very familiar ... sure it's not a copyvio of the Star Trek Encyclopedia? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:54, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wikibooks assuming this isn't fanon or copyvio (pretty sure about the former, not sure about the latter). <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> 20:10, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Subject to verification, I vote <b>delete</b> as non-notable trivia, tangentially related to a major fictional body of work, and apparently a mix of non-canon fanfic and possibly some copyvio. I believe we should let the WikiProject:Star Trek editors maintain notable material where it belongs and remove unencyclopedic cruft from WP's article namespace. Per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, this topic doesn't appear to be major or significant, so even if it were verifiable to be canon, it wouldn't merit an article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:37, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>, while I don't exactly question the notability of the information, I do question whether it deserves its own article. Frankly an article with just a table of the ranks doesn't do anything for me and I don't really see how any expansion will fix this. Personally I think the information should be split to the articles about whatever Race/Organization. Meaning the information about ranks for Klingons should probably be at <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon.html" title="Klingon">Klingon</a>. The information on StarFleet is <b>duplicated</b> anyway at <b><a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranks_and_Insignia_of_Starfleet_da7b.html" title="Ranks and Insignia of Starfleet">Ranks and Insignia of Starfleet</a></b>, which is a much more comprehensive article. Theres no need for an article to make comparisons between races etc. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 21:54, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Nothing wrong with documenting fan speculation about ranks. Although it may upset trek purists, any rank that has been reasonably widely discussed is encyclopedic enough for us if properly documented. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:05, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> cleanup and expand, concur with Starblind. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 02:03, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - As I have mentioned on the article's <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7EComparative_Ranks_and_Insignia_of_Star_Trek_17f0.html" title="Talk:Comparative Ranks and Insignia of Star Trek">talk page</a>, some of the ranks have been mentioned or can be referenced from canon sources like <i>The Klingon Dictionary</i>. I don't think the article should be deleted, as it does serve a purpose, but I definitely agree that it should be cleaned up and more references should be provided. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_Babcock_85fc.html" title="User:Ben Babcock">Ben Babcock</a> 03:40, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
