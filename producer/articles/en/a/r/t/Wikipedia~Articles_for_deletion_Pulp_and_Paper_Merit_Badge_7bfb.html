<dd><b>Response</b>. This is where I totally agree. What would be everyone's preference for documenting this type of information, namely: image, history, topic covered, relationship to society and culture, statistics, etc.? I am completely open to this type of discussion. A suggestion (below) is to merge with Merit Badges, but that would make a REALLY big article, perhaps unwieldly. Maybe it makes sense to group them in some other way. Ideas? <a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 22:37, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Older Boy Scout Handbooks are perfectly good resources for identifying old badge designs. There are also various lists out there as to when badges were added, revised, or had their names changed. While such things may be interesting, especially for the Eagle-required badges, I don't think that either bits of data are alone sufficient to make a given article notable. That the rest of the article is POV rambling, listing of badge requirements, and a list of weblinks doesn't help. My vote does not change. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThesquire_8265.html" title="User talk:Thesquire">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesquire_ea24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesquire">contribs</a>)</small> 22:08, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I also think that we should consider merging data into the main <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merit_badge_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29_8c64.html" title="Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)">Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)</a> article. Granted, the table is hardly sufficient at this point, but take a look at some of the fleshed out lists at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_lists_c1de.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured lists">Wikipedia:Featured lists</a>. This article will inevitably remain short, and I'm not a big fan of seeing hundreds of individual and short merit badge articles. I think that we should merge some of the information there, and drop some of the more trivial facts such as the paragraphs dealing with individual topics. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 22:15, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Speedy</s> Strong Keep</b> <a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 15:54, 9 February 2006 (UTC) The original AfD was posted in the middle of developing the site, when I had simply started creating a skeleton for a much more meaningful article. As I have continued work, I have incorporated the few positive suggestions listed above. The current page still needs some work (like many an article) but is dramatically different than the article at the time the AfD was posted. Here are some specific responses to the concerns listed above:
<ul>
<li>How-to guide to getting to the badge. This is inaccurate. There is nothing on the site that tells a Scout how to earn the badge, except for a link to the requirements, which are common knowledge. The site (in current form) is a description of the merit badge and what its goals and purposes are. It is clearly information about the merit badge itself.</li>
<li>List of links - Many articles start by cataloging what is already known. I was in the process of developing the site and had collected a list of related articles and links. Due to some positive comments, the direction of the article was changed to comply with Wikipedia policy, and the links are now used in a more appropriate fashion.</li>
<li>Go and buy the book - Seems counterintuitive that anybody would want to take information off Wikipedia because some of it is already available in a book somewhere.</li>
<li>Eventually, one would expect that other information about the merit badge itself - history, changes, impact, etc. would appear on this page. This will be of interest to many users, especially those that are involved in collecting patches, etc.</li>

<dd>Before I knew the proper protocol for resolving AfD requests, I removed the AfD tags on the article. They have been restored thanks to a kind note from <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJergen_cec0.html" title="User:Jergen">jergen</a> and I am hopeful that the current article is more consistent with what Scouters would expect to see. <s>By the way, as a newcomer, I was expecting a little more civility and cooperation than I received from the deletionists above.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think it does/did meet Speedy Keep because the inital AfD was based on an unfinished article (clearly a misunderstanding). Notice that some people have changed their positions now that they have seen the whole article.</dd>
<dd>Point well taken on the temper. Not everyone is a conspiratory deletionist, just a couple, at most. I have calmed down considerably since yesterday. I was referring to some of the insensitive and and inflammatory (to me) remarks (for example, "After all, how much is there to say about the merit badge? Information about pulp and paper already exists in various articles. Lists of requirements don't belong on Wikipedia. Merit badge pamphlets don't belong on Wikipedia.") that were meant to torpedo the page right off the bat without any regard given to an attempt to improve or fix it. I think those are squarely the types of things that are referred to in the "don't bite" article. I understand the need for people to patrol against random or wacky new stuff, but it seems necessary for the established users to welcome and guide newcomers rather than just jump on an unfinished page and suggest deleting it. Now we've got that cleared up, I am pleased at the level of debate on what this page should look like if it is to stay a part of Wikipedia. I am still thinking about wikibooks, but haven't even figured wikipedia out yet. I think we are now to the point where we can disagree about whether there is enough value in a particular topic to keep it on Wikipedia, but those are the types of disagreements where we can "agree to disagree." <a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 22:37, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think these mb articles should provide a history of the badge itself, give a general overview of the topic, and provide wiki and web resources the Scouts could use to earn the MB.
